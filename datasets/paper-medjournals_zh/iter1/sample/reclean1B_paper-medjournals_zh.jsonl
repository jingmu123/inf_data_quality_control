The data are very helpful in the counseling of RCP couples who wish to pursue PGT-A in order to conceive babies using their own gametes.\nThe RCP couples recruited in this study should meet the following criterions: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the RCP couple was the first time to experience PGT in the IVF center; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> only the first PGT cycle data were collected; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> all embryos were frozen–thawed transferred (FET); and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the couple in the PGT cycle produced at least one blastocyst for biopsy. The couples started PGT cycles between March 2014 and March 2017, and the clinical outcome data were collected till October 2017 for most of the couples might have a clinical result. This study was approved by the Faculty of Ethics Committee of Shanghai JIAI Genetics and IVF institute, Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, China. The ethical approval number is JIAI E2017-23.\nStandard techniques were used in IVF. Briefly, fertilized oocytes were produced using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and then were cultured postfertilization for 5–6 days in IVF laboratory to reach the blastocyst stage. Blastocysts were evaluated according to a grading system used widely recommended by Gardner et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> and 3–10 trophectoderm cells were biopsied and immediately transported to PGD laboratory of the same center for whole-genome amplification (WGA) and aSNP analysis. The day of trophectoderm biopsy was depended entirely on blastocyst development and was specifically recorded as day 5 or day 6. Blastocysts were cryopreserved immediately after biopsy procedure was finished.\nWGA was performed using the REPLI-g Single Cell Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s recommendations. aSNP analysis was performed according to the Infinium Chip procedure (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, the WGA product was amplified in an overnight isothermal reaction and then fragmented to a size of approximately 300–500 base pairs. After isopropanol precipitation and resuspension, the samples were hybridized to an Infinium Beadchip overnight for about 20 h. An automated Extension Staining (XStain) process was then performed. After staining, the Beadchips were read on an iScan reader. Genotype calls were made automatically by Illumina BlueFuse® software, generating reports of the results.\nAll the aSNP data were analyzed and reported by two independent genetic technicians and then verified by senior genetic director in our laboratory. Embryos without any seen unbalance were described as euploidy (products resulted from alternate segregation). We categorized the abnormal embryos into five types: segmental aneuploidy (products resulted from adjacent-1 or adjacent-2 segregation which were commonly happened in quadrivalent segregation or randomly happened in duplication or deletion of one part of the arms of chromosomes), whole-chromosome aneuploidy (products mainly resulted from 3:1 or 4:0 segregation of the quadrivalent or randomly happened in meiosis I/II error), segmental plus whole-chromosome aneuploidy (both quadrivalent and meiosis error happened), mosaic only (mosaicism with only one or two chromosomes was found), and UPD (1-22, X)*2(comprehensive chromosome uniparental diploidy; and one or two chromosome uniparental isodisomy was not recorded).\nThe serum level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was measured 14 days after transfer, and a serial ultrasound was performed 5, 7, and 9 weeks after transfer. The clinical pregnancy was confirmed if an intrauterine gestational sac with fetal heart beat was visualized. Monochorionic–diamniotic (MCDA) twins or dichorionic–diamniotic (DCDA) twins were considered as one pregnancy cycle. Biochemical pregnancy number was recorded if the hCG level was positive, but no gestational sac was seen. Miscarriage was recorded if the fetal heart beat was no longer seen at the time of 7 or 9 weeks after transfer. The pregnancy status would be followed up once in the second trimester, and prenatal diagnosis would be done during this period. live birth number would be recorded when the babies were born.\nData were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or as percentages. The detailed algorithm of every clinical outcome was listed as follows: embryo implantation rate = gestational sacs with heart beat number/transfer embryo number; the biochemical pregnancy rate/embryo transfer (ET) = biochemical pregnancy number/frozen–thawed transfer cycles (FET); the clinical pregnancy rate/ET or initiated = clinical pregnancy number/FET or oocyte retrieval cycles; the ongoing pregnancy rate/ET or initiated = ongoing pregnancy number/FET or oocyte retrieval cycles; the live birth rate/ET or initiated = live birth number/FET cycles or oocyte retrieval cycles; the cumulative pregnancy rate or ongoing pregnancy rate or live birth rate = clinical pregnancy number or ongoing pregnancy number or live birth number/enrolled couple number; the cancellation rate = no ET cycles/oocyte retrieval cycles; and the miscarriage rate = miscarriage number/clinical pregnancy number. All statistical procedures were conducted with SPSS version 17.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Data were analyzed according to the gender of the carriers. Independent sample t-test and crosstab with Chi-squared distribution were performed, and P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Binary logistic regression was fitted for the relationship between gender of RCP carriers and the type of embryos (euploidy, abnormal, and failed). Potential confounders included gender of RCP carriers (female or male), the biopsied day (day 5 or day 6), and maternal age of the RCP couple (<38 years old or ≥38 years old). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI s) were calculated to assess the association. All the potential confounders were retained in the fitted adjusted models regardless of the significance based on literatures.\nFrom April 2014 to March 2017, a total of 238 couples met our criterions and the clinical data of these couples were collected and analyzed. Among these couples, 124 were female carriers and 114 were male carriers. The average female age (31.69 ± 4.10 vs. 31.52 ± 4.18; P = 0.743) and male age (33.65 ± 5.30 vs. 33.59 ± 6.53; P = 0.932) were not different. The miscarriage times of the couple before underwent PGT cycles ranged 0- 7, and the average miscarriage times were not different (1.47 ± 1.45 vs. 1.18 ± 1.37; P = 0.112).

Eighty female carrier couples underwent 95 FETs, and 75 male carrier couples underwent 93 FETs. The mean embryo number per ET was 1.04 (99/95) and 1.13 (105/93) in female and male carriers, respectively. We waited until all the outcomes of the FET cycles were collected in October 2017. Eight female RCP and nine male RCP ET cycles only observed hCG positive but no gestational sacs, resulting biochemical pregnancy rate/ET to 8.40% vs. 9.70% (P = 0.764). There was one ectopic pregnancy in each group. Fourty-five intrauterine gestational sacs with heart beat were observed in female carrier group and 52 were observed in male group (among these one MCDA in female group, one MCDA and four DCDAs in male group), henceforth the embryo implantation rate was 47.50% vs. 48.60% (P = 0.875), the clinical pregnancy rate/ET was 49.50% vs. 50.50% (P = 0.884), and clinical pregnancy rate/initiated cycle was 37.90% vs. 41.20% (P= 0.6), respectively.

ET: Embryo transfer.\nThis study aimed to analyze the clinical outcome of the first PGT cycles differed by the gender of the RCP carrier. Our data showed that the clinical outcomes such as embryo implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, and live birth rate were higher in male RCP carrier group, but without significance. The miscarriage rate was lower in male RCP carrier group, but was not significantly different from female carrier group. Although the differences between the female and male carriers are not reached to the level of statistical significance, almost all clinical outcomes of PGT in the male group show better than those in the female group. The average live birth rate per initiated till data collection was 28.60%, which was similar to those reported earlier.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> The average miscarriage rate documented in the literatures ranged 0–33% after PGT,通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16,17]</u> and our results showed 10.60%, which was within the range and similar as the miscarriage level in general population. It is known that more than 50% of early pregnancy loss is resulted from aneuploidy; however, when the times of pregnancy loss increases, the euploidy rate of the conceptus increases, which suggests that other factors such as aberrant maternal-fetal immune tolerance exist and cause unexplained early pregnancy loss.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The women of the RCP couples might experience several times of pregnancy loss, whose uterine receptivity and maternal-fetal immune tolerance could be impaired, leading to higher miscarriage rate although the conceptus is euploidy.\nIt is well known that RCP will impair men’s fecundity by decreasing the sperm quantity and quality.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Our results showed that sperm live rate, forward motile sperm rate, and normal morphology rate were significantly decreased in male RCP carrier group compared with the counterparts in female RCP group, which was consistent with previous reports. It is assumed that the quality of sperm would impact embryo development, and the low-quality sperm might cause low fertilization rate,通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> slow growth rate, high embryo aneuploidy rate,通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u> and poor implantation rate during transfer procedure.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Our results showed that the fertilization rate, cleavage rate, blastocyst formation rate, and euploidy embryo rate were not significantly different between the two groups; however, the day-3 cleaving embryo rate was significantly higher in male RCP group. This result indicated the major role of oocyte quality in regulating embryo growth. Although the sperms were impaired, the oocytes of the spouses of male carriers might be in a healthy state and eventually the fertilized eggs were developing in a regular pattern. However, the developmental ability of oocytes from female RCP carriers could be decreased, which might cause the slow growth rate in this group. Our results also showed that the blastocyst formation rate and the mean number of normal, abnormal, and mosaic embryos were not significantly different within the two gender carrier groups. The euploidy rate of embryos was significantly higher in day-5 embryos, indicating that the growth rate of embryo was a critical impactor of chromosome constitution in embryos of RCP carriers. Other studies showed that the growing rate of embryos was strongly predictive of euploidy rate通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> and clinical outcome.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Our data confirmed that the growth rate of embryo was critical for evaluating euploidy rate of embryos of RCP carrier, while the gender effect was trivial. Although sperm quality was decreased in male RCP carriers, the growing rate of embryos was not affected, suggesting the principal role of oocytes in embryo development.\nWe specifically analyzed the constitution of all the abnormal embryos produced in this study and categorized the abnormal embryos into five types, which was described in material and methods. The results showed that the largest proportion was segmental aneuploidy, which reached 67.48%. The secondly share was whole-chromosome aneuploidy and then the third place was segmental plus whole-chromosome aneuploidy, which was also related with segregation error of quadrivalent. These data suggested that the quadrivalent segregation pattern overwhelmed the effect of older age in RCP carriers; however, the aneuploidies were not to be negligible in RCP carriers. Compared with older age (female age ≥38 years), younger age (female age <38 years) was associated with the increased rate of euploidy embryos at a borderline significance. Other study also showed 55- 65% embryos with additional aneuploidies with or without translocation-related imbalances in RCP carriers.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> The high risk of recurrent miscarriage and live birth defects due to segmental or whole-chromosome aneuploidy made PGT is a reasonable choice for RCP couples. Compared with other platforms, aSNP is the only platform that distinguishes not only the segmental and whole-chromosome aneuploidy but also the polyploidy and UPD at the preimplantation stage,通用删除6(英):<u>[10,26]</u> resulting in the greatest decrease in miscarriage rate for couples suffered from RPL. The incidence of polyploidy and UPD detected by aSNP in miscarriage specimens could exceed 10%.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> As noted earlier, these can only be detected by aSNP. Our results showed that 0.76% whole-genome UPD was detected in abnormal embryos, which could result in a molar pregnancy if transferred. No polyploidy embryo has been reported in this study which is interesting and need further investigation for ICSI might reduce diandric fertilization but could not avoid the occurrence of polyploidy, and others have reported detection of polyploidy occurred at 4.17%。in embryos.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Therefore, aSNP might be a reasonable choice for patients such as RCP carriers pursuing PGT.\nAs concerned by RCP carriers and physicians, the high abnormal embryo rate caused cancellation cycles in IVF treatment, which was a disturbance for both sides. In our data, the cancellation rate of female and male carriers was 33.90% and 28.90%, respectively. Cancellation cycles are reported to occur in 19%–50% of cases.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,28,29]</u> The fact that a great number of the RCP couples might have no chance to transfer a euploidy embryo in PGT cycles makes genetic counseling difficult for these couples. The minimum number of blastocysts was estimated to be 2–4 to obtain at least one normal/balanced embryo for RCP carriers,通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> and this should also be discussed with RCP carriers. On the contrary, RCP couples underwent conventional IVF cycles without PGT could experience adverse pregnancy outcomes. A recently published study with a small size of RCP couples (n = 41) underwent conventional IVF procedure without PGT showed that by increasing embryos number transferred per cycle (2.6 ± 0.5), the clinical pregnancy rate (46.3%) and live birth rate (36.6%) per transfer were acceptable, but the miscarriage rate (21.1%) was higher compared with that of age-matched couples without RCP.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> Other studies discovered that without PGT, the miscarriage rate of RCP couples might be higher than 50% and the karyotype of miscarriage was abnormal in 90% of cases.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Benefits and drawbacks of PGT for RCP couples should be discussed thoroughly before pursuing PGT.\nIn conclusion, we conclude that though gender influence is not significant, the clinical outcomes of couples with male RCP carriers show better in the first PGT cycles. Although sperm quality is decreased in male RCP carriers, the developing potential of embryo is not affected in this group, and the growing rate of embryo is a great prediction estimating euploidy rate in RCP carriers. Quadrivalent segregation pattern overwhelms the effect of older age in RCP carriers; however, the maternal age effect could not be neglected.\n删除7：<u>The authors thank Harvey J.

The fourth session of the committee of Chinese Society of Reproductive Medicine has published a guideline for NGS-based PGD/PGS and suggested that women aged <38 years should be considered as advanced age and suitable for PGT-A.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>\nIn this study, our goal is to analyze the clinical outcome of the RCP couples and the influence of carrier gender, maternal age, and embryo growth rate on euploidy. The data are very helpful in the counseling of RCP couples who wish to pursue PGT-A in order to conceive babies using their own gametes.\nThe RCP couples recruited in this study should meet the following criterions: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the RCP couple was the first time to experience PGT in the IVF center; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> only the first PGT cycle data were collected; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> all embryos were frozen–thawed transferred (FET); and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the couple in the PGT cycle produced at least one blastocyst for biopsy. The couples started PGT cycles between March 2014 and March 2017, and the clinical outcome data were collected till October 2017 for most of the couples might have a clinical result. This study was approved by the Faculty of Ethics Committee of Shanghai JIAI Genetics and IVF institute, Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, China. The ethical approval number is JIAI E2017-23.\nStandard techniques were used in IVF. Briefly, fertilized oocytes were produced using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and then were cultured postfertilization for 5–6 days in IVF laboratory to reach the blastocyst stage. Blastocysts were evaluated according to a grading system used widely recommended by Gardner et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> and 3–10 trophectoderm cells were biopsied and immediately transported to PGD laboratory of the same center for whole-genome amplification (WGA) and aSNP analysis. The day of trophectoderm biopsy was depended entirely on blastocyst development and was specifically recorded as day 5 or day 6. Blastocysts were cryopreserved immediately after biopsy procedure was finished.\nWGA was performed using the REPLI-g Single Cell Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s recommendations. aSNP analysis was performed according to the Infinium Chip procedure (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, the WGA product was amplified in an overnight isothermal reaction and then fragmented to a size of approximately 300–500 base pairs. After isopropanol precipitation and resuspension, the samples were hybridized to an Infinium Beadchip overnight for about 20 h. An automated Extension Staining (XStain) process was then performed. After staining, the Beadchips were read on an iScan reader. Genotype calls were made automatically by Illumina BlueFuse® software, generating reports of the results.\nAll the aSNP data were analyzed and reported by two independent genetic technicians and then verified by senior genetic director in our laboratory. Embryos without any seen unbalance were described as euploidy (products resulted from alternate segregation). We categorized the abnormal embryos into five types: segmental aneuploidy (products resulted from adjacent-1 or adjacent-2 segregation which were commonly happened in quadrivalent segregation or randomly happened in duplication or deletion of one part of the arms of chromosomes), whole-chromosome aneuploidy (products mainly resulted from 3:1 or 4:0 segregation of the quadrivalent or randomly happened in meiosis I/II error), segmental plus whole-chromosome aneuploidy (both quadrivalent and meiosis error happened), mosaic only (mosaicism with only one or two chromosomes was found), and UPD (1-22, X)*2(comprehensive chromosome uniparental diploidy; and one or two chromosome uniparental isodisomy was not recorded).\nThe serum level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was measured 14 days after transfer, and a serial ultrasound was performed 5, 7, and 9 weeks after transfer. The clinical pregnancy was confirmed if an intrauterine gestational sac with fetal heart beat was visualized. Monochorionic–diamniotic (MCDA) twins or dichorionic–diamniotic (DCDA) twins were considered as one pregnancy cycle. Biochemical pregnancy number was recorded if the hCG level was positive, but no gestational sac was seen. Miscarriage was recorded if the fetal heart beat was no longer seen at the time of 7 or 9 weeks after transfer. The pregnancy status would be followed up once in the second trimester, and prenatal diagnosis would be done during this period. live birth number would be recorded when the babies were born.\nData were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or as percentages. The detailed algorithm of every clinical outcome was listed as follows: embryo implantation rate = gestational sacs with heart beat number/transfer embryo number; the biochemical pregnancy rate/embryo transfer (ET) = biochemical pregnancy number/frozen–thawed transfer cycles (FET); the clinical pregnancy rate/ET or initiated = clinical pregnancy number/FET or oocyte retrieval cycles; the ongoing pregnancy rate/ET or initiated = ongoing pregnancy number/FET or oocyte retrieval cycles; the live birth rate/ET or initiated = live birth number/FET cycles or oocyte retrieval cycles; the cumulative pregnancy rate or ongoing pregnancy rate or live birth rate = clinical pregnancy number or ongoing pregnancy number or live birth number/enrolled couple number; the cancellation rate = no ET cycles/oocyte retrieval cycles; and the miscarriage rate = miscarriage number/clinical pregnancy number. All statistical procedures were conducted with SPSS version 17.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Data were analyzed according to the gender of the carriers. Independent sample t-test and crosstab with Chi-squared distribution were performed, and P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Binary logistic regression was fitted for the relationship between gender of RCP carriers and the type of embryos (euploidy, abnormal, and failed). Potential confounders included gender of RCP carriers (female or male), the biopsied day (day 5 or day 6), and maternal age of the RCP couple (<38 years old or ≥38 years old). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI s) were calculated to assess the association. All the potential confounders were retained in the fitted adjusted models regardless of the significance based on literatures.\nFrom April 2014 to March 2017, a total of 238 couples met our criterions and the clinical data of these couples were collected and analyzed. Among these couples, 124 were female carriers and 114 were male carriers. The average female age (31.69 ± 4.10 vs. 31.52 ± 4.18; P = 0.743) and male age (33.65 ± 5.30 vs. 33.59 ± 6.53; P = 0.932) were not different. The miscarriage times of the couple before underwent PGT cycles ranged 0- 7, and the average miscarriage times were not different (1.47 ± 1.45 vs. 1.18 ± 1.37; P = 0.112).

Eighty female carrier couples underwent 95 FETs, and 75 male carrier couples underwent 93 FETs. The mean embryo number per ET was 1.04 (99/95) and 1.13 (105/93) in female and male carriers, respectively. We waited until all the outcomes of the FET cycles were collected in October 2017. Eight female RCP and nine male RCP ET cycles only observed hCG positive but no gestational sacs, resulting biochemical pregnancy rate/ET to 8.40% vs. 9.70% (P = 0.764). There was one ectopic pregnancy in each group. Fourty-five intrauterine gestational sacs with heart beat were observed in female carrier group and 52 were observed in male group (among these one MCDA in female group, one MCDA and four DCDAs in male group), henceforth the embryo implantation rate was 47.50% vs. 48.60% (P = 0.875), the clinical pregnancy rate/ET was 49.50% vs. 50.50% (P = 0.884), and clinical pregnancy rate/initiated cycle was 37.90% vs. 41.20% (P= 0.6), respectively.

ET: Embryo transfer.\nThis study aimed to analyze the clinical outcome of the first PGT cycles differed by the gender of the RCP carrier. Our data showed that the clinical outcomes such as embryo implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, and live birth rate were higher in male RCP carrier group, but without significance. The miscarriage rate was lower in male RCP carrier group, but was not significantly different from female carrier group. Although the differences between the female and male carriers are not reached to the level of statistical significance, almost all clinical outcomes of PGT in the male group show better than those in the female group. The average live birth rate per initiated till data collection was 28.60%, which was similar to those reported earlier.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> The average miscarriage rate documented in the literatures ranged 0–33% after PGT,通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16,17]</u> and our results showed 10.60%, which was within the range and similar as the miscarriage level in general population. It is known that more than 50% of early pregnancy loss is resulted from aneuploidy; however, when the times of pregnancy loss increases, the euploidy rate of the conceptus increases, which suggests that other factors such as aberrant maternal-fetal immune tolerance exist and cause unexplained early pregnancy loss.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The women of the RCP couples might experience several times of pregnancy loss, whose uterine receptivity and maternal-fetal immune tolerance could be impaired, leading to higher miscarriage rate although the conceptus is euploidy.\nIt is well known that RCP will impair men’s fecundity by decreasing the sperm quantity and quality.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Our results showed that sperm live rate, forward motile sperm rate, and normal morphology rate were significantly decreased in male RCP carrier group compared with the counterparts in female RCP group, which was consistent with previous reports. It is assumed that the quality of sperm would impact embryo development, and the low-quality sperm might cause low fertilization rate,通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> slow growth rate, high embryo aneuploidy rate,通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u> and poor implantation rate during transfer procedure.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Our results showed that the fertilization rate, cleavage rate, blastocyst formation rate, and euploidy embryo rate were not significantly different between the two groups; however, the day-3 cleaving embryo rate was significantly higher in male RCP group. This result indicated the major role of oocyte quality in regulating embryo growth. Although the sperms were impaired, the oocytes of the spouses of male carriers might be in a healthy state and eventually the fertilized eggs were developing in a regular pattern. However, the developmental ability of oocytes from female RCP carriers could be decreased, which might cause the slow growth rate in this group. Our results also showed that the blastocyst formation rate and the mean number of normal, abnormal, and mosaic embryos were not significantly different within the two gender carrier groups. The euploidy rate of embryos was significantly higher in day-5 embryos, indicating that the growth rate of embryo was a critical impactor of chromosome constitution in embryos of RCP carriers. Other studies showed that the growing rate of embryos was strongly predictive of euploidy rate通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> and clinical outcome.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Our data confirmed that the growth rate of embryo was critical for evaluating euploidy rate of embryos of RCP carrier, while the gender effect was trivial. Although sperm quality was decreased in male RCP carriers, the growing rate of embryos was not affected, suggesting the principal role of oocytes in embryo development.\nWe specifically analyzed the constitution of all the abnormal embryos produced in this study and categorized the abnormal embryos into five types, which was described in material and methods. The results showed that the largest proportion was segmental aneuploidy, which reached 67.48%. The secondly share was whole-chromosome aneuploidy and then the third place was segmental plus whole-chromosome aneuploidy, which was also related with segregation error of quadrivalent. These data suggested that the quadrivalent segregation pattern overwhelmed the effect of older age in RCP carriers; however, the aneuploidies were not to be negligible in RCP carriers. Compared with older age (female age ≥38 years), younger age (female age <38 years) was associated with the increased rate of euploidy embryos at a borderline significance. Other study also showed 55- 65% embryos with additional aneuploidies with or without translocation-related imbalances in RCP carriers.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> The high risk of recurrent miscarriage and live birth defects due to segmental or whole-chromosome aneuploidy made PGT is a reasonable choice for RCP couples. Compared with other platforms, aSNP is the only platform that distinguishes not only the segmental and whole-chromosome aneuploidy but also the polyploidy and UPD at the preimplantation stage,通用删除6(英):<u>[10,26]</u> resulting in the greatest decrease in miscarriage rate for couples suffered from RPL. The incidence of polyploidy and UPD detected by aSNP in miscarriage specimens could exceed 10%.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> As noted earlier, these can only be detected by aSNP. Our results showed that 0.76% whole-genome UPD was detected in abnormal embryos, which could result in a molar pregnancy if transferred. No polyploidy embryo has been reported in this study which is interesting and need further investigation for ICSI might reduce diandric fertilization but could not avoid the occurrence of polyploidy, and others have reported detection of polyploidy occurred at 4.17%。in embryos.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Therefore, aSNP might be a reasonable choice for patients such as RCP carriers pursuing PGT.\nAs concerned by RCP carriers and physicians, the high abnormal embryo rate caused cancellation cycles in IVF treatment, which was a disturbance for both sides. In our data, the cancellation rate of female and male carriers was 33.90% and 28.90%, respectively. Cancellation cycles are reported to occur in 19%–50% of cases.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,28,29]</u> The fact that a great number of the RCP couples might have no chance to transfer a euploidy embryo in PGT cycles makes genetic counseling difficult for these couples. The minimum number of blastocysts was estimated to be 2–4 to obtain at least one normal/balanced embryo for RCP carriers,通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> and this should also be discussed with RCP carriers. On the contrary, RCP couples underwent conventional IVF cycles without PGT could experience adverse pregnancy outcomes. A recently published study with a small size of RCP couples (n = 41) underwent conventional IVF procedure without PGT showed that by increasing embryos number transferred per cycle (2.6 ± 0.5), the clinical pregnancy rate (46.3%) and live birth rate (36.6%) per transfer were acceptable, but the miscarriage rate (21.1%) was higher compared with that of age-matched couples without RCP.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> Other studies discovered that without PGT, the miscarriage rate of RCP couples might be higher than 50% and the karyotype of miscarriage was abnormal in 90% of cases.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Benefits and drawbacks of PGT for RCP couples should be discussed thoroughly before pursuing PGT.\nIn conclusion, we conclude that though gender influence is not significant, the clinical outcomes of couples with male RCP carriers show better in the first PGT cycles. Although sperm quality is decreased in male RCP carriers, the developing potential of embryo is not affected in this group, and the growing rate of embryo is a great prediction estimating euploidy rate in RCP carriers. Quadrivalent segregation pattern overwhelms the effect of older age in RCP carriers; however, the maternal age effect could not be neglected.\n删除7：<u>The authors thank Harvey J.

The data are very helpful in the counseling of RCP couples who wish to pursue PGT-A in order to conceive babies using their own gametes.\nThe RCP couples recruited in this study should meet the following criterions: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the RCP couple was the first time to experience PGT in the IVF center; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> only the first PGT cycle data were collected; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> all embryos were frozen–thawed transferred (FET); and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the couple in the PGT cycle produced at least one blastocyst for biopsy. The couples started PGT cycles between March 2014 and March 2017, and the clinical outcome data were collected till October 2017 for most of the couples might have a clinical result. This study was approved by the Faculty of Ethics Committee of Shanghai JIAI Genetics and IVF institute, Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, China. The ethical approval number is JIAI E2017-23.\nStandard techniques were used in IVF. Briefly, fertilized oocytes were produced using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and then were cultured postfertilization for 5–6 days in IVF laboratory to reach the blastocyst stage. Blastocysts were evaluated according to a grading system used widely recommended by Gardner et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> and 3–10 trophectoderm cells were biopsied and immediately transported to PGD laboratory of the same center for whole-genome amplification (WGA) and aSNP analysis. The day of trophectoderm biopsy was depended entirely on blastocyst development and was specifically recorded as day 5 or day 6. Blastocysts were cryopreserved immediately after biopsy procedure was finished.\nWGA was performed using the REPLI-g Single Cell Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s recommendations. aSNP analysis was performed according to the Infinium Chip procedure (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, the WGA product was amplified in an overnight isothermal reaction and then fragmented to a size of approximately 300–500 base pairs. After isopropanol precipitation and resuspension, the samples were hybridized to an Infinium Beadchip overnight for about 20 h. An automated Extension Staining (XStain) process was then performed. After staining, the Beadchips were read on an iScan reader. Genotype calls were made automatically by Illumina BlueFuse® software, generating reports of the results.\nAll the aSNP data were analyzed and reported by two independent genetic technicians and then verified by senior genetic director in our laboratory. Embryos without any seen unbalance were described as euploidy (products resulted from alternate segregation). We categorized the abnormal embryos into five types: segmental aneuploidy (products resulted from adjacent-1 or adjacent-2 segregation which were commonly happened in quadrivalent segregation or randomly happened in duplication or deletion of one part of the arms of chromosomes), whole-chromosome aneuploidy (products mainly resulted from 3:1 or 4:0 segregation of the quadrivalent or randomly happened in meiosis I/II error), segmental plus whole-chromosome aneuploidy (both quadrivalent and meiosis error happened), mosaic only (mosaicism with only one or two chromosomes was found), and UPD (1-22, X)*2(comprehensive chromosome uniparental diploidy; and one or two chromosome uniparental isodisomy was not recorded).\nThe serum level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was measured 14 days after transfer, and a serial ultrasound was performed 5, 7, and 9 weeks after transfer. The clinical pregnancy was confirmed if an intrauterine gestational sac with fetal heart beat was visualized. Monochorionic–diamniotic (MCDA) twins or dichorionic–diamniotic (DCDA) twins were considered as one pregnancy cycle. Biochemical pregnancy number was recorded if the hCG level was positive, but no gestational sac was seen. Miscarriage was recorded if the fetal heart beat was no longer seen at the time of 7 or 9 weeks after transfer. The pregnancy status would be followed up once in the second trimester, and prenatal diagnosis would be done during this period. live birth number would be recorded when the babies were born.\nData were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or as percentages. The detailed algorithm of every clinical outcome was listed as follows: embryo implantation rate = gestational sacs with heart beat number/transfer embryo number; the biochemical pregnancy rate/embryo transfer (ET) = biochemical pregnancy number/frozen–thawed transfer cycles (FET); the clinical pregnancy rate/ET or initiated = clinical pregnancy number/FET or oocyte retrieval cycles; the ongoing pregnancy rate/ET or initiated = ongoing pregnancy number/FET or oocyte retrieval cycles; the live birth rate/ET or initiated = live birth number/FET cycles or oocyte retrieval cycles; the cumulative pregnancy rate or ongoing pregnancy rate or live birth rate = clinical pregnancy number or ongoing pregnancy number or live birth number/enrolled couple number; the cancellation rate = no ET cycles/oocyte retrieval cycles; and the miscarriage rate = miscarriage number/clinical pregnancy number. All statistical procedures were conducted with SPSS version 17.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Data were analyzed according to the gender of the carriers. Independent sample t-test and crosstab with Chi-squared distribution were performed, and P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Binary logistic regression was fitted for the relationship between gender of RCP carriers and the type of embryos (euploidy, abnormal, and failed). Potential confounders included gender of RCP carriers (female or male), the biopsied day (day 5 or day 6), and maternal age of the RCP couple (<38 years old or ≥38 years old). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI s) were calculated to assess the association. All the potential confounders were retained in the fitted adjusted models regardless of the significance based on literatures.\nFrom April 2014 to March 2017, a total of 238 couples met our criterions and the clinical data of these couples were collected and analyzed. Among these couples, 124 were female carriers and 114 were male carriers. The average female age (31.69 ± 4.10 vs. 31.52 ± 4.18; P = 0.743) and male age (33.65 ± 5.30 vs. 33.59 ± 6.53; P = 0.932) were not different.

Eighty female carrier couples underwent 95 FETs, and 75 male carrier couples underwent 93 FETs. The mean embryo number per ET was 1.04 (99/95) and 1.13 (105/93) in female and male carriers, respectively. We waited until all the outcomes of the FET cycles were collected in October 2017. Eight female RCP and nine male RCP ET cycles only observed hCG positive but no gestational sacs, resulting biochemical pregnancy rate/ET to 8.40% vs. 9.70% (P = 0.764). There was one ectopic pregnancy in each group. Fourty-five intrauterine gestational sacs with heart beat were observed in female carrier group and 52 were observed in male group (among these one MCDA in female group, one MCDA and four DCDAs in male group), henceforth the embryo implantation rate was 47.50% vs. 48.60% (P = 0.875), the clinical pregnancy rate/ET was 49.50% vs. 50.50% (P = 0.884), and clinical pregnancy rate/initiated cycle was 37.90% vs. 41.20% (P= 0.6), respectively.

ET: Embryo transfer.\nThis study aimed to analyze the clinical outcome of the first PGT cycles differed by the gender of the RCP carrier. Our data showed that the clinical outcomes such as embryo implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, and live birth rate were higher in male RCP carrier group, but without significance. The miscarriage rate was lower in male RCP carrier group, but was not significantly different from female carrier group. Although the differences between the female and male carriers are not reached to the level of statistical significance, almost all clinical outcomes of PGT in the male group show better than those in the female group. The average live birth rate per initiated till data collection was 28.60%, which was similar to those reported earlier.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> The average miscarriage rate documented in the literatures ranged 0–33% after PGT,通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16,17]</u> and our results showed 10.60%, which was within the range and similar as the miscarriage level in general population. It is known that more than 50% of early pregnancy loss is resulted from aneuploidy; however, when the times of pregnancy loss increases, the euploidy rate of the conceptus increases, which suggests that other factors such as aberrant maternal-fetal immune tolerance exist and cause unexplained early pregnancy loss.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The women of the RCP couples might experience several times of pregnancy loss, whose uterine receptivity and maternal-fetal immune tolerance could be impaired, leading to higher miscarriage rate although the conceptus is euploidy.\nIt is well known that RCP will impair men’s fecundity by decreasing the sperm quantity and quality.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Our results showed that sperm live rate, forward motile sperm rate, and normal morphology rate were significantly decreased in male RCP carrier group compared with the counterparts in female RCP group, which was consistent with previous reports. It is assumed that the quality of sperm would impact embryo development, and the low-quality sperm might cause low fertilization rate,通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> slow growth rate, high embryo aneuploidy rate,通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u> and poor implantation rate during transfer procedure.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Our results showed that the fertilization rate, cleavage rate, blastocyst formation rate, and euploidy embryo rate were not significantly different between the two groups; however, the day-3 cleaving embryo rate was significantly higher in male RCP group. This result indicated the major role of oocyte quality in regulating embryo growth. Although the sperms were impaired, the oocytes of the spouses of male carriers might be in a healthy state and eventually the fertilized eggs were developing in a regular pattern. However, the developmental ability of oocytes from female RCP carriers could be decreased, which might cause the slow growth rate in this group. Our results also showed that the blastocyst formation rate and the mean number of normal, abnormal, and mosaic embryos were not significantly different within the two gender carrier groups. The euploidy rate of embryos was significantly higher in day-5 embryos, indicating that the growth rate of embryo was a critical impactor of chromosome constitution in embryos of RCP carriers. Other studies showed that the growing rate of embryos was strongly predictive of euploidy rate通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> and clinical outcome.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Our data confirmed that the growth rate of embryo was critical for evaluating euploidy rate of embryos of RCP carrier, while the gender effect was trivial. Although sperm quality was decreased in male RCP carriers, the growing rate of embryos was not affected, suggesting the principal role of oocytes in embryo development.\nWe specifically analyzed the constitution of all the abnormal embryos produced in this study and categorized the abnormal embryos into five types, which was described in material and methods. The results showed that the largest proportion was segmental aneuploidy, which reached 67.48%. The secondly share was whole-chromosome aneuploidy and then the third place was segmental plus whole-chromosome aneuploidy, which was also related with segregation error of quadrivalent. These data suggested that the quadrivalent segregation pattern overwhelmed the effect of older age in RCP carriers; however, the aneuploidies were not to be negligible in RCP carriers. Compared with older age (female age ≥38 years), younger age (female age <38 years) was associated with the increased rate of euploidy embryos at a borderline significance. Other study also showed 55- 65% embryos with additional aneuploidies with or without translocation-related imbalances in RCP carriers.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> The high risk of recurrent miscarriage and live birth defects due to segmental or whole-chromosome aneuploidy made PGT is a reasonable choice for RCP couples. Compared with other platforms, aSNP is the only platform that distinguishes not only the segmental and whole-chromosome aneuploidy but also the polyploidy and UPD at the preimplantation stage,通用删除6(英):<u>[10,26]</u> resulting in the greatest decrease in miscarriage rate for couples suffered from RPL. The incidence of polyploidy and UPD detected by aSNP in miscarriage specimens could exceed 10%.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> As noted earlier, these can only be detected by aSNP. Our results showed that 0.76% whole-genome UPD was detected in abnormal embryos, which could result in a molar pregnancy if transferred. No polyploidy embryo has been reported in this study which is interesting and need further investigation for ICSI might reduce diandric fertilization but could not avoid the occurrence of polyploidy, and others have reported detection of polyploidy occurred at 4.17%。in embryos.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Therefore, aSNP might be a reasonable choice for patients such as RCP carriers pursuing PGT.\nAs concerned by RCP carriers and physicians, the high abnormal embryo rate caused cancellation cycles in IVF treatment, which was a disturbance for both sides. In our data, the cancellation rate of female and male carriers was 33.90% and 28.90%, respectively. Cancellation cycles are reported to occur in 19%–50% of cases.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,28,29]</u> The fact that a great number of the RCP couples might have no chance to transfer a euploidy embryo in PGT cycles makes genetic counseling difficult for these couples. The minimum number of blastocysts was estimated to be 2–4 to obtain at least one normal/balanced embryo for RCP carriers,通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> and this should also be discussed with RCP carriers. On the contrary, RCP couples underwent conventional IVF cycles without PGT could experience adverse pregnancy outcomes. A recently published study with a small size of RCP couples (n = 41) underwent conventional IVF procedure without PGT showed that by increasing embryos number transferred per cycle (2.6 ± 0.5), the clinical pregnancy rate (46.3%) and live birth rate (36.6%) per transfer were acceptable, but the miscarriage rate (21.1%) was higher compared with that of age-matched couples without RCP.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> Other studies discovered that without PGT, the miscarriage rate of RCP couples might be higher than 50% and the karyotype of miscarriage was abnormal in 90% of cases.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Benefits and drawbacks of PGT for RCP couples should be discussed thoroughly before pursuing PGT.\nIn conclusion, we conclude that though gender influence is not significant, the clinical outcomes of couples with male RCP carriers show better in the first PGT cycles. Although sperm quality is decreased in male RCP carriers, the developing potential of embryo is not affected in this group, and the growing rate of embryo is a great prediction estimating euploidy rate in RCP carriers. Quadrivalent segregation pattern overwhelms the effect of older age in RCP carriers; however, the maternal age effect could not be neglected.\n删除7：<u>The authors thank Harvey J.

This study was approved by the Faculty of Ethics Committee of Shanghai JIAI Genetics and IVF institute, Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, China. The ethical approval number is JIAI E2017-23.\nStandard techniques were used in IVF.

The day of trophectoderm biopsy was depended entirely on blastocyst development and was specifically recorded as day 5 or day 6. Blastocysts were cryopreserved immediately after biopsy procedure was finished.\nWGA was performed using the REPLI-g Single Cell Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s recommendations. aSNP analysis was performed according to the Infinium Chip procedure (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, the WGA product was amplified in an overnight isothermal reaction and then fragmented to a size of approximately 300–500 base pairs. After isopropanol precipitation and resuspension, the samples were hybridized to an Infinium Beadchip overnight for about 20 h. An automated Extension Staining (XStain) process was then performed. After staining, the Beadchips were read on an iScan reader. Genotype calls were made automatically by Illumina BlueFuse® software, generating reports of the results.\nAll the aSNP data were analyzed and reported by two independent genetic technicians and then verified by senior genetic director in our laboratory. Embryos without any seen unbalance were described as euploidy (products resulted from alternate segregation). We categorized the abnormal embryos into five types: segmental aneuploidy (products resulted from adjacent-1 or adjacent-2 segregation which were commonly happened in quadrivalent segregation or randomly happened in duplication or deletion of one part of the arms of chromosomes), whole-chromosome aneuploidy (products mainly resulted from 3:1 or 4:0 segregation of the quadrivalent or randomly happened in meiosis I/II error), segmental plus whole-chromosome aneuploidy (both quadrivalent and meiosis error happened), mosaic only (mosaicism with only one or two chromosomes was found), and UPD (1-22, X)*2(comprehensive chromosome uniparental diploidy; and one or two chromosome uniparental isodisomy was not recorded).\nThe serum level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was measured 14 days after transfer, and a serial ultrasound was performed 5, 7, and 9 weeks after transfer. The clinical pregnancy was confirmed if an intrauterine gestational sac with fetal heart beat was visualized. Monochorionic–diamniotic (MCDA) twins or dichorionic–diamniotic (DCDA) twins were considered as one pregnancy cycle. Biochemical pregnancy number was recorded if the hCG level was positive, but no gestational sac was seen. Miscarriage was recorded if the fetal heart beat was no longer seen at the time of 7 or 9 weeks after transfer. The pregnancy status would be followed up once in the second trimester, and prenatal diagnosis would be done during this period. live birth number would be recorded when the babies were born.\nData were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or as percentages. The detailed algorithm of every clinical outcome was listed as follows: embryo implantation rate = gestational sacs with heart beat number/transfer embryo number; the biochemical pregnancy rate/embryo transfer (ET) = biochemical pregnancy number/frozen–thawed transfer cycles (FET); the clinical pregnancy rate/ET or initiated = clinical pregnancy number/FET or oocyte retrieval cycles; the ongoing pregnancy rate/ET or initiated = ongoing pregnancy number/FET or oocyte retrieval cycles; the live birth rate/ET or initiated = live birth number/FET cycles or oocyte retrieval cycles; the cumulative pregnancy rate or ongoing pregnancy rate or live birth rate = clinical pregnancy number or ongoing pregnancy number or live birth number/enrolled couple number; the cancellation rate = no ET cycles/oocyte retrieval cycles; and the miscarriage rate = miscarriage number/clinical pregnancy number. All statistical procedures were conducted with SPSS version 17.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Data were analyzed according to the gender of the carriers. Independent sample t-test and crosstab with Chi-squared distribution were performed, and P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Binary logistic regression was fitted for the relationship between gender of RCP carriers and the type of embryos (euploidy, abnormal, and failed). Potential confounders included gender of RCP carriers (female or male), the biopsied day (day 5 or day 6), and maternal age of the RCP couple (<38 years old or ≥38 years old). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI s) were calculated to assess the association. All the potential confounders were retained in the fitted adjusted models regardless of the significance based on literatures.\nFrom April 2014 to March 2017, a total of 238 couples met our criterions and the clinical data of these couples were collected and analyzed. Among these couples, 124 were female carriers and 114 were male carriers. The average female age (31.69 ± 4.10 vs. 31.52 ± 4.18; P = 0.743) and male age (33.65 ± 5.30 vs. 33.59 ± 6.53; P = 0.932) were not different. The miscarriage times of the couple before underwent PGT cycles ranged 0- 7, and the average miscarriage times were not different (1.47 ± 1.45 vs. 1.18 ± 1.37; P = 0.112).

Eighty female carrier couples underwent 95 FETs, and 75 male carrier couples underwent 93 FETs. The mean embryo number per ET was 1.04 (99/95) and 1.13 (105/93) in female and male carriers, respectively. We waited until all the outcomes of the FET cycles were collected in October 2017. Eight female RCP and nine male RCP ET cycles only observed hCG positive but no gestational sacs, resulting biochemical pregnancy rate/ET to 8.40% vs. 9.70% (P = 0.764). There was one ectopic pregnancy in each group. Fourty-five intrauterine gestational sacs with heart beat were observed in female carrier group and 52 were observed in male group (among these one MCDA in female group, one MCDA and four DCDAs in male group), henceforth the embryo implantation rate was 47.50% vs. 48.60% (P = 0.875), the clinical pregnancy rate/ET was 49.50% vs. 50.50% (P = 0.884), and clinical pregnancy rate/initiated cycle was 37.90% vs. 41.20% (P= 0.6), respectively. The cumulative pregnancy rate reached 58.80% vs. 62.70% (P = 0.618).

The miscarriage rate of female and male group was 12.80% versus 8.50% (P = 0.503). Till the end of collection of data, there were 16 ongoing pregnancy cycles (female/male, 9/7) and 68 live birth cycles (female/male, 32/36), leading the live birth rate per ET to 33.70% vs. 38.70% (P = 0.473), per initiated to 25.80% vs. 31.60% (P = 0.325), and the cumulative live birth rate to 40.00% vs. 48.00% (P = 0.316) in each group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 6]</u>.

ET: Embryo transfer.\nThis study aimed to analyze the clinical outcome of the first PGT cycles differed by the gender of the RCP carrier. Our data showed that the clinical outcomes such as embryo implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, and live birth rate were higher in male RCP carrier group, but without significance. The miscarriage rate was lower in male RCP carrier group, but was not significantly different from female carrier group. Although the differences between the female and male carriers are not reached to the level of statistical significance, almost all clinical outcomes of PGT in the male group show better than those in the female group. The average live birth rate per initiated till data collection was 28.60%, which was similar to those reported earlier.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> The average miscarriage rate documented in the literatures ranged 0–33% after PGT,通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16,17]</u> and our results showed 10.60%, which was within the range and similar as the miscarriage level in general population. It is known that more than 50% of early pregnancy loss is resulted from aneuploidy; however, when the times of pregnancy loss increases, the euploidy rate of the conceptus increases, which suggests that other factors such as aberrant maternal-fetal immune tolerance exist and cause unexplained early pregnancy loss.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The women of the RCP couples might experience several times of pregnancy loss, whose uterine receptivity and maternal-fetal immune tolerance could be impaired, leading to higher miscarriage rate although the conceptus is euploidy.\nIt is well known that RCP will impair men’s fecundity by decreasing the sperm quantity and quality.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Our results showed that sperm live rate, forward motile sperm rate, and normal morphology rate were significantly decreased in male RCP carrier group compared with the counterparts in female RCP group, which was consistent with previous reports. It is assumed that the quality of sperm would impact embryo development, and the low-quality sperm might cause low fertilization rate,通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> slow growth rate, high embryo aneuploidy rate,通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u> and poor implantation rate during transfer procedure.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Our results showed that the fertilization rate, cleavage rate, blastocyst formation rate, and euploidy embryo rate were not significantly different between the two groups; however, the day-3 cleaving embryo rate was significantly higher in male RCP group. This result indicated the major role of oocyte quality in regulating embryo growth. Although the sperms were impaired, the oocytes of the spouses of male carriers might be in a healthy state and eventually the fertilized eggs were developing in a regular pattern. However, the developmental ability of oocytes from female RCP carriers could be decreased, which might cause the slow growth rate in this group. Our results also showed that the blastocyst formation rate and the mean number of normal, abnormal, and mosaic embryos were not significantly different within the two gender carrier groups. The euploidy rate of embryos was significantly higher in day-5 embryos, indicating that the growth rate of embryo was a critical impactor of chromosome constitution in embryos of RCP carriers. Other studies showed that the growing rate of embryos was strongly predictive of euploidy rate通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> and clinical outcome.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Our data confirmed that the growth rate of embryo was critical for evaluating euploidy rate of embryos of RCP carrier, while the gender effect was trivial. Although sperm quality was decreased in male RCP carriers, the growing rate of embryos was not affected, suggesting the principal role of oocytes in embryo development.\nWe specifically analyzed the constitution of all the abnormal embryos produced in this study and categorized the abnormal embryos into five types, which was described in material and methods. The results showed that the largest proportion was segmental aneuploidy, which reached 67.48%. The secondly share was whole-chromosome aneuploidy and then the third place was segmental plus whole-chromosome aneuploidy, which was also related with segregation error of quadrivalent. These data suggested that the quadrivalent segregation pattern overwhelmed the effect of older age in RCP carriers; however, the aneuploidies were not to be negligible in RCP carriers. Compared with older age (female age ≥38 years), younger age (female age <38 years) was associated with the increased rate of euploidy embryos at a borderline significance. Other study also showed 55- 65% embryos with additional aneuploidies with or without translocation-related imbalances in RCP carriers.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> The high risk of recurrent miscarriage and live birth defects due to segmental or whole-chromosome aneuploidy made PGT is a reasonable choice for RCP couples. Compared with other platforms, aSNP is the only platform that distinguishes not only the segmental and whole-chromosome aneuploidy but also the polyploidy and UPD at the preimplantation stage,通用删除6(英):<u>[10,26]</u> resulting in the greatest decrease in miscarriage rate for couples suffered from RPL. The incidence of polyploidy and UPD detected by aSNP in miscarriage specimens could exceed 10%.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> As noted earlier, these can only be detected by aSNP. Our results showed that 0.76% whole-genome UPD was detected in abnormal embryos, which could result in a molar pregnancy if transferred. No polyploidy embryo has been reported in this study which is interesting and need further investigation for ICSI might reduce diandric fertilization but could not avoid the occurrence of polyploidy, and others have reported detection of polyploidy occurred at 4.17%。in embryos.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Therefore, aSNP might be a reasonable choice for patients such as RCP carriers pursuing PGT.\nAs concerned by RCP carriers and physicians, the high abnormal embryo rate caused cancellation cycles in IVF treatment, which was a disturbance for both sides. In our data, the cancellation rate of female and male carriers was 33.90% and 28.90%, respectively. Cancellation cycles are reported to occur in 19%–50% of cases.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,28,29]</u> The fact that a great number of the RCP couples might have no chance to transfer a euploidy embryo in PGT cycles makes genetic counseling difficult for these couples. The minimum number of blastocysts was estimated to be 2–4 to obtain at least one normal/balanced embryo for RCP carriers,通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> and this should also be discussed with RCP carriers. On the contrary, RCP couples underwent conventional IVF cycles without PGT could experience adverse pregnancy outcomes. A recently published study with a small size of RCP couples (n = 41) underwent conventional IVF procedure without PGT showed that by increasing embryos number transferred per cycle (2.6 ± 0.5), the clinical pregnancy rate (46.3%) and live birth rate (36.6%) per transfer were acceptable, but the miscarriage rate (21.1%) was higher compared with that of age-matched couples without RCP.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> Other studies discovered that without PGT, the miscarriage rate of RCP couples might be higher than 50% and the karyotype of miscarriage was abnormal in 90% of cases.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Benefits and drawbacks of PGT for RCP couples should be discussed thoroughly before pursuing PGT.\nIn conclusion, we conclude that though gender influence is not significant, the clinical outcomes of couples with male RCP carriers show better in the first PGT cycles. Although sperm quality is decreased in male RCP carriers, the developing potential of embryo is not affected in this group, and the growing rate of embryo is a great prediction estimating euploidy rate in RCP carriers. Quadrivalent segregation pattern overwhelms the effect of older age in RCP carriers; however, the maternal age effect could not be neglected.\n删除7：<u>The authors thank Harvey J.

More than 890,000 new and relapse cases emerged in 2012, accounting for 12 % of cases globally – a proportion second only to India通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In order to reduce financial barriers to treatment, the Chinese government introduced the National TB Control Program (NTP) that incorporated the DOTS strategy and removed fee charges for diagnosis and treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Significant improvements have been achieved in the past two decades; the prevalence of smear-positive tuberculosis has fallen by 65 %, bacteriologically positive prevalence declined by 48 %, and prevalence of all pulmonary cases declined by 28 % according to the national tuberculosis prevalence surveys in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Since 2003, China has adopted a \"designated hospital model\" in the eastern part of the country to further improve the quality of TB treatment and patient management, under which selected hospitals undertake both TB outpatient/inpatient services and patient management 通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u>. Recently, policymakers and researchers have being concerned about how the new TB policies will control TB patient admission rates and the cost of TB inpatient services.\nIn fact, the development of anti-TB drugs has revolu- tionized treatment in the 1950s, which led to a dramatic reduction in TB case fatality, and since then both developed and developing countries started to abandon hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Worldwide experiences have demonstrated that it is no longer necessary for TB patients to be isolated from other hospital patients nor from the community with the introduction of short-course chemotherapy and the rapid sterilizing effect of rifampicin in the 1970s 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Moreover, the implementation of DOTS has promoted a standard treatment regimen and high completion rates. With a well-functioning DOTS program, higher cure rates and a lower incidence of adverse reactions can be expected 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u>. The DOTS program advocates the use of outpatient services in most cases, which can reduce the financial burden of treatment. According to the National TB Control Program Guidelines in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>, inpatient services are regarded as essential only for severely ill patients, those with comorbidities or associated conditions and patients with adverse reactions.\nHowever, hospitalization of TB patients is common in China. A study using data collected through a national survey of TB specialized hospitals found that the hospitalization rate of TB patients increased 185.3 % from 1999 to 2009, with an associated increase of inpatient ser- vice cost. This study estimated that the hospitalization rate in 2010 was 29.8 % in eastern China, 35.6 % in central China and 34.6 % in the west 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In 2011, 60.1 % of TB patients covered by the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NCMS) in Yichang city received inpatient services 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In addition, qualitative research from Zhejiang and Guangxi has estimated that nearly 40 % of general TB patients (without comorbidities) experienced hospitalization in the general hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Previous studies have shown no significant differences between inpatient and outpatient treatment outcomes for TB patients, while inpatient costs were substantially higher通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16]</u>. Tuberculosis inpatients often face high costs, risk of nosocomial infection, loss of income, disruption of family life 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>, low therapy completion 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>, psychosocial burdens and unnecessary drugs and tests beyond those supplied through the national program 通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u>.\nStudies have also found that high treatment costs were associated with higher likelihood of non-adherence 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Adherence to TB treatment is crucial for full recovery and to avoid the emergence of drug resistance. Even though DOTS promotes full compliance, high financial burden can result in patients failing to complete the full course of treatment. Due to irregular treatments, smear-negative patients may become smear-positive up to five years later, sometimes developing multiple drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), in turn, infecting others 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\nAs hospitalization is often responsible for the high financial burden on patients and for low adherence rates通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>, it is important to understand the reasons why health care providers often recommend inpatient service rather than outpatient services for TB treatment. This paper pro- vides estimates of admission rates and medical costs of TB inpatients in two cities in China, then explores the factors that are potentially associated with high admission rates via a mixed method. Finally, recommendations are made as to how policy-makers might act to reduce admission rates and the cost of TB inpatient services, limiting the financial burden on TB patients and hence potentially improving treatment adherence.\nEthical approval was issued by the Research Ethics Committee of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the survey and interviews. Data access complied with standard procedure.\nThis study was part of a cross-sectional baseline survey for the China-Gates project Phase II conducted in 2013. We used data obtained in Zhenjiang city of Jiangsu Province in eastern China and Hanzhong city of Shaanxi Province in western China. Counties in each city were grouped into three categories—developed, less developed and least developed according to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2012 and one county from each category was then randomly selected as the study county. Consequently, Yangzhong (105878 CNY), Dantu (83388 CNY) and Jurong (54140 CNY) were selected in Zhengjiang while Mianxian (24900 CNY), Chengg (22444 CNY) and Zhenba (16383 CNY) were selected in Hanzhong.\nWe carried out a patient survey in the three selected counties to investigate the inpatient service utilization of TB patients. In each county, three townships/streets were randomly selected and, in each, 30 TB cases were randomly selected from the TB case registration list. Patient survey primarily focused on those patients who did not have MDR-TB, started TB treatment in 2012 and completed the treatment or stopped treatment before the survey (April 2013). The content of the questionnaire primarily included socio-economic information of TB patients, pathways of seeking TB care, utilization of services, and medical costs. TB patients were all invited to the township hospital to be interviewed by trained medical students from Nanjing Medical University and Xi’an Jiaotong University. In total, 267 TB patients in Zhenjiang and 270 in Hanzhong completed the questionnaire, and after cleaning cases with missing values, 263 completed questionnaires in Zhenjiang and 270 in Hanzhong were valid.\nMedical records of TB inpatients between 2010 and 2012, where the primary diagnosis for hospital admission was TB, were collected in six county TB designated hospitals. The main variables of interest in these records were patient age and sex, health insurance coverage, diagnoses at dates of admission and discharge, length of stay, treatment details and related service costs.\nKey Informant Interviews (KII) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were used to explore the perceptions of stakeholders on the provision and utilization of TB inpatient care. A purposive sampling method was adopted to select the interviewees and FGD participants. All qualitative interviews lasted from fifty to eighty minutes and were both video- and audio- recorded with permission. Semi-structured KIIs were conducted with local health administrators, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) heads in charge of TB control, CDC TB control unit leaders, heads of TB designated hospitals and local health insurance managers. A total of forty KIIs were completed and all KIIs were conducted in the offices of the interviewees. These KIIs focused on the financial burden on TB patients, patient treatment adherence, health insurance regulation on service provision, perceptions of the provision of TB diagnosis and treatment care, TB diagnosis and treatment practices and payment methods for TB treatment. In addition, fourteen focus groups were formed (eight for TB care providers and six for TB patients), taking place at the designated hospitals. Each TB care provider FGD was comprised of doctors and nurses who treated TB, head of TB units, lab staff and administrative staff associated with TB diagnosis and treatment with 8–10 participants per group on average. The topics for these frontline health care workers covered financial burden on TB patients, patients’ adherence to the treatment, regulation of service provision set by the health insurance agency and its impact on service provision, and doctors’ adherence to the TB practice guideline. The six TB patient FGDs revealed differences in the age and gender of TB patients, treatment experience (inpatient and/or outpatient), financial situation, and classification of TB (new or relapsed cases) with 6–8 participants per group on average. The main points of these discussions for TB patients mainly included: experience with TB treatment; financial burden of TB treatment and its impact on family life; satisfaction with the service provision; perception of TB and MDR-TB infection; reimbursement from health insurance.\nWe collected the local policy documents relating to health insurance regulations and reimbursement policies from the county level and municipal level health bureaus and health insurance offices.\nUnivariate and multivariate analyses were applied to analyze the quantitative data. Firstly, with the patient sur- vey data, we estimated the admission rate which was defined as the proportion of surveyed patients admitted to the hospital. A binary logistic regression was used to explore the association between these six characteristics of TB patients (gender, age, social health insurance, classification of TB cases, household per capital income and sample sites) and the occurrence of hospitalization by computing odds ratios (ORs), which can be adjusted for each of their effects. Secondly, we linked patient surveys with the inpatient medical records by patient name in order to have precise information on the utilization of inpatient service. We successfully matched 271 cases (169 cases from county level designated hospitals and 102 from municipal level hospitals). In the linked database, ANOVA was used to find difference in average length of stay (ALOS) and average medical cost among the counties in the two study cities. Associations between the characteristics of TB patients and the average medical costs were estimated by multiple linear regression analysis, in which the log of the average medical cost was the dependent variable as the data were skewed. Thirdly, with the database of medical records, TB inpatients were categorized as with or without comorbidities as defined by their treatment history. ALOS and average medical cost of inpatient treatment were compared between these two groups. The criterion for significance was set at P > 0.05 based on a two-sided test.\nFor the qualitative data, all tape-recorded qualitative resources were firstly transcribed by the medical students, then read by the interviewers. Secondly, a thematic framework analysis approach was used to systematically analyze the potential reasons for hospitalization and the TB inpatient service cost. The themes were identified by the interviewers based on the transcripts and their topic guides. Inductive codes were then developed and used to cataloged all the transcripts. Thirdly, the Nvivo10 software package, a computer-assisted qualitative analysis program, was employed to manage the qualitative data. For the fairness and accuracy of the study, verbatim quotations were used in the transcripts of different stakeholders and all qualitative data were coded and then categorized carefully. In addition, a team approach was used in coding, sorting and classifying these qualitative data, which provided a form of researchers’ triangulation. Charting was used to identify common and divergent perceptions. Explanations of the emergent patterns in this data were developed.\nIn addition, we reviewed local policy documents and summarized the policies related to service provision and reimbursement specifically for TB patients, such as regu- lation of average medical cost for inpatient service, payment method for TB service provision, and reimbursement rates of outpatient and inpatient services.\nSurvey data was obtained for 533 TB patients (263 in Zhenjiang, 270 in Hanzhong). About 57 % of patients from Zhenjiang and 48 % of those from Hanzhong were aged 60 and above, while the proportions of those under 30 were 5.7 and 5.2 % in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong respectively. A large majority were men (73 % in Zhenjiang, 78 % in Hanzhong). Almost 87 % were covered by the NCMS (82 % in Zhenjiang, 92 % in Hanzhong), 8.8 % by the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), and 2.6 % by the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI). Of the 533 patients, 411 were new patients and 122 were relapsed patients. Almost half of the TB patients in Zhenjiang were from families with higher levels of income. The percentages of TB patients from the low level of household per capita income were 20 % in Zhenjiang and 46 % in Hanzhong .\nDemographic and social characteristics of the 533 TB patients fom Zhenjiang and Hanzhong in 2012, (N/%)\n删除重复语句：<u>Demographic and social characteristics of the 533 TB patients fom Zhenjiang and Hanzhong in 2012, (N/%)</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\naUEBMI: urban employee basic medical insurance, URBMI: urban resident basic medical insurance, NCMS: new rural cooperative medical system\nbHousehold per capital income was classified into three equal parts based on the frequency\nTable 2 showed the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and the payment method of TB treatment from NCMS, in which we found no reimbursement policies or payment methods were drawn specifically for TB treatment in Zhenjaing and Hanzhong. The reimbursement rates for outpatient service ranged from 0 % in Yangzhong to 40 % in Dantu, while 60–90 % for inpatient service in all three counties in Zhenjiang. Patients in Hanzhong can get fixed amounts of reimbursement for outpatient service ranged from 800 CNY in Chenggu to 2500 CNY in Zhenba and the reimbursement rates for inpatient service ranged from 60–80 % in three counties. In addition, inpatients in these six County hospitals should firstly pay the deductible costs and then get the reimbursement with a regulated ceiling cost. Health insurance agency in Jurong regulated the average inpatient ser- vice cost so that it would not be higher than 5500 CNY. And Zhenba also specified that average inpatient service cost should not exceed 8,500 CNY in a tertiary hospital and 3,800 CNY in a secondary hospital.\nDescription of the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and payment method for TB treatment from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Description of the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and payment method for TB treatment from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: health policy documents related to TB prevention and treatment, issues by agencies of New Rural Cooperative Medical System\nAround 55 % of the surveyed TB patients were hospitalized at least once during treatment in each of the two cities. Some 17 % of patients in Zhenjiang and 27 % in Hanzhong experienced more than one hospitalization, with an average of 1.39 admissions per patient. In Zhenjiang, significant differences in hospitalization rates existed between the three counties (83 % in Dantu, 43 % in Jurong and 39 % in Yangzhong, P = 0.000). However, there were no significant differences between the three counties in Hanzhong (63 % in Mianxian, 57 % in Zhenba and 47 % in Chenggu, P = 0.120) .\nAdmission rate and hospitalization times of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Admission rate and hospitalization times of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\naFirst time hospitalization from the database of TB patient survey\nHospitalization rate Pearson Chi-Square: P= 0.000 for three county hospitals in Zhenjiang; P= 0.120 for three county hospitals in Hanzhong\nTable 4 shows the results of the logistic regression analysis with the occurrence of hospitalizations as a dependent variable. Tuberculosis patients covered by the NCMS were more likely to have higher hospitalization rates compared to patients covered by UEBMI (P.E = 1.644, OR= 5.18, P= 0.019). In addition, significant differences were found in the hospitalization rates in three counties in Zhenjiang, and TB patients in Dantu were more likely to be hospitalized. More external associated factors should be explored, as few socio-demographic characteristics of TB patients were associated with hospitalization rate.\nMultivariate analysis of the potential factors that influence admission rates of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Multivariate analysis of the potential factors that influence admission rates of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\nWith the analysis of qualitative interviews, the following were potential factors that drove high TB admission rates. First, although all the studied designated TB hospitals were public hospitals, they needed the revenue from TB care to recover their service costs. The inpatient services were more expensive than outpatient services; therefore, the TB designated hospitals were more likely to admit patients for the monetary benefits. This factor was also confirmed by some stakeholders in the interviews with staff in the CDC:  \"Provided the profit of hospitals, overtreatment and over examination is obvious in designated hospitals, not to mention the inappropriate hospitalizations\" (administers from CDC in Yangzhong). Certainly, this preference for admitting more TB patients was constrained by the availability of hospital beds. With limited hospital beds, hospital administrators had to prioritize the distribution of beds between specialties for maximized revenue. As one health administrator commented, \"Hospitalization rate in XX hospital is not high and indeed this hospital does not have many TB inpatients. The bed utilization rate is often beyond 100 %. We have no extra beds for TB patients as the revenue from inpatient TB treatment is relatively low compared to other inpatient services\" (Inter- view results from local health administrator).\nSecond, many designated hospital managers and TB care providers considered hospitalization to be a control measure for TB infection. Most physicians insisted that hospitalizing TB patients was needed to control infection, especially for those with smear-positive pulmonary TB.  \"Even though tuberculosis is an infectious disease, it is not regarded as a category A infectious disease in China. And it is a good way to reduce the spread of TB by getting the patients, especially those that are smear positive, admitted to hospital\" (a physician in Hanzhong).\nThird, it was reported that the high admission rates of TB patients were due to patient request. One reason re- vealed by these interviews was the high reimbursement rate for inpatient services in the health insurance schemes of NCMS and URBMI.  \"We can get more reimbursement if we are hospitalized compared to the outpatient service\" (patient in Chenggu). Another reason was the fact that TB patients worried about the spread of TB infection within the family and in the community.  \"I worry that my daughter may get infected with tuberculosis as I live together with my daughter and she is going to give birth to a baby. and it is better for me to live separately or just be admitted into the hospital\" (patient in Mianxian). Given the patients’ requests, doctors will admit TB patients in order to avoid conflicts with patients or family members and to avoid the risk of being accused of malpractice if they did not admit the patients. And some health care providers in Zhenjiang expressed that  \"In fact, we should acknowledge that most TB patients bear huge psychological pressure, and when they are diagnosed with tuberculosis, they are afraid of telling the truth to their relatives, neighbors and colleagues. Therefore, patients do not allow us, wearing white coats and masks, to enter their homes or even their neighborhood to complete the follow-up work. So it is reasonable to understand why some patients ask to be hospitalized.\"\nIn addition, the high admission rates for TB patients can be associated with the reimbursement ceiling policy as well. The TB doctors who we interviewed in the designated hospital said,  \"Sometimes we (TB designated hospital) had to pay if the cost (for inpatient services) was beyond the ceiling level. For some serious (TB) patients, we had to discharge them and then have them admitted again later.\" These readmissions could further increase the financial burden on patients because they must pay a deductible for each admission.\nUsing the linked database described above, estimates were made for the average medical cost of TB inpatient services . The results displayed that the inpatient service cost in Zhenjiang was higher than in Hanzhong. At the county level in Zhenjiang, the average medical cost in Jurong was significantly higher than in Dantu and Yangzhong, 7,215 CNY compared to 5,161 CNY and 4,809 CNY, respectively. In Hanzhong, service cost for TB inpatients in Zhenba was highest, 4,644 CNY compared to 3,678 CNY and 3,732 CNY in Chenggu and Mianxian.\nAverage medical costs and average length of stay of the 169 matched TB inpatients from six disignated hospitals in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Average medical costs and average length of stay of the 169 matched TB inpatients from six disignated hospitals in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey and medical records of the designated hospitals, a total of 169 cases were successfully matched\naANOVA for county hospitals: Zhenjiang P= 0.047, significant difference between Dantu vs. Jurong; Hanzhong P= 0.060, significant difference between Chenggu vs. Zhenba, Mianxian vs. Zhenba\nbANOVA for county hospitals: Zhenjiang P= 0.216; Hanzhong P= 0.002, significant difference between Chenggu vs. Mianxian, Chenggu vs. Zhenba\nWith the available quantitative data, we examined the relationship between TB inpatient service cost and the comorbidities based on 845 eligible TB patient medical records from designated hospitals in Jurong and Mianxian. The results showed that lung infection (240 patients, 18.8 %), hemoptysis (95 patients, 7.4 %), tuberculosis pleurisy (93 patients, 7.3 %) and COPD (74 patients. 5.8 %) were among the top ten comorbidities. Almost 79 % of inpatients 通用删除7(英):<u>(665)</u> had more than one recorded comorbidity, while some 23 % 通用删除7(英):<u>(198)</u> had over three . The analytical results further demonstrated that contrary to expectations, there were no statistically significant differences in the inpatient costs, as well as the ALOS, between the patients with and without comorbidities .\nFrequency of comorbidities and the 10 most common comorbidities of TB inpatients in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Frequency of comorbidities and the 10 most common comorbidities of TB inpatients in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012</u>\nData source: medical records from the designated hospital\nAverage length of stay and average medical costs of TB inpatients with and without comorbidity in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Average length of stay and average medical costs of TB inpatients with and without comorbidity in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012</u>\nData source: medical records of the designated hospitals\nAnother factor that could have influenced the cost of inpatient services was ALOS . While the average cost of inpatient service in Jurong was significantly higher than in Dantu and Yangzhong, there was no significant difference in terms of ALOS (P = 0.216). In Hanzhong, the average medical costs among the three counties also varied greatly and there were also significant differences in ALOS (P = 0.002); however, Chenggu county had the longest ALOS with the lowest average cost of inpatient services.\nWe also tried to find the association between the health insurance policies and the inpatient service cost. Average medical costs for TB inpatients in Jurong and Zhenba were 7,215 CNY and 4,644 CNY, which was much higher than the 5,500 CNY and 3,800 CNY limits set by the NCMS.\nIn addition, we explored the factors related to the high inpatient service cost for TB treatment via multiple linear regression analysis. In this analysis, we used the log of the average medical cost for TB inpatient care as the dependent variable and the variables in Table 1 as independent variables. However, in addition to the classification of TB cases, no differences could be found in the other subgroups of TB inpatients, which indicated the power of the sociodemographic characteristics we explored to explain that the great variation in average medical cost was limited.\nIn both cities, the qualitative studies indicated general agreement across CDC staff and designated hospital health care providers that higher inpatient costs were usu- ally associated with treatment of patients with comorbidities, given the potential need for a more expensive drug regimen which would be self-paid.  \"Half of the total cost of outpatient treatment is free to TB patients if they have no complications. And another half of the cost will be reimbursed by the health insurance. TB patients, in fact, just need to pay 25 % of the total cost. But the part paid out-of-pocket by patients will be higher if they have some complications\" (health care providers in Dantu).\nThis study examined the TB patient admission rate as well as the costs of TB inpatient services in the sample study sites. The results suggest that both TB patient admission rate and inpatient service cost are high. This is clearly not in line with government policy under which TB patients in China receive free outpatient care (free first-line anti- TB drugs, three free sputum smears and two chest X-rays) 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. The study also explored the possible factors that associated with TB patient admission rate and TB inpatient service cost. The results showed that the financial incentives, misunderstandings of infectious disease control and failure of health insurance regulation are the main potential factors that associated with the high admission rates and high inpatient service costs of TB patients.\nIn our quantitative study, TB patients covered by the NCMS or those from Dantu were the only factors associated with admission rate in our quantitative analysis. Given that relatively low reimbursement rate for outpatient service in NCMS, it was possible for TB patients to choose inpatient service, which was verified by our qualitative study. In China, NCMS aims to provide health protection over catastrophic illnesses with limited health insurance fund, and therefore, it normally sets relatively high reimbursement rates for inpatient care but low rates for outpatient services 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. In addition, the NCMS reimbursed outpatient expenses much less than the UEBMI and UEBMI. Difference in admission rate for TB patients in Zhenjiang can be attributed to the difference in health care accessibility. Dantu is located in an urban area of Zhenjiang, where there are many better general hospitals than the county level designated hospitals. It is rational for TB patients in Dantu to seek service from some other mu- nicipal hospital, since previous study found that nondesignated general hospitals tend to provide inpatient ser- vice before the referral 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. In contrast, it was due to the limited medical resources that resulted in the lowest admission rate for TB patients in Yangzhong, which was also confirmed by the interviews with hospital manager. In fact, there were only four doctors and eight beds available for TB treatment in the Yangzhong designated hospital.\nThe average medical cost for TB inpatient service was 6171 CNY in Zhenjiang and 3952 CNY in Hanzhong, which were slightly lower than the national average cost, revealed in a cross-sectional study in 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. A potential reason was the limited sample size in this study. In addition, significant differences in medical cost existed among three designated hospitals in Zhenjiang. Results of qualitative study attributed the high medical service costs to the treatment of comorbidities and the extensive use of liver protection drugs. With the limited quantitative data, we failed to analyze the differences in the details and structure of the medical costs among the three counties.\nResults from our qualitative study confirmed that economic incentives was indeed associated with TB patient admission rates and the inpatient service costs, which was also revealed by many other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[13,26]</u>. In China, the profit motive for hospitals and monetary incentives for physicians are closely aligned 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. With the decrease in government funding for public hospitals in China, insurance and patient payments are the main sources of income for health facilities 通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u>. Physicians employed by hospitals are rewarded with bonuses and promotions based on the profits they generate by admitting patients, recommending diagnostic tests, and prescribing medications 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. This undoubtedly encourages physicians to increase earnings by perverse behaviors. Most importantly, as fee-for-service remains standard practice in China, health care providers typically do not face a financial risk from the provisioning of unnecessary services 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. Consistent with another study, we also found disagreement between the designated hospital staff and other stakeholders, such as heads of local CDCs officials in charge of TB control, over the 'profit-orientated’ hospitalizations, which can be attributed to the different funding mechanisms between general hospitals and CDCs 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\nQualitative study also revealed that the high TB patient admission rates was associated with the misunderstanding of infectious disease control. In FGDs with healthcare providers, three physicians from two cities insisted that hospitalization was necessary for the purpose of infection control. In addition, a considerable number of patients in Zhenjiang demanded inpatient services for fear of infecting relatives. Previous studies have concluded that domiciliary treatment is as effective as hospital treatment通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33]</u> and inpatient service often resulted in a greater financial burden on patients which may reduce the likelihood of treatment adherence 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Considering the possibility of nosocomial infections and the cost-effectiveness of patient management, WHO also recommended that TB patients should be managed as outpatients when possible 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>, a position supported by the Chinese government guidelines on TB care described in the introduction. Therefore, health education programs were in need to increase the knowledge of both patients and the population about TB control, which would help limit patents’ unreasonable demand for inpatient care. A previous study had confirmed healthcare providers’ inappropriate behaviors, regarding the irrational use of anti-tuberculosis drugs, overprovisioning of liver protection drugs and frequent lab tests in designated hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. And with regard to healthcare providers’ attitude towards hospitalization, further quantitatively study should focus on the extent to which health care providers followed the standard protocols for TB treatment, such as the admission indicators.\nUnexpectedly, no differences were found between patients with and without comorbidities regarding the cost of inpatient service utilization, which was not consistent with our qualitative findings that physicians attributed the high inpatient service to the treatment of TB-related comorbidity. The observed distribution of comorbidities was similar to that in a previous study of TB patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>. In fact, it is reasonable to conclude these results, as most of the comorbidities of TB patients in our quantitative study were common symptoms, comorbidities or chronic diseases for TB patients and patients did not need inpatient service. Only patients with tuberculosis pleurisy need special treatment, such as pumping fluid by thoracentesis, which would increase financial burden. However, only 7.3 % of the total population gets this disease. Therefore, it seems likely that this reflects unnecessary inpatient treatment of those without comorbidities.\nIn addition, health insurance policies were also associated with TB patient admission rates and inpatient service costs. Firstly, we found almost 27 % of TB inpatients in Hanzhong experienced more than one hospitalization. This result can be explained by the qualitative findings that designated hospital providers in Hanzhong argued because TB inpatients needed long periods of inpatient care and incurred high medical expenses they had no choice but to use multiple admissions. Secondly, the average medical costs in Jurong and Zhenba had exceeded that costs regulated by NCMS. The potential reason was the fact that the regulations were for all patients in a hospital and could not work well to control some specific diseases. Thirdly, most TB patients asked for inpatient service, which also can be explained by the reimbursement policy of NCMS. Even though TB patients can get free outpatient treatment, they still need to pay for other drugs, such as liver protection drugs. And the rural health insurance scheme did not cover much of the patient outpatient costs, which may drove TB patients for hospitalization通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Therefore, the current health insurance policies failed to encourage the designated hospitals and TB patients to provide or seek the appropriate services.\nWith quantitative and qualitative study, we found there were several factors impacting on admission rate of TB patients. Health insurance policies may influence hospital admission. Higher reimbursement rate for inpatient service may lead to higher admission rate. Economic incentive was a big motivation for doctors to make admission decision. Misunderstanding of TB infection may be associated with higher admission rate. However, we didn’t find the differences of inpatient service costs between TB patients with or without comorbidities.\nThere are potential limitations in this study. The quantitative data we collected only allowed us to estimate the admission rates and the costs of inpatient services for TB patients. Most of the results of the potential factors that associated with admission rates and inpatient costs come from qualitative interviews. The contributions of the qualitative analysis were limited. These mixed types of analyses limited our ability to draw any causal conclusions.\nBearing these limitations in mind, the key findings from this study are still relevant and informative to the development and implementation of the current \"TB designated hospital model\" policy in China. Based on the results, we would like to propose the following policy interventions that could potentially curb the high TB patient admission rates and inpatient service costs, and as a result reduce the financial burden on TB patients and increase adherence rates to the standard TB treatment. First, increase TB health care providers’, TB patients’ and the general population’s knowledge about TB infection control through various health education programs. Educational programs will potentially increase the acceptability of treating TB patients at the community level with outpatient services. Second, optimize the current TB financing policies, for example by revising reimbursement and provider payment policies relevant to TB treatment, which may help encourage the designated hospitals to provide appropriate medical services and to control the medical expenditure. Third, improve the quality of TB services by advancing TB treatment guideline development and its implementation through strong supportive monitoring and supervision interventions.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Multilingual abstracts in the six official working languages of the United Nations.

More than 890,000 new and relapse cases emerged in 2012, accounting for 12 % of cases globally – a proportion second only to India通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In order to reduce financial barriers to treatment, the Chinese government introduced the National TB Control Program (NTP) that incorporated the DOTS strategy and removed fee charges for diagnosis and treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Significant improvements have been achieved in the past two decades; the prevalence of smear-positive tuberculosis has fallen by 65 %, bacteriologically positive prevalence declined by 48 %, and prevalence of all pulmonary cases declined by 28 % according to the national tuberculosis prevalence surveys in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Since 2003, China has adopted a \"designated hospital model\" in the eastern part of the country to further improve the quality of TB treatment and patient management, under which selected hospitals undertake both TB outpatient/inpatient services and patient management 通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u>. Recently, policymakers and researchers have being concerned about how the new TB policies will control TB patient admission rates and the cost of TB inpatient services.\nIn fact, the development of anti-TB drugs has revolu- tionized treatment in the 1950s, which led to a dramatic reduction in TB case fatality, and since then both developed and developing countries started to abandon hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Worldwide experiences have demonstrated that it is no longer necessary for TB patients to be isolated from other hospital patients nor from the community with the introduction of short-course chemotherapy and the rapid sterilizing effect of rifampicin in the 1970s 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Moreover, the implementation of DOTS has promoted a standard treatment regimen and high completion rates. With a well-functioning DOTS program, higher cure rates and a lower incidence of adverse reactions can be expected 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u>. The DOTS program advocates the use of outpatient services in most cases, which can reduce the financial burden of treatment. According to the National TB Control Program Guidelines in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>, inpatient services are regarded as essential only for severely ill patients, those with comorbidities or associated conditions and patients with adverse reactions.\nHowever, hospitalization of TB patients is common in China. A study using data collected through a national survey of TB specialized hospitals found that the hospitalization rate of TB patients increased 185.3 % from 1999 to 2009, with an associated increase of inpatient ser- vice cost. This study estimated that the hospitalization rate in 2010 was 29.8 % in eastern China, 35.6 % in central China and 34.6 % in the west 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In 2011, 60.1 % of TB patients covered by the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NCMS) in Yichang city received inpatient services 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In addition, qualitative research from Zhejiang and Guangxi has estimated that nearly 40 % of general TB patients (without comorbidities) experienced hospitalization in the general hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Previous studies have shown no significant differences between inpatient and outpatient treatment outcomes for TB patients, while inpatient costs were substantially higher通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16]</u>. Tuberculosis inpatients often face high costs, risk of nosocomial infection, loss of income, disruption of family life 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>, low therapy completion 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>, psychosocial burdens and unnecessary drugs and tests beyond those supplied through the national program 通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u>.\nStudies have also found that high treatment costs were associated with higher likelihood of non-adherence 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Adherence to TB treatment is crucial for full recovery and to avoid the emergence of drug resistance. Even though DOTS promotes full compliance, high financial burden can result in patients failing to complete the full course of treatment. Due to irregular treatments, smear-negative patients may become smear-positive up to five years later, sometimes developing multiple drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), in turn, infecting others 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\nAs hospitalization is often responsible for the high financial burden on patients and for low adherence rates通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>, it is important to understand the reasons why health care providers often recommend inpatient service rather than outpatient services for TB treatment. This paper pro- vides estimates of admission rates and medical costs of TB inpatients in two cities in China, then explores the factors that are potentially associated with high admission rates via a mixed method. Finally, recommendations are made as to how policy-makers might act to reduce admission rates and the cost of TB inpatient services, limiting the financial burden on TB patients and hence potentially improving treatment adherence.\nEthical approval was issued by the Research Ethics Committee of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the survey and interviews. Data access complied with standard procedure.\nThis study was part of a cross-sectional baseline survey for the China-Gates project Phase II conducted in 2013. We used data obtained in Zhenjiang city of Jiangsu Province in eastern China and Hanzhong city of Shaanxi Province in western China. Counties in each city were grouped into three categories—developed, less developed and least developed according to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2012 and one county from each category was then randomly selected as the study county. Consequently, Yangzhong (105878 CNY), Dantu (83388 CNY) and Jurong (54140 CNY) were selected in Zhengjiang while Mianxian (24900 CNY), Chengg (22444 CNY) and Zhenba (16383 CNY) were selected in Hanzhong.\nWe carried out a patient survey in the three selected counties to investigate the inpatient service utilization of TB patients. In each county, three townships/streets were randomly selected and, in each, 30 TB cases were randomly selected from the TB case registration list. Patient survey primarily focused on those patients who did not have MDR-TB, started TB treatment in 2012 and completed the treatment or stopped treatment before the survey (April 2013). The content of the questionnaire primarily included socio-economic information of TB patients, pathways of seeking TB care, utilization of services, and medical costs. TB patients were all invited to the township hospital to be interviewed by trained medical students from Nanjing Medical University and Xi’an Jiaotong University. In total, 267 TB patients in Zhenjiang and 270 in Hanzhong completed the questionnaire, and after cleaning cases with missing values, 263 completed questionnaires in Zhenjiang and 270 in Hanzhong were valid.\nMedical records of TB inpatients between 2010 and 2012, where the primary diagnosis for hospital admission was TB, were collected in six county TB designated hospitals. The main variables of interest in these records were patient age and sex, health insurance coverage, diagnoses at dates of admission and discharge, length of stay, treatment details and related service costs.\nKey Informant Interviews (KII) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were used to explore the perceptions of stakeholders on the provision and utilization of TB inpatient care. A purposive sampling method was adopted to select the interviewees and FGD participants. All qualitative interviews lasted from fifty to eighty minutes and were both video- and audio- recorded with permission. Semi-structured KIIs were conducted with local health administrators, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) heads in charge of TB control, CDC TB control unit leaders, heads of TB designated hospitals and local health insurance managers. A total of forty KIIs were completed and all KIIs were conducted in the offices of the interviewees. These KIIs focused on the financial burden on TB patients, patient treatment adherence, health insurance regulation on service provision, perceptions of the provision of TB diagnosis and treatment care, TB diagnosis and treatment practices and payment methods for TB treatment. In addition, fourteen focus groups were formed (eight for TB care providers and six for TB patients), taking place at the designated hospitals. Each TB care provider FGD was comprised of doctors and nurses who treated TB, head of TB units, lab staff and administrative staff associated with TB diagnosis and treatment with 8–10 participants per group on average. The topics for these frontline health care workers covered financial burden on TB patients, patients’ adherence to the treatment, regulation of service provision set by the health insurance agency and its impact on service provision, and doctors’ adherence to the TB practice guideline. The six TB patient FGDs revealed differences in the age and gender of TB patients, treatment experience (inpatient and/or outpatient), financial situation, and classification of TB (new or relapsed cases) with 6–8 participants per group on average. The main points of these discussions for TB patients mainly included: experience with TB treatment; financial burden of TB treatment and its impact on family life; satisfaction with the service provision; perception of TB and MDR-TB infection; reimbursement from health insurance.\nWe collected the local policy documents relating to health insurance regulations and reimbursement policies from the county level and municipal level health bureaus and health insurance offices.\nUnivariate and multivariate analyses were applied to analyze the quantitative data. Firstly, with the patient sur- vey data, we estimated the admission rate which was defined as the proportion of surveyed patients admitted to the hospital. A binary logistic regression was used to explore the association between these six characteristics of TB patients (gender, age, social health insurance, classification of TB cases, household per capital income and sample sites) and the occurrence of hospitalization by computing odds ratios (ORs), which can be adjusted for each of their effects. Secondly, we linked patient surveys with the inpatient medical records by patient name in order to have precise information on the utilization of inpatient service. We successfully matched 271 cases (169 cases from county level designated hospitals and 102 from municipal level hospitals). In the linked database, ANOVA was used to find difference in average length of stay (ALOS) and average medical cost among the counties in the two study cities. Associations between the characteristics of TB patients and the average medical costs were estimated by multiple linear regression analysis, in which the log of the average medical cost was the dependent variable as the data were skewed. Thirdly, with the database of medical records, TB inpatients were categorized as with or without comorbidities as defined by their treatment history. ALOS and average medical cost of inpatient treatment were compared between these two groups. The criterion for significance was set at P > 0.05 based on a two-sided test.\nFor the qualitative data, all tape-recorded qualitative resources were firstly transcribed by the medical students, then read by the interviewers. Secondly, a thematic framework analysis approach was used to systematically analyze the potential reasons for hospitalization and the TB inpatient service cost. The themes were identified by the interviewers based on the transcripts and their topic guides. Inductive codes were then developed and used to cataloged all the transcripts. Thirdly, the Nvivo10 software package, a computer-assisted qualitative analysis program, was employed to manage the qualitative data. For the fairness and accuracy of the study, verbatim quotations were used in the transcripts of different stakeholders and all qualitative data were coded and then categorized carefully. In addition, a team approach was used in coding, sorting and classifying these qualitative data, which provided a form of researchers’ triangulation. Charting was used to identify common and divergent perceptions. Explanations of the emergent patterns in this data were developed.\nIn addition, we reviewed local policy documents and summarized the policies related to service provision and reimbursement specifically for TB patients, such as regu- lation of average medical cost for inpatient service, payment method for TB service provision, and reimbursement rates of outpatient and inpatient services.\nSurvey data was obtained for 533 TB patients (263 in Zhenjiang, 270 in Hanzhong). About 57 % of patients from Zhenjiang and 48 % of those from Hanzhong were aged 60 and above, while the proportions of those under 30 were 5.7 and 5.2 % in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong respectively. A large majority were men (73 % in Zhenjiang, 78 % in Hanzhong). Almost 87 % were covered by the NCMS (82 % in Zhenjiang, 92 % in Hanzhong), 8.8 % by the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), and 2.6 % by the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI). Of the 533 patients, 411 were new patients and 122 were relapsed patients. Almost half of the TB patients in Zhenjiang were from families with higher levels of income. The percentages of TB patients from the low level of household per capita income were 20 % in Zhenjiang and 46 % in Hanzhong .\nDemographic and social characteristics of the 533 TB patients fom Zhenjiang and Hanzhong in 2012, (N/%)\n删除重复语句：<u>Demographic and social characteristics of the 533 TB patients fom Zhenjiang and Hanzhong in 2012, (N/%)</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\naUEBMI: urban employee basic medical insurance, URBMI: urban resident basic medical insurance, NCMS: new rural cooperative medical system\nbHousehold per capital income was classified into three equal parts based on the frequency\nTable 2 showed the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and the payment method of TB treatment from NCMS, in which we found no reimbursement policies or payment methods were drawn specifically for TB treatment in Zhenjaing and Hanzhong. The reimbursement rates for outpatient service ranged from 0 % in Yangzhong to 40 % in Dantu, while 60–90 % for inpatient service in all three counties in Zhenjiang. Patients in Hanzhong can get fixed amounts of reimbursement for outpatient service ranged from 800 CNY in Chenggu to 2500 CNY in Zhenba and the reimbursement rates for inpatient service ranged from 60–80 % in three counties. In addition, inpatients in these six County hospitals should firstly pay the deductible costs and then get the reimbursement with a regulated ceiling cost. Health insurance agency in Jurong regulated the average inpatient ser- vice cost so that it would not be higher than 5500 CNY. And Zhenba also specified that average inpatient service cost should not exceed 8,500 CNY in a tertiary hospital and 3,800 CNY in a secondary hospital.\nDescription of the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and payment method for TB treatment from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Description of the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and payment method for TB treatment from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: health policy documents related to TB prevention and treatment, issues by agencies of New Rural Cooperative Medical System\nAround 55 % of the surveyed TB patients were hospitalized at least once during treatment in each of the two cities. Some 17 % of patients in Zhenjiang and 27 % in Hanzhong experienced more than one hospitalization, with an average of 1.39 admissions per patient. In Zhenjiang, significant differences in hospitalization rates existed between the three counties (83 % in Dantu, 43 % in Jurong and 39 % in Yangzhong, P = 0.000). However, there were no significant differences between the three counties in Hanzhong (63 % in Mianxian, 57 % in Zhenba and 47 % in Chenggu, P = 0.120) .\nAdmission rate and hospitalization times of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Admission rate and hospitalization times of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\naFirst time hospitalization from the database of TB patient survey\nHospitalization rate Pearson Chi-Square: P= 0.000 for three county hospitals in Zhenjiang; P= 0.120 for three county hospitals in Hanzhong\nTable 4 shows the results of the logistic regression analysis with the occurrence of hospitalizations as a dependent variable. Tuberculosis patients covered by the NCMS were more likely to have higher hospitalization rates compared to patients covered by UEBMI (P.E = 1.644, OR= 5.18, P= 0.019). In addition, significant differences were found in the hospitalization rates in three counties in Zhenjiang, and TB patients in Dantu were more likely to be hospitalized. More external associated factors should be explored, as few socio-demographic characteristics of TB patients were associated with hospitalization rate.\nMultivariate analysis of the potential factors that influence admission rates of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Multivariate analysis of the potential factors that influence admission rates of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\nWith the analysis of qualitative interviews, the following were potential factors that drove high TB admission rates. First, although all the studied designated TB hospitals were public hospitals, they needed the revenue from TB care to recover their service costs. The inpatient services were more expensive than outpatient services; therefore, the TB designated hospitals were more likely to admit patients for the monetary benefits. This factor was also confirmed by some stakeholders in the interviews with staff in the CDC:  \"Provided the profit of hospitals, overtreatment and over examination is obvious in designated hospitals, not to mention the inappropriate hospitalizations\" (administers from CDC in Yangzhong). Certainly, this preference for admitting more TB patients was constrained by the availability of hospital beds. With limited hospital beds, hospital administrators had to prioritize the distribution of beds between specialties for maximized revenue. As one health administrator commented, \"Hospitalization rate in XX hospital is not high and indeed this hospital does not have many TB inpatients. The bed utilization rate is often beyond 100 %. We have no extra beds for TB patients as the revenue from inpatient TB treatment is relatively low compared to other inpatient services\" (Inter- view results from local health administrator).\nSecond, many designated hospital managers and TB care providers considered hospitalization to be a control measure for TB infection. Most physicians insisted that hospitalizing TB patients was needed to control infection, especially for those with smear-positive pulmonary TB.  \"Even though tuberculosis is an infectious disease, it is not regarded as a category A infectious disease in China. And it is a good way to reduce the spread of TB by getting the patients, especially those that are smear positive, admitted to hospital\" (a physician in Hanzhong).\nThird, it was reported that the high admission rates of TB patients were due to patient request. One reason re- vealed by these interviews was the high reimbursement rate for inpatient services in the health insurance schemes of NCMS and URBMI.  \"We can get more reimbursement if we are hospitalized compared to the outpatient service\" (patient in Chenggu). Another reason was the fact that TB patients worried about the spread of TB infection within the family and in the community.  \"I worry that my daughter may get infected with tuberculosis as I live together with my daughter and she is going to give birth to a baby. and it is better for me to live separately or just be admitted into the hospital\" (patient in Mianxian). Given the patients’ requests, doctors will admit TB patients in order to avoid conflicts with patients or family members and to avoid the risk of being accused of malpractice if they did not admit the patients. And some health care providers in Zhenjiang expressed that  \"In fact, we should acknowledge that most TB patients bear huge psychological pressure, and when they are diagnosed with tuberculosis, they are afraid of telling the truth to their relatives, neighbors and colleagues. Therefore, patients do not allow us, wearing white coats and masks, to enter their homes or even their neighborhood to complete the follow-up work. So it is reasonable to understand why some patients ask to be hospitalized.\"\nIn addition, the high admission rates for TB patients can be associated with the reimbursement ceiling policy as well. The TB doctors who we interviewed in the designated hospital said,  \"Sometimes we (TB designated hospital) had to pay if the cost (for inpatient services) was beyond the ceiling level. For some serious (TB) patients, we had to discharge them and then have them admitted again later.\" These readmissions could further increase the financial burden on patients because they must pay a deductible for each admission.\nUsing the linked database described above, estimates were made for the average medical cost of TB inpatient services . The results displayed that the inpatient service cost in Zhenjiang was higher than in Hanzhong. At the county level in Zhenjiang, the average medical cost in Jurong was significantly higher than in Dantu and Yangzhong, 7,215 CNY compared to 5,161 CNY and 4,809 CNY, respectively. In Hanzhong, service cost for TB inpatients in Zhenba was highest, 4,644 CNY compared to 3,678 CNY and 3,732 CNY in Chenggu and Mianxian.\nAverage medical costs and average length of stay of the 169 matched TB inpatients from six disignated hospitals in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Average medical costs and average length of stay of the 169 matched TB inpatients from six disignated hospitals in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey and medical records of the designated hospitals, a total of 169 cases were successfully matched\naANOVA for county hospitals: Zhenjiang P= 0.047, significant difference between Dantu vs. Jurong; Hanzhong P= 0.060, significant difference between Chenggu vs. Zhenba, Mianxian vs. Zhenba\nbANOVA for county hospitals: Zhenjiang P= 0.216; Hanzhong P= 0.002, significant difference between Chenggu vs. Mianxian, Chenggu vs. Zhenba\nWith the available quantitative data, we examined the relationship between TB inpatient service cost and the comorbidities based on 845 eligible TB patient medical records from designated hospitals in Jurong and Mianxian. The results showed that lung infection (240 patients, 18.8 %), hemoptysis (95 patients, 7.4 %), tuberculosis pleurisy (93 patients, 7.3 %) and COPD (74 patients. 5.8 %) were among the top ten comorbidities. Almost 79 % of inpatients 通用删除7(英):<u>(665)</u> had more than one recorded comorbidity, while some 23 % 通用删除7(英):<u>(198)</u> had over three . The analytical results further demonstrated that contrary to expectations, there were no statistically significant differences in the inpatient costs, as well as the ALOS, between the patients with and without comorbidities .\nFrequency of comorbidities and the 10 most common comorbidities of TB inpatients in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Frequency of comorbidities and the 10 most common comorbidities of TB inpatients in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012</u>\nData source: medical records from the designated hospital\nAverage length of stay and average medical costs of TB inpatients with and without comorbidity in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Average length of stay and average medical costs of TB inpatients with and without comorbidity in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012</u>\nData source: medical records of the designated hospitals\nAnother factor that could have influenced the cost of inpatient services was ALOS . While the average cost of inpatient service in Jurong was significantly higher than in Dantu and Yangzhong, there was no significant difference in terms of ALOS (P = 0.216). In Hanzhong, the average medical costs among the three counties also varied greatly and there were also significant differences in ALOS (P = 0.002); however, Chenggu county had the longest ALOS with the lowest average cost of inpatient services.\nWe also tried to find the association between the health insurance policies and the inpatient service cost. Average medical costs for TB inpatients in Jurong and Zhenba were 7,215 CNY and 4,644 CNY, which was much higher than the 5,500 CNY and 3,800 CNY limits set by the NCMS.\nIn addition, we explored the factors related to the high inpatient service cost for TB treatment via multiple linear regression analysis. In this analysis, we used the log of the average medical cost for TB inpatient care as the dependent variable and the variables in Table 1 as independent variables. However, in addition to the classification of TB cases, no differences could be found in the other subgroups of TB inpatients, which indicated the power of the sociodemographic characteristics we explored to explain that the great variation in average medical cost was limited.\nIn both cities, the qualitative studies indicated general agreement across CDC staff and designated hospital health care providers that higher inpatient costs were usu- ally associated with treatment of patients with comorbidities, given the potential need for a more expensive drug regimen which would be self-paid.  \"Half of the total cost of outpatient treatment is free to TB patients if they have no complications. And another half of the cost will be reimbursed by the health insurance. TB patients, in fact, just need to pay 25 % of the total cost. But the part paid out-of-pocket by patients will be higher if they have some complications\" (health care providers in Dantu).\nThis study examined the TB patient admission rate as well as the costs of TB inpatient services in the sample study sites. The results suggest that both TB patient admission rate and inpatient service cost are high. This is clearly not in line with government policy under which TB patients in China receive free outpatient care (free first-line anti- TB drugs, three free sputum smears and two chest X-rays) 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. The study also explored the possible factors that associated with TB patient admission rate and TB inpatient service cost. The results showed that the financial incentives, misunderstandings of infectious disease control and failure of health insurance regulation are the main potential factors that associated with the high admission rates and high inpatient service costs of TB patients.\nIn our quantitative study, TB patients covered by the NCMS or those from Dantu were the only factors associated with admission rate in our quantitative analysis. Given that relatively low reimbursement rate for outpatient service in NCMS, it was possible for TB patients to choose inpatient service, which was verified by our qualitative study. In China, NCMS aims to provide health protection over catastrophic illnesses with limited health insurance fund, and therefore, it normally sets relatively high reimbursement rates for inpatient care but low rates for outpatient services 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. In addition, the NCMS reimbursed outpatient expenses much less than the UEBMI and UEBMI. Difference in admission rate for TB patients in Zhenjiang can be attributed to the difference in health care accessibility. Dantu is located in an urban area of Zhenjiang, where there are many better general hospitals than the county level designated hospitals. It is rational for TB patients in Dantu to seek service from some other mu- nicipal hospital, since previous study found that nondesignated general hospitals tend to provide inpatient ser- vice before the referral 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. In contrast, it was due to the limited medical resources that resulted in the lowest admission rate for TB patients in Yangzhong, which was also confirmed by the interviews with hospital manager. In fact, there were only four doctors and eight beds available for TB treatment in the Yangzhong designated hospital.\nThe average medical cost for TB inpatient service was 6171 CNY in Zhenjiang and 3952 CNY in Hanzhong, which were slightly lower than the national average cost, revealed in a cross-sectional study in 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. A potential reason was the limited sample size in this study. In addition, significant differences in medical cost existed among three designated hospitals in Zhenjiang. Results of qualitative study attributed the high medical service costs to the treatment of comorbidities and the extensive use of liver protection drugs. With the limited quantitative data, we failed to analyze the differences in the details and structure of the medical costs among the three counties.\nResults from our qualitative study confirmed that economic incentives was indeed associated with TB patient admission rates and the inpatient service costs, which was also revealed by many other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[13,26]</u>. In China, the profit motive for hospitals and monetary incentives for physicians are closely aligned 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. With the decrease in government funding for public hospitals in China, insurance and patient payments are the main sources of income for health facilities 通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u>. Physicians employed by hospitals are rewarded with bonuses and promotions based on the profits they generate by admitting patients, recommending diagnostic tests, and prescribing medications 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. This undoubtedly encourages physicians to increase earnings by perverse behaviors. Most importantly, as fee-for-service remains standard practice in China, health care providers typically do not face a financial risk from the provisioning of unnecessary services 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. Consistent with another study, we also found disagreement between the designated hospital staff and other stakeholders, such as heads of local CDCs officials in charge of TB control, over the 'profit-orientated’ hospitalizations, which can be attributed to the different funding mechanisms between general hospitals and CDCs 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\nQualitative study also revealed that the high TB patient admission rates was associated with the misunderstanding of infectious disease control. In FGDs with healthcare providers, three physicians from two cities insisted that hospitalization was necessary for the purpose of infection control. In addition, a considerable number of patients in Zhenjiang demanded inpatient services for fear of infecting relatives. Previous studies have concluded that domiciliary treatment is as effective as hospital treatment通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33]</u> and inpatient service often resulted in a greater financial burden on patients which may reduce the likelihood of treatment adherence 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Considering the possibility of nosocomial infections and the cost-effectiveness of patient management, WHO also recommended that TB patients should be managed as outpatients when possible 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>, a position supported by the Chinese government guidelines on TB care described in the introduction. Therefore, health education programs were in need to increase the knowledge of both patients and the population about TB control, which would help limit patents’ unreasonable demand for inpatient care. A previous study had confirmed healthcare providers’ inappropriate behaviors, regarding the irrational use of anti-tuberculosis drugs, overprovisioning of liver protection drugs and frequent lab tests in designated hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. And with regard to healthcare providers’ attitude towards hospitalization, further quantitatively study should focus on the extent to which health care providers followed the standard protocols for TB treatment, such as the admission indicators.\nUnexpectedly, no differences were found between patients with and without comorbidities regarding the cost of inpatient service utilization, which was not consistent with our qualitative findings that physicians attributed the high inpatient service to the treatment of TB-related comorbidity. The observed distribution of comorbidities was similar to that in a previous study of TB patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>. In fact, it is reasonable to conclude these results, as most of the comorbidities of TB patients in our quantitative study were common symptoms, comorbidities or chronic diseases for TB patients and patients did not need inpatient service. Only patients with tuberculosis pleurisy need special treatment, such as pumping fluid by thoracentesis, which would increase financial burden. However, only 7.3 % of the total population gets this disease. Therefore, it seems likely that this reflects unnecessary inpatient treatment of those without comorbidities.\nIn addition, health insurance policies were also associated with TB patient admission rates and inpatient service costs. Firstly, we found almost 27 % of TB inpatients in Hanzhong experienced more than one hospitalization. This result can be explained by the qualitative findings that designated hospital providers in Hanzhong argued because TB inpatients needed long periods of inpatient care and incurred high medical expenses they had no choice but to use multiple admissions. Secondly, the average medical costs in Jurong and Zhenba had exceeded that costs regulated by NCMS. The potential reason was the fact that the regulations were for all patients in a hospital and could not work well to control some specific diseases. Thirdly, most TB patients asked for inpatient service, which also can be explained by the reimbursement policy of NCMS. Even though TB patients can get free outpatient treatment, they still need to pay for other drugs, such as liver protection drugs. And the rural health insurance scheme did not cover much of the patient outpatient costs, which may drove TB patients for hospitalization通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Therefore, the current health insurance policies failed to encourage the designated hospitals and TB patients to provide or seek the appropriate services.\nWith quantitative and qualitative study, we found there were several factors impacting on admission rate of TB patients. Health insurance policies may influence hospital admission. Higher reimbursement rate for inpatient service may lead to higher admission rate. Economic incentive was a big motivation for doctors to make admission decision. Misunderstanding of TB infection may be associated with higher admission rate. However, we didn’t find the differences of inpatient service costs between TB patients with or without comorbidities.\nThere are potential limitations in this study. The quantitative data we collected only allowed us to estimate the admission rates and the costs of inpatient services for TB patients. Most of the results of the potential factors that associated with admission rates and inpatient costs come from qualitative interviews. The contributions of the qualitative analysis were limited. These mixed types of analyses limited our ability to draw any causal conclusions.\nBearing these limitations in mind, the key findings from this study are still relevant and informative to the development and implementation of the current \"TB designated hospital model\" policy in China. Based on the results, we would like to propose the following policy interventions that could potentially curb the high TB patient admission rates and inpatient service costs, and as a result reduce the financial burden on TB patients and increase adherence rates to the standard TB treatment. First, increase TB health care providers’, TB patients’ and the general population’s knowledge about TB infection control through various health education programs. Educational programs will potentially increase the acceptability of treating TB patients at the community level with outpatient services. Second, optimize the current TB financing policies, for example by revising reimbursement and provider payment policies relevant to TB treatment, which may help encourage the designated hospitals to provide appropriate medical services and to control the medical expenditure. Third, improve the quality of TB services by advancing TB treatment guideline development and its implementation through strong supportive monitoring and supervision interventions.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Multilingual abstracts in the six official working languages of the United Nations.

More than 890,000 new and relapse cases emerged in 2012, accounting for 12 % of cases globally – a proportion second only to India通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In order to reduce financial barriers to treatment, the Chinese government introduced the National TB Control Program (NTP) that incorporated the DOTS strategy and removed fee charges for diagnosis and treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Significant improvements have been achieved in the past two decades; the prevalence of smear-positive tuberculosis has fallen by 65 %, bacteriologically positive prevalence declined by 48 %, and prevalence of all pulmonary cases declined by 28 % according to the national tuberculosis prevalence surveys in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Since 2003, China has adopted a \"designated hospital model\" in the eastern part of the country to further improve the quality of TB treatment and patient management, under which selected hospitals undertake both TB outpatient/inpatient services and patient management 通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u>. Recently, policymakers and researchers have being concerned about how the new TB policies will control TB patient admission rates and the cost of TB inpatient services.\nIn fact, the development of anti-TB drugs has revolu- tionized treatment in the 1950s, which led to a dramatic reduction in TB case fatality, and since then both developed and developing countries started to abandon hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Worldwide experiences have demonstrated that it is no longer necessary for TB patients to be isolated from other hospital patients nor from the community with the introduction of short-course chemotherapy and the rapid sterilizing effect of rifampicin in the 1970s 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Moreover, the implementation of DOTS has promoted a standard treatment regimen and high completion rates. With a well-functioning DOTS program, higher cure rates and a lower incidence of adverse reactions can be expected 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u>. The DOTS program advocates the use of outpatient services in most cases, which can reduce the financial burden of treatment. According to the National TB Control Program Guidelines in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>, inpatient services are regarded as essential only for severely ill patients, those with comorbidities or associated conditions and patients with adverse reactions.\nHowever, hospitalization of TB patients is common in China. A study using data collected through a national survey of TB specialized hospitals found that the hospitalization rate of TB patients increased 185.3 % from 1999 to 2009, with an associated increase of inpatient ser- vice cost. This study estimated that the hospitalization rate in 2010 was 29.8 % in eastern China, 35.6 % in central China and 34.6 % in the west 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In 2011, 60.1 % of TB patients covered by the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NCMS) in Yichang city received inpatient services 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In addition, qualitative research from Zhejiang and Guangxi has estimated that nearly 40 % of general TB patients (without comorbidities) experienced hospitalization in the general hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Previous studies have shown no significant differences between inpatient and outpatient treatment outcomes for TB patients, while inpatient costs were substantially higher通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16]</u>. Tuberculosis inpatients often face high costs, risk of nosocomial infection, loss of income, disruption of family life 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>, low therapy completion 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>, psychosocial burdens and unnecessary drugs and tests beyond those supplied through the national program 通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u>.\nStudies have also found that high treatment costs were associated with higher likelihood of non-adherence 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Adherence to TB treatment is crucial for full recovery and to avoid the emergence of drug resistance. Even though DOTS promotes full compliance, high financial burden can result in patients failing to complete the full course of treatment. Due to irregular treatments, smear-negative patients may become smear-positive up to five years later, sometimes developing multiple drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), in turn, infecting others 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\nAs hospitalization is often responsible for the high financial burden on patients and for low adherence rates通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>, it is important to understand the reasons why health care providers often recommend inpatient service rather than outpatient services for TB treatment. This paper pro- vides estimates of admission rates and medical costs of TB inpatients in two cities in China, then explores the factors that are potentially associated with high admission rates via a mixed method. Finally, recommendations are made as to how policy-makers might act to reduce admission rates and the cost of TB inpatient services, limiting the financial burden on TB patients and hence potentially improving treatment adherence.\nEthical approval was issued by the Research Ethics Committee of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the survey and interviews. Data access complied with standard procedure.\nThis study was part of a cross-sectional baseline survey for the China-Gates project Phase II conducted in 2013. We used data obtained in Zhenjiang city of Jiangsu Province in eastern China and Hanzhong city of Shaanxi Province in western China. Counties in each city were grouped into three categories—developed, less developed and least developed according to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2012 and one county from each category was then randomly selected as the study county. Consequently, Yangzhong (105878 CNY), Dantu (83388 CNY) and Jurong (54140 CNY) were selected in Zhengjiang while Mianxian (24900 CNY), Chengg (22444 CNY) and Zhenba (16383 CNY) were selected in Hanzhong.\nWe carried out a patient survey in the three selected counties to investigate the inpatient service utilization of TB patients. In each county, three townships/streets were randomly selected and, in each, 30 TB cases were randomly selected from the TB case registration list. Patient survey primarily focused on those patients who did not have MDR-TB, started TB treatment in 2012 and completed the treatment or stopped treatment before the survey (April 2013). The content of the questionnaire primarily included socio-economic information of TB patients, pathways of seeking TB care, utilization of services, and medical costs. TB patients were all invited to the township hospital to be interviewed by trained medical students from Nanjing Medical University and Xi’an Jiaotong University. In total, 267 TB patients in Zhenjiang and 270 in Hanzhong completed the questionnaire, and after cleaning cases with missing values, 263 completed questionnaires in Zhenjiang and 270 in Hanzhong were valid.\nMedical records of TB inpatients between 2010 and 2012, where the primary diagnosis for hospital admission was TB, were collected in six county TB designated hospitals. The main variables of interest in these records were patient age and sex, health insurance coverage, diagnoses at dates of admission and discharge, length of stay, treatment details and related service costs.\nKey Informant Interviews (KII) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were used to explore the perceptions of stakeholders on the provision and utilization of TB inpatient care. A purposive sampling method was adopted to select the interviewees and FGD participants. All qualitative interviews lasted from fifty to eighty minutes and were both video- and audio- recorded with permission. Semi-structured KIIs were conducted with local health administrators, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) heads in charge of TB control, CDC TB control unit leaders, heads of TB designated hospitals and local health insurance managers. A total of forty KIIs were completed and all KIIs were conducted in the offices of the interviewees. These KIIs focused on the financial burden on TB patients, patient treatment adherence, health insurance regulation on service provision, perceptions of the provision of TB diagnosis and treatment care, TB diagnosis and treatment practices and payment methods for TB treatment. In addition, fourteen focus groups were formed (eight for TB care providers and six for TB patients), taking place at the designated hospitals. Each TB care provider FGD was comprised of doctors and nurses who treated TB, head of TB units, lab staff and administrative staff associated with TB diagnosis and treatment with 8–10 participants per group on average. The topics for these frontline health care workers covered financial burden on TB patients, patients’ adherence to the treatment, regulation of service provision set by the health insurance agency and its impact on service provision, and doctors’ adherence to the TB practice guideline. The six TB patient FGDs revealed differences in the age and gender of TB patients, treatment experience (inpatient and/or outpatient), financial situation, and classification of TB (new or relapsed cases) with 6–8 participants per group on average. The main points of these discussions for TB patients mainly included: experience with TB treatment; financial burden of TB treatment and its impact on family life; satisfaction with the service provision; perception of TB and MDR-TB infection; reimbursement from health insurance.\nWe collected the local policy documents relating to health insurance regulations and reimbursement policies from the county level and municipal level health bureaus and health insurance offices.\nUnivariate and multivariate analyses were applied to analyze the quantitative data. Firstly, with the patient sur- vey data, we estimated the admission rate which was defined as the proportion of surveyed patients admitted to the hospital. A binary logistic regression was used to explore the association between these six characteristics of TB patients (gender, age, social health insurance, classification of TB cases, household per capital income and sample sites) and the occurrence of hospitalization by computing odds ratios (ORs), which can be adjusted for each of their effects. Secondly, we linked patient surveys with the inpatient medical records by patient name in order to have precise information on the utilization of inpatient service. We successfully matched 271 cases (169 cases from county level designated hospitals and 102 from municipal level hospitals). In the linked database, ANOVA was used to find difference in average length of stay (ALOS) and average medical cost among the counties in the two study cities. Associations between the characteristics of TB patients and the average medical costs were estimated by multiple linear regression analysis, in which the log of the average medical cost was the dependent variable as the data were skewed. Thirdly, with the database of medical records, TB inpatients were categorized as with or without comorbidities as defined by their treatment history. ALOS and average medical cost of inpatient treatment were compared between these two groups. The criterion for significance was set at P > 0.05 based on a two-sided test.\nFor the qualitative data, all tape-recorded qualitative resources were firstly transcribed by the medical students, then read by the interviewers. Secondly, a thematic framework analysis approach was used to systematically analyze the potential reasons for hospitalization and the TB inpatient service cost. The themes were identified by the interviewers based on the transcripts and their topic guides. Inductive codes were then developed and used to cataloged all the transcripts. Thirdly, the Nvivo10 software package, a computer-assisted qualitative analysis program, was employed to manage the qualitative data. For the fairness and accuracy of the study, verbatim quotations were used in the transcripts of different stakeholders and all qualitative data were coded and then categorized carefully. In addition, a team approach was used in coding, sorting and classifying these qualitative data, which provided a form of researchers’ triangulation. Charting was used to identify common and divergent perceptions. Explanations of the emergent patterns in this data were developed.\nIn addition, we reviewed local policy documents and summarized the policies related to service provision and reimbursement specifically for TB patients, such as regu- lation of average medical cost for inpatient service, payment method for TB service provision, and reimbursement rates of outpatient and inpatient services.\nSurvey data was obtained for 533 TB patients (263 in Zhenjiang, 270 in Hanzhong). About 57 % of patients from Zhenjiang and 48 % of those from Hanzhong were aged 60 and above, while the proportions of those under 30 were 5.7 and 5.2 % in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong respectively. A large majority were men (73 % in Zhenjiang, 78 % in Hanzhong). Almost 87 % were covered by the NCMS (82 % in Zhenjiang, 92 % in Hanzhong), 8.8 % by the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), and 2.6 % by the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI). Of the 533 patients, 411 were new patients and 122 were relapsed patients. Almost half of the TB patients in Zhenjiang were from families with higher levels of income. The percentages of TB patients from the low level of household per capita income were 20 % in Zhenjiang and 46 % in Hanzhong .\nDemographic and social characteristics of the 533 TB patients fom Zhenjiang and Hanzhong in 2012, (N/%)\n删除重复语句：<u>Demographic and social characteristics of the 533 TB patients fom Zhenjiang and Hanzhong in 2012, (N/%)</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\naUEBMI: urban employee basic medical insurance, URBMI: urban resident basic medical insurance, NCMS: new rural cooperative medical system\nbHousehold per capital income was classified into three equal parts based on the frequency\nTable 2 showed the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and the payment method of TB treatment from NCMS, in which we found no reimbursement policies or payment methods were drawn specifically for TB treatment in Zhenjaing and Hanzhong. The reimbursement rates for outpatient service ranged from 0 % in Yangzhong to 40 % in Dantu, while 60–90 % for inpatient service in all three counties in Zhenjiang. Patients in Hanzhong can get fixed amounts of reimbursement for outpatient service ranged from 800 CNY in Chenggu to 2500 CNY in Zhenba and the reimbursement rates for inpatient service ranged from 60–80 % in three counties. In addition, inpatients in these six County hospitals should firstly pay the deductible costs and then get the reimbursement with a regulated ceiling cost. Health insurance agency in Jurong regulated the average inpatient ser- vice cost so that it would not be higher than 5500 CNY. And Zhenba also specified that average inpatient service cost should not exceed 8,500 CNY in a tertiary hospital and 3,800 CNY in a secondary hospital.\nDescription of the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and payment method for TB treatment from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Description of the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and payment method for TB treatment from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: health policy documents related to TB prevention and treatment, issues by agencies of New Rural Cooperative Medical System\nAround 55 % of the surveyed TB patients were hospitalized at least once during treatment in each of the two cities. Some 17 % of patients in Zhenjiang and 27 % in Hanzhong experienced more than one hospitalization, with an average of 1.39 admissions per patient. In Zhenjiang, significant differences in hospitalization rates existed between the three counties (83 % in Dantu, 43 % in Jurong and 39 % in Yangzhong, P = 0.000). However, there were no significant differences between the three counties in Hanzhong (63 % in Mianxian, 57 % in Zhenba and 47 % in Chenggu, P = 0.120) .\nAdmission rate and hospitalization times of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Admission rate and hospitalization times of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\naFirst time hospitalization from the database of TB patient survey\nHospitalization rate Pearson Chi-Square: P= 0.000 for three county hospitals in Zhenjiang; P= 0.120 for three county hospitals in Hanzhong\nTable 4 shows the results of the logistic regression analysis with the occurrence of hospitalizations as a dependent variable. Tuberculosis patients covered by the NCMS were more likely to have higher hospitalization rates compared to patients covered by UEBMI (P.E = 1.644, OR= 5.18, P= 0.019). In addition, significant differences were found in the hospitalization rates in three counties in Zhenjiang, and TB patients in Dantu were more likely to be hospitalized. More external associated factors should be explored, as few socio-demographic characteristics of TB patients were associated with hospitalization rate.\nMultivariate analysis of the potential factors that influence admission rates of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Multivariate analysis of the potential factors that influence admission rates of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\nWith the analysis of qualitative interviews, the following were potential factors that drove high TB admission rates. First, although all the studied designated TB hospitals were public hospitals, they needed the revenue from TB care to recover their service costs. The inpatient services were more expensive than outpatient services; therefore, the TB designated hospitals were more likely to admit patients for the monetary benefits. This factor was also confirmed by some stakeholders in the interviews with staff in the CDC:  \"Provided the profit of hospitals, overtreatment and over examination is obvious in designated hospitals, not to mention the inappropriate hospitalizations\" (administers from CDC in Yangzhong). Certainly, this preference for admitting more TB patients was constrained by the availability of hospital beds. With limited hospital beds, hospital administrators had to prioritize the distribution of beds between specialties for maximized revenue. As one health administrator commented, \"Hospitalization rate in XX hospital is not high and indeed this hospital does not have many TB inpatients. The bed utilization rate is often beyond 100 %. We have no extra beds for TB patients as the revenue from inpatient TB treatment is relatively low compared to other inpatient services\" (Inter- view results from local health administrator).\nSecond, many designated hospital managers and TB care providers considered hospitalization to be a control measure for TB infection. Most physicians insisted that hospitalizing TB patients was needed to control infection, especially for those with smear-positive pulmonary TB.  \"Even though tuberculosis is an infectious disease, it is not regarded as a category A infectious disease in China. And it is a good way to reduce the spread of TB by getting the patients, especially those that are smear positive, admitted to hospital\" (a physician in Hanzhong).\nThird, it was reported that the high admission rates of TB patients were due to patient request. One reason re- vealed by these interviews was the high reimbursement rate for inpatient services in the health insurance schemes of NCMS and URBMI.  \"We can get more reimbursement if we are hospitalized compared to the outpatient service\" (patient in Chenggu). Another reason was the fact that TB patients worried about the spread of TB infection within the family and in the community.  \"I worry that my daughter may get infected with tuberculosis as I live together with my daughter and she is going to give birth to a baby. and it is better for me to live separately or just be admitted into the hospital\" (patient in Mianxian). Given the patients’ requests, doctors will admit TB patients in order to avoid conflicts with patients or family members and to avoid the risk of being accused of malpractice if they did not admit the patients. And some health care providers in Zhenjiang expressed that  \"In fact, we should acknowledge that most TB patients bear huge psychological pressure, and when they are diagnosed with tuberculosis, they are afraid of telling the truth to their relatives, neighbors and colleagues. Therefore, patients do not allow us, wearing white coats and masks, to enter their homes or even their neighborhood to complete the follow-up work. So it is reasonable to understand why some patients ask to be hospitalized.\"\nIn addition, the high admission rates for TB patients can be associated with the reimbursement ceiling policy as well. The TB doctors who we interviewed in the designated hospital said,  \"Sometimes we (TB designated hospital) had to pay if the cost (for inpatient services) was beyond the ceiling level. For some serious (TB) patients, we had to discharge them and then have them admitted again later.\" These readmissions could further increase the financial burden on patients because they must pay a deductible for each admission.\nUsing the linked database described above, estimates were made for the average medical cost of TB inpatient services . The results displayed that the inpatient service cost in Zhenjiang was higher than in Hanzhong. At the county level in Zhenjiang, the average medical cost in Jurong was significantly higher than in Dantu and Yangzhong, 7,215 CNY compared to 5,161 CNY and 4,809 CNY, respectively. In Hanzhong, service cost for TB inpatients in Zhenba was highest, 4,644 CNY compared to 3,678 CNY and 3,732 CNY in Chenggu and Mianxian.\nAverage medical costs and average length of stay of the 169 matched TB inpatients from six disignated hospitals in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Average medical costs and average length of stay of the 169 matched TB inpatients from six disignated hospitals in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey and medical records of the designated hospitals, a total of 169 cases were successfully matched\naANOVA for county hospitals: Zhenjiang P= 0.047, significant difference between Dantu vs. Jurong; Hanzhong P= 0.060, significant difference between Chenggu vs. Zhenba, Mianxian vs. Zhenba\nbANOVA for county hospitals: Zhenjiang P= 0.216; Hanzhong P= 0.002, significant difference between Chenggu vs. Mianxian, Chenggu vs. Zhenba\nWith the available quantitative data, we examined the relationship between TB inpatient service cost and the comorbidities based on 845 eligible TB patient medical records from designated hospitals in Jurong and Mianxian. The results showed that lung infection (240 patients, 18.8 %), hemoptysis (95 patients, 7.4 %), tuberculosis pleurisy (93 patients, 7.3 %) and COPD (74 patients. 5.8 %) were among the top ten comorbidities. Almost 79 % of inpatients 通用删除7(英):<u>(665)</u> had more than one recorded comorbidity, while some 23 % 通用删除7(英):<u>(198)</u> had over three . The analytical results further demonstrated that contrary to expectations, there were no statistically significant differences in the inpatient costs, as well as the ALOS, between the patients with and without comorbidities .\nFrequency of comorbidities and the 10 most common comorbidities of TB inpatients in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Frequency of comorbidities and the 10 most common comorbidities of TB inpatients in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012</u>\nData source: medical records from the designated hospital\nAverage length of stay and average medical costs of TB inpatients with and without comorbidity in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Average length of stay and average medical costs of TB inpatients with and without comorbidity in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012</u>\nData source: medical records of the designated hospitals\nAnother factor that could have influenced the cost of inpatient services was ALOS . While the average cost of inpatient service in Jurong was significantly higher than in Dantu and Yangzhong, there was no significant difference in terms of ALOS (P = 0.216). In Hanzhong, the average medical costs among the three counties also varied greatly and there were also significant differences in ALOS (P = 0.002); however, Chenggu county had the longest ALOS with the lowest average cost of inpatient services.\nWe also tried to find the association between the health insurance policies and the inpatient service cost. Average medical costs for TB inpatients in Jurong and Zhenba were 7,215 CNY and 4,644 CNY, which was much higher than the 5,500 CNY and 3,800 CNY limits set by the NCMS.\nIn addition, we explored the factors related to the high inpatient service cost for TB treatment via multiple linear regression analysis. In this analysis, we used the log of the average medical cost for TB inpatient care as the dependent variable and the variables in Table 1 as independent variables. However, in addition to the classification of TB cases, no differences could be found in the other subgroups of TB inpatients, which indicated the power of the sociodemographic characteristics we explored to explain that the great variation in average medical cost was limited.\nIn both cities, the qualitative studies indicated general agreement across CDC staff and designated hospital health care providers that higher inpatient costs were usu- ally associated with treatment of patients with comorbidities, given the potential need for a more expensive drug regimen which would be self-paid.  \"Half of the total cost of outpatient treatment is free to TB patients if they have no complications. And another half of the cost will be reimbursed by the health insurance. TB patients, in fact, just need to pay 25 % of the total cost. But the part paid out-of-pocket by patients will be higher if they have some complications\" (health care providers in Dantu).\nThis study examined the TB patient admission rate as well as the costs of TB inpatient services in the sample study sites. The results suggest that both TB patient admission rate and inpatient service cost are high. This is clearly not in line with government policy under which TB patients in China receive free outpatient care (free first-line anti- TB drugs, three free sputum smears and two chest X-rays) 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. The study also explored the possible factors that associated with TB patient admission rate and TB inpatient service cost. The results showed that the financial incentives, misunderstandings of infectious disease control and failure of health insurance regulation are the main potential factors that associated with the high admission rates and high inpatient service costs of TB patients.\nIn our quantitative study, TB patients covered by the NCMS or those from Dantu were the only factors associated with admission rate in our quantitative analysis. Given that relatively low reimbursement rate for outpatient service in NCMS, it was possible for TB patients to choose inpatient service, which was verified by our qualitative study. In China, NCMS aims to provide health protection over catastrophic illnesses with limited health insurance fund, and therefore, it normally sets relatively high reimbursement rates for inpatient care but low rates for outpatient services 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. In addition, the NCMS reimbursed outpatient expenses much less than the UEBMI and UEBMI. Difference in admission rate for TB patients in Zhenjiang can be attributed to the difference in health care accessibility. Dantu is located in an urban area of Zhenjiang, where there are many better general hospitals than the county level designated hospitals. It is rational for TB patients in Dantu to seek service from some other mu- nicipal hospital, since previous study found that nondesignated general hospitals tend to provide inpatient ser- vice before the referral 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. In contrast, it was due to the limited medical resources that resulted in the lowest admission rate for TB patients in Yangzhong, which was also confirmed by the interviews with hospital manager. In fact, there were only four doctors and eight beds available for TB treatment in the Yangzhong designated hospital.\nThe average medical cost for TB inpatient service was 6171 CNY in Zhenjiang and 3952 CNY in Hanzhong, which were slightly lower than the national average cost, revealed in a cross-sectional study in 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. A potential reason was the limited sample size in this study. In addition, significant differences in medical cost existed among three designated hospitals in Zhenjiang. Results of qualitative study attributed the high medical service costs to the treatment of comorbidities and the extensive use of liver protection drugs. With the limited quantitative data, we failed to analyze the differences in the details and structure of the medical costs among the three counties.\nResults from our qualitative study confirmed that economic incentives was indeed associated with TB patient admission rates and the inpatient service costs, which was also revealed by many other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[13,26]</u>. In China, the profit motive for hospitals and monetary incentives for physicians are closely aligned 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. With the decrease in government funding for public hospitals in China, insurance and patient payments are the main sources of income for health facilities 通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u>. Physicians employed by hospitals are rewarded with bonuses and promotions based on the profits they generate by admitting patients, recommending diagnostic tests, and prescribing medications 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. This undoubtedly encourages physicians to increase earnings by perverse behaviors. Most importantly, as fee-for-service remains standard practice in China, health care providers typically do not face a financial risk from the provisioning of unnecessary services 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. Consistent with another study, we also found disagreement between the designated hospital staff and other stakeholders, such as heads of local CDCs officials in charge of TB control, over the 'profit-orientated’ hospitalizations, which can be attributed to the different funding mechanisms between general hospitals and CDCs 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\nQualitative study also revealed that the high TB patient admission rates was associated with the misunderstanding of infectious disease control. In FGDs with healthcare providers, three physicians from two cities insisted that hospitalization was necessary for the purpose of infection control. In addition, a considerable number of patients in Zhenjiang demanded inpatient services for fear of infecting relatives. Previous studies have concluded that domiciliary treatment is as effective as hospital treatment通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33]</u> and inpatient service often resulted in a greater financial burden on patients which may reduce the likelihood of treatment adherence 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Considering the possibility of nosocomial infections and the cost-effectiveness of patient management, WHO also recommended that TB patients should be managed as outpatients when possible 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>, a position supported by the Chinese government guidelines on TB care described in the introduction. Therefore, health education programs were in need to increase the knowledge of both patients and the population about TB control, which would help limit patents’ unreasonable demand for inpatient care. A previous study had confirmed healthcare providers’ inappropriate behaviors, regarding the irrational use of anti-tuberculosis drugs, overprovisioning of liver protection drugs and frequent lab tests in designated hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. And with regard to healthcare providers’ attitude towards hospitalization, further quantitatively study should focus on the extent to which health care providers followed the standard protocols for TB treatment, such as the admission indicators.\nUnexpectedly, no differences were found between patients with and without comorbidities regarding the cost of inpatient service utilization, which was not consistent with our qualitative findings that physicians attributed the high inpatient service to the treatment of TB-related comorbidity. The observed distribution of comorbidities was similar to that in a previous study of TB patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>. In fact, it is reasonable to conclude these results, as most of the comorbidities of TB patients in our quantitative study were common symptoms, comorbidities or chronic diseases for TB patients and patients did not need inpatient service. Only patients with tuberculosis pleurisy need special treatment, such as pumping fluid by thoracentesis, which would increase financial burden. However, only 7.3 % of the total population gets this disease. Therefore, it seems likely that this reflects unnecessary inpatient treatment of those without comorbidities.\nIn addition, health insurance policies were also associated with TB patient admission rates and inpatient service costs. Firstly, we found almost 27 % of TB inpatients in Hanzhong experienced more than one hospitalization. This result can be explained by the qualitative findings that designated hospital providers in Hanzhong argued because TB inpatients needed long periods of inpatient care and incurred high medical expenses they had no choice but to use multiple admissions. Secondly, the average medical costs in Jurong and Zhenba had exceeded that costs regulated by NCMS. The potential reason was the fact that the regulations were for all patients in a hospital and could not work well to control some specific diseases. Thirdly, most TB patients asked for inpatient service, which also can be explained by the reimbursement policy of NCMS. Even though TB patients can get free outpatient treatment, they still need to pay for other drugs, such as liver protection drugs. And the rural health insurance scheme did not cover much of the patient outpatient costs, which may drove TB patients for hospitalization通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Therefore, the current health insurance policies failed to encourage the designated hospitals and TB patients to provide or seek the appropriate services.\nWith quantitative and qualitative study, we found there were several factors impacting on admission rate of TB patients. Health insurance policies may influence hospital admission. Higher reimbursement rate for inpatient service may lead to higher admission rate. Economic incentive was a big motivation for doctors to make admission decision. Misunderstanding of TB infection may be associated with higher admission rate. However, we didn’t find the differences of inpatient service costs between TB patients with or without comorbidities.\nThere are potential limitations in this study. The quantitative data we collected only allowed us to estimate the admission rates and the costs of inpatient services for TB patients. Most of the results of the potential factors that associated with admission rates and inpatient costs come from qualitative interviews. The contributions of the qualitative analysis were limited. These mixed types of analyses limited our ability to draw any causal conclusions.\nBearing these limitations in mind, the key findings from this study are still relevant and informative to the development and implementation of the current \"TB designated hospital model\" policy in China. Based on the results, we would like to propose the following policy interventions that could potentially curb the high TB patient admission rates and inpatient service costs, and as a result reduce the financial burden on TB patients and increase adherence rates to the standard TB treatment. First, increase TB health care providers’, TB patients’ and the general population’s knowledge about TB infection control through various health education programs. Educational programs will potentially increase the acceptability of treating TB patients at the community level with outpatient services. Second, optimize the current TB financing policies, for example by revising reimbursement and provider payment policies relevant to TB treatment, which may help encourage the designated hospitals to provide appropriate medical services and to control the medical expenditure. Third, improve the quality of TB services by advancing TB treatment guideline development and its implementation through strong supportive monitoring and supervision interventions.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Multilingual abstracts in the six official working languages of the United Nations.

More than 890,000 new and relapse cases emerged in 2012, accounting for 12 % of cases globally – a proportion second only to India通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In order to reduce financial barriers to treatment, the Chinese government introduced the National TB Control Program (NTP) that incorporated the DOTS strategy and removed fee charges for diagnosis and treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Significant improvements have been achieved in the past two decades; the prevalence of smear-positive tuberculosis has fallen by 65 %, bacteriologically positive prevalence declined by 48 %, and prevalence of all pulmonary cases declined by 28 % according to the national tuberculosis prevalence surveys in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Since 2003, China has adopted a \"designated hospital model\" in the eastern part of the country to further improve the quality of TB treatment and patient management, under which selected hospitals undertake both TB outpatient/inpatient services and patient management 通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u>. Recently, policymakers and researchers have being concerned about how the new TB policies will control TB patient admission rates and the cost of TB inpatient services.\nIn fact, the development of anti-TB drugs has revolu- tionized treatment in the 1950s, which led to a dramatic reduction in TB case fatality, and since then both developed and developing countries started to abandon hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Worldwide experiences have demonstrated that it is no longer necessary for TB patients to be isolated from other hospital patients nor from the community with the introduction of short-course chemotherapy and the rapid sterilizing effect of rifampicin in the 1970s 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Moreover, the implementation of DOTS has promoted a standard treatment regimen and high completion rates. With a well-functioning DOTS program, higher cure rates and a lower incidence of adverse reactions can be expected 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u>. The DOTS program advocates the use of outpatient services in most cases, which can reduce the financial burden of treatment. According to the National TB Control Program Guidelines in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>, inpatient services are regarded as essential only for severely ill patients, those with comorbidities or associated conditions and patients with adverse reactions.\nHowever, hospitalization of TB patients is common in China. A study using data collected through a national survey of TB specialized hospitals found that the hospitalization rate of TB patients increased 185.3 % from 1999 to 2009, with an associated increase of inpatient ser- vice cost. This study estimated that the hospitalization rate in 2010 was 29.8 % in eastern China, 35.6 % in central China and 34.6 % in the west 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In 2011, 60.1 % of TB patients covered by the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NCMS) in Yichang city received inpatient services 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In addition, qualitative research from Zhejiang and Guangxi has estimated that nearly 40 % of general TB patients (without comorbidities) experienced hospitalization in the general hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Previous studies have shown no significant differences between inpatient and outpatient treatment outcomes for TB patients, while inpatient costs were substantially higher通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16]</u>. Tuberculosis inpatients often face high costs, risk of nosocomial infection, loss of income, disruption of family life 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>, low therapy completion 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>, psychosocial burdens and unnecessary drugs and tests beyond those supplied through the national program 通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u>.\nStudies have also found that high treatment costs were associated with higher likelihood of non-adherence 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Adherence to TB treatment is crucial for full recovery and to avoid the emergence of drug resistance. Even though DOTS promotes full compliance, high financial burden can result in patients failing to complete the full course of treatment. Due to irregular treatments, smear-negative patients may become smear-positive up to five years later, sometimes developing multiple drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), in turn, infecting others 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\nAs hospitalization is often responsible for the high financial burden on patients and for low adherence rates通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>, it is important to understand the reasons why health care providers often recommend inpatient service rather than outpatient services for TB treatment. This paper pro- vides estimates of admission rates and medical costs of TB inpatients in two cities in China, then explores the factors that are potentially associated with high admission rates via a mixed method. Finally, recommendations are made as to how policy-makers might act to reduce admission rates and the cost of TB inpatient services, limiting the financial burden on TB patients and hence potentially improving treatment adherence.\nEthical approval was issued by the Research Ethics Committee of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the survey and interviews. Data access complied with standard procedure.\nThis study was part of a cross-sectional baseline survey for the China-Gates project Phase II conducted in 2013. We used data obtained in Zhenjiang city of Jiangsu Province in eastern China and Hanzhong city of Shaanxi Province in western China. Counties in each city were grouped into three categories—developed, less developed and least developed according to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2012 and one county from each category was then randomly selected as the study county. Consequently, Yangzhong (105878 CNY), Dantu (83388 CNY) and Jurong (54140 CNY) were selected in Zhengjiang while Mianxian (24900 CNY), Chengg (22444 CNY) and Zhenba (16383 CNY) were selected in Hanzhong.\nWe carried out a patient survey in the three selected counties to investigate the inpatient service utilization of TB patients. In each county, three townships/streets were randomly selected and, in each, 30 TB cases were randomly selected from the TB case registration list. Patient survey primarily focused on those patients who did not have MDR-TB, started TB treatment in 2012 and completed the treatment or stopped treatment before the survey (April 2013). The content of the questionnaire primarily included socio-economic information of TB patients, pathways of seeking TB care, utilization of services, and medical costs. TB patients were all invited to the township hospital to be interviewed by trained medical students from Nanjing Medical University and Xi’an Jiaotong University. In total, 267 TB patients in Zhenjiang and 270 in Hanzhong completed the questionnaire, and after cleaning cases with missing values, 263 completed questionnaires in Zhenjiang and 270 in Hanzhong were valid.\nMedical records of TB inpatients between 2010 and 2012, where the primary diagnosis for hospital admission was TB, were collected in six county TB designated hospitals. The main variables of interest in these records were patient age and sex, health insurance coverage, diagnoses at dates of admission and discharge, length of stay, treatment details and related service costs.\nKey Informant Interviews (KII) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were used to explore the perceptions of stakeholders on the provision and utilization of TB inpatient care. A purposive sampling method was adopted to select the interviewees and FGD participants. All qualitative interviews lasted from fifty to eighty minutes and were both video- and audio- recorded with permission. Semi-structured KIIs were conducted with local health administrators, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) heads in charge of TB control, CDC TB control unit leaders, heads of TB designated hospitals and local health insurance managers. A total of forty KIIs were completed and all KIIs were conducted in the offices of the interviewees. These KIIs focused on the financial burden on TB patients, patient treatment adherence, health insurance regulation on service provision, perceptions of the provision of TB diagnosis and treatment care, TB diagnosis and treatment practices and payment methods for TB treatment. In addition, fourteen focus groups were formed (eight for TB care providers and six for TB patients), taking place at the designated hospitals. Each TB care provider FGD was comprised of doctors and nurses who treated TB, head of TB units, lab staff and administrative staff associated with TB diagnosis and treatment with 8–10 participants per group on average. The topics for these frontline health care workers covered financial burden on TB patients, patients’ adherence to the treatment, regulation of service provision set by the health insurance agency and its impact on service provision, and doctors’ adherence to the TB practice guideline. The six TB patient FGDs revealed differences in the age and gender of TB patients, treatment experience (inpatient and/or outpatient), financial situation, and classification of TB (new or relapsed cases) with 6–8 participants per group on average. The main points of these discussions for TB patients mainly included: experience with TB treatment; financial burden of TB treatment and its impact on family life; satisfaction with the service provision; perception of TB and MDR-TB infection; reimbursement from health insurance.\nWe collected the local policy documents relating to health insurance regulations and reimbursement policies from the county level and municipal level health bureaus and health insurance offices.\nUnivariate and multivariate analyses were applied to analyze the quantitative data. Firstly, with the patient sur- vey data, we estimated the admission rate which was defined as the proportion of surveyed patients admitted to the hospital. A binary logistic regression was used to explore the association between these six characteristics of TB patients (gender, age, social health insurance, classification of TB cases, household per capital income and sample sites) and the occurrence of hospitalization by computing odds ratios (ORs), which can be adjusted for each of their effects. Secondly, we linked patient surveys with the inpatient medical records by patient name in order to have precise information on the utilization of inpatient service. We successfully matched 271 cases (169 cases from county level designated hospitals and 102 from municipal level hospitals). In the linked database, ANOVA was used to find difference in average length of stay (ALOS) and average medical cost among the counties in the two study cities. Associations between the characteristics of TB patients and the average medical costs were estimated by multiple linear regression analysis, in which the log of the average medical cost was the dependent variable as the data were skewed. Thirdly, with the database of medical records, TB inpatients were categorized as with or without comorbidities as defined by their treatment history. ALOS and average medical cost of inpatient treatment were compared between these two groups. The criterion for significance was set at P > 0.05 based on a two-sided test.\nFor the qualitative data, all tape-recorded qualitative resources were firstly transcribed by the medical students, then read by the interviewers. Secondly, a thematic framework analysis approach was used to systematically analyze the potential reasons for hospitalization and the TB inpatient service cost. The themes were identified by the interviewers based on the transcripts and their topic guides. Inductive codes were then developed and used to cataloged all the transcripts. Thirdly, the Nvivo10 software package, a computer-assisted qualitative analysis program, was employed to manage the qualitative data. For the fairness and accuracy of the study, verbatim quotations were used in the transcripts of different stakeholders and all qualitative data were coded and then categorized carefully. In addition, a team approach was used in coding, sorting and classifying these qualitative data, which provided a form of researchers’ triangulation. Charting was used to identify common and divergent perceptions. Explanations of the emergent patterns in this data were developed.\nIn addition, we reviewed local policy documents and summarized the policies related to service provision and reimbursement specifically for TB patients, such as regu- lation of average medical cost for inpatient service, payment method for TB service provision, and reimbursement rates of outpatient and inpatient services.\nSurvey data was obtained for 533 TB patients (263 in Zhenjiang, 270 in Hanzhong). About 57 % of patients from Zhenjiang and 48 % of those from Hanzhong were aged 60 and above, while the proportions of those under 30 were 5.7 and 5.2 % in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong respectively. A large majority were men (73 % in Zhenjiang, 78 % in Hanzhong). Almost 87 % were covered by the NCMS (82 % in Zhenjiang, 92 % in Hanzhong), 8.8 % by the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), and 2.6 % by the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI). Of the 533 patients, 411 were new patients and 122 were relapsed patients. Almost half of the TB patients in Zhenjiang were from families with higher levels of income. The percentages of TB patients from the low level of household per capita income were 20 % in Zhenjiang and 46 % in Hanzhong .\nDemographic and social characteristics of the 533 TB patients fom Zhenjiang and Hanzhong in 2012, (N/%)\n删除重复语句：<u>Demographic and social characteristics of the 533 TB patients fom Zhenjiang and Hanzhong in 2012, (N/%)</u>\n<mark>Data source: TB patient survey\n\naUEBMI: urban employee basic medical insurance, URBMI: urban resident basic medical insurance, NCMS: new rural cooperative medical system</mark>bHousehold per capital income was classified into three equal parts based on the frequency\nTable 2 showed the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and the payment method of TB treatment from NCMS, in which we found no reimbursement policies or payment methods were drawn specifically for TB treatment in Zhenjaing and Hanzhong. The reimbursement rates for outpatient service ranged from 0 % in Yangzhong to 40 % in Dantu, while 60–90 % for inpatient service in all three counties in Zhenjiang. Patients in Hanzhong can get fixed amounts of reimbursement for outpatient service ranged from 800 CNY in Chenggu to 2500 CNY in Zhenba and the reimbursement rates for inpatient service ranged from 60–80 % in three counties. In addition, inpatients in these six County hospitals should firstly pay the deductible costs and then get the reimbursement with a regulated ceiling cost. Health insurance agency in Jurong regulated the average inpatient ser- vice cost so that it would not be higher than 5500 CNY. And Zhenba also specified that average inpatient service cost should not exceed 8,500 CNY in a tertiary hospital and 3,800 CNY in a secondary hospital.\nDescription of the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and payment method for TB treatment from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Description of the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and payment method for TB treatment from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: health policy documents related to TB prevention and treatment, issues by agencies of New Rural Cooperative Medical System\nAround 55 % of the surveyed TB patients were hospitalized at least once during treatment in each of the two cities. Some 17 % of patients in Zhenjiang and 27 % in Hanzhong experienced more than one hospitalization, with an average of 1.39 admissions per patient. In Zhenjiang, significant differences in hospitalization rates existed between the three counties (83 % in Dantu, 43 % in Jurong and 39 % in Yangzhong, P = 0.000). However, there were no significant differences between the three counties in Hanzhong (63 % in Mianxian, 57 % in Zhenba and 47 % in Chenggu, P = 0.120) .\nAdmission rate and hospitalization times of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Admission rate and hospitalization times of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\naFirst time hospitalization from the database of TB patient survey\nHospitalization rate Pearson Chi-Square: P= 0.000 for three county hospitals in Zhenjiang; P= 0.120 for three county hospitals in Hanzhong\nTable 4 shows the results of the logistic regression analysis with the occurrence of hospitalizations as a dependent variable. Tuberculosis patients covered by the NCMS were more likely to have higher hospitalization rates compared to patients covered by UEBMI (P.E = 1.644, OR= 5.18, P= 0.019). In addition, significant differences were found in the hospitalization rates in three counties in Zhenjiang, and TB patients in Dantu were more likely to be hospitalized. More external associated factors should be explored, as few socio-demographic characteristics of TB patients were associated with hospitalization rate.\nMultivariate analysis of the potential factors that influence admission rates of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Multivariate analysis of the potential factors that influence admission rates of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\nWith the analysis of qualitative interviews, the following were potential factors that drove high TB admission rates. First, although all the studied designated TB hospitals were public hospitals, they needed the revenue from TB care to recover their service costs. The inpatient services were more expensive than outpatient services; therefore, the TB designated hospitals were more likely to admit patients for the monetary benefits. This factor was also confirmed by some stakeholders in the interviews with staff in the CDC:  \"Provided the profit of hospitals, overtreatment and over examination is obvious in designated hospitals, not to mention the inappropriate hospitalizations\" (administers from CDC in Yangzhong). Certainly, this preference for admitting more TB patients was constrained by the availability of hospital beds. With limited hospital beds, hospital administrators had to prioritize the distribution of beds between specialties for maximized revenue. As one health administrator commented, \"Hospitalization rate in XX hospital is not high and indeed this hospital does not have many TB inpatients. The bed utilization rate is often beyond 100 %. We have no extra beds for TB patients as the revenue from inpatient TB treatment is relatively low compared to other inpatient services\" (Inter- view results from local health administrator).\nSecond, many designated hospital managers and TB care providers considered hospitalization to be a control measure for TB infection. Most physicians insisted that hospitalizing TB patients was needed to control infection, especially for those with smear-positive pulmonary TB.  \"Even though tuberculosis is an infectious disease, it is not regarded as a category A infectious disease in China. And it is a good way to reduce the spread of TB by getting the patients, especially those that are smear positive, admitted to hospital\" (a physician in Hanzhong).\nThird, it was reported that the high admission rates of TB patients were due to patient request. One reason re- vealed by these interviews was the high reimbursement rate for inpatient services in the health insurance schemes of NCMS and URBMI.  \"We can get more reimbursement if we are hospitalized compared to the outpatient service\" (patient in Chenggu). Another reason was the fact that TB patients worried about the spread of TB infection within the family and in the community.  \"I worry that my daughter may get infected with tuberculosis as I live together with my daughter and she is going to give birth to a baby. and it is better for me to live separately or just be admitted into the hospital\" (patient in Mianxian). Given the patients’ requests, doctors will admit TB patients in order to avoid conflicts with patients or family members and to avoid the risk of being accused of malpractice if they did not admit the patients. And some health care providers in Zhenjiang expressed that  \"In fact, we should acknowledge that most TB patients bear huge psychological pressure, and when they are diagnosed with tuberculosis, they are afraid of telling the truth to their relatives, neighbors and colleagues. Therefore, patients do not allow us, wearing white coats and masks, to enter their homes or even their neighborhood to complete the follow-up work. So it is reasonable to understand why some patients ask to be hospitalized.\"\nIn addition, the high admission rates for TB patients can be associated with the reimbursement ceiling policy as well. The TB doctors who we interviewed in the designated hospital said,  \"Sometimes we (TB designated hospital) had to pay if the cost (for inpatient services) was beyond the ceiling level. For some serious (TB) patients, we had to discharge them and then have them admitted again later.\" These readmissions could further increase the financial burden on patients because they must pay a deductible for each admission.\nUsing the linked database described above, estimates were made for the average medical cost of TB inpatient services . The results displayed that the inpatient service cost in Zhenjiang was higher than in Hanzhong. At the county level in Zhenjiang, the average medical cost in Jurong was significantly higher than in Dantu and Yangzhong, 7,215 CNY compared to 5,161 CNY and 4,809 CNY, respectively. In Hanzhong, service cost for TB inpatients in Zhenba was highest, 4,644 CNY compared to 3,678 CNY and 3,732 CNY in Chenggu and Mianxian.\nAverage medical costs and average length of stay of the 169 matched TB inpatients from six disignated hospitals in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Average medical costs and average length of stay of the 169 matched TB inpatients from six disignated hospitals in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey and medical records of the designated hospitals, a total of 169 cases were successfully matched\naANOVA for county hospitals: Zhenjiang P= 0.047, significant difference between Dantu vs. Jurong; Hanzhong P= 0.060, significant difference between Chenggu vs. Zhenba, Mianxian vs. Zhenba\nbANOVA for county hospitals: Zhenjiang P= 0.216; Hanzhong P= 0.002, significant difference between Chenggu vs. Mianxian, Chenggu vs. Zhenba\nWith the available quantitative data, we examined the relationship between TB inpatient service cost and the comorbidities based on 845 eligible TB patient medical records from designated hospitals in Jurong and Mianxian. The results showed that lung infection (240 patients, 18.8 %), hemoptysis (95 patients, 7.4 %), tuberculosis pleurisy (93 patients, 7.3 %) and COPD (74 patients. 5.8 %) were among the top ten comorbidities. Almost 79 % of inpatients 通用删除7(英):<u>(665)</u> had more than one recorded comorbidity, while some 23 % 通用删除7(英):<u>(198)</u> had over three . The analytical results further demonstrated that contrary to expectations, there were no statistically significant differences in the inpatient costs, as well as the ALOS, between the patients with and without comorbidities .\nFrequency of comorbidities and the 10 most common comorbidities of TB inpatients in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Frequency of comorbidities and the 10 most common comorbidities of TB inpatients in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012</u>\nData source: medical records from the designated hospital\nAverage length of stay and average medical costs of TB inpatients with and without comorbidity in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Average length of stay and average medical costs of TB inpatients with and without comorbidity in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012</u>\nData source: medical records of the designated hospitals\nAnother factor that could have influenced the cost of inpatient services was ALOS . While the average cost of inpatient service in Jurong was significantly higher than in Dantu and Yangzhong, there was no significant difference in terms of ALOS (P = 0.216). In Hanzhong, the average medical costs among the three counties also varied greatly and there were also significant differences in ALOS (P = 0.002); however, Chenggu county had the longest ALOS with the lowest average cost of inpatient services.\nWe also tried to find the association between the health insurance policies and the inpatient service cost. Average medical costs for TB inpatients in Jurong and Zhenba were 7,215 CNY and 4,644 CNY, which was much higher than the 5,500 CNY and 3,800 CNY limits set by the NCMS.\nIn addition, we explored the factors related to the high inpatient service cost for TB treatment via multiple linear regression analysis. In this analysis, we used the log of the average medical cost for TB inpatient care as the dependent variable and the variables in Table 1 as independent variables. However, in addition to the classification of TB cases, no differences could be found in the other subgroups of TB inpatients, which indicated the power of the sociodemographic characteristics we explored to explain that the great variation in average medical cost was limited.\nIn both cities, the qualitative studies indicated general agreement across CDC staff and designated hospital health care providers that higher inpatient costs were usu- ally associated with treatment of patients with comorbidities, given the potential need for a more expensive drug regimen which would be self-paid.  \"Half of the total cost of outpatient treatment is free to TB patients if they have no complications. And another half of the cost will be reimbursed by the health insurance. TB patients, in fact, just need to pay 25 % of the total cost. But the part paid out-of-pocket by patients will be higher if they have some complications\" (health care providers in Dantu).\nThis study examined the TB patient admission rate as well as the costs of TB inpatient services in the sample study sites. The results suggest that both TB patient admission rate and inpatient service cost are high. This is clearly not in line with government policy under which TB patients in China receive free outpatient care (free first-line anti- TB drugs, three free sputum smears and two chest X-rays) 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. The study also explored the possible factors that associated with TB patient admission rate and TB inpatient service cost. The results showed that the financial incentives, misunderstandings of infectious disease control and failure of health insurance regulation are the main potential factors that associated with the high admission rates and high inpatient service costs of TB patients.\nIn our quantitative study, TB patients covered by the NCMS or those from Dantu were the only factors associated with admission rate in our quantitative analysis. Given that relatively low reimbursement rate for outpatient service in NCMS, it was possible for TB patients to choose inpatient service, which was verified by our qualitative study. In China, NCMS aims to provide health protection over catastrophic illnesses with limited health insurance fund, and therefore, it normally sets relatively high reimbursement rates for inpatient care but low rates for outpatient services 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. In addition, the NCMS reimbursed outpatient expenses much less than the UEBMI and UEBMI. Difference in admission rate for TB patients in Zhenjiang can be attributed to the difference in health care accessibility. Dantu is located in an urban area of Zhenjiang, where there are many better general hospitals than the county level designated hospitals. It is rational for TB patients in Dantu to seek service from some other mu- nicipal hospital, since previous study found that nondesignated general hospitals tend to provide inpatient ser- vice before the referral 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. In contrast, it was due to the limited medical resources that resulted in the lowest admission rate for TB patients in Yangzhong, which was also confirmed by the interviews with hospital manager. In fact, there were only four doctors and eight beds available for TB treatment in the Yangzhong designated hospital.\nThe average medical cost for TB inpatient service was 6171 CNY in Zhenjiang and 3952 CNY in Hanzhong, which were slightly lower than the national average cost, revealed in a cross-sectional study in 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. A potential reason was the limited sample size in this study. In addition, significant differences in medical cost existed among three designated hospitals in Zhenjiang. Results of qualitative study attributed the high medical service costs to the treatment of comorbidities and the extensive use of liver protection drugs. With the limited quantitative data, we failed to analyze the differences in the details and structure of the medical costs among the three counties.\nResults from our qualitative study confirmed that economic incentives was indeed associated with TB patient admission rates and the inpatient service costs, which was also revealed by many other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[13,26]</u>. In China, the profit motive for hospitals and monetary incentives for physicians are closely aligned 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. With the decrease in government funding for public hospitals in China, insurance and patient payments are the main sources of income for health facilities 通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u>. Physicians employed by hospitals are rewarded with bonuses and promotions based on the profits they generate by admitting patients, recommending diagnostic tests, and prescribing medications 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. This undoubtedly encourages physicians to increase earnings by perverse behaviors. Most importantly, as fee-for-service remains standard practice in China, health care providers typically do not face a financial risk from the provisioning of unnecessary services 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. Consistent with another study, we also found disagreement between the designated hospital staff and other stakeholders, such as heads of local CDCs officials in charge of TB control, over the 'profit-orientated’ hospitalizations, which can be attributed to the different funding mechanisms between general hospitals and CDCs 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\nQualitative study also revealed that the high TB patient admission rates was associated with the misunderstanding of infectious disease control. In FGDs with healthcare providers, three physicians from two cities insisted that hospitalization was necessary for the purpose of infection control. In addition, a considerable number of patients in Zhenjiang demanded inpatient services for fear of infecting relatives. Previous studies have concluded that domiciliary treatment is as effective as hospital treatment通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33]</u> and inpatient service often resulted in a greater financial burden on patients which may reduce the likelihood of treatment adherence 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Considering the possibility of nosocomial infections and the cost-effectiveness of patient management, WHO also recommended that TB patients should be managed as outpatients when possible 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>, a position supported by the Chinese government guidelines on TB care described in the introduction. Therefore, health education programs were in need to increase the knowledge of both patients and the population about TB control, which would help limit patents’ unreasonable demand for inpatient care. A previous study had confirmed healthcare providers’ inappropriate behaviors, regarding the irrational use of anti-tuberculosis drugs, overprovisioning of liver protection drugs and frequent lab tests in designated hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. And with regard to healthcare providers’ attitude towards hospitalization, further quantitatively study should focus on the extent to which health care providers followed the standard protocols for TB treatment, such as the admission indicators.\nUnexpectedly, no differences were found between patients with and without comorbidities regarding the cost of inpatient service utilization, which was not consistent with our qualitative findings that physicians attributed the high inpatient service to the treatment of TB-related comorbidity. The observed distribution of comorbidities was similar to that in a previous study of TB patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>. In fact, it is reasonable to conclude these results, as most of the comorbidities of TB patients in our quantitative study were common symptoms, comorbidities or chronic diseases for TB patients and patients did not need inpatient service. Only patients with tuberculosis pleurisy need special treatment, such as pumping fluid by thoracentesis, which would increase financial burden. However, only 7.3 % of the total population gets this disease. Therefore, it seems likely that this reflects unnecessary inpatient treatment of those without comorbidities.\nIn addition, health insurance policies were also associated with TB patient admission rates and inpatient service costs. Firstly, we found almost 27 % of TB inpatients in Hanzhong experienced more than one hospitalization. This result can be explained by the qualitative findings that designated hospital providers in Hanzhong argued because TB inpatients needed long periods of inpatient care and incurred high medical expenses they had no choice but to use multiple admissions. Secondly, the average medical costs in Jurong and Zhenba had exceeded that costs regulated by NCMS. The potential reason was the fact that the regulations were for all patients in a hospital and could not work well to control some specific diseases. Thirdly, most TB patients asked for inpatient service, which also can be explained by the reimbursement policy of NCMS. Even though TB patients can get free outpatient treatment, they still need to pay for other drugs, such as liver protection drugs. And the rural health insurance scheme did not cover much of the patient outpatient costs, which may drove TB patients for hospitalization通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Therefore, the current health insurance policies failed to encourage the designated hospitals and TB patients to provide or seek the appropriate services.\nWith quantitative and qualitative study, we found there were several factors impacting on admission rate of TB patients. Health insurance policies may influence hospital admission. Higher reimbursement rate for inpatient service may lead to higher admission rate. Economic incentive was a big motivation for doctors to make admission decision. Misunderstanding of TB infection may be associated with higher admission rate. However, we didn’t find the differences of inpatient service costs between TB patients with or without comorbidities.\nThere are potential limitations in this study. The quantitative data we collected only allowed us to estimate the admission rates and the costs of inpatient services for TB patients. Most of the results of the potential factors that associated with admission rates and inpatient costs come from qualitative interviews. The contributions of the qualitative analysis were limited. These mixed types of analyses limited our ability to draw any causal conclusions.\nBearing these limitations in mind, the key findings from this study are still relevant and informative to the development and implementation of the current \"TB designated hospital model\" policy in China. Based on the results, we would like to propose the following policy interventions that could potentially curb the high TB patient admission rates and inpatient service costs, and as a result reduce the financial burden on TB patients and increase adherence rates to the standard TB treatment. First, increase TB health care providers’, TB patients’ and the general population’s knowledge about TB infection control through various health education programs. Educational programs will potentially increase the acceptability of treating TB patients at the community level with outpatient services. Second, optimize the current TB financing policies, for example by revising reimbursement and provider payment policies relevant to TB treatment, which may help encourage the designated hospitals to provide appropriate medical services and to control the medical expenditure. Third, improve the quality of TB services by advancing TB treatment guideline development and its implementation through strong supportive monitoring and supervision interventions.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Multilingual abstracts in the six official working languages of the United Nations.

More than 890,000 new and relapse cases emerged in 2012, accounting for 12 % of cases globally – a proportion second only to India通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In order to reduce financial barriers to treatment, the Chinese government introduced the National TB Control Program (NTP) that incorporated the DOTS strategy and removed fee charges for diagnosis and treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Significant improvements have been achieved in the past two decades; the prevalence of smear-positive tuberculosis has fallen by 65 %, bacteriologically positive prevalence declined by 48 %, and prevalence of all pulmonary cases declined by 28 % according to the national tuberculosis prevalence surveys in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Since 2003, China has adopted a \"designated hospital model\" in the eastern part of the country to further improve the quality of TB treatment and patient management, under which selected hospitals undertake both TB outpatient/inpatient services and patient management 通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u>. Recently, policymakers and researchers have being concerned about how the new TB policies will control TB patient admission rates and the cost of TB inpatient services.\nIn fact, the development of anti-TB drugs has revolu- tionized treatment in the 1950s, which led to a dramatic reduction in TB case fatality, and since then both developed and developing countries started to abandon hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Worldwide experiences have demonstrated that it is no longer necessary for TB patients to be isolated from other hospital patients nor from the community with the introduction of short-course chemotherapy and the rapid sterilizing effect of rifampicin in the 1970s 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Moreover, the implementation of DOTS has promoted a standard treatment regimen and high completion rates. With a well-functioning DOTS program, higher cure rates and a lower incidence of adverse reactions can be expected 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u>. The DOTS program advocates the use of outpatient services in most cases, which can reduce the financial burden of treatment. According to the National TB Control Program Guidelines in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>, inpatient services are regarded as essential only for severely ill patients, those with comorbidities or associated conditions and patients with adverse reactions.\nHowever, hospitalization of TB patients is common in China. A study using data collected through a national survey of TB specialized hospitals found that the hospitalization rate of TB patients increased 185.3 % from 1999 to 2009, with an associated increase of inpatient ser- vice cost. This study estimated that the hospitalization rate in 2010 was 29.8 % in eastern China, 35.6 % in central China and 34.6 % in the west 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. In 2011, 60.1 % of TB patients covered by the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NCMS) in Yichang city received inpatient services 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In addition, qualitative research from Zhejiang and Guangxi has estimated that nearly 40 % of general TB patients (without comorbidities) experienced hospitalization in the general hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Previous studies have shown no significant differences between inpatient and outpatient treatment outcomes for TB patients, while inpatient costs were substantially higher通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16]</u>. Tuberculosis inpatients often face high costs, risk of nosocomial infection, loss of income, disruption of family life 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>, low therapy completion 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>, psychosocial burdens and unnecessary drugs and tests beyond those supplied through the national program 通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u>.\nStudies have also found that high treatment costs were associated with higher likelihood of non-adherence 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Adherence to TB treatment is crucial for full recovery and to avoid the emergence of drug resistance. Even though DOTS promotes full compliance, high financial burden can result in patients failing to complete the full course of treatment. Due to irregular treatments, smear-negative patients may become smear-positive up to five years later, sometimes developing multiple drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), in turn, infecting others 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>.\nAs hospitalization is often responsible for the high financial burden on patients and for low adherence rates通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>, it is important to understand the reasons why health care providers often recommend inpatient service rather than outpatient services for TB treatment. This paper pro- vides estimates of admission rates and medical costs of TB inpatients in two cities in China, then explores the factors that are potentially associated with high admission rates via a mixed method. Finally, recommendations are made as to how policy-makers might act to reduce admission rates and the cost of TB inpatient services, limiting the financial burden on TB patients and hence potentially improving treatment adherence.\nEthical approval was issued by the Research Ethics Committee of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the survey and interviews. Data access complied with standard procedure.\nThis study was part of a cross-sectional baseline survey for the China-Gates project Phase II conducted in 2013. We used data obtained in Zhenjiang city of Jiangsu Province in eastern China and Hanzhong city of Shaanxi Province in western China. Counties in each city were grouped into three categories—developed, less developed and least developed according to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2012 and one county from each category was then randomly selected as the study county. Consequently, Yangzhong (105878 CNY), Dantu (83388 CNY) and Jurong (54140 CNY) were selected in Zhengjiang while Mianxian (24900 CNY), Chengg (22444 CNY) and Zhenba (16383 CNY) were selected in Hanzhong.\nWe carried out a patient survey in the three selected counties to investigate the inpatient service utilization of TB patients. In each county, three townships/streets were randomly selected and, in each, 30 TB cases were randomly selected from the TB case registration list. Patient survey primarily focused on those patients who did not have MDR-TB, started TB treatment in 2012 and completed the treatment or stopped treatment before the survey (April 2013). The content of the questionnaire primarily included socio-economic information of TB patients, pathways of seeking TB care, utilization of services, and medical costs. TB patients were all invited to the township hospital to be interviewed by trained medical students from Nanjing Medical University and Xi’an Jiaotong University. In total, 267 TB patients in Zhenjiang and 270 in Hanzhong completed the questionnaire, and after cleaning cases with missing values, 263 completed questionnaires in Zhenjiang and 270 in Hanzhong were valid.\nMedical records of TB inpatients between 2010 and 2012, where the primary diagnosis for hospital admission was TB, were collected in six county TB designated hospitals. The main variables of interest in these records were patient age and sex, health insurance coverage, diagnoses at dates of admission and discharge, length of stay, treatment details and related service costs.\nKey Informant Interviews (KII) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were used to explore the perceptions of stakeholders on the provision and utilization of TB inpatient care. A purposive sampling method was adopted to select the interviewees and FGD participants. All qualitative interviews lasted from fifty to eighty minutes and were both video- and audio- recorded with permission. Semi-structured KIIs were conducted with local health administrators, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) heads in charge of TB control, CDC TB control unit leaders, heads of TB designated hospitals and local health insurance managers. A total of forty KIIs were completed and all KIIs were conducted in the offices of the interviewees. These KIIs focused on the financial burden on TB patients, patient treatment adherence, health insurance regulation on service provision, perceptions of the provision of TB diagnosis and treatment care, TB diagnosis and treatment practices and payment methods for TB treatment. In addition, fourteen focus groups were formed (eight for TB care providers and six for TB patients), taking place at the designated hospitals. Each TB care provider FGD was comprised of doctors and nurses who treated TB, head of TB units, lab staff and administrative staff associated with TB diagnosis and treatment with 8–10 participants per group on average. The topics for these frontline health care workers covered financial burden on TB patients, patients’ adherence to the treatment, regulation of service provision set by the health insurance agency and its impact on service provision, and doctors’ adherence to the TB practice guideline. The six TB patient FGDs revealed differences in the age and gender of TB patients, treatment experience (inpatient and/or outpatient), financial situation, and classification of TB (new or relapsed cases) with 6–8 participants per group on average. The main points of these discussions for TB patients mainly included: experience with TB treatment; financial burden of TB treatment and its impact on family life; satisfaction with the service provision; perception of TB and MDR-TB infection; reimbursement from health insurance.\nWe collected the local policy documents relating to health insurance regulations and reimbursement policies from the county level and municipal level health bureaus and health insurance offices.\nUnivariate and multivariate analyses were applied to analyze the quantitative data. Firstly, with the patient sur- vey data, we estimated the admission rate which was defined as the proportion of surveyed patients admitted to the hospital. A binary logistic regression was used to explore the association between these six characteristics of TB patients (gender, age, social health insurance, classification of TB cases, household per capital income and sample sites) and the occurrence of hospitalization by computing odds ratios (ORs), which can be adjusted for each of their effects. Secondly, we linked patient surveys with the inpatient medical records by patient name in order to have precise information on the utilization of inpatient service. We successfully matched 271 cases (169 cases from county level designated hospitals and 102 from municipal level hospitals). In the linked database, ANOVA was used to find difference in average length of stay (ALOS) and average medical cost among the counties in the two study cities. Associations between the characteristics of TB patients and the average medical costs were estimated by multiple linear regression analysis, in which the log of the average medical cost was the dependent variable as the data were skewed. Thirdly, with the database of medical records, TB inpatients were categorized as with or without comorbidities as defined by their treatment history. ALOS and average medical cost of inpatient treatment were compared between these two groups. The criterion for significance was set at P > 0.05 based on a two-sided test.\nFor the qualitative data, all tape-recorded qualitative resources were firstly transcribed by the medical students, then read by the interviewers. Secondly, a thematic framework analysis approach was used to systematically analyze the potential reasons for hospitalization and the TB inpatient service cost. The themes were identified by the interviewers based on the transcripts and their topic guides. Inductive codes were then developed and used to cataloged all the transcripts. Thirdly, the Nvivo10 software package, a computer-assisted qualitative analysis program, was employed to manage the qualitative data. For the fairness and accuracy of the study, verbatim quotations were used in the transcripts of different stakeholders and all qualitative data were coded and then categorized carefully. In addition, a team approach was used in coding, sorting and classifying these qualitative data, which provided a form of researchers’ triangulation. Charting was used to identify common and divergent perceptions. Explanations of the emergent patterns in this data were developed.\nIn addition, we reviewed local policy documents and summarized the policies related to service provision and reimbursement specifically for TB patients, such as regu- lation of average medical cost for inpatient service, payment method for TB service provision, and reimbursement rates of outpatient and inpatient services.\nSurvey data was obtained for 533 TB patients (263 in Zhenjiang, 270 in Hanzhong). About 57 % of patients from Zhenjiang and 48 % of those from Hanzhong were aged 60 and above, while the proportions of those under 30 were 5.7 and 5.2 % in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong respectively. A large majority were men (73 % in Zhenjiang, 78 % in Hanzhong). Almost 87 % were covered by the NCMS (82 % in Zhenjiang, 92 % in Hanzhong), 8.8 % by the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), and 2.6 % by the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI). Of the 533 patients, 411 were new patients and 122 were relapsed patients. Almost half of the TB patients in Zhenjiang were from families with higher levels of income. The percentages of TB patients from the low level of household per capita income were 20 % in Zhenjiang and 46 % in Hanzhong .\nDemographic and social characteristics of the 533 TB patients fom Zhenjiang and Hanzhong in 2012, (N/%)\n删除重复语句：<u>Demographic and social characteristics of the 533 TB patients fom Zhenjiang and Hanzhong in 2012, (N/%)</u>\n<mark>Data source: TB patient survey\n\naUEBMI: urban employee basic medical insurance, URBMI: urban resident basic medical insurance, NCMS: new rural cooperative medical system</mark>bHousehold per capital income was classified into three equal parts based on the frequency\nTable 2 showed the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and the payment method of TB treatment from NCMS, in which we found no reimbursement policies or payment methods were drawn specifically for TB treatment in Zhenjaing and Hanzhong. The reimbursement rates for outpatient service ranged from 0 % in Yangzhong to 40 % in Dantu, while 60–90 % for inpatient service in all three counties in Zhenjiang. Patients in Hanzhong can get fixed amounts of reimbursement for outpatient service ranged from 800 CNY in Chenggu to 2500 CNY in Zhenba and the reimbursement rates for inpatient service ranged from 60–80 % in three counties. In addition, inpatients in these six County hospitals should firstly pay the deductible costs and then get the reimbursement with a regulated ceiling cost. Health insurance agency in Jurong regulated the average inpatient ser- vice cost so that it would not be higher than 5500 CNY. And Zhenba also specified that average inpatient service cost should not exceed 8,500 CNY in a tertiary hospital and 3,800 CNY in a secondary hospital.\nDescription of the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and payment method for TB treatment from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Description of the health insurance policies related to the reimbursement and payment method for TB treatment from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: health policy documents related to TB prevention and treatment, issues by agencies of New Rural Cooperative Medical System\nAround 55 % of the surveyed TB patients were hospitalized at least once during treatment in each of the two cities. Some 17 % of patients in Zhenjiang and 27 % in Hanzhong experienced more than one hospitalization, with an average of 1.39 admissions per patient. In Zhenjiang, significant differences in hospitalization rates existed between the three counties (83 % in Dantu, 43 % in Jurong and 39 % in Yangzhong, P = 0.000). However, there were no significant differences between the three counties in Hanzhong (63 % in Mianxian, 57 % in Zhenba and 47 % in Chenggu, P = 0.120) .\nAdmission rate and hospitalization times of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Admission rate and hospitalization times of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\naFirst time hospitalization from the database of TB patient survey\nHospitalization rate Pearson Chi-Square: P= 0.000 for three county hospitals in Zhenjiang; P= 0.120 for three county hospitals in Hanzhong\nTable 4 shows the results of the logistic regression analysis with the occurrence of hospitalizations as a dependent variable. Tuberculosis patients covered by the NCMS were more likely to have higher hospitalization rates compared to patients covered by UEBMI (P.E = 1.644, OR= 5.18, P= 0.019). In addition, significant differences were found in the hospitalization rates in three counties in Zhenjiang, and TB patients in Dantu were more likely to be hospitalized. More external associated factors should be explored, as few socio-demographic characteristics of TB patients were associated with hospitalization rate.\nMultivariate analysis of the potential factors that influence admission rates of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Multivariate analysis of the potential factors that influence admission rates of the 533 TB patients from six counties in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey\nWith the analysis of qualitative interviews, the following were potential factors that drove high TB admission rates. First, although all the studied designated TB hospitals were public hospitals, they needed the revenue from TB care to recover their service costs. The inpatient services were more expensive than outpatient services; therefore, the TB designated hospitals were more likely to admit patients for the monetary benefits. This factor was also confirmed by some stakeholders in the interviews with staff in the CDC:  \"Provided the profit of hospitals, overtreatment and over examination is obvious in designated hospitals, not to mention the inappropriate hospitalizations\" (administers from CDC in Yangzhong). Certainly, this preference for admitting more TB patients was constrained by the availability of hospital beds. With limited hospital beds, hospital administrators had to prioritize the distribution of beds between specialties for maximized revenue. As one health administrator commented, \"Hospitalization rate in XX hospital is not high and indeed this hospital does not have many TB inpatients. The bed utilization rate is often beyond 100 %. We have no extra beds for TB patients as the revenue from inpatient TB treatment is relatively low compared to other inpatient services\" (Inter- view results from local health administrator).\nSecond, many designated hospital managers and TB care providers considered hospitalization to be a control measure for TB infection. Most physicians insisted that hospitalizing TB patients was needed to control infection, especially for those with smear-positive pulmonary TB.  \"Even though tuberculosis is an infectious disease, it is not regarded as a category A infectious disease in China. And it is a good way to reduce the spread of TB by getting the patients, especially those that are smear positive, admitted to hospital\" (a physician in Hanzhong).\nThird, it was reported that the high admission rates of TB patients were due to patient request. One reason re- vealed by these interviews was the high reimbursement rate for inpatient services in the health insurance schemes of NCMS and URBMI.  \"We can get more reimbursement if we are hospitalized compared to the outpatient service\" (patient in Chenggu). Another reason was the fact that TB patients worried about the spread of TB infection within the family and in the community.  \"I worry that my daughter may get infected with tuberculosis as I live together with my daughter and she is going to give birth to a baby. and it is better for me to live separately or just be admitted into the hospital\" (patient in Mianxian). Given the patients’ requests, doctors will admit TB patients in order to avoid conflicts with patients or family members and to avoid the risk of being accused of malpractice if they did not admit the patients. And some health care providers in Zhenjiang expressed that  \"In fact, we should acknowledge that most TB patients bear huge psychological pressure, and when they are diagnosed with tuberculosis, they are afraid of telling the truth to their relatives, neighbors and colleagues. Therefore, patients do not allow us, wearing white coats and masks, to enter their homes or even their neighborhood to complete the follow-up work. So it is reasonable to understand why some patients ask to be hospitalized.\"\nIn addition, the high admission rates for TB patients can be associated with the reimbursement ceiling policy as well. The TB doctors who we interviewed in the designated hospital said,  \"Sometimes we (TB designated hospital) had to pay if the cost (for inpatient services) was beyond the ceiling level. For some serious (TB) patients, we had to discharge them and then have them admitted again later.\" These readmissions could further increase the financial burden on patients because they must pay a deductible for each admission.\nUsing the linked database described above, estimates were made for the average medical cost of TB inpatient services . The results displayed that the inpatient service cost in Zhenjiang was higher than in Hanzhong. At the county level in Zhenjiang, the average medical cost in Jurong was significantly higher than in Dantu and Yangzhong, 7,215 CNY compared to 5,161 CNY and 4,809 CNY, respectively. In Hanzhong, service cost for TB inpatients in Zhenba was highest, 4,644 CNY compared to 3,678 CNY and 3,732 CNY in Chenggu and Mianxian.\nAverage medical costs and average length of stay of the 169 matched TB inpatients from six disignated hospitals in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Average medical costs and average length of stay of the 169 matched TB inpatients from six disignated hospitals in Zhenjiang and Hanzhong, respectively, in 2012</u>\nData source: TB patient survey and medical records of the designated hospitals, a total of 169 cases were successfully matched\naANOVA for county hospitals: Zhenjiang P= 0.047, significant difference between Dantu vs. Jurong; Hanzhong P= 0.060, significant difference between Chenggu vs. Zhenba, Mianxian vs. Zhenba\nbANOVA for county hospitals: Zhenjiang P= 0.216; Hanzhong P= 0.002, significant difference between Chenggu vs. Mianxian, Chenggu vs. Zhenba\nWith the available quantitative data, we examined the relationship between TB inpatient service cost and the comorbidities based on 845 eligible TB patient medical records from designated hospitals in Jurong and Mianxian. The results showed that lung infection (240 patients, 18.8 %), hemoptysis (95 patients, 7.4 %), tuberculosis pleurisy (93 patients, 7.3 %) and COPD (74 patients. 5.8 %) were among the top ten comorbidities. Almost 79 % of inpatients 通用删除7(英):<u>(665)</u> had more than one recorded comorbidity, while some 23 % 通用删除7(英):<u>(198)</u> had over three . The analytical results further demonstrated that contrary to expectations, there were no statistically significant differences in the inpatient costs, as well as the ALOS, between the patients with and without comorbidities .\nFrequency of comorbidities and the 10 most common comorbidities of TB inpatients in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Frequency of comorbidities and the 10 most common comorbidities of TB inpatients in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012</u>\nData source: medical records from the designated hospital\nAverage length of stay and average medical costs of TB inpatients with and without comorbidity in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012\n删除重复语句：<u>Average length of stay and average medical costs of TB inpatients with and without comorbidity in designated hospitals of Jurong and Mianxian from 2010 to 2012</u>\n<mark>Data source: medical records of the designated hospitals</mark>\nAnother factor that could have influenced the cost of inpatient services was ALOS . While the average cost of inpatient service in Jurong was significantly higher than in Dantu and Yangzhong, there was no significant difference in terms of ALOS (P = 0.216). In Hanzhong, the average medical costs among the three counties also varied greatly and there were also significant differences in ALOS (P = 0.002); however, Chenggu county had the longest ALOS with the lowest average cost of inpatient services.\nWe also tried to find the association between the health insurance policies and the inpatient service cost. Average medical costs for TB inpatients in Jurong and Zhenba were 7,215 CNY and 4,644 CNY, which was much higher than the 5,500 CNY and 3,800 CNY limits set by the NCMS.\nIn addition, we explored the factors related to the high inpatient service cost for TB treatment via multiple linear regression analysis. In this analysis, we used the log of the average medical cost for TB inpatient care as the dependent variable and the variables in Table 1 as independent variables. However, in addition to the classification of TB cases, no differences could be found in the other subgroups of TB inpatients, which indicated the power of the sociodemographic characteristics we explored to explain that the great variation in average medical cost was limited.\nIn both cities, the qualitative studies indicated general agreement across CDC staff and designated hospital health care providers that higher inpatient costs were usu- ally associated with treatment of patients with comorbidities, given the potential need for a more expensive drug regimen which would be self-paid.  \"Half of the total cost of outpatient treatment is free to TB patients if they have no complications. And another half of the cost will be reimbursed by the health insurance. TB patients, in fact, just need to pay 25 % of the total cost. But the part paid out-of-pocket by patients will be higher if they have some complications\" (health care providers in Dantu).\nThis study examined the TB patient admission rate as well as the costs of TB inpatient services in the sample study sites. The results suggest that both TB patient admission rate and inpatient service cost are high. This is clearly not in line with government policy under which TB patients in China receive free outpatient care (free first-line anti- TB drugs, three free sputum smears and two chest X-rays) 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. The study also explored the possible factors that associated with TB patient admission rate and TB inpatient service cost. The results showed that the financial incentives, misunderstandings of infectious disease control and failure of health insurance regulation are the main potential factors that associated with the high admission rates and high inpatient service costs of TB patients.\nIn our quantitative study, TB patients covered by the NCMS or those from Dantu were the only factors associated with admission rate in our quantitative analysis. Given that relatively low reimbursement rate for outpatient service in NCMS, it was possible for TB patients to choose inpatient service, which was verified by our qualitative study. In China, NCMS aims to provide health protection over catastrophic illnesses with limited health insurance fund, and therefore, it normally sets relatively high reimbursement rates for inpatient care but low rates for outpatient services 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. In addition, the NCMS reimbursed outpatient expenses much less than the UEBMI and UEBMI. Difference in admission rate for TB patients in Zhenjiang can be attributed to the difference in health care accessibility. Dantu is located in an urban area of Zhenjiang, where there are many better general hospitals than the county level designated hospitals. It is rational for TB patients in Dantu to seek service from some other mu- nicipal hospital, since previous study found that nondesignated general hospitals tend to provide inpatient ser- vice before the referral 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>. In contrast, it was due to the limited medical resources that resulted in the lowest admission rate for TB patients in Yangzhong, which was also confirmed by the interviews with hospital manager. In fact, there were only four doctors and eight beds available for TB treatment in the Yangzhong designated hospital.\nThe average medical cost for TB inpatient service was 6171 CNY in Zhenjiang and 3952 CNY in Hanzhong, which were slightly lower than the national average cost, revealed in a cross-sectional study in 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. A potential reason was the limited sample size in this study. In addition, significant differences in medical cost existed among three designated hospitals in Zhenjiang. Results of qualitative study attributed the high medical service costs to the treatment of comorbidities and the extensive use of liver protection drugs. With the limited quantitative data, we failed to analyze the differences in the details and structure of the medical costs among the three counties.\nResults from our qualitative study confirmed that economic incentives was indeed associated with TB patient admission rates and the inpatient service costs, which was also revealed by many other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[13,26]</u>. In China, the profit motive for hospitals and monetary incentives for physicians are closely aligned 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. With the decrease in government funding for public hospitals in China, insurance and patient payments are the main sources of income for health facilities 通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u>. Physicians employed by hospitals are rewarded with bonuses and promotions based on the profits they generate by admitting patients, recommending diagnostic tests, and prescribing medications 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. This undoubtedly encourages physicians to increase earnings by perverse behaviors. Most importantly, as fee-for-service remains standard practice in China, health care providers typically do not face a financial risk from the provisioning of unnecessary services 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. Consistent with another study, we also found disagreement between the designated hospital staff and other stakeholders, such as heads of local CDCs officials in charge of TB control, over the 'profit-orientated’ hospitalizations, which can be attributed to the different funding mechanisms between general hospitals and CDCs 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\nQualitative study also revealed that the high TB patient admission rates was associated with the misunderstanding of infectious disease control. In FGDs with healthcare providers, three physicians from two cities insisted that hospitalization was necessary for the purpose of infection control. In addition, a considerable number of patients in Zhenjiang demanded inpatient services for fear of infecting relatives. Previous studies have concluded that domiciliary treatment is as effective as hospital treatment通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33]</u> and inpatient service often resulted in a greater financial burden on patients which may reduce the likelihood of treatment adherence 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. Considering the possibility of nosocomial infections and the cost-effectiveness of patient management, WHO also recommended that TB patients should be managed as outpatients when possible 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>, a position supported by the Chinese government guidelines on TB care described in the introduction. Therefore, health education programs were in need to increase the knowledge of both patients and the population about TB control, which would help limit patents’ unreasonable demand for inpatient care. A previous study had confirmed healthcare providers’ inappropriate behaviors, regarding the irrational use of anti-tuberculosis drugs, overprovisioning of liver protection drugs and frequent lab tests in designated hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. And with regard to healthcare providers’ attitude towards hospitalization, further quantitatively study should focus on the extent to which health care providers followed the standard protocols for TB treatment, such as the admission indicators.\nUnexpectedly, no differences were found between patients with and without comorbidities regarding the cost of inpatient service utilization, which was not consistent with our qualitative findings that physicians attributed the high inpatient service to the treatment of TB-related comorbidity. The observed distribution of comorbidities was similar to that in a previous study of TB patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u>. In fact, it is reasonable to conclude these results, as most of the comorbidities of TB patients in our quantitative study were common symptoms, comorbidities or chronic diseases for TB patients and patients did not need inpatient service. Only patients with tuberculosis pleurisy need special treatment, such as pumping fluid by thoracentesis, which would increase financial burden. However, only 7.3 % of the total population gets this disease. Therefore, it seems likely that this reflects unnecessary inpatient treatment of those without comorbidities.\nIn addition, health insurance policies were also associated with TB patient admission rates and inpatient service costs. Firstly, we found almost 27 % of TB inpatients in Hanzhong experienced more than one hospitalization. This result can be explained by the qualitative findings that designated hospital providers in Hanzhong argued because TB inpatients needed long periods of inpatient care and incurred high medical expenses they had no choice but to use multiple admissions. Secondly, the average medical costs in Jurong and Zhenba had exceeded that costs regulated by NCMS. The potential reason was the fact that the regulations were for all patients in a hospital and could not work well to control some specific diseases. Thirdly, most TB patients asked for inpatient service, which also can be explained by the reimbursement policy of NCMS. Even though TB patients can get free outpatient treatment, they still need to pay for other drugs, such as liver protection drugs. And the rural health insurance scheme did not cover much of the patient outpatient costs, which may drove TB patients for hospitalization通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Therefore, the current health insurance policies failed to encourage the designated hospitals and TB patients to provide or seek the appropriate services.\nWith quantitative and qualitative study, we found there were several factors impacting on admission rate of TB patients. Health insurance policies may influence hospital admission. Higher reimbursement rate for inpatient service may lead to higher admission rate. Economic incentive was a big motivation for doctors to make admission decision. Misunderstanding of TB infection may be associated with higher admission rate. However, we didn’t find the differences of inpatient service costs between TB patients with or without comorbidities.\nThere are potential limitations in this study. The quantitative data we collected only allowed us to estimate the admission rates and the costs of inpatient services for TB patients. Most of the results of the potential factors that associated with admission rates and inpatient costs come from qualitative interviews. The contributions of the qualitative analysis were limited. These mixed types of analyses limited our ability to draw any causal conclusions.\nBearing these limitations in mind, the key findings from this study are still relevant and informative to the development and implementation of the current \"TB designated hospital model\" policy in China. Based on the results, we would like to propose the following policy interventions that could potentially curb the high TB patient admission rates and inpatient service costs, and as a result reduce the financial burden on TB patients and increase adherence rates to the standard TB treatment. First, increase TB health care providers’, TB patients’ and the general population’s knowledge about TB infection control through various health education programs. Educational programs will potentially increase the acceptability of treating TB patients at the community level with outpatient services. Second, optimize the current TB financing policies, for example by revising reimbursement and provider payment policies relevant to TB treatment, which may help encourage the designated hospitals to provide appropriate medical services and to control the medical expenditure. Third, improve the quality of TB services by advancing TB treatment guideline development and its implementation through strong supportive monitoring and supervision interventions.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Multilingual abstracts in the six official working languages of the United Nations.

The surgical and perfusion techniques, as well as the postoperative care, have advanced and evolved since that time. Despite that evolution, the two concepts of surgical interventions had remained the same. There is still much debate on what is the ideal surgical approach to infants with TOF, an early primary surgical repair (EPSR) versus a two-staged surgical approach with either an initial temporary shunt for pulmonary blood flow or transcatheter cardiac palliation. The aim of this study was to determine if one strategy had lower mortality than the other and to assess the hospital length of stay and cost of charge in the study groups.\nThe data were obtained from the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample, part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. This is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient care database in the United States, containing data from more than seven million hospital stays each year.删除4：<u>4</u> The National Inpatient Sample database randomly samples 20% of the discharges from participating hospitals in 47 US states and the District of Columbia. The sampling method provides a geographically distributed sample that represents all inpatient admissions in the nation.\nThe study population was identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9&10-CM). Data were queried from the years 2010-2018. Neonates (age < 30 days) with the diagnosis of TOF were included in the study. These patients were further stratified into the following groups: no intervention, complete EPSR, or palliative intervention (PI) group. The PI group was further divided into (systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt [SPS], or transcatheter palliation [TCP] intervention on the pulmonary valve or ductus arteriosus stent). The primary outcome is the in-hospital mortality between the patients who underwent repair in the neonatal period versus those who underwent PI in the neonatal period. The secondary outcomes include the length of hospital stay and the hospital cost of charge.\nContinuous variables were described using the median and interquartile range. Categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. The analysis was performed by SPSS software, version 25.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis.\nWe identified 29 292 neonates with TOF, neonates who needed intervention during the first 30 days of life were found to be 6089 (20.8%). Of those, 1726 (28.4%) had EPSR and 4363 (71.7%) had PI. The PI group included 2661 neonates with SPS and 1702 who had TCP. The basic characteristics and outcomes of groups are shown in Table 1. The majority of these patients were males, TCP (55.2%), SPS (54.9%), and EPSR (57.3%). Neonates with PI had higher frequency of diagnoses chromosomal abnormalities (TCP 12.0%, SPS 13.5%, vs. EPSR 7.8%, P < 0.001). Other non-cardiac anomalies were present at higher frequency in EPSR group (EPSR 21.9% vs. SPS 18.9%, P = 0.016). Patients who had PI had higher rate of prematurity (< 37 weeks gestation: TCP 15.6 %, SPS 14.8 %, vs. EPSR 10.4%, P < 0.001) and higher frequency of low birth weight (birth weight < 2500 g: TCP 16.1%, SPS 15.0% vs. EPSR 10.3%, P < 0.001). Hospital mortality was similar in both groups (TCP 6.9%, SPS 7.7%, vs. EPSR 8.0%, P = 0.210). Mechanical ventilation was used more frequently in the patients with EPSR (EPSR 50.4% vs. TCP 46.4%, P = 0.018). The length of hospital stay was the shortest in the TCP versus the other two groups (EPSR 25 d, SPS 21 d vs. TCP 16 d, P < 0.001). The cost of charge was significantly lower in the TCP than in the other two groups (EPSR $ 312 405, SPS $ 248 362 vs. TCP $ 162 927, P < 0.001). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation utilization was lowest in the TCP (TCP 1.8% vs. EPSR 4.6% and SPS 4.5%, P < 0.001).\nCharacteristics and outcomes of Tetralogy of Fallot in neonates\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics and outcomes of Tetralogy of Fallot in neonates</u>\nData are shown as n (%) or median (IQR). †Early primary surgical repair vs. transcatheter palliation. ‡Early primary surgical repair vs. systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt. §Transcatheter palliation vs. systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt. ns, not significant; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\nThere is still much debate about the management of symptomatic neonates with TOF, a two-staged repair (the initial stage of securing a source of pulmonary blood flow followed by a later stage of a full repair) versus an early (neonatal) primary surgical repair. This study’s goal was to compare the outcomes of these two approaches, we evaluated 6089 neonates with TOF who either had an EPSR (1726, 28.4%) versus 4363 neonates (71.7%) who had a PI (aortopulmonary shunt, or cardiac catheter intervention on pulmonary valve or ductus arteriosus stenting). In this study, in-hospital mortality is similar between the groups (EPSR vs. TCP, SPS) but the EPSR approach comes with higher resource utilization (prolonged hospital stay, higher frequency of mechanical ventilation, and higher cost of charge). It is important to mention that the resource utilization includes only the index hospitalization, however, a two-staged approach requires another hospitalization for full repair, therefore the cumulative morbidity and mortality of PI could be higher. There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach, an EPSR would restore normal cardiovascular anatomy and physiology, resolve chronic cyanosis and promote neurodevelopment during the critical period of brain growth in early infancy. EPSR would also relieve the right ventricular afterload and allow for early myocardial remodeling. Early repair may also restore the normal development of pulmonary vasculature and alveologenesis in patients with diminished pulmonary perfusion.删除4：<u>5</u> The advantages of a two-staged repair are mainly avoiding potential organ damage with neonatal open-heart surgery and allowing for time to attain somatic growth and organ maturity prior to the utilization of cardiopulmonary bypass in the second stage. The risks associated with SPS are well described and they include shunt thrombosis, pulmonary artery distortion, excess volume load on the pulmonary vasculature and the left ventricle with potential pulmonary vasculature disease and congestive heart failure.删除4：<u>6,7,8,9</u> In this study we are comparing approaches in symptomatic neonates with TOF who needed an intervention during the 30 days of life, we are not comparing EPSR versus late surgical repair, previous studies had shown that primary surgical repair at a later age in infancy in asymptomatic TOF patients carries less morbidity and mortality than neonatal surgical repair.删除4：<u>10,11</u>\nWe used data from a large multicenter national database that randomly samples 20% of the discharges from hospitals across the United States with both a large number of patients and a wide range of practice variations, this allowed us to evaluate the surgical management in neonates with TOF. An important finding on the current surgical practice of TOF is that only 28.4% of neonates had an early complete surgical repair, which eludes that the majority of centers prefer PI rather than early surgical repair in neonates with TOF. We also noted a patient selection bias in this retrospective study, we find that hospitals in the United States are inclined to use a PI in patients with significant comorbidities such as low birth weight, prematurity, and chromosomal anomalies. The only comorbidity that was present at a higher frequency in the EPSR was the presence of other non-cardiac anomalies. We also found that patients with TCP had overall superior outcomes compared to SPS although having similar comorbidities. A recent study from the UK examined infants with TOF, the study showed that those who have intervention at an age less than 60 days outcomes had more favorable outcomes if they had a right ventricular outflow tract catheter intervention than SPS and EPSR.删除4：<u>12</u>\nThere are several limitations to this study, we were not able to assess long-term outcomes, specifically, which group will have a better neurological outcome and which group will have a better right ventricular function. We used an administrative database, and the study relied on the ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis and procedure codes for identifying the study population and the associated comorbidities. Some limitations are inherent to all retrospective studies using administrative databases. Incorrect or missing data may exist and the lack of validation of the data collected by chart review is a source of potential bias for errors. However, in a large study such as ours, the patients’ volume likely offset these inaccuracies.\nIn conclusion, the EPSR of neonates with TOF had similar in-hospital mortality to neonates with TOF who received PI. The resource utilization was much higher in the EPSR but this included only the index hospitalization, however, a two-staged approach requires another hospitalization for full repair, therefore the cumulative morbidity and mortality of PI could be higher. A future prospective randomized study with long-term follow-up is needed to further answer if early neonatal surgical repair is the ideal approach for symptomatic neonates with TOF who are not amenable to transcatheter cardiac PI.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:01:36", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:02:30", "cost": 53.892}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:33", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:02:28", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:01:34"}

The study participants were randomly assigned to a control (saline) group, a lidocaine group, or an esmolol and lidocaine (EL) group using a computerized random sequence generator program . The investigator who was involved in drug administration was blinded to group allocation. A nonblinded nurse prepared the study drugs in the recovery room and handed syringes containing the drugs to the investigator. Drug administration and patient evaluation were performed by a single investigator.\nAll patients received intramuscular injections of glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg as premedication. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and the SpO2 level were monitored, and thiopental 5 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg were administered immediately prior to induction. Vital signs were then checked at 5-minute intervals. At intubation, esmolol 0.5 mg/kg was injected intravenously and anesthesia was maintained with 2% sevoflurane in a mixture of oxygen and air (FiO2 0.5) and maintenance of normocapnia. Dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg was injected before surgery. The inhalation anesthetic levels were elevated or nicardipine was administered if the patient’s blood pressure (BP) or heart rate rose by >25% of the baseline value, and atropine 0.01 mg/kg was administered if bradycardia developed. All patients received 1:4 saline dextrose.\nThe control group received saline at a volume equivalent to that of 1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine at the end of surgery and saline at a volume equivalent to that of 0.5 mg/kg of esmolol when they started to move voluntarily. The lidocaine group received 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine intravenously at the end of surgery and saline at a volume equivalent to that of 0.5 mg/kg of esmolol when they started to move voluntarily after the gas was turned off. The EL group received 1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine at the end of surgery and 0.5 mg/kg of esmolol when they started to move voluntarily after the gas was turned off. The esmolol dose used in this study was determined from the dose administered when esmolol is used as an adjunct to opioids, which is generally 0.5 mg/kg.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> The lidocaine dose was determined based on reports of lidocaine being effective in reducing airway stimulation when administered at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg.通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14]</u> The primary outcome was the effect of esmolol and lidocaine on the severity of postoperative agitation in children who have received sevoflurane anesthesia. The secondary outcomes were vital signs, severity of pain, amount of fentanyl used, extubation time, and recovery time. All patients were monitored from the end of surgery to the time of discharge from the recovery room.\nAgitation was measured using the objective pain score (OPS), Cole 5-point score (CPS), and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1, Table 2, Table 3]</u>, starting when the patients awoke from anesthesia and initiated spontaneous breathing at 6 to 8 ml/kg. Even though the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale is typically used to measure agitation in children, we opted to use the OPS instead because the children’s eyes were covered, thereby preventing use of the PAED scale. Although the OPS is an instrument that measures pain, given a report 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> showing that an OPS score of ≥4 is similar to the 4-point PAED scale item \"The child is restless\" while a score of 5 means \"The child is inconsolable,\" we decided that an OPS score of ≥4 indicated agitation rather than a pain response and, strabismus surgery is known to be associated with little pain.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Thus, we determined that the OPS would be useful for measuring agitation.\nThe Objective pain score (OPS).\n删除重复语句：<u>The Objective pain score (OPS).</u>\nThe cole 5-point scale (CPS) score.\n删除重复语句：<u>The cole 5-point scale (CPS) score.</u>\nRichmond agitation and sedation scale (RASS).\n删除重复语句：<u>Richmond agitation and sedation scale (RASS).</u>\nAll patients were extubated and transferred to the recovery room when spontaneous breathing at 5 to 8 ml/kg was stable and head elevation was possible. The extubation time was the interval between the completion of surgery and extubation. The recovery time was the interval between arrival in and departure from the recovery room after recovering from anesthesia. The OPS, CPS, and RASS were applied; heart rate, BP, and blood oxygen saturation were measured on arrival in the recovery room and at 10 and 30 min after arrival. When the objective OPS score was 3 to 4 for up to 10 min after arrival in the recovery room, verbal sedation was attempted, given that the symptoms were not considered to be pain responses but rather agitation after awaking from anesthesia. Symptoms were considered to be pain responses if verbal sedation failed, and fentanyl 1 μg/kg was administered after 10 min.\nIn the study by Cao et al,通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> the results were statistically significant when OPS scores differed by more than two points, and they calculated that the number of patients required for an alpha of 0.5, a beta of 0.1 (power of 90%), and a dropout rate of 20% would be 28. The incidence of severe agitation was 30% in that study. Based on the values of OPS in the control group [median (range), 2 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–6)</u>; mean ± standard deviation (SD), 2 ± 1.5] and dexmedetomidine group [median (range), 0 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–7)</u>; mean ± SD, 0 ± 1.75] in the previous study,通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> the sample size was calculated using the Bonferroni method. First, we assessed the descriptive summary statistics (the mean ± SD values for age, weight, operating time, duration of anesthesia, and extubation and recovery times; sex distributions and proportion of patients who received fentanyl; and the median OPS, CPS, and RASS scores). The three study groups were compared using the Pearson chi-square test, the Bonferroni method, analysis of variance (ANOVA), or the Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software . All tests were two-tailed and a P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 shows the CONSORT flow diagram for the pediatric patients in this study.

Compared to the Control group, the EL group had a significantly lower incidence (P= 0.01), and when compared to the Lidocine group, the EL group also had a significantly greater reduction of incidence (P= 0.00). Although the Lidocaine group had a higher incidence, there was no statistically difference in incidence between the Lidocaine group and Control group (P= 0.515).\nThere was no statistically significant between-group difference in patients’ age (P= 0.085), weight (P= 0.369), sex (P= 0.784), operation duration (P= 0.999), anesthesia duration (P= 0.978), extubation time (P= 0.175), recovery time (P= 0.163), fentanyl use (P= 0.316) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in extubation time among the three groups (P= 0.175), likely because neither esmolol nor lidocaine has a marked effect on the level of sedation. As shown in Table 5, although the EL group showed a statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (113.5 ± 17.4 mmHg, P < 0.05) and heart rate (113.9 ± 8.9 beats/min, P < 0.05) on awakening, there were no hemodynamic changes over time in any of the study groups that could be attributed to the short duration of action of esmolol.\nCharacteristics of patients undergoing strabismus surgery among three different groups.\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics of patients undergoing strabismus surgery among three different groups.</u>\nData are expressed as number of patients, mean ± standard deviation, or n (%).\nHemodynamic data of patients undergoing strabismus surgery (n= 22 in each group).\n删除重复语句：<u>Hemodynamic data of patients undergoing strabismus surgery (n= 22 in each group).</u>\nData are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

After being transferred to the recovery room, if the pediatric patient shows agitation, 10 min of verbal relaxation was attempted. If this failed, fentanyl was administered regardless of the level of agitation. Therefore, agitation scores measured at 30 min were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Unlike the OPS and RASS scores, there was no significant difference in the CPS score among the three groups at the time of arrival in the recovery room (P > 0.05), likely because its criteria are not as detailed as those for the OPS and RASS. Although emergence agitation delayed discharge from the recovery room, we found that the time spent in the recovery room was similar among the three groups (P > 0.05); most children stabilized and their pain had resolved at 30 min after arrival in the recovery room.\nPostanesthesia agitation data of patient undergoing strabismus surgery (n= 22 in each group).\n删除重复语句：<u>Postanesthesia agitation data of patient undergoing strabismus surgery (n= 22 in each group).</u>\nData are expressed as median (range).

The incidence of postoperative agitation differs between school-aged children and preschool-aged children. However, we did not distinguish between these age groups and enrolled children aged 3 to 9 years. This is unlikely to have affected the outcomes, given that the three groups did not differ significantly in terms of age, and the lidocaine group had a greater OPS score after arrival in the recovery room, although there were more preschool-aged children in the control group (19 of 22) than in the lidocaine group (14 of 22).\nPostoperative agitation is common in children. It is known that several factors, including the anesthetic agent, anxiety, young age, and pain, cause postoperative agitation in this age group. It can cause many problems, including the risk of additional injury, a need for increased staffing, and delays in recovery.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Therefore, many studies have explored the use of opioids, midazolam, and analgesics to reduce postoperative agitation. Opioids are the agents used most often to alleviate agitation. However, their use is associated with a high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting, as well as risks of urinary retention, respiratory depression, and delayed emergence from anesthesia.通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u> Therefore, many studies have explored ketorolac, acetaminophen, and midazolam as alternatives to opioid to attenuate emergence agitation.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Some studies found that children premedicated with midazolam were less agitated after surgery while others reported that airway sensitivity to midazolam delayed discharge from the recovery room.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Midazolam worsened pain because of its anti-analgesic effects,通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> limiting use of the drug in children. The rationale for use of ketorolac and acetaminophen to lessen agitation is that alleviation of pain reduces agitation. However, these two drugs cannot be used only to mitigate agitation; many studies have found that agitation can develop in the absence of pain.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,20,21,22,23]</u> For example, covering the eyes after strabismus surgery may trigger anxiety and agitation.\nSevoflurane, an inhaled anesthetic often used in children, is associated with rapid induction and emergence; its blood solubility is low and there is no airway stimulation. However, sevoflurane has been associated with various complications, including agitation on emergence,通用删除6(英):<u>[1,18,24]</u> particularly after pediatric ophthalmic surgery (the eyes are covered postoperatively). One study found that 44% of pediatric patients who underwent strabismus surgery showed emergence agitation.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>\nAlthough it is unclear why agitation is prevalent after strabismus surgery, it may be attributable to anxiety or airway stimulation rather than pain. Although intravenous infusion of lidocaine may delay recovery, postoperative sore throat is reduced, possibly lessening agitation.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> The mechanism by which lidocaine relieves sore throat and cough remains unclear, but it is known that the drug reduces secretion of neuropeptides in the brainstem and airway by inhibiting stimulation of sensory C fibers in the airway and reducing stimulation of the mucosa in the airway by the tracheal tube.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> One study found that lidocaine reduced agitation by lessening airway stimulation通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> and another found that the drug had no effect on agitation.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> In the former study, 1 mg/kg of 1% lidocaine or 2 mg/kg of 2% lidocaine was administered after return of spontaneous breathing; in the latter study, lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg was administered at the end of anesthesia. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the effects of lidocaine on agitation. In this study, we explored whether lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg alone (to relieve sore throat) mitigated agitation, or whether lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg (to relieve sore throat) and additional use of esmolol (to reduce anxiety) was helpful. Moreover, the study included patients undergoing strabismus surgery, which is associated with only low-level pain.\nEsmolol is a beta-blocker that is generally used to lower the heart rate after intubation or surgical stimulation.通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u> In this study, esmolol was administered not only on awakening but also during induction. However, we believe that esmolol administered at the time of induction would exert only a minimal effect; the mean operating time was only 30 min, and the peak effect of esmolol occurs within 5 to 10 min and lasts for only 10 to 20 min. Beta-blockers also reduce surgical stress and the levels of anesthetics and opioids required. Beta-agonists increase wakefulness and excitation by activating the reticular activating system in the brain,通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> in turn reducing cortical arousal, which is how esmolol reduces agitation.通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31]</u> Several studies found that esmolol reduced the need for analgesics and sedatives, but most researchers have reported that esmolol is more effective when combined with other drugs than when administered as monotherapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,22,32,33]</u> For this reason, we combined esmolol with lidocaine, which relieves sore throat. Strabismus surgery in children is known to cause minimal pain,通用删除6(英):<u>[25,34]</u> so we attempted to determine whether injection of lidocaine can reduce agitation by attenuating stimulation of the airway. And also, we predicted that because esmolol not only maintains hemodynamic stability but also suppresses wakefulness,通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> using the two agents in combination would achieve a greater reduction in agitation. Therefore, we compared an EL group with a lidocaine group, and found that only the patients in the EL group had a statistically significant reduction in agitation. However, there is a limitation that esmolol alone has not been compared. Therefore, further studies on the effect of using esmolol alone are needed. It can be inferred that agitation was decreased by a combination of the ability of esmolol to block beta receptors and decrease wakefulness通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> and the ability of lidocaine to lessen airway stimulation in children.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Infusions of esmolol are not commonly used in pediatric patients because their safety is not confirmed.\nUnlike other studies in which esmolol was administered as a bolus for induction, infused during anesthesia, or administered as a further bolus at the end of surgery,通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,31,32,35,36,37,38]</u> we delivered boluses on induction and awakening. Therefore, it is possible that the duration of any effect of esmolol on agitation was less than if the drug had been administered via a continuous infusion. The extent and duration of esmolol-mediated effects require further examination.\nWe used the RASS rather than the more popular PAED because it contains an item measuring the extent of eye contact with the caregiver. Our patients were blindfolded after surgery, so were unable to make eye contact. Furthermore, the RASS affords a more detailed measure of pediatric agitation when used in conjunction with the OPS and CPS.\nThis study has some limitations. First, we did not distinguish between patients in whom one or both eyes was/were covered. Second, agitation that persisted for 10 min after arrival in the recovery room was considered to be a pain response. Such patients received fentanyl regardless of symptom severity and we did not explore the possibility of a relationship between severity of agitation and administration of fentanyl. Third, the RASS can be used to subclassify agitation in children. However, the RASS is generally employed to measure sedation and agitation in patients in the intensive care unit. Therefore, items commonly used to measure agitation in children were not perfectly matched with RASS items. Fourth, the bispectral index is not used in children at our institution. However, we maintained the state of anesthesia at 1 MAC from induction to emergence from anesthesia. Furthermore, although there were no tools available to measure the consumption of sevoflurane, the duration of anesthesia and the concentration of sevoflurane were similar in the three study groups. We believe that these factors had no significant impact on the results of our study. Fifth, we did not use the PAED, which is commonly used to measure the severity of agitation in pediatric patients, because one of the items in the PAED checks for eye movement and the patients in this study had their eyes covered after strabismus surgery. Therefore, given that OPS score >4 indicates symptoms of anxiety and agitation in children in other study,通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> and, strabismus surgery is known cause minimal pain,通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> we determined that if an OPS score was >4, any agitation would have a cause other than pain.\nIn conclusion, administration of both lidocaine and esmolol at the end of anesthesia reduced agitation when pediatric patients awoke from anesthesia and were transferred to the recovery room. This effect was helpful even though it was of short duration; because when patients are transferred from the operating room to the recovery room, further reducing the risk of fall-related accidents. Further studies should explore whether such treatment is useful after procedures other than pediatric strabismus surgery.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by the Soonchunhyang University Research Fund.</u>\n删除7：<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": " 通用删除7(英):(0–7); ", "content": "【0】In recent years, sevoflurane has become a popular anesthetic agent, affording hemodynamic stability, low-level stimulation of the airway, and low blood-gas solubility and permitting rapid induction of anesthesia and emergence.

Drug administration and patient evaluation were performed by a single investigator.\nAll patients received intramuscular injections of glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg as premedication. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and the SpO2 level were monitored, and thiopental 5 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg were administered immediately prior to induction. Vital signs were then checked at 5-minute intervals. At intubation, esmolol 0.5 mg/kg was injected intravenously and anesthesia was maintained with 2% sevoflurane in a mixture of oxygen and air (FiO2 0.5) and maintenance of normocapnia. Dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg was injected before surgery. The inhalation anesthetic levels were elevated or nicardipine was administered if the patient’s blood pressure (BP) or heart rate rose by >25% of the baseline value, and atropine 0.01 mg/kg was administered if bradycardia developed. All patients received 1:4 saline dextrose.\nThe control group received saline at a volume equivalent to that of 1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine at the end of surgery and saline at a volume equivalent to that of 0.5 mg/kg of esmolol when they started to move voluntarily. The lidocaine group received 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine intravenously at the end of surgery and saline at a volume equivalent to that of 0.5 mg/kg of esmolol when they started to move voluntarily after the gas was turned off. The EL group received 1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine at the end of surgery and 0.5 mg/kg of esmolol when they started to move voluntarily after the gas was turned off. The esmolol dose used in this study was determined from the dose administered when esmolol is used as an adjunct to opioids, which is generally 0.5 mg/kg.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> The lidocaine dose was determined based on reports of lidocaine being effective in reducing airway stimulation when administered at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg.通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14]</u> The primary outcome was the effect of esmolol and lidocaine on the severity of postoperative agitation in children who have received sevoflurane anesthesia. The secondary outcomes were vital signs, severity of pain, amount of fentanyl used, extubation time, and recovery time. All patients were monitored from the end of surgery to the time of discharge from the recovery room.\nAgitation was measured using the objective pain score (OPS), Cole 5-point score (CPS), and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1, Table 2, Table 3]</u>, starting when the patients awoke from anesthesia and initiated spontaneous breathing at 6 to 8 ml/kg. Even though the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale is typically used to measure agitation in children, we opted to use the OPS instead because the children’s eyes were covered, thereby preventing use of the PAED scale. Although the OPS is an instrument that measures pain, given a report 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> showing that an OPS score of ≥4 is similar to the 4-point PAED scale item \"The child is restless\" while a score of 5 means \"The child is inconsolable,\" we decided that an OPS score of ≥4 indicated agitation rather than a pain response and, strabismus surgery is known to be associated with little pain.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Thus, we determined that the OPS would be useful for measuring agitation.\nThe Objective pain score (OPS).\n删除重复语句：<u>The Objective pain score (OPS).</u>\nThe cole 5-point scale (CPS) score.\n删除重复语句：<u>The cole 5-point scale (CPS) score.</u>\nRichmond agitation and sedation scale (RASS).\n删除重复语句：<u>Richmond agitation and sedation scale (RASS).</u>\nAll patients were extubated and transferred to the recovery room when spontaneous breathing at 5 to 8 ml/kg was stable and head elevation was possible. The extubation time was the interval between the completion of surgery and extubation. The recovery time was the interval between arrival in and departure from the recovery room after recovering from anesthesia. The OPS, CPS, and RASS were applied; heart rate, BP, and blood oxygen saturation were measured on arrival in the recovery room and at 10 and 30 min after arrival. When the objective OPS score was 3 to 4 for up to 10 min after arrival in the recovery room, verbal sedation was attempted, given that the symptoms were not considered to be pain responses but rather agitation after awaking from anesthesia. Symptoms were considered to be pain responses if verbal sedation failed, and fentanyl 1 μg/kg was administered after 10 min.\nIn the study by Cao et al,通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> the results were statistically significant when OPS scores differed by more than two points, and they calculated that the number of patients required for an alpha of 0.5, a beta of 0.1 (power of 90%), and a dropout rate of 20% would be 28. The incidence of severe agitation was 30% in that study. Based on the values of OPS in the control group [median (range), 2 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–6)</u>; mean ± standard deviation (SD), 2 ± 1.5] and dexmedetomidine group [median (range), 0 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–7)</u>; mean ± SD, 0 ± 1.75] in the previous study,通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> the sample size was calculated using the Bonferroni method. First, we assessed the descriptive summary statistics (the mean ± SD values for age, weight, operating time, duration of anesthesia, and extubation and recovery times; sex distributions and proportion of patients who received fentanyl; and the median OPS, CPS, and RASS scores). The three study groups were compared using the Pearson chi-square test, the Bonferroni method, analysis of variance (ANOVA), or the Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software . All tests were two-tailed and a P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 shows the CONSORT flow diagram for the pediatric patients in this study. Eighty-four patients were enrolled.

Compared to the Control group, the EL group had a significantly lower incidence (P= 0.01), and when compared to the Lidocine group, the EL group also had a significantly greater reduction of incidence (P= 0.00). Although the Lidocaine group had a higher incidence, there was no statistically difference in incidence between the Lidocaine group and Control group (P= 0.515).\nThere was no statistically significant between-group difference in patients’ age (P= 0.085), weight (P= 0.369), sex (P= 0.784), operation duration (P= 0.999), anesthesia duration (P= 0.978), extubation time (P= 0.175), recovery time (P= 0.163), fentanyl use (P= 0.316) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in extubation time among the three groups (P= 0.175), likely because neither esmolol nor lidocaine has a marked effect on the level of sedation. As shown in Table 5, although the EL group showed a statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (113.5 ± 17.4 mmHg, P < 0.05) and heart rate (113.9 ± 8.9 beats/min, P < 0.05) on awakening, there were no hemodynamic changes over time in any of the study groups that could be attributed to the short duration of action of esmolol.\nCharacteristics of patients undergoing strabismus surgery among three different groups.\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics of patients undergoing strabismus surgery among three different groups.</u>\nData are expressed as number of patients, mean ± standard deviation, or n (%).\nHemodynamic data of patients undergoing strabismus surgery (n= 22 in each group).\n删除重复语句：<u>Hemodynamic data of patients undergoing strabismus surgery (n= 22 in each group).</u>\nData are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

After being transferred to the recovery room, if the pediatric patient shows agitation, 10 min of verbal relaxation was attempted. If this failed, fentanyl was administered regardless of the level of agitation. Therefore, agitation scores measured at 30 min were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Unlike the OPS and RASS scores, there was no significant difference in the CPS score among the three groups at the time of arrival in the recovery room (P > 0.05), likely because its criteria are not as detailed as those for the OPS and RASS. Although emergence agitation delayed discharge from the recovery room, we found that the time spent in the recovery room was similar among the three groups (P > 0.05); most children stabilized and their pain had resolved at 30 min after arrival in the recovery room.\nPostanesthesia agitation data of patient undergoing strabismus surgery (n= 22 in each group).\n删除重复语句：<u>Postanesthesia agitation data of patient undergoing strabismus surgery (n= 22 in each group).</u>\nData are expressed as median (range).

The incidence of postoperative agitation differs between school-aged children and preschool-aged children. However, we did not distinguish between these age groups and enrolled children aged 3 to 9 years. This is unlikely to have affected the outcomes, given that the three groups did not differ significantly in terms of age, and the lidocaine group had a greater OPS score after arrival in the recovery room, although there were more preschool-aged children in the control group (19 of 22) than in the lidocaine group (14 of 22).\nPostoperative agitation is common in children. It is known that several factors, including the anesthetic agent, anxiety, young age, and pain, cause postoperative agitation in this age group. It can cause many problems, including the risk of additional injury, a need for increased staffing, and delays in recovery.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Therefore, many studies have explored the use of opioids, midazolam, and analgesics to reduce postoperative agitation. Opioids are the agents used most often to alleviate agitation. However, their use is associated with a high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting, as well as risks of urinary retention, respiratory depression, and delayed emergence from anesthesia.通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u> Therefore, many studies have explored ketorolac, acetaminophen, and midazolam as alternatives to opioid to attenuate emergence agitation.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Some studies found that children premedicated with midazolam were less agitated after surgery while others reported that airway sensitivity to midazolam delayed discharge from the recovery room.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Midazolam worsened pain because of its anti-analgesic effects,通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> limiting use of the drug in children. The rationale for use of ketorolac and acetaminophen to lessen agitation is that alleviation of pain reduces agitation. However, these two drugs cannot be used only to mitigate agitation; many studies have found that agitation can develop in the absence of pain.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,20,21,22,23]</u> For example, covering the eyes after strabismus surgery may trigger anxiety and agitation.\nSevoflurane, an inhaled anesthetic often used in children, is associated with rapid induction and emergence; its blood solubility is low and there is no airway stimulation. However, sevoflurane has been associated with various complications, including agitation on emergence,通用删除6(英):<u>[1,18,24]</u> particularly after pediatric ophthalmic surgery (the eyes are covered postoperatively). One study found that 44% of pediatric patients who underwent strabismus surgery showed emergence agitation.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>\nAlthough it is unclear why agitation is prevalent after strabismus surgery, it may be attributable to anxiety or airway stimulation rather than pain. Although intravenous infusion of lidocaine may delay recovery, postoperative sore throat is reduced, possibly lessening agitation.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> The mechanism by which lidocaine relieves sore throat and cough remains unclear, but it is known that the drug reduces secretion of neuropeptides in the brainstem and airway by inhibiting stimulation of sensory C fibers in the airway and reducing stimulation of the mucosa in the airway by the tracheal tube.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> One study found that lidocaine reduced agitation by lessening airway stimulation通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> and another found that the drug had no effect on agitation.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> In the former study, 1 mg/kg of 1% lidocaine or 2 mg/kg of 2% lidocaine was administered after return of spontaneous breathing; in the latter study, lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg was administered at the end of anesthesia. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the effects of lidocaine on agitation. In this study, we explored whether lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg alone (to relieve sore throat) mitigated agitation, or whether lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg (to relieve sore throat) and additional use of esmolol (to reduce anxiety) was helpful. Moreover, the study included patients undergoing strabismus surgery, which is associated with only low-level pain.\nEsmolol is a beta-blocker that is generally used to lower the heart rate after intubation or surgical stimulation.通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u> In this study, esmolol was administered not only on awakening but also during induction. However, we believe that esmolol administered at the time of induction would exert only a minimal effect; the mean operating time was only 30 min, and the peak effect of esmolol occurs within 5 to 10 min and lasts for only 10 to 20 min. Beta-blockers also reduce surgical stress and the levels of anesthetics and opioids required. Beta-agonists increase wakefulness and excitation by activating the reticular activating system in the brain,通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> in turn reducing cortical arousal, which is how esmolol reduces agitation.通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31]</u> Several studies found that esmolol reduced the need for analgesics and sedatives, but most researchers have reported that esmolol is more effective when combined with other drugs than when administered as monotherapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,22,32,33]</u> For this reason, we combined esmolol with lidocaine, which relieves sore throat. Strabismus surgery in children is known to cause minimal pain,通用删除6(英):<u>[25,34]</u> so we attempted to determine whether injection of lidocaine can reduce agitation by attenuating stimulation of the airway. And also, we predicted that because esmolol not only maintains hemodynamic stability but also suppresses wakefulness,通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> using the two agents in combination would achieve a greater reduction in agitation. Therefore, we compared an EL group with a lidocaine group, and found that only the patients in the EL group had a statistically significant reduction in agitation. However, there is a limitation that esmolol alone has not been compared. Therefore, further studies on the effect of using esmolol alone are needed. It can be inferred that agitation was decreased by a combination of the ability of esmolol to block beta receptors and decrease wakefulness通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> and the ability of lidocaine to lessen airway stimulation in children.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Infusions of esmolol are not commonly used in pediatric patients because their safety is not confirmed.\nUnlike other studies in which esmolol was administered as a bolus for induction, infused during anesthesia, or administered as a further bolus at the end of surgery,通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,31,32,35,36,37,38]</u> we delivered boluses on induction and awakening. Therefore, it is possible that the duration of any effect of esmolol on agitation was less than if the drug had been administered via a continuous infusion. The extent and duration of esmolol-mediated effects require further examination.\nWe used the RASS rather than the more popular PAED because it contains an item measuring the extent of eye contact with the caregiver. Our patients were blindfolded after surgery, so were unable to make eye contact. Furthermore, the RASS affords a more detailed measure of pediatric agitation when used in conjunction with the OPS and CPS.\nThis study has some limitations. First, we did not distinguish between patients in whom one or both eyes was/were covered. Second, agitation that persisted for 10 min after arrival in the recovery room was considered to be a pain response. Such patients received fentanyl regardless of symptom severity and we did not explore the possibility of a relationship between severity of agitation and administration of fentanyl. Third, the RASS can be used to subclassify agitation in children. However, the RASS is generally employed to measure sedation and agitation in patients in the intensive care unit. Therefore, items commonly used to measure agitation in children were not perfectly matched with RASS items. Fourth, the bispectral index is not used in children at our institution. However, we maintained the state of anesthesia at 1 MAC from induction to emergence from anesthesia. Furthermore, although there were no tools available to measure the consumption of sevoflurane, the duration of anesthesia and the concentration of sevoflurane were similar in the three study groups. We believe that these factors had no significant impact on the results of our study. Fifth, we did not use the PAED, which is commonly used to measure the severity of agitation in pediatric patients, because one of the items in the PAED checks for eye movement and the patients in this study had their eyes covered after strabismus surgery. Therefore, given that OPS score >4 indicates symptoms of anxiety and agitation in children in other study,通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> and, strabismus surgery is known cause minimal pain,通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> we determined that if an OPS score was >4, any agitation would have a cause other than pain.\nIn conclusion, administration of both lidocaine and esmolol at the end of anesthesia reduced agitation when pediatric patients awoke from anesthesia and were transferred to the recovery room. This effect was helpful even though it was of short duration; because when patients are transferred from the operating room to the recovery room, further reducing the risk of fall-related accidents. Further studies should explore whether such treatment is useful after procedures other than pediatric strabismus surgery.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by the Soonchunhyang University Research Fund.</u>\n删除7：<u>None.</u>", "index": 8020, "show": true, "start": 8020, "end": 8037, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "通用删除7(英):(0–4),"}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:09:54", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:11:37", "cost": 102.638}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:33", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:11:36", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:09:53"}

Their functional phenotype is controlled by microenvironmental signals. Macrophages in leukemia microenvironment are called leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs). They are involved in disease progression.\nUnder physiological conditions, macrophages are heterogeneous in several aspects, that is, tissue-specific phenotypes/functions, developmental origins, and polarization by different stimuli.删除4：<u>9</u> It is well-established that tissue-specific microenvironments give rise to the heterogeneity of tissue macrophages. The phenotypic markers and transcription regulators of tissue-resident macrophages in different macroenvironments are summarized in Table 1.\nPhenotypic markers and transcriptional regulators of tissue macrophages.\n删除重复语句：<u>Phenotypic markers and transcriptional regulators of tissue macrophages.</u>\nRecent evidence reveals that macrophages in adult have different developmental origins. In general, adult tissue-resident macrophages have three origins, that is, yolk sac, fetal liver, and circulating monocytes. The origin of tissue macrophages varies among tissues. Tissue-resident macrophages in brain, known as microglia, may arise only from yolk sac macrophages. Langerhans, alveolar macrophages, and Kupffer cells originate from both yolk sac and fetal liver monocytes. In heart-, pancreas-, and gut tissue-resident macrophages of fetal origin will gradually be replaced by BM- and monocyte-derived macrophages.删除4：<u>10</u> Although they have almost identical phenotype and function in the same microenvironment, macrophages from different origins may have different developmental imprints. For example, Siglec-F and CCR2 can be used to identify alveolar macrophages with embryonic and monocytic origins since embryonic origin macrophages are Siglec-Fhi and monocytic origin ones are CCR2hi.删除4：<u>10</u>\nMacrophages have remarkable plasticity that allows them to respond efficiently to numerous environmental signals. They are heterogeneous in activation phenotype. The classically activated macrophages (M1) and alternatively activated macrophages (M2) are well-accepted phenotypes of macrophage activation. M1 macrophages are polarized by LPS and IFN-γ. They express high level of iNOS and secrete proinflammatory cytokines and express inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL9 and CXCL10. M2 macrophages are polarized by IL-4 and IL-6. They express high level of Arg1 and secrete TGF-β, IL-10, arginase, and metalloprotease to participate in immunosuppression.删除4：<u>11</u> However, macrophage phenotypes may be more appropriately described as a continuum of functional states. M1 and M2 macrophages represent only the two extremes of macrophage activation phenotypes.删除4：<u>12</u> Nowadays, M2 macrophages refer to all non-M1 macrophages and are further divided into M2a to M2d subtypes. TAMs are regarded as an M2-like phenotype, M2d.13 M1- and M2-associated genes have been suggested. Though no gene expression is unique for either M1 or M2 macrophages, high-level expression of some genes is commonly observed in M1 or M2 macrophages. For example, iNOS and Arg1 are frequently used as markers for M1 and M2 macrophages, respectively. In general, M1 macrophages have antitumor effects, whereas M2 macrophages have protumor effects. A color wheel hypothesis has also been proposed based on three fundamental populations of macrophages that include classically activated macrophages, wound-healing macrophages, and regulatory macrophages.删除4：<u>14</u>\nUnder pathological conditions, such as tumor and leukemia microenvironments, macrophages retain their plasticity and respond to disease microenvironmental signals.删除4：<u>1</u> Macrophages recruited into tumor microenvironment are educated to an M2-like phenotype.删除4：<u>15</u> TAMs, as an important component of the tumor microenvironment, involve in the tumor-related immunosuppression.16 M2-like TAMs promote tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis by secreting growth factors, cytokines such as angiogenesis factors, and various proteases.删除4：<u>17</u> LAMs express both M1- and M2-associated genes. Similar to TAMs, LAMs consist of M1- and M2-like subpopulations based on CD206 expression.删除4：<u>18</u> Macrophages in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are known as \"nanny-like cells\" (NLCs), which exhibit similar phenotype with TAMs in B-cell lymphoma.删除4：<u>19</u>\nIn hematological malignancies, TAMs in lymphoma and myeloma are widely studied and in many cases TAM counts in tissue sections correlate with poor prognosis.删除4：<u>20,21</u> In recent years, studies on phenotype and function of macrophages in leukemia microenvironment reveal their characteristics.\nFrom different leukemia models, increase of LAMs in hematopoietic microenvironment is observed during the development of leukemia, especially early and middle stages of leukemia. In nonirradiated Notch1-induced mouse T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and MLL-AF9-induced mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models, macrophages infiltrated into BM and spleen increase during early stage of leukemia progression and decrease thereafter.删除4：<u>18,22</u> In another report, in which macrophages in AML are also defined as AML-associated macrophages (AAMs), increase of macrophages in BM is detected in AML patients. This phenomenon is also observed in NUP98-HOXD13 mouse AML model.删除4：<u>23</u> These observations suggest that noninfectious inflammation occur in the development of leukemia and macrophages play pathological roles in the progression of leukemia.\nAlthough LAMs are generally considered as M2-like macrophages, the activation phenotype of LAMs is heterogeneous. In Notch1-induced T-ALL and MLL-AF9-induced AML, LAMs from different organs express both M1 and M2 macrophage activation-associated molecules.删除4：<u>18,22</u> AAMs in leukemia burden mice express higher levels of Arg1 and lower levels of IL-6 and Nos2, exhibiting M2 like phenotype.删除4：<u>23</u> LAMs in T-ALL model consist of CD206+ and CD206- subpopulations, especially at early stage of leukemia. Two subpopulations express both M1- and M2-associated genes. But CD206+ LAMs expressed higher levels of both M1- and M2-associated genes than CD206- LAMs.删除4：<u>18</u> Similar results are also observed in AML model, and gene expression profiles of LAMs from BM and spleen in T-ALL and AML mice show that they have distinct gene expression signature.删除4：<u>22</u> During the development of CLL, leukemia cells secrete chemokines to induce peripheral monocytes migration to them. And infiltrative monocytes differentiate into NLCs with M2 phenotype, which express high level of CD14, CD68, CD163, and CD206.24\nIn physiological state, macrophages showed tissue-specific gene expression profiles determined by gene-enhancer landscapes shaped by microenvironments.删除4：<u>25</u> LAMs present organ-specific activation as well. Peritoneal tissue-derived LAMs simultaneously expressed high-level iNOS and Arg1, which was not commonly observed in macrophages from other tissues and origins. A study comparing the activation phenotype of LAMs from BM, spleen, and peritoneal tissue in T-ALL model demonstrates that considerable phenotypic diversities are detected among those LAMs, although they all express lower level of CSF-1, TGF-β1, and VEGFα than TAMs.26 A study comparing the activation phenotype of LAMs from BM and spleen in T-ALL and AML models reveals that LAMs in spleen have more M2 characteristics, whereas LAMs in BM have more M1 characteristics. IRF7 promoted M1 characteristics through activation of SAPK/JNK pathway in macrophages.删除4：<u>22</u> LAMs in liver exhibited a more M1-like phenotype distinct from LAMs in BM or spleen. They express higher level of CCL5, iNOS, IL12β, TNFα, MCSF, MMP9, TGFβ, and VEGFα, while lower level of IL1-β, CD206, and IL 10 than that in BM and spleen LAMs.删除4：<u>27</u> Furthermore, LAM subpopulations in different organs show considerable diversity. For instance, the expression of IL-1β, iNOS, IL-6, Arg1, and IL-10 from CD206+ LAMs in spleen is higher than that in BM.删除4：<u>18</u> The phenotypic characteristics of macrophages in different types of leukemia are summarized in Table 2.\nPhenotypic characteristics of macrophages in different types of leukemia.\n删除重复语句：<u>Phenotypic characteristics of macrophages in different types of leukemia.</u>\nIt is well known that TAMs infiltrate into tumors and promote tumor progression through affecting proliferation of tumor cells, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and so on. Accumulation of TAMs is correlated with worse prognosis in many cancers, including lymphoma and myeloma.删除4：<u>20,28,29,30,31</u> Similar to TAMs, LAMs are an adverse factor in leukemia development. Patients with higher level of CD163 expression have a shorter survival than those with lower level of CD163.22 In T-ALL and AML mouse models, LAMs promote the proliferation of leukemia cells.删除4：<u>18,22</u> The leukemia microenvironment polarizes AAMs to M2 phenotype through regulating Gfi1, which supports the growth of AML cells.删除4：<u>23</u> CD14+ blood cells from healthy donors differentiate into NLCs when cocultured with CLL B cells and protect CLL cells from apoptosis.删除4：<u>24</u> CLL cells secrete IL-4,31 IL-13,32 IL-10 33, and other cytokines and promote NLCs/TAMs polarization to M2 phenotype, while M2-like NLCs/TAMs inhibits T cell infiltration and mediates local immunosuppression. NLCs/TAMs also promote the survival of CLL cells by secreting IGF1, IL-8, CCL2, and CXCL12.34 In the Eu-TCL1 transgenic CLL model, macrophages support the growth of CLL cells in mice,35 protumorigenic and immunosuppressive properties of macrophages can be modulated through the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway.删除4：<u>36</u>\nIn leukemia and tumor microenvironments, proliferation of malignant cells largely depends on local malignant niches. LAMs and TAMs in respective niche exhibit similar but different phenotypic and functional characteristics. Several similarities are found between LAMs and TAMs. First, increase of LAMs and TAMs are commonly detected in malignant microenvironments when compared with their normal counterparts.删除4：<u>18,23,37,38</u> Second, LAM and TAM populations are heterogeneous and can be subdivided into different subpopulations. TAMs in tumor microenvironment consist of M1-like TAMs and M2-like TAMs. The phenotype of TAMs varies in different areas of tumor tissues. In a breast cancer model, TAMs localized in normoxic sites express M1 markers and antiangiogenic chemokines, whereas TAMs in hypoxic sites express M2 markers and have proangiogenic effects.39 M2 like TAMs have the effects of immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and promoting the metastasis.删除4：<u>40,41,42</u> In leukemia microenvironment, LAMs consist of CD206+ and CD206- subpopulations. Both CD206+ and CD206- LAMs have proleukemia effects.删除4：<u>18</u> Third, LAMs and TAMs have tissue-specific phenotypes. TAMs in metastatic tumor exhibit more M2 phenotype than primary lesion.删除4：<u>43</u> As already discussed, LAMs from BM, spleen, liver, and abdominal cavity have different phenotypic characteristics.删除4：<u>18,22,26,27</u>\nThe functional characteristics of LAMs and TAMs also have differences. Although both LAMs and TAMs promote malignant progression, the main mechanisms may be different. As angiogenesis is much more important in solid tumors, high-level expression of pro-angiogenetic factors, such as VEGFα, are frequently detected in TAMs, whereas it is not detected in LAMs in several tissues from different leukemia models.删除4：<u>18,22,26,27</u> TAMs also promote tumor progression through immunosuppression and promoting invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. In CLL microenvironment, M2-like NLCs/TAMs play important roles in immunosuppression through secreting inflammatory suppressing cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13.31,32,33 It is still unclear whether immunosuppression effects play important roles in other types of leukemia. Furthermore, the role of LAMs in invasion and metastasis of leukemia cells has not been established. In the CLL and AML model, LAMs promote proliferation or inhibit apoptosis of leukemia cells directly in AML microenvironment.删除4：<u>18,23,34,35</u>\nMacrophage infiltration has been shown to be an independent poor prognostic factor in several cancer types as well as in leukemia.删除4：<u>44</u> Hence, more attention has been paid to develop immunotherapies targeting TAMs and LAMs. TAMs-targeted therapies have been extensively studied in solid tumors. Intervention strategies include depleting TAMs, blocking their protumor signaling, and restoring their immune-stimulatory properties.删除4：<u>41</u> With deep understanding of macrophage in hematological malignancies, strategies for targeting macrophages have been suggested and explored for therapy applications. In CLL mouse model, depletion of CLL-associated patrolling monocytes and macrophages using liposomal clodronate results in delay of disease development and repairs immune dysfunction.删除4：<u>45</u> Targeting macrophages by either CSF1R signaling blockade or liposomal clodronate-mediated depletion has marked inhibitory effects on established leukemia.删除4：<u>35</u> Interaction between SIRPα on macrophages and CD47 on AML cells is critical for leukemic engraftment and evasion of immune surveillance. Disruption of SIRPα-CD47 interaction by SIRPα-Fc fusion protein impairs AML engraftment and does not adversely affect normal hematopoiesis.删除4：<u>46</u> Similar to CAR-T cell therapies, modified macrophages have been reported by introducing engineered chimeric antigen receptors for phagocytosis (CAR-Ps): Megf10 in macrophages. CAR-Ps result in specific engulfment of antigen-coated particles and human cancer cells.删除4：<u>47</u> Macrophages-targeted therapies are promising strategies against leukemia and they may be practicable therapy options in clinical applications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:47:29", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:47:42", "cost": 12.862}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:33", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:47:42", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:47:28"}

Of these, mPB cells make up the majority of autologous and allogeneic HCT efforts worldwide. The advantage of mPB is that one can, in many cases, usually collect more than enough cells to ensure a rapid and long-lasting donor graft, be it for autologous or allogeneic HCT. The \"gold\" standard for collection of mPB has been, and continues to be, the cells mobilized from the BM to peripheral blood by multiple additions of the cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) each day over a number of days. However, G-CSF-induced mPB does not always yield enough cells for a graft, takes 4-5 days for optimal yield of HSC and HPC, and can entail leukocytapheresis efforts to obtain enough cells for a transplant. This requires the donor to be ready and willing for multiple days of G-CSF treatment. Moreover, there are patients who do not mobilize HSC and HPC well for a number of reasons, including low numbers of these cells inherent in the BM of the patient undergoing an autologous transplant—an example being patients with Fanconi anemia, under such conditions, one might attempt to use gene therapy on the mobilized cells to correct the Fanconi anemia gene defect. New, simple, and less time-consuming efforts to mobilize HSC and HPC for clinical use would be advantageous. In this context, a recent article by Hoggatt et al.6 describes a new regimen combining two small molecules (GRO-beta and AMD3100) to quickly mobilize HSC and HPC in mice.\nAs a background to the article by Hoggatt et al.6 a number of small molecules have been used in mice and/or man, alone or in combination with G-CSF, to enhance collection of HSC and HPC with an optimized mobilization procedure. This includes the chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha (also referred to as CCL3),7,8,9,10 which, although active as a mobilizer in mice, did not show much, if any, efficacy in humans when its analog BB10010 was used.删除4：<u>7,8,9,10</u> Among a number of small molecules that have been used to mobilize HSC and HPC, one that stands out and has been used for good advantage is AMD3100 (Plerixafor).删除4：<u>3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16</u> AMD3100 has been used alone but synergizes with G-CSF to greatly enhance mobilization of HSC and HPC in both mice and humans.删除4：<u>11,12,13,14</u> The combination of the two usually entails 4 days or more of G-CSF given twice a day with AMD3100 given on the last day of G-CSF administration, and the cells are collected hours later. Another small molecule, the chemokine growth-regulated protein (GRO)-beta (also referred to as CXCL2), has shown some efficacy in mice and rhesus monkeys17 and now in humans6 as a mobilizer of HSC and HPC, although the GRO-beta by itself in humans had only modest effects.删除4：<u>6</u> In contrast to G-CSF, which takes days to mobilize sufficient HSC and HPC, AMD3100 and GRO-beta, each when given alone, act quickly in mice within 15 minutes to a few hours.\nIn an effort to more quickly and simply mobilize HSC and HPC, groups from the Indiana University and the Harvard University collaborated to assess the combined mobilizing effects of GRO-beta and AMD3100 in mice.删除4：<u>6</u> Take-home messages from their article were several fold: A single injection of both GRO-beta, which acts as an agonist through the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2) on neutrophils resulting in release of metalloproteinase (MMP) 9,6 and AMD3100, which can act as an antagonist of the stromal cell-derived factor (SDF) 1/C-X-C chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)-CXCR4 receptor axis interaction11,12,13,14 but which also manifests agonistic effects on this latter interaction,18 results in mobilizing the same numbers of HSC and HPC in mice within 15 minutes, which takes days to mobilize using G-CSF. Of significance and high biological interest, they noted that the combination of GRO-beta and AMD3100 mobilized a higher engrafting and competitive HSC population than that of G-CSF.删除4：<u>6</u> This may not be too surprising a find, because there was some evidence that AMD3100 alone and in combination with G-CSF also seems to mobilize a high engrafting HSC population.删除4：<u>11</u>\nAs exciting as their mouse data6 is, the combination of MIP-1-alpha plus AMD3100 plus G-CSF was a more potent mobilizer in mice than either combination of two alone,9 and whether or not such an efficacious mobilization procedure using the combination of GRObeta and AMD3100 will work in humans remains to be seen. It may take a while to sort out the best mobilization timing in humans. While GRO-beta seems to work within 15 minutes in mice and humans as a mobilizer,6 AMD3100 takes a much longer time to mobilize in humans than in mice (e.g. AMD3100 in mice peaks at about 1 hour but takes 9-12 hours in humans for maximal effectiveness).删除4：<u>11,12,13,14</u> However, sorting this window of timing out for the combined use of GRO-beta and AMD3100 in humans should not be too difficult.\nA most intriguing aspect of the work by Hoggatt et al.6 is the characteristics of the cells mobilized by the combination of GRO-beta plus AMD3100. What exactly is this higher engrafting and competing HSC population? RNA sequencing found that these highly engrafting and competitive mouse cells have a distinct transcriptome different from that of G-CSF mobilized mouse cells,6 but it is not yet clear if these differences can be defined with regard to the surface phenotype of HSC to separate out these highly engrafting from lesser engrafting HSC. Cluster density (CD)166 is a type 1 cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of molecules.删除4：<u>19,20</u> CD166 is present on the surface of mouse and human HSC as well as on the regulatory cells in the microenvironment niche. Perhaps CD166 may be a usable surface marker candidate when added to the most rigorously defined phenotypic HSC populations to distinguish differentially engrafting cells. Can adding CD166 as a marker further define this highly functional HSC population in mice and man, and what about other cell surface functional markers such as CXCR4, the homing and survival receptor for SDF-1/CXCL12,21,22,23,24,25,26 and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 4 that can truncate and change the activities of a number of biologically active proteins including SDF-1/CXCL12?27,28,29,30,31 How well these additional markers work for human cells to define the more efficacious engrafting cells remains to be determined and may well depend on the expression levels of these surface proteins.\nOnce the characteristics of these highly engrafting cells are known, the question becomes if this engrafting ability can be further enhanced or are these cells already maximally fit for engraftment? A number of different measures have been used to enhance engraftment of CB HSC, in part through enhancing the expression of CXCR4 on the cells and increasing the homing capacity of these cells. This includes using short-term ex vivo pulsing periods (e.g. hours) with inhibitors of DPP427,30 or of the enzyme histone deacetylase (HDAC)532 and/or use of prostaglandin E (PGE),33,34 glucocorticosteroids (e.g. dexamethosone or Flonase),35 or hyperthermia treatment36 of the donor cells, as well as short-term DPP4 inhibitor administration to the recipient before administration of the donor cells.删除4：<u>30,37,38,39</u> Combined PGE pulsing of mouse BM donor cells into DPP4-inhibitor-treated recipients has already been shown to enhance engraftment of mouse BM cells into lethally irradiated mice.删除4：<u>40</u>\nEfforts to enhance the collection and engrafting capability of donor cells are ongoing in numerous laboratories worldwide. We have found that collecting mouse BM and human CB cells under hypoxic conditions (e.g. at 3% oxygen) or in ambient air in the presence of cyclosporine A mitigates the effects of extra physiological oxygen shock/stress (EPHOSS) that acts through a cyclophilin D-P53-mitochondrial permeability transition pore axis, which involves the release of reactive oxygen species, hypoxia-inducing factor, and the hypoximer, miR210.41 EPHOSS, upon collection of cells in ambient air, causes rapid loss of HSC through a differentiation, rather than cell death, phenomenon. Would such collections of the mPB in hypoxia or in air in the presence of cyclosporine A or combinations of inhibitors of antioxidants and/or epigenetic enzymes42 enhance numbers of GRO-beta and AMD3100 mPB HSC?\nIt is only through rigorous experimentation that we will enhance the efficiency of HCT using not only mPB but also BM and CB. However, a note of caution is necessary when trying to move from mouse studies to human trials. Some efforts that work in humans do not seem to work in mice.删除4：<u>32,35</u> For example, glucocorticosteroids and HDAC5 inhibitors worked with human, but not mouse, cells and it is possible that certain efforts that work in mice will not work with humans, or the timing differences for optimal efficacy may vary. The only way to know for sure is to do the experiments and then test them to determine if they work in humans.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:41:05", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:41:26", "cost": 20.54}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:33", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:41:26", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:41:05"}

In contrast, the -137G/C polymorphism may increase the risk of TA, and thus is a risk factor. At the -607 position, the risk of occurrence of TA was decreased by about 47% in individuals carrying the A allele compared with carriers of the C allele. At the -137 position, the risk of occurrence of TA was increased by about 57% in individuals carrying the C allele compared with carriers of the G allele. However, the -607C/A and -137G/C SNPs in IL18 were not associated with activity of TA (active or quiescent stage).\nIL18 is mainly generated by monocyte-macrophage cells and can induce proliferation of T helper 1 cells. It not only stimulates production of interferon-γ, but also induces tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-2 synthesis, which may enhance Fas and its ligand-mediated cytotoxicity effect. Therefore, IL18 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine with multiple biologic functions involved in antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and autoimmune mechanisms.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7,8]</u>\nThe IL18-607C/A and -137G/C polymorphisms significantly affect expression levels and plasma concentrations of IL18.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u> Patients with the active state of TA show increased levels of IL18 compared with patients with the quiescent state.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> However, on the genetic level, our data did not indicate show correlations of IL18-607C/A and -137G/C polymorphisms and activity of TA under the dominant, additive, or recessive models.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that SNPs in the IL18 gene promoter region at positions -607 and -137 are involved in many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]</u> Carriers of the A allele at position -607 have a 28% increased risk of chronic hepatitis B.

Lee et al通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> found that IL18-607C/A and -137G/C SNPs were susceptibility genes for Behcet disease in a Korean population. However, Jang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> reported no such correlation in a Korean population.\nOur results showed that under the dominant model, the risk of TA was decreased by about 47% in individuals carrying the A allele at the -607C/A SNP (P = 0.005). After adjusting for risk factors, the risk of TA was decreased by about 47% (P = 0.010). Under the additive model, the risk of TA decreased by about 68% in carriers of the A allele (P = 0.011). After adjusting for risk factors, the risk of TA decreased by about 73% (P = 0.051).\nFor the -137G/C SNP, under the dominant model, the risk of TA was increased by about 66% in individuals carrying the C allele (P = 0.005). After adjusting for risk factors, the risk of TA was increased by about 57% (P = 0.022). Under the additive model, the risk of TA increased by about 55% in carriers of the C allele (P = 0.001). After adjusting for risk factors, the risk of TA increased by about 47% (P = 0.012). These findings confirmed that IL18-607C/A may decrease the risk of TA, and thus is a protective factor, whereas the -137G/C SNP may increase the risk of TA, and thus is a risk factor.\nAlthough we confirmed the importance of the IL18-607C/A and -137G/C SNPs in TA, there are some limitations to this study, as follows. First, the correlations might be caused by synergistic interactions with other SNPs in the same gene or in other candidate genes. Moreover, the study subjects may not fully represent the Chinese Han population, and population stratification can cause false-positive results. These results need to be verified in other countries and populations, with a larger sample size and additional prospective cohort studies. Finally, the potential functional mechanism of the IL18 gene needs to be further elucidated.\nThe IL18-607C/A gene polymorphism may decrease the risk of TA, and thus is a protective factor, whereas -137G/C may increase the risk of TA, and thus is a risk factor.

Moreover, all patients provided written informed consent.\nThe neoadjuvant chemotherapy plan used to treat osteosarcoma in our department is preoperative chemotherapy, surgery, and postoperative chemotherapy. Commonly used chemotherapy drugs are HD-MTX, ifosfamide, cisplatin, and adriamycin. Hydration and alkalinization are implemented 12 h before MTX infusion using 200 ml of 5% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), 10 ml of 15% potassium chloride, as well as 1 L of 5% glucose and 5% glucose and normal saline (GNS). At the end of the first stage of hydration and alkalinization, 5% glucose and 5% GNS (1 L) + 5% NaHCO3 (100 ml) + vincristine (2 mg) is administered. The next day, MTX (10 g/m2) is added to 5% glucose (500 ml) and infused for 4–6 h. After completion of MTX infusion for 6–8 h, leucovorin rescue (12 mg, q6h) is started until the serum concentration of MTX falls to 0.05 µmol/L. If delayed excretion occurs, the leucovorin dose is increased. During chemotherapy, the patient is given NaHCO3 tablets (1.0 g, p.o. tid) and allopurinol (200 mg, p.o. tid). Then, 24-h urine output is recorded, and urine pH controlled to lie within the range of 7–9.\nAfter MTX infusion for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h, contralateral venous blood (2 ml) was taken. If the serum concentration of MTX at 72 h (C72 h) was >0.05 µmol/L, an additional 2 ml of contralateral venous blood was obtained every 24 h until the serum concentration of MTX decreased to <0.05 µmol/L.\nPatients were grouped by age as \"children\" (≤14 years) and \"adults\" (>14 years), as well as by the number of chemotherapy cycles received (1–3 and 4–11 cycles).\nDelayed excretion of MTX was defined as C24 h > 5 µmol/L after MTX infusion, in accordance with the literatures.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> C24 h of 5–20 µmol/L was classified as \"mild–moderate\" delayed excretion, and C24 h >20 µmol/L as \"severe\" delayed excretion.\nData were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

The incidences of delayed excretion (C24 h > 5 µmol/L) and severe delayed excretion (C24 h > 20 µmol/L) of MTX among these 1277 patients after administration of HD-MTX chemotherapy were 6.19% and 0.86%, and 2.31 % and 0.26% of the 4291 chemotherapy cycles in total, respectively. These data are in accordance with the results of a retrospective study of 790 osteosarcoma patients by Bacci et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> who also classified C24 h > 5 µmol/L and C24 h > 20 µmol/L as delayed excretion and severe delayed excretion of MTX, respectively. The incidences of delayed excretion and severe delayed excretion of MTX reported in their study were 8.7% and 0.4%, respectively.\nEvaluation of the 11 patients with severe delayed excretion of MTX revealed that severe delayed excretion of MTX was associated with gender. The incidence of severe delayed excretion of MTX in female patients (1.75%) was significantly higher than that in male patients (0.37%). For the 79 patients with delayed excretion of MTX, no significant difference was observed between males and females with regard to the incidence of delayed excretion of MTX. This finding may be related (at least in part) to the male:female ratio (821:456) of the 1277 patients in our study. Few studies on patients treated with HD-MTX have reported the influence of gender on pharmacokinetic parameters or delayed excretion of MTX. Several studies have explored the influence of gender on the efficacy/toxicity of HD-MTX chemotherapy. For instance, Holmboe et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> evaluated retrospectively 288 cycles of the HD-MTX chemotherapy received by 65 osteosarcoma patients. The female:male ratio with regard to the maximum concentration of alanine transaminase was 1.7:1.0. Gender was one of the factors influencing liver toxicity but did not influence renal toxicity or delayed excretion of MTX.\nWe also found an association between age and severe delayed excretion of MTX. The incidence of severe delayed excretion of MTX in children (1.56%) was significantly higher than that in adults (0.39%). However, of the 79 patients with delayed excretion of MTX, the incidence of delayed excretion of MTX in adults (6.8%) was higher than that in children (5.27%). This difference may be explained by the small number of patients 通用删除7(英):<u>(11)</u> with severe delayed excretion of MTX. Wang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> studied pharmacokinetics in osteosarcoma patients of different age groups (≤10, 11–14, 15–17, and ≥18 years) and identified the influence of age on the MTX concentration in serum. Using an identical dose of MTX, they found that the younger the age of patients, the lower was the serum concentration of MTX they had 6 and 24 h after MTX administration and, therefore, the lower the risk of delayed excretion.\nIn the study by Bacci et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> the number of cycles of HD-MTX chemotherapy received by 790 patients was 1–10. They reported that the risk of delayed excretion of MTX during the first three cycles was significantly greater than that during subsequent cycles, and that severe delayed excretion of MTX was not observed after the 5th cycle. Of the 99 cases of delayed excretion of MTX observed in the present study, 70 occurred during the first three cycles and 29 occurred after the 3rd cycle. Of the 11 cases of severe delayed excretion of MTX, 9 occurred during the first three cycles and 2 occurred after the 3rd cycle, but a significant difference was not observed. This finding may be related to the samples included in the studies: Of the 4291 cycles of chemotherapy in the present study, the ratio of 1–3 cycles and 4–11 cycles was 3020:1271, whereas in the study by Bacci et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> the ratio in the 4219 cycles they used was 2324:1895.\nOf the 11 patients with severe delayed excretion of MTX, 7 were found to have C24 h >50 µmol/L. The emergency management plan was initiated immediately if C24 h >50 µmol/L was reported. The attending physician implemented treatment with close monitoring of the patient to prevent severe, irreversible damage. Simultaneously, the frequency and dose of leucovorin rescue were increased with continuous hydration and alkalinization to maintain urine pH at 7–9 to eliminate MTX as quickly as possible. All 11 patients reached the standard of MTX excretion (serum concentration <0.05 µmol/L) within 7–28 days and proceeded to the next cycle of chemotherapy.\nTreatments for delayed excretion of MTX include supportive care, appropriate dose of leucovorin, blood purification, and carboxypeptidase G2 (CPDG2) administration.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u> Hemodialysis, blood perfusion, and peritoneal dialysis can also be used for rescue of HD-MTX chemotherapy, but they can increase the risks of other complications (e.g. bleeding, infection) in cancer patients.

In the present study, patients with delayed excretion of MTX were found to have significantly higher values of C0 h and C24 h than patients with normal excretion. Furthermore, the C24 h of patients with severe delayed excretion of MTX was significantly higher than that of patients with mild–moderate delayed excretion of MTX. Therefore, the C24 h can be an indicator of the need to increase the frequency and dose of leucovorin.\n删除3：<u>This study was supported by the grants from the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission for Capital Characteristic Clinical Application Program 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. Z13110700220000 and No. Z131107002213029)</u>.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Data are shown as median 通用删除11(英):(P25, P75).

Moreover, all patients provided written informed consent.\nThe neoadjuvant chemotherapy plan used to treat osteosarcoma in our department is preoperative chemotherapy, surgery, and postoperative chemotherapy. Commonly used chemotherapy drugs are HD-MTX, ifosfamide, cisplatin, and adriamycin. Hydration and alkalinization are implemented 12 h before MTX infusion using 200 ml of 5% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), 10 ml of 15% potassium chloride, as well as 1 L of 5% glucose and 5% glucose and normal saline (GNS). At the end of the first stage of hydration and alkalinization, 5% glucose and 5% GNS (1 L) + 5% NaHCO3 (100 ml) + vincristine (2 mg) is administered. The next day, MTX (10 g/m2) is added to 5% glucose (500 ml) and infused for 4–6 h. After completion of MTX infusion for 6–8 h, leucovorin rescue (12 mg, q6h) is started until the serum concentration of MTX falls to 0.05 µmol/L. If delayed excretion occurs, the leucovorin dose is increased. During chemotherapy, the patient is given NaHCO3 tablets (1.0 g, p.o. tid) and allopurinol (200 mg, p.o. tid). Then, 24-h urine output is recorded, and urine pH controlled to lie within the range of 7–9.\nAfter MTX infusion for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h, contralateral venous blood (2 ml) was taken. If the serum concentration of MTX at 72 h (C72 h) was >0.05 µmol/L, an additional 2 ml of contralateral venous blood was obtained every 24 h until the serum concentration of MTX decreased to <0.05 µmol/L.\nPatients were grouped by age as \"children\" (≤14 years) and \"adults\" (>14 years), as well as by the number of chemotherapy cycles received (1–3 and 4–11 cycles).\nDelayed excretion of MTX was defined as C24 h > 5 µmol/L after MTX infusion, in accordance with the literatures.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> C24 h of 5–20 µmol/L was classified as \"mild–moderate\" delayed excretion, and C24 h >20 µmol/L as \"severe\" delayed excretion.\nData were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

MTX: Methotrexate.\nWe assessed retrospectively the HD-MTX chemotherapy that 1277 osteosarcoma patients received in the past 6 years in our department. The incidences of delayed excretion (C24 h > 5 µmol/L) and severe delayed excretion (C24 h > 20 µmol/L) of MTX among these 1277 patients after administration of HD-MTX chemotherapy were 6.19% and 0.86%, and 2.31 % and 0.26% of the 4291 chemotherapy cycles in total, respectively. These data are in accordance with the results of a retrospective study of 790 osteosarcoma patients by Bacci et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> who also classified C24 h > 5 µmol/L and C24 h > 20 µmol/L as delayed excretion and severe delayed excretion of MTX, respectively. The incidences of delayed excretion and severe delayed excretion of MTX reported in their study were 8.7% and 0.4%, respectively.\nEvaluation of the 11 patients with severe delayed excretion of MTX revealed that severe delayed excretion of MTX was associated with gender. The incidence of severe delayed excretion of MTX in female patients (1.75%) was significantly higher than that in male patients (0.37%). For the 79 patients with delayed excretion of MTX, no significant difference was observed between males and females with regard to the incidence of delayed excretion of MTX. This finding may be related (at least in part) to the male:female ratio (821:456) of the 1277 patients in our study. Few studies on patients treated with HD-MTX have reported the influence of gender on pharmacokinetic parameters or delayed excretion of MTX. Several studies have explored the influence of gender on the efficacy/toxicity of HD-MTX chemotherapy. For instance, Holmboe et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> evaluated retrospectively 288 cycles of the HD-MTX chemotherapy received by 65 osteosarcoma patients. The female:male ratio with regard to the maximum concentration of alanine transaminase was 1.7:1.0. Gender was one of the factors influencing liver toxicity but did not influence renal toxicity or delayed excretion of MTX.\nWe also found an association between age and severe delayed excretion of MTX. The incidence of severe delayed excretion of MTX in children (1.56%) was significantly higher than that in adults (0.39%). However, of the 79 patients with delayed excretion of MTX, the incidence of delayed excretion of MTX in adults (6.8%) was higher than that in children (5.27%). This difference may be explained by the small number of patients 通用删除7(英):<u>(11)</u> with severe delayed excretion of MTX. Wang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> studied pharmacokinetics in osteosarcoma patients of different age groups (≤10, 11–14, 15–17, and ≥18 years) and identified the influence of age on the MTX concentration in serum. Using an identical dose of MTX, they found that the younger the age of patients, the lower was the serum concentration of MTX they had 6 and 24 h after MTX administration and, therefore, the lower the risk of delayed excretion.\nIn the study by Bacci et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> the number of cycles of HD-MTX chemotherapy received by 790 patients was 1–10. They reported that the risk of delayed excretion of MTX during the first three cycles was significantly greater than that during subsequent cycles, and that severe delayed excretion of MTX was not observed after the 5th cycle. Of the 99 cases of delayed excretion of MTX observed in the present study, 70 occurred during the first three cycles and 29 occurred after the 3rd cycle. Of the 11 cases of severe delayed excretion of MTX, 9 occurred during the first three cycles and 2 occurred after the 3rd cycle, but a significant difference was not observed. This finding may be related to the samples included in the studies: Of the 4291 cycles of chemotherapy in the present study, the ratio of 1–3 cycles and 4–11 cycles was 3020:1271, whereas in the study by Bacci et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> the ratio in the 4219 cycles they used was 2324:1895.\nOf the 11 patients with severe delayed excretion of MTX, 7 were found to have C24 h >50 µmol/L. The emergency management plan was initiated immediately if C24 h >50 µmol/L was reported. The attending physician implemented treatment with close monitoring of the patient to prevent severe, irreversible damage. Simultaneously, the frequency and dose of leucovorin rescue were increased with continuous hydration and alkalinization to maintain urine pH at 7–9 to eliminate MTX as quickly as possible. All 11 patients reached the standard of MTX excretion (serum concentration <0.05 µmol/L) within 7–28 days and proceeded to the next cycle of chemotherapy.\nTreatments for delayed excretion of MTX include supportive care, appropriate dose of leucovorin, blood purification, and carboxypeptidase G2 (CPDG2) administration.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u> Hemodialysis, blood perfusion, and peritoneal dialysis can also be used for rescue of HD-MTX chemotherapy, but they can increase the risks of other complications (e.g. bleeding, infection) in cancer patients. Cavone et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> reported on CPDG2 use in the rescue from HD-MTX toxicity, but its safety has not been studied fully and, therefore, it is not used in China. The 11 patients all reached the standard for MTX excretion after sufficient leucovorin rescue without the need for invasive treatment, and potentially pathogenic complications were not observed.\nSeveral studies have shown that the peak concentration in serum (Cmax) can be an indicator of the pharmacologic effect to predict the efficacy of HD-MTX treatment for osteosarcoma.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,15,16]</u> In general, a better prognosis can be obtained if the Cmax 4 h after administration can be controlled at 1000–1500 µmol/L. In addition, given the incomplete understanding of the mechanism of the metabolism and clearance of MTX, the serum concentration of MTX can be an indicator for determination of delayed excretion and used to guide the dose and frequency of leucovorin administration. In the present study, patients with delayed excretion of MTX were found to have significantly higher values of C0 h and C24 h than patients with normal excretion. Furthermore, the C24 h of patients with severe delayed excretion of MTX was significantly higher than that of patients with mild–moderate delayed excretion of MTX. Therefore, the C24 h can be an indicator of the need to increase the frequency and dose of leucovorin.\n删除3：<u>This study was supported by the grants from the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission for Capital Characteristic Clinical Application Program 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. Z13110700220000 and No. Z131107002213029)</u>.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "index": 9334, "show": true, "start": 9334, "end": 9399, "province": ["语义有效性", "语句/字词重复"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:19:55", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:20:31", "cost": 35.393}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:33", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:20:30", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:19:54"}

With the improvement of its techniques and methods, CRRT is currently widely used in the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) and for fluid management, metabolic solute management, and exogenous solute management. CRRT has good hemodynamic tolerance, especially suitable for patients with severe hemodynamic instability, so it plays an important role in the field of critical care medicine. Since AKI and fluid overload are often found to be associated with hemodynamic abnormalities such as shock and heart failure, determining the relationship between CRRT and hemodynamics remains a challenge in the treatment of critically ill patients. Therefore, the aim of this review was to summarize key points in the relationship between CRRT and hemodynamics and to understand and monitor renal hemodynamics in critically ill patients, especially those with AKI.\nAlthough it is well established that the occurrence of AKI in critically ill patients can significantly increase mortality, the incidence of AKI in the intensive care unit (ICU) remains high. The kidneys are vital organs, and appropriate preload (flow and pressure) and afterload (central venous pressure [CVP] and venous congestion) are required to maintain their normal functions.\nRenal blood flow is autoregulatory under healthy conditions. That is, regardless of fluctuations in blood pressure, the autoregulatory mechanisms of the kidneys maintain renal blood flow at a relatively stable level if arterial pressure is within the average range of 80–180 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). However, this autoregulation is no longer effective when blood pressure is outside of normal range and in some critical situations. A study examining the factors that contribute to the occurrence of AKI in critically ill patients found that direct circulation dysfunction (including hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock)-induced AKI accounts for 47.3% of all cases ofAKI.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> In addition, Poukkanen et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> showed that time-adjusted mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 73 mmHg, the use of dobutamine within the first 24 h in the ICU, and the highest lactate value during the first 24 h can accelerate the progression of AKI in patients with severe sepsis. These findings clearly demonstrated that renal injury is closely associated with hemodynamics, and the use of CRRT for accurate quantitative volume management can therefore provide prompt improvement in renal perfusion.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Since CRRT reduces further deterioration of renal function, and consequently the dependence on dialysis through maintenance of hemodynamic stability, the application of CRRT is highly recommended in severe AKI patients, especially for those with hemodynamic unstability.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\nCVP is the backward-pressure target for organ protection, and \"MAP-CVP\" is commonly used to represent renal perfusion pressure. Renal perfusion pressure gradually decreases along the path of blood flow. Since the average glomerular capillary pressure is around 50 mmHg and renal tubular capillary pressure is 10 mmHg, greater CVP (renal afterload) indicates greater renal resistance. High CVP increases renal afterload but not perfusion flow, and therefore reduces renal perfusion. A previous study showed that high CVP might increase the occurrence and morbidity of AKI in patients with septic shock. In addition, an excessively high CVP should be prevented, especially when it approaches 10 mmHg.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Another study found that the occurrence of AKI is linearly correlated with CVP in patients with severe sepsis such that the risk of AKI increases with increasing CVP.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> A study of 105 septic shock patients by Wang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> showed that CVP is closely associated with renal function. Patients with septic shock with high CVP (CVP >12 mmHg) had higher levels of serum creatinine (SCr) compared with those with low CVP (CVP <8 mmHg) on day 5, and patients whose CVP dropped to <8 mmHg within 7 days had a higher 28-day survival rate. This suggests that maintaining CVP <8 mmHg during the early phase of septic shock can prevent further damage to renal function and improve the survival rate of critically ill patients.\nVenous congestion, commonly caused by right-sided heart failure, can also lead to obstruction of venous reflux, which results in elevated renal vein pressure and reduced glomerular filtration rate and ultimately leads to the occurrence of AKI. Using transthoracic echocardiography, Guinot et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> assessed the right ventricular function of patients with AKI undergoing cardiac surgery. They found that the occurrence of early postoperative right ventricular dysfunction was significantly associated with elevated SCr, indicating that the main cause of AKI is not reduced cardiac output but venous congestion.\nFluid overload (defined as fluid accumulation of over 10% of baseline weight within a given period of time) is a phenomenon that commonly occurs in critically ill patients. It not only causes renal vein pressure elevation and renal interstitial edema, but also leads to reduced renal perfusion, which increases intraglomerular pressure and leads to sustained AKI.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> In \"Critical Hemodynamic Therapy-Beijing Consensus,\" Liu et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> indicated that volume overload can lead to impaired renal perfusion and deterioration of AKI. A recently serial research indicate fluid status abnormalities were common among patients receiving CRRT. Different types of fluid status corresponded to different clinical conditions and treatment outcomes, and in patients with AKI, a higher degree of fluid overload at RRT initiation predicts worse renal recovery at 1 year.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u> Similarly, a study on patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome demonstrated that positive fluid balance is closely associated with the occurrence of AKI.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> In contrast, when negative fluid balance increases during CRRT, the probability of renal function recovery in AKI patients also increases.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Therefore, by precise titration of fluid balance using CRRT during the volume management of severe AKI patients, renal interstitial edema is reduced. In turn, the rate of recovery of renal function and survival in these patients can improve significantly.\nFinally, CRRT can timely correct solute abnormalities (such as hyperchloremia, and hypernatremia caused by various factors). All these contributes to the maintenance of a stable internal environment in critically ill patients and reduces further renal injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>\nIn summary, CRRT can be used to treat AKI by hemodynamic therapy.\n\"Volume\" often refers to the total volume in the circulatory system, including cardiac preload. However, volume management of critically ill patients not only includes fluid in the circulatory system, but also those in interstitial fluid.\nA previous study demonstrated that up to 70% of critically ill patients in the ICU have fluid overload.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> In critically ill patient immediate reverse resuscitation is required for those with fluid and volume overload. In cases of postoperative congestive heart failure and patients with pericarditis, rapid elevation of the circulating volume in these patients causes rapid expansion of the right ventricle, which then pushes the interventricular septum leftward and restricts left ventricular filling, which results in reduced cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion. If urine output decreases and diuretics are ineffective in removing the excess fluid, emergency mechanical fluid removal (i.e. CRRT) should be performed.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>\nCRRT precisely regulates fluid, and is simple to operate. Therefore, it is suitable for precise adjustments of fluid removal rate in the management of fluid overload in different diseases. For example, in patients with cardiorenal syndrome, negative fluid balance should be established as early as possible, and dehydration can be slowed once lung edema is reduced. For septic shock patients, slow dehydration should only be performed after they are clinically stable to limit further accumulation of body fluids. Dehydration of patients with kidney damage can be conducted at a faster rate than that of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. While CRRT can maintain fluid balance, it is also an indispensable method for correcting fluid overload, an outcome that is especially vital for the fluid management of critically ill patients with complications from cardiac insufficiency.\nIn summary, CRRT is not only a treatment for AKI and a substitute for organ function, but it is also an important technique in hemodynamic therapy that focuses on managing fluid overload and stabilizing hemodynamics in critically ill patients.\nCRRT is a powerful tool for hemodynamic therapy, and corresponding therapeutic hemodynamic targets should be established when it is used.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>\nCVP is a simple indicator for evaluating preload. Although CVP is not a perfect indicator, its value is easily obtained, and it is always the first indicator to be examined and intervened. Dynamic changes in CVP can accurately reflect relative changes in blood volume and provide guidance for adjustment of dehydration rate during CRRT. Therefore, CVP might represent a preferred target in hemodynamic therapy during CRRT. Moreover, the degree of venous congestion can be immediately observed by measurement of changes in the diameter of the inferior vena cava before and after volume therapy and its variability during respiration using ultrasonography. Such changes in inferior vena cava diameter prompt adjustments of the dehydration rate.\nPrevious studies found that heart failure is a major risk factor of AKI, as 30% of patients with heart failure are also accompanied by renal insufficiency. Hence, greater care should be taken when conducting fluid management by CRRT in patients with cardiac insufficiency,通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u> especially those with right ventricular dysfunction. When the right ventricular end-diastolic pressure becomes greater than the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, the interventricular septum bends toward the left ventricle, leading to decreased left ventricular filling and reduced cardiac output that ultimately result in circulatory fluctuations. However, if dehydration therapy is conducted immediately to reduce the right ventricular pressure, cardiac output will elevate again. During this process, critial ultrasound can be used to monitor immediate changes in the right ventricle and interventricular septum to allow prompt reverse volume resuscitation and maintain hemodynamic stability. Reverse volume resuscitation also plays an important role in special cardiac cases, such as valvular vegetation, the identification of which is equally reliant on the use of critial ultrasound.\nFurthermore, lung ultrasound has a role in volume monitoring. When lung tissue fluid increases, \"comet-tails\" perpendicular to the pleura, otherwise known as the B-lines, can be observed by lung ultrasound. The number, density, and distribution of B-lines are closely associated with the extent of extravascular lung water, and different B-line characteristics represent different levels of water content in the lungs.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> A study using lung ultrasound to predict pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) showed that patients with A-predominance have lower PAWP, while patients with B-predominance have higher PAWP, which indicates interstitial edema.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> Since changes in B-lines occur with negative fluid balance during the treatment of lung edema, continuous assessment of their changes can help to determine treatment efficacy and guide treatment speed and effectiveness. In addition, ongoing studies have demonstrated that continuous assessment of B-lines in the lung during fluid therapy allows for early identification of increasing extravascular lung water, which prevents excessive fluid resuscitation.\nFluid overload can induce edema in abdominal organs and reduce abdominal wall compliance, resulting in high intraperitoneal pressure that affects not only renal venous return, but induces or exacerbates AKI. However, the use of CRRT in these cases can reduce edema through dehydration and achieve lower intraperitoneal pressure. Therefore, intraperitoneal pressure becomes the target of hemodynamic therapy at the moment.\nIn summary, corresponding therapeutic hemodynamic targets should be established when using CRRT.\nReduction of blood pressure and further deterioration of renal function are sometimes inevitable during CRRT. A previous study demonstrated that 43% of critically ill patients undergoing initial CRRT presented with new onset hypotension within 1 h of beginning treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> As previously mentioned, the duration of MAP <73 mmHg can accelerate the progression of AKI.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Therefore, maintaining circulatory stability is especially important during CRRT.\nIt is important to note that the fluid therapy phase of patients (recovery phase, optimal phase, stable phase, and withdrawal phase) must be known before conducting fluid management.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> Body fluid distribution should be accurately evaluated to select appropriate fluid therapy measures and goals. A previous study suggested using bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) in the clinical evaluation of volume balance.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Samoni et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> also demonstrated that the prognostic prediction of patients in the ICU who had been evaluated by BIVA for body fluid distribution was superior to conventional methods of recording fluid balance. Hence, it can be used to accurately guide fluid therapy by CRRT.\nClose monitoring of hemodynamics should be conducted. Due to the unpredictable nature of hemodynamic changes in some patients undergoing CRRT, close hemodynamic monitoring is advised to reduce hemodynamic fluctuations as much as possible. This relates to the issue as to how monitoring should be conducted. A previous study showed that the use of monitoring tools, such as transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), can provide better management of fluid therapy, etiology, and speed.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Another study found that ultrasound determination of the inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD) and its collapsibility index (IVCCI) could be used to optimize the fluid removal rate while avoiding hypotension during slow continuous ultrafiltration (SCUF). Therefore, they can be used in the management and monitoring of circulation during CRRT.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>\nEffective preventative measures should be taken. As a form of establishing extracorporeal circulation, the occurrence of hemodynamic stability during CRRT is closely associated with changes in blood flow and circulating volume. Therefore, circulatory fluctuations might be prevented if the time for increasing the blood pump speed is reduced appropriately at the beginning of CRRT. Eastwood et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> compared the effect of two different sets of parameters for regulating pump speed at the beginning of CRRT (blood pump speed increases of 50 ml/min over 1- 4 min vs. 20- 50 ml/min over 3- 10 min) on circulation and found that slower adjustment of pump speed at the start of CRRT was not only better for stabilizing circulation compared with the conventional method, but also reduced the incidence of low blood pressure and prevented further damage to renal function.\nFinally, monitoring of CRRT-related fluid balance should be performed. The set of replacement and dehydration speed during CRRT should be reassessed periodically by monitoring cardiac output and volume status so that timely adjustments can be made in response to reduced or excessive circulating volume.\nIt was reported in \"Critical Hemodynamic Therapy-Beijing Consensus\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> that organ specificity is an important basis for establishing the targets of hemodynamic therapy. Moreover, the targets of hemodynamic therapy differ for different organs because of their specific requirements. As the most susceptible organs under pathophysiological conditions (such as during shock), the kidneys have more stringent requirements for the maintenance of hemodynamic stability. Changes in renal function are also somewhat reflective of changes in hemodynamics. Therefore, close assessment of renal blood flow and perfusion represents an organ-directed target for hemodynamic therapy.\nIt is an important issue how to more accurately assess renal blood flow. As a noninvasive method, ultrasound is commonly used by ICU physicians to assess renal blood flow in critically ill patients. Renal blood flow can be examined by various types of ultrasound, including color Doppler ultrasound, pulse Doppler ultrasound, power Doppler ultrasound (PDU), and contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Moreover, researchers in the field of AKI and CRRT are investigating the potential application of the newly developed ultrasonic dynamic evaluation perfusion technique.\nChanges in renal perfusion can be detected by monitoring renal blood flow using color Doppler ultrasound.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> By monitoring renal blood flow in AKI patients using PDU, Chen et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> confirmed that PDU is a suitable technique for monitoring renal blood flow in AKI patients, and the PDU score can be used for assessing the severity and prognosis of AKI. In addition, Doppler ultrasound can also be applied to measure resistance index(RI) to reflect renal artery blood flow to a certain degree. A previous study found that changes in RI (measured by ultrasound) during fluid challenge were associated with increased urine volume and appeared earlier than changes in urine volume.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> In contrast, another study showed that there was no correlation between RI and stroke volume before and after the fluid challenge in sepsis patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> A study by Zhang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> indicated that increasing cardiac output and MAP, without significantly increasing CVP, can increase renal blood flow score, and therefore improve renal perfusion. As more studies are being performed on contrast-enhanced ultrasound using microbubbles as contrast agent, many investigators are beginning to recognize its value in evaluating renal microcirculation and blood perfusion.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>\nAlthough there are a considerable number of studies related to renal hemodynamics, further studies are still required to help and guide the development and improvement of hemodynamic therapy.\nCRRT is closely associated with hemodynamics. It is not only a replacement for organ function, but also an important form of hemodynamic therapy. Improved hemodynamic management of critically ill patients can be achieved by establishing clear therapeutic hemodynamic targets and maintaining circulatory stability during CRRT. Finally, close observation of renal hemodynamics will provide greater opportunities for the development and progression of CRRT associated hemodynamic therapy.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:38:05", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:38:37", "cost": 32.119}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:33", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:38:37", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:38:04"}

The most recently reported incidence of TB in China was 94 per 1 million, and the morbidity rate was 68 per 10 million. In 2015, low- and middle-income countries spent the equivalent of about 80 billion US dollars in TB control, 8% of which was used for the development of rapid TB detection methods and laboratory equipments. The World Health Organization has put forward a new strategy \"Stop TB\" on the basis of the \"Containment of TB strategy\" .通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>\nUnfortunately, the diagnosis of TB remains a challenge, particularly in China. In China, about 70% of TB patients have negative bacteriological findings, which makes TB difficult to diagnose.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Conventional TB diagnosis relies on percutaneous needle lung biopsy or bronchoscopic biopsy. These are invasive methods, which carry a risk of bleeding, pneumothorax, and seeding of the bacterium along the needle path. Further, the positive rate of those methods is <20%, and these methods cannot be applied in patients with a poor general condition.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u> An alternative is the purified protein derivative (PPD) test, which can be implemented easily, but is highly dependent on the patients’ immune function. A delayed allergic reaction and previous Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination can lead to false-positive PPD results, whereas immune suppression, HIV coinfection, other recent infections, malnutrition, and a very young or old age can yield false-negative PPD results.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u> Moreover, the sensitivity of PPD is significantly decreased in low- and middle-income countries.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> T-SPOT®.TB is a new technology, with high sensitivity and specificity for TB, theoretically up to 98% and 99%, respectively. In 2009, it was certified by the American Food and Drug Administration. In 2015, the Editorial Board of the Chinese Journal of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases, a branch of the Chinese Medical Association, recommended that T-SPOT®.TB could be used as a complementary and supplementary diagnostic tool for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> The present study investigated the effectiveness of T-SPOT®.TB in distinguishing between active, previous TB, and non-TB patients and assessed the diagnostic power of T-SPOT®.TB for active TB.\nWe conducted this retrospective study with the approval of the Ethics Committee of Henan Province People’s Hospital. The patients who attended the Department of Respiratory and Critical Medicine of Henan Province People’s Hospital from June 2015 to June 2016 and underwent T-SPOT®.TB assays were recruited for the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age >18 years; admitted to the group through telephone counseling; typical TB symptoms and/or signs such as cough, expectoration, hemoptysis, fever, emaciation, fatigue, and night sweats; and chest radiographs revealed nodules, cavities, cysts, calcifications, contours of the large bronchi, and vascular details in the lung parenchyma or other parts. Patients were excluded if they were without a clear diagnosis; had no etiology or histopathological data; had severe pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe hemoptysis, or other severe respiratory diseases; had severe immunosuppression (such as HIV or continuous use of corticosteroids [e.g. ≥30 mg prednisone daily for more than 2 weeks]); or had ambiguous T-SPOT®.TB and tuberculin skin test (TST) results.\nTB was diagnosed according to the Centers for Disease Control Prevention guidelines: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Clinically active TB: This group consisted of patients with clinically active TB who had undergone complete diagnostic procedures, regardless of any previous TB history. This was established most definitively by isolation of MTB. In the absence of a positive culture for MTB, persons in this class had to have a positive reaction to the TST (with no BCG vaccination or previous TB), clinical or radiographic evidence of current TB, or had to have been cured after standard anti-TB treatment. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Previous TB: This group consisted of patients with a history of the previous episode(s) of TB or abnormal radiographic findings in a person with a positive reaction to the TST, negative bacteriologic studies (if these were performed), and no clinical and/or radiographic evidence of current disease. Any patients with a history of TB were included in this group, regardless of whether they had received chemotherapy. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Non-TB: This group consisted of patients with pathological findings showing a clear tumor, inflammation, or other diseases and included individuals in whom other diseases were clinically diagnosed, after the appropriate treatment or follow-up.\nIn cases where the diagnosis was unclear and the patients had no BCG vaccination or previous TB, we performed a TST. The TST was administered by experienced, trained staff. In the TST, 0.1 ml (5 IU) of PPD reagent (Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co. Ltd. China) was injected intracutaneously into the forearm. After 72 h, two doctors measured the diameter of induration; these clinicians were blinded to other patient information. An average induration diameter of >5 mm was considered a positive result.\nFor this assay, 5 ml of peripheral venous blood was collected and immersed in heparin lithium anticoagulant tubes. The T-SPOT®.TB kit was supplied by Oxford Immunotec (Abingdon, UK), and testing procedures were implemented strictly according to the kit manual. The deep blue spots were counted as described by the manufacturer to determine the results. Criteria: The positive result: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> The negative control hole spot points were 0–5, and (A antigen or B antigen spot points) – (the negative control hole spot points) ≥6; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> while the negative control hole spots ≥6, and (A antigen or antigen B spot points) ≥2 times (the negative control hole spots); the negative result does not meet the positive criteria, and the control hole of aseptic phytohemagglutinin is normal.\nTwo trained laboratory workers judged the results of the T-SPOT®.TB assay and the final diagnosis according to the reference standard at the same time, in a double-blinded manner. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 17.0 (International Business Machines Corporation, USA). Measurement data were expressed as a mean ± standard deviation (SD). We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of T-SPOT®.TB in all patients diagnosed with active TB including the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and Youden index. We also generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of T-SPOT®.TB data for the diagnosis of active and previous TB and determined the optimal cutoff value for diagnosis. We compared the differences between the TB groups using Kruskal − Wallis rank sum test. All tests were two sided, and P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant differences.\nWe initially enrolled 510 cases; however, after reviewing the recorded test data, we excluded sixty cases: 16 cases did not have a clear diagnosis, 24 cases had neither pathological nor bacteriological data, 11 cases had severe respiratory disease, three cases had HIV, and six cases had no definite TST results. Finally, 450 patients were included (296 men and 154 women). Their age ranged from 18 to 91 years (average 51.9 ± 19.7 years). Among the 450 cases, 132 cases (33%) had active TB, 257 cases (64%) were non-TB patients, and 61 cases (3%) had previous TB.\nOverall, 244 cases (55%) were T-SPOT®.TB positive and 206 cases (45%) were T-SPOT®.TB negative. In the active TB group, 14 cases were negative for T-SPOT®.TB and 118 cases were positive for T-SPOT®.TB; this group included 76 cases of pulmonary, 31 pleural, 8 meningeal, 2 endobronchial, 6 abdominal, 4 lymph node, and 5 spinal TB. In the non-TB group, 95 cases were positive for T-SPOT®.TB and 162 were negative for T-SPOT®.TB; these included 144 cases of infectious diseases, 52 cases with tumors, and 64 cases with another diagnosis such as noninfectious fever, interstitial pneumonia, bronchiectasis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In the previous TB group, 31 cases were positive for T-SPOT®.TB and 30 cases were negative; this group included 37 cases with lung infection, 12 cases with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 12 cases with another diagnosis 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.\nResults of T-SPOT®.TB assay in each group\n删除重复语句：<u>Results of T-SPOT®.TB assay in each group</u>\nTB: Tuberculosis; SD: Standard deviation; SFCs: Spot-forming cells.\nThe sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and the negative likelihood ratio of the T-SPOT®.TB assay in the active TB group were 89.78%, 63.16%, 0.56, 0.92, 2.47, and 0.16, respectively. Youden index was 0.53.\nThe values of A antigen and B antigen in the active TB group ranked 204.57 and 198.68, respectively.

There was a significant difference in A antigen (χ2 = 106.93, P < 0.01) and B antigen (χ2 = 91.47, P < 0.01) ranks among the three groups. Upon closer examination, the differences in A and B antigens between the active TB and previous TB (A antigen: χ2 = 12.99, P < 0.01 and antigen B: χ2 = 8.56, P < 0.01) and the non-TB group (A antigen: χ2 = 105.41, P < 0.01 and antigen B: χ2 = 91.03, P < 0.01) were significant.

There were also no significant differences in A and B antigen ranks between the sputum smear-positive and smear-negative individuals (P = 0.68 and P = 0.55, respectively), or among those with pulmonary, pleural, or extrapulmonary TB (P = 0.89 and P = 0.21, respectively).\nDifferential analysis of A antigen and B antigen ranking in active, previous, and non-TB groups\n删除重复语句：<u>Differential analysis of A antigen and B antigen ranking in active, previous, and non-TB groups</u>\nTB: Tuberculosis.\nROC curves were drawn with sensitivity as the horizontal coordinate and the 1-specificity as the vertical coordinate. In the active TB infection group, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of A and B antigens was 0.89 and 0.87, respectively, and at a cutoff of 13.5 spot-forming cells (SFCs) per 2.5 × 105 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the diagnostic value of the A antigen was optimal, and Youden index was maximal (0.71). At this cutoff, sensitivity was 84.10% and specificity was 86.50% 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nThe AUCs of the A and B antigens in the previous TB group were 0.60 and 0.58, respectively. When the cutoff of the A antigen was 2.5 SFCs per 2.5 × 105 PBMCs, the diagnostic power of the A antigen value was optimal and Youden index was 0.16. At this cutoff, the sensitivity was 60.00% and the specificity was 55.60% 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.\nIf both A and B antigens together (A + B antigen) were used as the criterion for diagnosing active and previous TB, the AUCs were 0.89 and 0.618, respectively. When the A + B antigen cutoff was 44 and 14 SFCs per 2.5 × 105 PBMCs, respectively, the diagnostic value was optimal. At these cutoffs, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing active and previous TB were 81% and 87%, and 50% and 79%, respectively 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3 and Figure 4]</u>.\nThis study verified that T-SPOT®.TB can differentiate different groups of TB infection. The T-SPOT®.TB assay tests for the presence of specific antigens of MTB, i.e. ESAT-6 and CFP-10. As reported by a large number of studies in China, the sensitivity and specificity of T-SPOT®.TB exceed 70%. Sun and Shen通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> performed a meta-analysis of nine studies, showing that the T-SPOT®.TB test had a sensitivity of 94% in the diagnosis of active TB. Pai et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> reported in a meta-analysis of six studies that the overall sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 93% in adults with no history of exposure to TB. Our study concluded that the sensitivity of T-SPOT®.TB was 89.78%, and its specificity was 63.16%, for active TB; these values were slightly lower than those shown by previous studies. This may be related to the older age of the patients in our study, as the average age was 52 years, and individuals exceeding 60 years of age accounted for 42% of our study population. Although our study did not analyze the impact of age on T-SPOT®.TB results, two studies in a Japanese population found that the sensitivity of T-SPOT®.TB was lower in the elderly than in younger individuals with suspected active TB.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13]</u>\nAn increased age may be associated with low immunity, poor nutritional status, and increased comorbidity. The quantity and function of T-cells declines with age, resulting in decreased specificity of the antigen−antibody reaction, and thus decreased sensitivity of the T-SPOT®.TB test.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> The low specificity in this study may be caused by latent TB, a vegetarian diet, or Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium kansasii, or Mycobacterium gordonae infection since T-cells activated by these pathogens may also react with the A or B antigen. In addition, Amirzargar et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> reported that some genes in humans offer a form of resistance to MTB infection such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes HLA-DRB1*0501 and HLA-DQA1*0301. Individuals harboring these genes are not susceptible to MTB infection, which may also result in decreased sensitivity and specificity.\nOur study showed that T-SPOT®.TB did not distinguish between latent TB or active TB.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> T-SPOT®.TB specifically detects T-cells in blood, to determine whether MTB infection is present. Latent TB does not require immediate chemotherapy, and the disease progression can be monitored by clinical observation; however, active TB requires immediate treatment so as to prevent disease progression. There is an urgent need for effective supplementary means of diagnosis of active TB. In this study, we determined that when the A antigen cutoff was 13.5 SFCs per 2.5 × 105 PBMCs, the diagnostic value was optimal; at this cutoff, Youden index reached a maximum of 0.71, and the sensitivity and specificity were 84.10% and 86.50%, respectively. This suggests that this cutoff value has the most power to distinguish between active and latent TB. Sun et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> also proposed that a cutoff value based on the number of SFCs would allow the identification of active and latent TB.\nAnti-TB treatment will affect the results of the T-SPOT®. TB assay. The results of the T-SPOT®.TB test in TB patients were significantly more frequently positive before anti-TB treatment than thereafter (83% and 17%, respectively).通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Liu et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> reported an average of 47 A antigen (ESAT-6) spots and 18 B antigen (CFP-10) spots per 2.5 × 105 PBMCs, after 2 and 4 weeks of anti-TB treatment, which was significantly lower than that found before treatment (99 and 49, respectively; P < 0.05). However, these findings did not explain the specific value of the A antigen after undergoing treatment for active TB.\nOur study findings require further confirmation. If T-SPOT®.TB results can be obtained over a longer period, the specific value of the A antigen in patients with active TB can be determined after the disease has been completely cured. If this value reached 13.5 SFCs per 2.5 × 105 PBMCs or less, it would verify the use of this cutoff value. In cases where the T-SPOT®.TB results are positive, but A antigen levels are <13.5 SFCs per 2.5 × 105 PBMCs, latent TB is the most likely diagnosis, and the diagnosis of active TB would require a combination of clinical and other findings. In addition, we found that using the A + B antigens as the standard for diagnosis was not superior to using only the A or B antigen. Moreover, the diagnostic value of the A antigen was superior to that of the B antigen, suggesting that the A antigen should be used as a standard of judgment in clinical work, as far as possible, using the cutoff value of 13.5 SFCs per 2.5 × 105 PBMCs, for the diagnosis of active TB.\nPrevious TB accounts for nearly 20% of the diagnoses of TB: Li and Luo通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> reported that 18% of cases diagnosed with pulmonary TB were actually previous TB cases. At present, it is not clear whether a history of TB will affect the results of the T-SPOT®. TB test. Zhang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> reported that previous TB can cause false-positive results in the T-SPOT®.TB test. In the present study, we obtained AUCs of 0.595 and 0.579 for the A and B antigens, respectively, for previous TB; these values were close to 0.5, implying that these antigens had minimal diagnostic significance for previous TB. Moreover, between the previous TB group and the non-TB group, there were no statistically significant differences in the A and B antigens, whereas there were statistically significant differences in these values between the active TB group and the other two groups. This is probably because the effector T-cells only survive for a short period in vivo and disappear after pathogen eradication;通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> thus, after MTB has been completely cleared and the lesions remain stable, the T-SPOT®.TB test should be negative.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> Another study found that interferon-gamma release assays also assessed present rather than past infections;通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> however, the T-SPOT®.TB findings of patients with previous TB were sometimes positive, which may indicate latent TB or may be caused by other mycobacterium species such as M. kansasii and M. gordonae.\nIn summary, T-SPOT®.TB has a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of active TB and is not influenced by previous TB or BCG vaccination. It can be used to distinguish active TB from latent TB. Thus, it can be useful for the diagnosis of active TB.\n删除7：<u>The authors thank Zhi-Wei Xu of the People’s Hospital of Zhengzhou University for his assistance in statistical analysis.

But in clinical practice we found that in some fracture cases, the damage to soft tissues is not as severe as \"destructive injury\" indicates, whereas comminuted fractures still cannot show the severity of bone damage. Therefore we proposed a new term \"destructive fractures\" after combining the definition of destructive injury with typical clinic cases. Destructive fractures refer to the fractures whose osseous tissues are damaged too seriously to be repaired, but soft tissues, nerves and veins are less severely injured and can be repaired. From the year 2001 to 2010, 75 cases of destructive fractures were admitted in our department. According to whether the fractures interlinked with the external environment, together with the fracture sites, they were divided into 6 types: al type, closed diaphysis destructive fracture; a2 type, open diaphysis destructive fracture; b1 type, closed joint-involved destructive fracture; b2 type,open joint-involved destructive fracture; cl type, closed mixed destructive fracture; c2 type, open mixed destructive fracture. Corresponding clinical treatments were conducted for each type.The new classification criterion of destructivefracture is simple and practical and thus can be used as an important guide to make reasonable treatment plans for destructive fractures。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:41:28", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:41:33", "cost": 4.328}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:32", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:41:33", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:41:28"}

The study protocol was reviewed by the Ethics Committee of each center. The study was conducted according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from each patient in writing before randomization. Patients (≥18 years) with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months who were inadequately controlled by topical treatments, phototherapy, and/or previous systemic therapy were included. PsA diagnosis was based on fulfillment of the classification criteria for psoriatic arthritis and ≥3 tender and swollen joints at baseline. The treatment consisted of an induction (baseline - week 12), maintenance (week 13-52), and follow-up period (week 53-60). Eligible patients were randomized (2:1:1) to secukinumab 300 mg, secukinumab 150 mg, or placebo. At week 12, patients in the placebo group were reassigned based on their Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75 response status; non-responders were reassigned to secukinumab 300 mg (referred here placebo-secukinumab switchers), while PASI 75 responders continued on placebo to week 52. PsA efficacy was assessed using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response. Psoriasis was assessed using PASI 75/90/100 and the Investigator’s Global Assessment 0/1. Patient-reported outcomes were also assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) for psoriasis and the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) for PsA.\nA total of 24/441 (5.4%) of Chinese psoriasis patients had concurrent PsA (secukinumab 150 mg [n = 6], secukinumab 300 mg [n = 14], placebo [placebo-secukinumab switchers] [n = 4]).

At baseline, patients had comparable mean PASI scores (secukinumab 300 mg: 29.3 [14.7-52.4; n = 14]; secukinumab 150 mg: 25.1 [15.6-36.6; n = 6]; placebo: 24.2 [19.2-35.5; n = 4]), and body surface area affected (secukinumab 300 mg: 45.1% [15.0%-82.0%]; secukinumab 150 mg: 41.8% [16.0%-71.0%]; placebo: 36.6% [28.0%-46.0%]). The mean PsA duration was 6.8, 6.9, and 2.3 years in the secukinumab 300, 150 mg, and placebo arms, respectively. A higher proportion of patients in the secukinumab 300 mg arm had severe disease (IGA score of 4) (secukinumab 300 mg: 8 [57.1%]; secukinumab 150 mg: 4 [66.7%]; placebo: 2 [50.0%]).\nThe proportion of psoriasis patients with PsA showing an ACR 20 response was high in patients treated with secukinumab at week 12 (secukinumab 300 mg: 12/13 [92.3%]; secukinumab 150 mg: 4/6 [66.7%]; placebo: 0/4 通用删除6(英):<u>[0]</u>) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.

This was compared with 50% (2/4; gastrointestinal AE) and 25% (1/4; non-serious infection) in patients receiving placebo, all of which were possibly related to study treatment. Hypersensitivity was also common in patients receiving any secukinumab dose (8/24 [33.3%]; 3/24 [12.5%] possibly related to study treatment), including eczema (3/24 [12.5%]; 1/24 [4.2%] possibly related to study treatment), urticaria (3/24 [12.5%]; 2/24 [8.3%] possibly related to study treatment), dermatitis (1/24 [4.2%]), and eyelid edema (1/24 [4.2%]) over 52 weeks. One patient experienced a serious adverse event (SAE; hemorrhoids) which was deemed unrelated to secukinumab treatment.\nIn summary, secukinumab demonstrated high efficacy outcomes in Chinese psoriasis patients with concomitant PsA at week 12 sustained to week 52. Secukinumab 300 mg dose showed a greater improvement for both skin lesions and arthritis with 93% achieving PASI 75, 79% IGA 0/1, and 85% ACR 20 responses over week 52.

In this study we reviewed the relevant literatures and case reports to further discuss and understand the clinical feature, treatment and prevention of this syndrome.\nThe child patient, weighted 41Kg, a 12-year-old boy was admitted to hospital with headache for 1 year. He had undergone microscopic craniopharyngioma resection 7 years ago. The recent brain MR imaging showed tumor recurrence and obstructive hydrocephalus. The Fig. 1 shows the pre- and post- operative MR images. After a complete of medical evaluation, he accepted uneventful endonasal endoscopic surgery under general anesthesia in our department on Nov 11, 2016, and achieved total resection. After operation he kept a clear state of consciousness, but had persistent diabetes insipidus(DI). on the second day of postoperative, we applied pituitrin by continuous intravenous injection for 1 U per hour, in order to control 24 h urine volume between 2000 and 3000 ml. The serum sodium concentration began to fluctuate after operation. On postoperative day 2 laboratory values showed hypernatremia (163 mEq/l), and DI had worsened, so we continous to use pituitrin. But the leve of serum sodium droped to 112 mEq/l on postoperative day 7. It suggested that he developed syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). His 24 h fluid intake was restricted at 2000 ml - 2500 ml, balanced the volume of output. At the same time hypertonic saline was applied for refractory hyponatremia. We also stoped pituitrin continous infusion, but it failed because of DI. His serum sodium remained low (ranged, 112 - 114 mEq/l) for the next days. On postoperative day 9 his conscious leve deteriorated rapidly, associated with epileptic seizure and right upper limb involuntary movement. The laboratory values of serum sodium ranged from 112 to 172 mEq/l within 24 h. The Fig. 5 shows postoperative fluctuation of serum sodium leves, urine volume and clinical course. The hypernatramia continoued for 3 days, and then declined to normal leve after treatment. On postoperative day 16, his brain MR imaging showed symmetrical abnormalities in the extrapontine . The patient’s coma state persisted for 2 months. Three months later, the consciousness improved, he can respond to verbal stimuli with eye opening.

She received endonasal neuroendoscopic operation to remove the suprasellar lesion on Nov 10, 2015. During the procedure, the lesion was total resection. On postoperative day 1, she was recovered well. But blood biochemical examination showed the sodium level was 168 mEq/l, and 24 h urine volume was about 3835 ml. Considered hypernatramia, we gave her hypotonic saline and water, at the same time applied pituirin to control urine output per hour.

There are variety of complications after operation. Among these, diabetic insipidus (DI) and electrolyte disturbance are the most common complications. And osmotic demyelination syndrome have close relationship with rapid correction of serum sodium disorder after operation. It can cause serious symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>, for example myelinolysis, seizure, disturbance of consiciousness, paralysis, and dyskinesia. It may be affect the prognosis of patients. Osmotic demyelination may occur in central pontine or extrapontine. For extrapontine demyelination, the basal ganglia region are often involved, it is particularly affected caudal and lentiform nuclei 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Above all, craniopharyngioma after surgery often cause electrolyte disturbance and diabetis insipidus, but the cases of osmotic demyelination followed by rapid correction of the electrolyte disturbance 通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u>, was so rare in previous reports. Today we report two cases of children who presented serious serum sodium disorder after endscopic surgery of craniopharyngioma. Both occured extrapontine myelinolysis followed by rapid correction of hyponatremia, but wether hyponatremia or hypernatremia can cause EPM still remained controversial. In this study we reviewed the relevant literatures and case reports to further discuss and understand the clinical feature, treatment and prevention of this syndrome.\nThe child patient, weighted 41Kg, a 12-year-old boy was admitted to hospital with headache for 1 year. He had undergone microscopic craniopharyngioma resection 7 years ago. The recent brain MR imaging showed tumor recurrence and obstructive hydrocephalus. The Fig. 1 shows the pre- and post- operative MR images. After a complete of medical evaluation, he accepted uneventful endonasal endoscopic surgery under general anesthesia in our department on Nov 11, 2016, and achieved total resection. After operation he kept a clear state of consciousness, but had persistent diabetes insipidus(DI). on the second day of postoperative, we applied pituitrin by continuous intravenous injection for 1 U per hour, in order to control 24 h urine volume between 2000 and 3000 ml. The serum sodium concentration began to fluctuate after operation. On postoperative day 2 laboratory values showed hypernatremia (163 mEq/l), and DI had worsened, so we continous to use pituitrin. But the leve of serum sodium droped to 112 mEq/l on postoperative day 7. It suggested that he developed syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). His 24 h fluid intake was restricted at 2000 ml - 2500 ml, balanced the volume of output. At the same time hypertonic saline was applied for refractory hyponatremia. We also stoped pituitrin continous infusion, but it failed because of DI. His serum sodium remained low (ranged, 112 - 114 mEq/l) for the next days. On postoperative day 9 his conscious leve deteriorated rapidly, associated with epileptic seizure and right upper limb involuntary movement. The laboratory values of serum sodium ranged from 112 to 172 mEq/l within 24 h. The Fig. 5 shows postoperative fluctuation of serum sodium leves, urine volume and clinical course. The hypernatramia continoued for 3 days, and then declined to normal leve after treatment. On postoperative day 16, his brain MR imaging showed symmetrical abnormalities in the extrapontine . The patient’s coma state persisted for 2 months. Three months later, the consciousness improved, he can respond to verbal stimuli with eye opening. The postoperative day 16 and 30 MR images .\nA 16-year-old girl, weighted 46KG, who was hospitalized with dizziness and headache for two months. And her brain MR imaging showed a lesion at the suprasellar region, considered craniophrayngioma. Fig. 3 shows pre- and post - operative MR images. She received endonasal neuroendoscopic operation to remove the suprasellar lesion on Nov 10, 2015. During the procedure, the lesion was total resection. On postoperative day 1, she was recovered well. But blood biochemical examination showed the sodium level was 168 mEq/l, and 24 h urine volume was about 3835 ml. Considered hypernatramia, we gave her hypotonic saline and water, at the same time applied pituirin to control urine output per hour. After treatment serum sodium concentration went down to the normal range. On day 5, the girl suffered accidental epileptic seiz- ure, and also presented with dysarthria, gait ataxia and abnormal involuntary movement. Then her conscious leve deteriorated. The serum sodium concentration was 118 mEq/l at that time. We try our best to correct then and it still fluctuated between 115 to 118 mEq/l on day 6. On postoperative day 7 the serum sodium concentration went to 139 mEq/l suddenly. At the following 2 days it still went up persistent to 175 mEq/l. She was still at confu- sion. Hypernatramia state last for 3 days, and then declined to normal leve gradully.

The following parameters from medical records were collected, including outpatient follow-up time, sex, age at diagnosis, body height and body weight, family history of autoimmune thyroid disease clinical diagnosis of Graves’ ophthalmopathy, goiter size at diagnosis, TSH, serum levels of total triiodothyronine (TT3), free triiodothyronine (FT3), total thyroxine (TT4), FT4, TRAb, and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), ATDs-associated adverse events (e.g. rash, arthritis, liver function, neutropenia) and duration of ATDs treatment.\nSerum thyroid hormone concentrations and thyroid antibody levels were measured at the laboratory within Beijing Children’s Hospital. Reference values were as follows: TT3 1.08-3.23 nmol/L; FT3 3.30-8.25 pmol/L; TT4 51.48-154.45 nmol/L; FT4 8.37-29.60 pmol/L; TSH 0.4-4.0 mIU/L; TPOAb < 34 IU/mL; and TRAb <1.75 IU/mL.\nQuantitative variables are shown as by mean ± SD; those that did not exhibit normal distributions are shown as median (IQR). Qualitative variables are shown as n (%). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify influencing actors associated with remission. Cox univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify influencing factors associated with remission duration.\nVariables with P < 0.1 in univariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze correlations between clinical factors and prognosis. The results are shown as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). All statistical tests were two-tailed, and P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. SPSS Statistics, version 22.0 was used for all statistical analyses.\nThis retrospective study reviewed the medical records of 77 children. The median age at GD onset was 4.2 years (IQR: 3.2-5.3 years). Sixty-three (81.8%) girls and 14 (18.2%) boys were included; these patients were divided into two groups based on the criteria described in the Methods section. Eighteen patients in the remission group and 59 patients in the non-remission group. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data of the two groups are shown in Table 1. No differences were found in age, sex, family history, initial goiter size, and initial TT3, TT4, FT3, TPOAb level, and MMI dose between the groups. Eleven patients in remission group and 40 patients in non-remission group had Graves’ ophthalmopathy, but no statistical significance between the two groups.\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with Graves’ disease\n删除重复语句：<u>Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with Graves’ disease</u>\nData was shown as n (%) or median (interquartile range). *P < 0.05. TT3, total triiodothyronine; TT4, total thyroxine; FT3, free triiodothyronine; FT4, free thyroxine; TPOAb, thyroid peroxidase antibody; TRAb, thyrotropin receptor antibody; MMI, methimazole.\nAll patients were initially treated with MMI. The median MMI treatment time was 2.6 years (1.4-3.8 years). The median treatment period among patients who achieved remission was 2.9 years (2.3-4.3 years).\nAdverse events were encountered in 29 patients during MMI treatment. No patients experienced fatal adverse events. The most common adverse events were leukopenia, neutropenia, and liver dysfunction. The main type of liver dysfunction was an elevated ALT level. Seventeen patients developed neutropenia; after treatment with glucuronolactone and leucogen, their biochemical indexes and white blood cell counts returned to normal.\nIn this study, 18 patients (23.4%) achieved remission. Univariate analyses revealed no significant differences in age at diagnosis, sex, initial goiter size, or initial thyroid hormone concentration. However, there were a trend of correlation between the initial level of TPOAb and remission status (univariate analysis OR 1.002, P = 0.038; multivariate analysis OR 1.004, P = 0.019). Similar results were observed in univariate analysis of the TRAb level, but this association was not significant in multivariate analysis .\nUnivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of factors associated with remission in children with Graves’ disease\n删除重复语句：<u>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of factors associated with remission in children with Graves’ disease</u>\n*P < 0.05.

The result showed that children with high TRAb level required longer duration of remission, compared with low TRAb level (HR 0.950, 95% CI 0.904-0.997, P = 0.037). This result revealed that the initial TRAb level was an independent predictor of remission outcome in children under the age of 7 years with GD.\nHyperthyroidism is much rarer in children than in adults, such that diagnoses in children constitute approximately 1%-5% of diagnoses in all age groups.删除4：<u>12</u> Increased incidences of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease, have been reported in children and adolescents in recent years; a similar increase has been suggested for hyperthyroidism.删除4：<u>13,14,15</u> GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in children. GD is common in girls, with peak in prevalence during adolescence. Young-age-of-onset GD differs from adolescent hyperthyroidism. Lazar et al1 studied Graves’ thyrotoxicosis in seven prepubertal children (6.4 ± 2.4 years), compared with 21 pubertal children (12.5 ± 1.1 years) and 12 postpubertal children (16.2 ± 0.8 years). In the prepubertal group the main complaints were weight loss and frequent bowel movements (86%), whereas typical symptoms (irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, and neck lump) occurred significantly less often.删除4：<u>1</u> These symptoms and signs may have been present, but were overlooked or misinterpreted by the patients’ parents. Prepubertal children with GD reportedly exhibit greater thyrotoxicity at diagnosis and require a longer course of medical therapy, compared with pubertal and postpubertal children and adolescents.删除4：<u>16</u>\nAs noted in the Introduction, treatment options for children with GD include antithroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation and thyroidectomy. Antithroid drugs are often preferred for initial treatment.删除4：<u>17</u> MMI is strongly recommended for treatment of children with GD. The frequency of adverse reactions to MMI is reportedly 1%-30%.删除4：<u>18</u> In our study, no serious adverse events were observed, such as agranulocytosis or severe liver failure. In total, 29 minor adverse effects were observed, including leukopenia, neutropenia, and slightly elevated transaminase levels. These adverse reactions were not serious and the patients who have side effects recovered after reduction of MMI dosage.\nCox regression analyses of factors associated with duration of remission in children with Graves’ disease\n删除重复语句：<u>Cox regression analyses of factors associated with duration of remission in children with Graves’ disease</u>\n*P < 0.05. HR, hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval; TT3, total triiodothyronine; TT4, total thyroxine; FT3, free triiodothyronine; FT4, free thyroxine; TPOAb, thyroid peroxidase antibody; TRAb, thyrotropin receptor antibody; MMI, methimazole.\nThe difficulty in treatment of hyperthyroidism in children lies in the remission and relapse. Although remission occurs in 40%-60% of adults,19,20 it is less common in prepubertal and pubertal children, in whom remission occurs at rates of 20%-30% and 15%, respectively.删除4：<u>16,21,22,23,24</u> Fewer than 25% of patients achieve remission within 2 years of beginning antithroid drugs therapy. In this study of 77 children under the age of 7 years with GD, 23.4% achieved remission. Our results are similar to the findings in previous studies.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there have only been a few studies regarding prognostic factors in children and adolescents with Graves’ disease; although a number of variables have been investigated to determine whether they influence the risk of relapse, the results remain inconclusive.删除4：<u>1,2,25</u> In prior studies, older age, greater body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis, smaller goiter size, greater initial dosage, and prolonged drug treatment were correlated with a greater likelihood of remission.删除4：<u>4,25</u>\nOur results confirmed that the initial TRAb level is an independent predictor of remission outcome in children under the age of 7 years with GD. This indicator may predict the likelihood of remission in patients with young-age-of-onset GD. Similar results were found in the study of hyperthyroidism children regardless of age.删除4：<u>23,24</u> But another study have suggested that the TRAb cannot be used as a predictor of remission. Glaser et al26 studied 51 children who had Graves’ disease and compared children who achieved remission after 2 years with those who had persistent disease to determine which variables were associated with remission. They founded that there were no significant differences in the frequency of positive thyroid antibody tests between the remission group and the non-remission group.删除4：<u>26</u> Some scholars argue that current data do not support the use of TRAb determination in predicting the outcome of Graves’ disease because there is significant variability in published data with respect to assay methodology, population characteristics, and study design. TRAb may have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects; current TRAb assays lack specificity and may yield positive results for patients with other thyroid diseases.删除4：<u>27</u> However, it should be noted that these subjects were not grouped by age. Therefore, the role of TRAb in the remission of hyperthyroidism children in different age groups needs further study.\nThe selection of ideal treatment for children under the age of 7 years with GD is often problematic; doctors and patients must consider the risks and benefits of each treatment option. The predictors identified in this study could help to recognize patients who are candidates for alternative therapy, such as surgery or radioiodine therapy. Importantly, this was a retrospective study. Thus, further collaborative and prospective studies are needed to confirm these data and improve the complex clinical problems of pediatric patients with Graves’ disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:17:51", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:18:37", "cost": 45.981}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:32", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:18:36", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:17:50"}

COPD is a silent killer in developing countries with roughly 328 million people living with COPD.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The mortality is expected to reach 3 million in 2016,通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> and it has become the third most common reason for mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>\nSmoking and/or environmental exposure is one of the most common risk factors for COPD.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u> After removal of risk factors, the inflammation could continue in self-sustaining fashion which contributes to a gradual deterioration in pulmonary function. Acute exacerbations, usually caused by an infection with bacteria or viruses, are superimposed on this chronic inflammation and result in further cycles of bronchitis and emphysema. However, current therapies have limited effectiveness on chronic bronchitis or emphysematous change.\nNeutrophils, the most abundant inflammatory cells, form a vital part of the innate immune system to defend against microbial invasion. They are rapidly recruited to tissues, both infected and damaged, where they ingest and eliminate micro-organisms that have invaded.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> However, bacterial airway colonization and recurrent colonization may further irritate the development of inflammatory alterations, which have been shown as the cause of emphysematous destruction in COPD.\nFor decades, researchers have been searching for novel biologic modulators of neutrophils which could potentially serve as potent cell type-specific target agents for the treatment of airway neutrophilia. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) belong to the immunoglobulin gene family. Among them, Siglec-9 is mainly expressed by human neutrophils and monocytes, playing a key role in regulating neutrophil recruitment through mechanisms of apoptosis and autophagic-like cell death to induce programmed cell death.\nThis review will summarize the current understanding of airway neutrophilia in COPD, discuss the role of Siglec-9 in immunoregulatory mechanisms in neutrophil recruitment and activation, and Siglec-9 as a potential target for immunotherapy of COPD.\nExcessive neutrophils are detected in induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as a characteristic profile of COPD sufferers,通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> which have also been reported as a biomarker of disease severity in COPD.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> The last few years witnessed a new wave of discoveries about the central role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of COPD 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. Exposure to harmful stimuli such as cigarette smoke and pathogenic organisms has a direct stimulatory effect on the generation and emission of neutrophils from the bone marrow, and further extending the lifespan of cells in the airways may be attributed to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) released from alveolar macrophages and endothelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Interestingly, GM-CSF cannot modulate neutrophil apoptosis in COPD in a similar fashion as it regulates this process in healthy subjects.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nHence, we have been unable to identify the identical pathway through which GM-CSF acts on pulmonary neutrophils in COPD as it acts in healthy humans. The lifespan of neutrophils in COPD possibly depends on a dynamic balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathways. The pro-apoptotic Bac and CASP genes are significantly down-regulated in neutrophils from COPD patients. However, in these subjects, the apoptosis-resistant Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 genes were increased in expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u> In addition, cigarette smoke also affects the phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, leading to secondary necrosis, which triggers subsequent activation of proinflammatory signals.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>\nIn COPD patients, an increased neutrophilic infiltration in the airways is closely associated with initial adhesion to endothelial cells though E-selectin which is up-regulated on the surface of endothelium. Adherent neutrophils migrate into the airway and parenchyma under the guiding of multiple neutrophil chemoattractant molecules, such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 1, CXCL5, and CXCL8 (interleukin-8 [IL-8]), which are accumulated in COPD respiratory tract.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> These chemoattractants can be released by activated lung epithelial cells as well as immunocyte-like macrophages and T cells, but neutrophils may be the primary origin of IL-8.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> In acute exacerbations of COPD, the remarkably increased number of neutrophils in the airway accounted for the elevated purulence of sputum, which might present up-regulated secretion of neutrophil chemotactic mediators, consisting of LTB4 and IL-8.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>\nNeutrophils recruitment to the respiratory tract of COPD patients is activated owing to elevated concentrations of granule proteins including human neutrophil lipocalin and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in respiratory tract secretions.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Indeed, partial or global hypoxia compromises antimorphic effect and enhances the production of multiple serine proteases, such as serprocidins and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), resulting in further cellular and tissue injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18]</u> Moreover, several neutrophil-derived inflammatory mediators including neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to trigger small airway remodeling and alveolar destruction in patients with COPD.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20,21,22]</u>\nMPO is an essential hemoprotein which is found predominantly in the primary granules of neutrophils. It triggers ROS elevation in a state of inflammation, especially in the presence of cigarette smoke, and also accelerates the inflammatory response in smokers.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> 3-Chlorotyrosine, a product of MPO oxidative activity, was shown to be upregulated in COPD sputum, implying that it may serve as tissue damage biomarker for MPO-mediated tissue damage in COPD pathogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>\nSerprocidins, also known as neutrophil serine proteases, include neutrophil elastase, proteinase-3, and cathepsin-G, form three components of azurophilic granules. They have been demonstrated to harbor proteolytic enzymatic activity towards extracellular matrix components, including type IV collagen, elastin, and fibronectin.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> There is an endogenous association between respiratory tract neutrophilia and mucus hypersecretion, since neutrophil serine protease is a strong stimulus for mucus release from submucosal glands and trabecular cells. In order to avoid excessive harm, the family of serine protease inhibitors known as the serpins could be identified in the plasma, and serine proteases deficiency present protective functions against cigarette smoke exposure-induced emphysema in mice.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>\nMMPs belong to the Zn-dependent protease family that can be released from neutrophils, macrophages, and stromal cells. Collectively, the release of gelatinase MMP-9, metalloelastase MMP-12, and collagenase MMP-1, likely accounts for the majority of elastin and collagen degradation in emphysema pathogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> Of these, the gelatinase MMP-9, synthesized exclusively by mature neutrophils, causes elastolysis and stimulates airway neutrophilia via the generation of N-acetyl-proline-glycine-proline.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>\nFormed by activated neutrophils, the NETs are adorned with cytoplasmic proteins, granules, and histones. While NETs have a key function in the innate immune response, excessive formation of NETs cause damage to lung tissue injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> A substantial amount of NETs have been observed in the respiratory tracts of COPD patients in association with the severity of condition and frequency of exacerbation.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>\nHMGB1, a DNA binding protein, is mainly released by necrotic neutrophils involved in neutrophilic inflammation. Patients with COPD exhibit elevated sputum and plasma levels of HMGB1.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> HMGB1 has significant effects on epithelial injury and reparation through a combined initiation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and receptor for advanced glycation end signaling, which may provide a potential target for treating neutrophilia and remodeling in patients with COPD.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>\nCurrently, the main therapeutic strategy for COPD consists of bronchodilators and corticosteroids. These agents may temporarily relieve the symptoms, but not considerably postpone disease progression or reduce the frequency of exacerbation. Notably, bronchodilators and corticosteroids are also the mainstay therapy in the management of asthma. Hence, it is important to be wary of the fact that COPD and asthma are two completely distinct diseases, although they have been confused for a long time. In asthma, eosinophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes perform a crucial function, whereas neutrophils have an essential role in only relatively uncommon situations, such as subtype of severe asthma.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>\nHowever, neutrophils recruitment and activation in the lungs are correlated directly with the severity of COPD.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Airway neutrophilia is a driving mechanism for the exacerbations, progression, and probably associated complications of COPD, such as arterial pulmonary hypertension and lung cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,32]</u> Clinically, corticosteroids are highly effective in treating eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthmatic patients and largely ineffective as an anti-neutrophilic inflammatory therapy in COPD.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> The treatment of corticosteroids against COPD remains widely practiced, but its side effects have caused a substantial incidence of morbidity.\nThe recent advances have been exploring the neutrophilic inflammatory mechanisms, particularly a greater understanding of its numerous mediators involved in COPD. Specific blockade of these mediators by either preventing their synthesis or antagonizing their receptors may play a crucial role in efficiently controlling disease progression. Several regulators of neutrophilic inflammatory mediators, such as anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitors, IL-17 inhibitors, and protease inhibitors are under development for the treatment of COPD.通用删除6(英):<u>[25,34]</u>\nThe negative results question the strategy of inhibiting a single mediator in therapy due to the complex of the neutrophilic inflammation in COPD, and so broad-spectrum agents, which directly suppress the cellular components of inflammation, need to be identified. The therapies explored include phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, adenosine A2a-receptor agonists, and agents that interfere with adhesion molecules.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> Still, there are concerns about the immune system dysfunction recently found in COPD patients,通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> because an impaired neutrophilic response may increase the susceptibility to infectious disease.\nThere is evidence that bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tracts is found in half of COPD patients, especially in severe stage, and involves the same bacterial species that contribute to exacerbations.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> Bacterial colonization is also associated with airway neutrophilia and acquired immunity in the airways. Therefore, the antibiotics for the treatment of lower airway infections should be taken into consideration as a logical therapeutic strategy, albeit concerns on antimicrobial resistance vote against this approach.\nSiglecs, the members of immunoregulatory receptors, are primarily located on the surface of hematopoietic cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> The recognition of distinct sialylated glycoconjugates is configurated by an amino-terminal V-set immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, which may initiate or inhibit the immune response, depending on the involved Siglecs.通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>\nThere are 15 different functionally activated Siglecs that have been characterized in humans.通用删除6(英):<u>[38,39]</u> Conservative Siglecs, comprised of Siglec-1/2/4/15, have genetic homology in diverse mammalian.通用删除6(英):<u>[38,39]</u> However, CD33-related Siglecs have undergone rapid evolutionary adaptation including Siglec-9.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> It is not feasible to identify a direct orthologs of human CD33-related Siglecs in mice, but functional paralogs with similar patterns of cellular expression and function can be determined.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>\nSiglec-9 belongs to CD33-related Siglecs and is encoded by the SIGLEC9 gene.通用删除6(英):<u>[41,42]</u> Immunoblotting with a specific antibody revealed hyper-expression of Siglec-9 on neutrophils and monocytes in human, and low levels on natural killer cells, and sub-populations of T and B lymphocytes.通用删除6(英):<u>[41,42]</u> Functionally, Siglec-9 has been demonstrated as an inhibitory receptor. Like the other members of CD33-related Siglecs, Siglec-9 has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and ITIM-like domain that rapidly becomes phosphorylated followed by cell activation, which leads to the recruitment and activation of tyrosine phosphatases, including the Src homology-2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1 and SHP-2.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>\nIn terms of the murine CD33-related Siglecs expression pattern, Siglec-E is mainly observed in monocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells, and has been considered to be closest to human Siglec-9.通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> The amino acid sequence of Siglec-E retains approximately 50% to 80% sequence identity to Siglec-9, which comprises three extracellular Ig domains and a cytoplasmic tail with two ITIMs.通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> In line with Siglec-9, Siglec-E ITIMs may recruit and initiate SHP-1 and SHP-2, indicating that Siglec-E negatively modulates the immune response.通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> Recently, elevated tumor cell death was observed in Siglec-E deficiency mice, whereas this phenotype was completely reversed in humanized Siglec-9 transgenic mice,通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> proving the supposition that murine Siglec-E is a functional ortholog of human Siglec-9.通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45]</u>\nIn 2005, Von Gunten et al通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> first reported that Siglec-9 plays an important role in initiating apoptotic and autophagic-like cell death pathways in neutrophils 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. In normal neutrophils, Siglec-9 ligation induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. However, for local microenvironments with proinflammatory cytokines, such as GM-CSF, interferon (IFN)-α, and IFN-γ, Siglec-9 ligation on neutrophils appears to switch from caspase-dependent apoptosis to caspase-independent autophagic-like cell death, which presents more potent cytotoxicity.通用删除6(英):<u>[47,48]</u> Remarkably, as indicated by additional assays utilizing ROS scavengers or neutrophils unable to produce ROS, the Siglec-9-mediated caspase-dependent and caspase-independent programmed cell death were ROS dependent, and such form of cell death was likely to be even more sensitive and effective in the presence of ROS.通用删除6(英):<u>[47,48]</u>\nThere is some existing evidence indicating that engagement of Siglec-9 by natural anti-Siglec-9 autoantibodies occurs on neutrophils after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations.通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> Intriguingly, this effect dramatically accelerates in a cytokine-rich microenvironment. In parallel with the reported effects of Siglec-9 ligation by specific antibodies, IVIg-mediated neutrophil death also involves ROS, in caspase-dependent and caspase-independent manners.通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u> More importantly, there are clinical consequences of the presence of naturally occurring anti-Siglec-9 autoantibodies in IVIg that may have a potential to induce both desired and undesired effects. For instance, the beneficial effect of IVIg may involve the suppression of neutrophilia.通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> Also, an undesired neutropenia has been identified in association with IVIg therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u> The reassuring facts are that IVIg-induced neutropenia is reversible and no severe infectious adverse events have been observed during the neutropenic period.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> Future work is warranted to explore potential biomarkers to determine those individuals who may benefit from IVIg management for neutrophil dysfunction.\nTo date, the mechanisms leading to caspases activation in Siglec-9-mediated neutrophil death remain poorly understood. There are only a few studies which reported that tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 may be involved in the apoptosis-associated caspase activation.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> Furthermore, phosphoinositide 3 kinase, which participates in anti-apoptotic pathway in neutrophils,通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> would be dephosphorylated by SHP-1 via its association with the regulatory p85 subunit.通用删除6(英):<u>[55,56]</u> Neutrophil survival is regulated by finely-balanced interactions between pro-apoptotic and survival signals, and SHP-1 could be an important regulator in these processes.通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u> Further studies will be awaited to intensively dissect these possible mechanisms.\nAs a vital constituent of the innate immune system, neutrophils represent a first cellular line in the defense against bacterial and fungal infections. However, the host immune system and neutrophil recruitment must be precisely regulated to avoid chronic inflammation response and prevent excessive tissue damage. Otherwise, unregulated neutrophil responses and persistent inflammation could lead to entities such as COPD, asthma, and acute lung injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[31,32,58]</u>\nIn a murine sepsis model, McMillan et al通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> found that Siglec-E as an essential inhibitor of CD11b β2-integrin-dependent neutrophil recruitment to the lung after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure. This was linked to a Siglec-E-dependent reduction in phosphorylation of Syk-Tyr317 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in neutrophils activated via CD11b β2-integrin ligation to fibrinogen.通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> It has been widely accepted that Syk and p38 MAPK signals are essential for lung neutrophil recruitment.通用删除6(英):<u>[60,61]</u> Siglec-E in neutrophils was constitutively associated with SHP-1 and thereby dephosphorylation of Syk and p38 MAPK to repress neutrophilic inflammatory responses.通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>\nIn addition to Syk and MAPK-dependent signals negatively regulated by Siglec-E that dampens neutrophil recruitment, another important compensatory pathway involved is the activation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex and production of ROS.通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u> NADPH oxidase, a multi-subunit membrane-bound enzyme complex, can be assembled and activated in response to a wide variety of stimulants.通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u> Studies targeting NADPH oxidase deficiency revealed a key contribution of the complex in antimicrobial host defense in humans and rodents.通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u> Moreover, other studies using NADPH oxidase-deficient mice have validated a phagocyte-derived ROS-mediated anti-inflammatory properties, thereby inhibiting the neutrophils infiltration into the lungs.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> Thus, the McMillan study provided a novel viewpoint that ROS production by neutrophils following LPS stimulation was dominantly dependent on Siglec-E, which is responsible for the suppression of neutrophils recruitment to the lung.通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u> Given the role of murine Siglec-E as a negative regulator in neutrophil recruitment, the human functional ortholog, Siglec-9 could be a potential therapeutic target in neutrophil-driven inflammatory lung disease.\nFor decades, multiple studies have indicated that ligation of Siglecs-9 or Siglec-E is associated with regulation of neutrophil functions, such as induction of apoptotic and autophagic-like cell death,通用删除6(英):<u>[47,48]</u> inhibition of recruitment and activation,通用删除6(英):<u>[59,62]</u> modulation of oxidative stress,通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u> repression of inflammatory cytokine secretion,通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> and regulation of tumor immune surveillance.通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> To date, the natural ligands of Siglec-9 and Siglec-E have not been fully identified.\nRecent groundbreaking reports have revealed that certain bacteria strains and tumor cells can exploit sialoglycan-Siglec interactions to modulate immune cell function, thereby evading immune surveillance.通用删除6(英):<u>[66,67]</u> In the field of microbial immunity, Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of Siglec-9-mediated bacterial infections in human newborns.通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u> The key virulence agent of GBS is its cystic polysaccharide, mimicking sialic acid that suppresses host immune response and provides a survival benefit to the etiological agent. Therefore, bacterial GBS could bind to Siglec-9 on neutrophils, which is anticipated to inhibit the immunoreactivity of neutrophils. Soluble form of Siglec-9 (sSiglec-9), also known as the extracellular region of Siglec-9, can competitively inhibit binding of GBS to Siglec-9 on neutrophils, leading to antibacterial benefit against GBS infection in the sSiglec-9 transgenic mice.通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u>\nHigh-molecular-weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA), a class of glycosaminoglycans, can conjugate to Siglec-9 in a sialic acid-independent fashion and perform immunosuppressive activities on human neutrophils.通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u> This interaction between HMW-HA and Siglec-9 may recruit SHP-1 to ITIMs, leading to neutrophil dysfunctions (eg, NETs formation, and oxidative burst) and inducing apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u> Group A streptococci utilize this dynamic procedure to escape from neutrophil attack via HMW-HA capsules.通用删除6(英):<u>[70]</u> Of note, a weaker cross-linking was observed between HMW-HA and murine Siglec-E.通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u>\nIn the fledgling field of tumor immunity, Jia et al通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u> first demonstrated that LPS-induced increases in Siglec-9 ligand and MUC5B expression in Calu-3 human lung adenocarcinoma cells occur via activating the TLR-4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Interestingly, Tomioka et al通用删除6(英):<u>[72]</u> reported that sSiglec-9 competitively antagonizes binding of Mucin1 to its immunomodulatory receptor Siglec-9, leading to the anti-tumor effect on Mucin1-expressing tumor cells in vivo, which may down-regulate the negative immunomodulatory function and/or inhibit tumor-associated Mucin1 downstream signal, and subsequent tumor proliferation.\nMoreover, a novel sialylated ligand of Siglec-9-N-glycosylated lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 binding protein (LGALS3BP) was identified in human colorectal and prostate cancers.通用删除6(英):<u>[73]</u> LGALS3BP binds with high affinity to Siglec-9 and suppresses neutrophil activation, suggesting a potential mechanism of tumor immune evasion via Siglec-9 ligation. Additionally, LGALS3BP also binds to Siglec-E, while presents a lower affinity.通用删除6(英):<u>[74]</u>\nNeutrophils obtained from patients with acute septic shock or rheumatoid arthritis showed elevated Siglec-9 expression and vitality.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> Recent evidence has revealed that imbalance in Siglec-5 and Siglec-14 expression promotes initiation of inflammatory mechanisms in COPD.通用删除6(英):<u>[75,76]</u> So far, the role of Siglec-9 and its natural ligands in the pathogenesis of COPD has not yet been clearly elucidated.\nRecently, Siglec-9 and sSiglelc-9 have been shown to play an important role in excessive and uncontrolled neutrophilic inflammatory airway diseases.通用删除6(英):<u>[77]</u> In 2017, Zeng et al通用删除6(英):<u>[78]</u> further confirmed that Siglec-9 and sSiglec-9 present a compensatory elevation in COPD patients. In vitro studies, cigarette smoke extract and LPS could induce Siglec-9 and sSiglelc-9 expression in peripheral blood neutrophils and culture supernatant, respectively.通用删除6(英):<u>[78]</u> Notably, dexamethasone could augment neutrophil Siglec-9 expression rather than sSiglec-9 levels in culture supernatant, suggesting that it exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on neutrophils by inducing Siglec-9 expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[78]</u> Interestingly, sSiglce-9 only enhanced neutrophil chemotaxis toward IL-8 without influence on apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[78]</u> It was reasonable to postulate that an increased level of sSiglce-9 may lead to severe airway neutrophilia in COPD by inducing neutrophil recruitment. Siglec-9 and Siglec-E are important negative regulators of neutrophil recruitment.通用删除6(英):<u>[59,62]</u> Therefore, sSiglce-9 increased neutrophil chemotaxis probably via binding with Siglec-9 ligands to inhibit Siglec-9 function.\nAcute exacerbations are severe events that carry significant consequences for COPD patients. A number of subjects experience frequent exacerbations, designated as the exacerbation susceptible phenotype.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> These patients are a priority for research and treatment, as exacerbations lead to poorer quality of life and higher mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> As most of COPD exacerbations are caused by respiratory infections with bacteria or viruses, numerous studies suggest that the aberrant immune response may mechanistically result in exacerbation susceptibility.通用删除6(英):<u>[79]</u> The initial immune responses against these pathogenic microorganisms frequently involve endogenous glycoproteins, including Siglecs. For instance, a previous study has indicated that non-typeable Haemophilus influenza (NTHi), a major trigger of COPD exacerbations, could interact with Siglec-14 to induce proinflammatory cytokine production and secretion from myeloid cells. Consistently, Siglec-14 deficiency resulted in a reduced risk of COPD exacerbations.通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u>\nIt is widely recognized that Siglec-14 ligation can activate innate immune cells. Mostly, Siglecs play a negative modulatory function in innate immune response including Siglec-9. Ishii et al通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u> demonstrated that two prevalent non-synonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs), rs2075803 and rs2258983, in the SIGLEC9 gene were associated with higher risk of exacerbations and the extent of emphysema in a Japanese population of COPD. Furthermore, a myeloid cell line THP-1 expressing the Siglec-9 variant corresponding to the GA haplotype (rs2075803 = G and rs2258983 = A) induced more TNF-α expression than the control haplotype.通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u> In general, Siglec-9 could interact with NTHi and transduce a suppressive signal in myeloid cells. However, a genetic variant of SIGLEC9 that attenuates the suppressive function of the Siglec-9 protein would promote more severe inflammatory responses, rendering COPD patients more susceptible to exacerbation.\nIn addition, Läubli et al通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> reported that another cSNP (rs16988910) in the SIGLEC9 gene is associated with emphysematous destruction in the African-Americans. Although rs16988910 is rare among Asian or European populations, the close relationship between this SIGLEC9 cSNPs and emphysema in different ethnicities appears to support a critical function of Siglec-9 in innate immune responses, in which Siglec-9 variant is a potential risk factor for the development of emphysema in COPD.\nCOPD is a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality throughout the world. At present, the pathophysiology of COPD is poorly understood and therapeutic strategy is mainly palliative care. The existing evidence suggests a critical role for neutrophilic inflammation in the pathogenesis of COPD. Human Siglec-9, identified predominantly on neutrophils, is an inhibitory receptor that is potentially able to induce neutrophil apoptosis, suppress neutrophil migration, and reduce exacerbation frequency and the extent of emphysema in COPD. Clinically, high-dose IVIg is now used widely for the treatment of autoimmune and systemic inflammatory diseases. Natural anti-Siglec-9 autoantibodies have been identified in IVIg, suggesting that IVIg might induce caspase-dependent cell death in Siglec-9-sensitive cells. Therefore, treatment for efficient anti-neutrophilic inflammation should be developed via using Siglec-9 relevant ligands or agonistic antibodies. In the future, based on in-depth dissection of the glycobiological characteristics of Siglec-9, a series of targeted therapies will be developed for treatment of COPD, including synthetic ligands, specific antibodies, and small molecule compounds.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:30:09", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:30:48", "cost": 39.671}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:32", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:30:48", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:30:08"}

There are a range of insecticide classes used in agriculture that have not yet been applied to public health, such as the neonicotinoids. Some of these likely will provide additional modes of action for insecticide resistance management, particularly until new modes of action dedicated to vector control become available.\nThe neonicotinoid family is composed of eight active ingredients which includes imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, thiacloprid, nitenpyram, acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran and nithiazine. These have a unique mode of action from other insecticides currently used in public health, hence their potential value in resistance management. They act by selectively targeting the invertebrate nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and disrupting excitatory cholinergic neurotransmission leading to paralysis and death 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Neonicotinoids are widely used in agriculture. Their pest spectrum, systemic activity and relatively low risk to non-target organisms have resulted in their widespread use. They constituted more than 25% of the insecticides sold globally in 2014 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Imidacloprid, the first neonicotinoid developed for commercial use, was introduced in 1991. While it is currently the most widely-used neonicotinoid, several others have been developed and implemented since its inception.\nInterest in neonicotinoids for vector control is focused around clothianidin, which was developed by both Sumitomo (solo, under the brand name SumiShield) and Bayer (as a combination with deltamethrin, under the brand name Fludora Fusion). These lead to a need to better understand the current susceptibility profiles of Anopheles spp. malaria mosquitoes to this family of compounds, especially in areas where agricultural usage is high. Several studies have proposed the link between agricultural pesticide use and the development of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors 通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,5,6,7,8]</u>, although direct causal links have been difficult to establish, as these studies focused on insecticide modes of action that are used both in agriculture and in public health.\nIn the study described herein, neonicotinoids were never involved in any vector control strategy in Côte d’Ivoire, so any potential resistance observed in Anopheles spp. vectors to these products could only be attributed to their use in agriculture. Three neonicotinoids were assessed in this study: clothianidin, acetamiprid and imidacloprid. We sought to evaluate, for the first time, the resistance level of natural malaria vectors to neonicotinoids in different agrochemical use contexts, and to generate data that could serve as a basis for discussion of novel neonicotinoidbased vector control strategies. Addressing these also will clarify important knowledge gaps on the role of agrochemicals in the development of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors and implications for malaria vector control interventions.\nThe study was conducted at three different geographical areas: Vitre (5°15′44 \" N, 3°45’14\" W), Tiassale (5°53′54 \" N, 4°49’42\" W) and Gagnoa (6°08′00″ N, 5°56′00″ W) in Côte d’Ivoire, that varied by agricultural profile (i.e. the main crops grown in that area) and the subsequent use of agrochemicals. Vitre is a peri-urban area located 30 km to the southeast of Abidjan, the economic capital of Côte d’Ivoire. Its climate is tropical, with a short dry season, and a rainy season marked by high rainfall most months of the year (average precipitation of 1912 mm of rain) and an average temperature of 26.5 °C. Food production, which is the main agricultural activity of the region is not as practiced as lagoon fishing which constitutes the main economic activity of residents. Gagnoa is located approximately at 270 km northeast of Abidjan. The prevailing climate is humid tropical and has four seasons including a long rainy season followed by a short dry season, and then a short rainy season followed by a long dry season. Temperatures range from 21 to 35 °C during the year. Gagnoa is located in a densely forested area, which is now severely degraded by the ubiquitous cacao crop; together with cassava constitutes the main economic activity of the region. Other agricultural activities include growing maize, yams, rice, coffee, plantain and other food products. A pervasive use of pyrethroids and neonicotinoids has been recorded in this region in crop protection (primarily against cocoa pests). These two insecticide classes account for more than 90% of all insecticides used in the region 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Tiassale is located between Abidjan and Gagnoa in southern Côte d’Ivoire, about 120 km northwest of Abidjan. The climate is tropical and also characterized by four seasons. A long rainy season during which falls 2/3 of the annual rainfall, a short dry season, then a short rainy season followed by a long dry season. Tiassale is a rice-growing irrigated area with an intensive use of agrochemicals throughout the year including pyrethroids accounting for approximately 85%, and neonicotinoids accounting for approximately 9% of all agrochemicals used 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\nThe study was conducted between June and August 2017 corresponding to the rainy season favourable to breeding site creation. Mosquito larvae were sampled from multiple breeding sites at each locality and pooled together, then re-distributed evenly in development trays containing fresh water. They were provided access to powdered TetraFin® fish food, and were reared to adults under insectary conditions of 25-28 °C and 70-80% relative humidity (RH) at the Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Cote d'Ivoire. Adults were maintained in 35 cm3 cages and allowed access to 10% sugary water.\nThe determination of a diagnostic concentration was made using bottle bioassays. The treatment of bottles was conducted in compliance with US Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[10, 11]</u>. Acetamiprid used was formulated as Optimal 20SP whereas imidacloprid and clothianidin were technical materials. These chemicals were obtained from Bayer CropScience Ltd. Each chemical was mixed in acetone (or acetone and Mero for clothianidin) at different concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 μg/bottle and used for testing against the susceptible An. gambiae Kisumu mosquitoes to determine the diagnostic concentration. The diagnostic concentration was defined as the minimum concentration that killed 100% of susceptible mosquitoes after 0.5-1 h exposure and a 24 h holding period.\nThe bioassays were performed with bottles in an upright position according to CDC guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> using 20 to 25 non-blood-fed, wild adult female An. gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes, 3 to 5 days old. Four replicates were tested per condition . During the exposure period, knocked down mosquitoes (mosquito lies on its back, mosquito that cannot stand, mosquito that cannot fly in coordinate manner and mosquito that can take off briefly but falls down immediately) were counted every 5 min . After the corresponding exposure time defined with the susceptible strain, mosquitoes were removed from the bottles and placed into net-covered plastic cups containing a 10% honey solution. They were observed for mortality daily for five consecutive days . Testing was performed at 25-27 °C and 70-90% RH.\nA total of 50 adult mosquitoes from the negative control batches were processed for molecular identification. Genomic DNA of whole mosquitoes was extracted according to Collins et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In brief, whole mosquitoes previously soaked individually in 200 μl of 2% cetyl trimethyl were crushed and incubated at 65 °C for 5 min. Then, 200 μl of chloroform was added and the resulting mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 12000 rpm. The supernatant was pipetted into a new 1.5 ml tube to which 200 μl isopropanol was added; DNA was precipitated by spinning the mixture for 15 min at 12000 rpm. The supernatant was removed and the pellet of DNA formed at the bottom of tubes was purified with 70% ethanol. A further centrifugation step at 12000 rpm for 5 min was used to rinse the DNA, the excess ethanol was removed, and the resulting pellet was dried on the lab bench overnight. The extracted DNA was reconstituted in 20 μl DNase-free water (Sigma-Aldrich, United Kingdom) prior to storage at - 20 °C.\nSpecimens were identified to species by Sine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. PCR reactions were carried out in a 25 μl reaction which contained 1 pmol of each of the following primer: F6.1A of sequence 5′-TCGCCTTAGACCTTGCGTTA-3′ used to determine An. coluzzii formerly known as An. gambiae M molecular form and the R6.1B of sequence 5′-CGCTTCAAGAATTCGAGATAC-3′ for An. gambiae formerly known as An. gambiae S molecular form. The other reagents included 0.2 mmol/L of each dNTP, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 2.5 U Taq polymerase, and 1 μl of DNA template extracted from individual mosquitoes. The thermocycler program was: 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 25 s, 54 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min, a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min, and a 4 °C hold. The resulting products were allowed to migrate on a 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. The profile of the expected bands by species was 479 bp for An. coluzzii and 249 bp for An. gambiae s.s. after visualization with an ultra violet illuminator.\nTest data were interpreted based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>, stating that: mortality < 90% is indicative of resistance, mortality levels from 90 to 97% is suggestive of probable resistance and needs further investigation, and mortality ≥98% is indicative of susceptibility. The mortality of a test sample was calculated by summing the number of dead mosquitoes across all four exposure bottles and expressing this as a percentage of the total number of exposed mosquitoes. The Abbott formula 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> was used to correct test mortality if mortality in the control was 5-20%. The test was repeated if mortality in the control was more than 20%. The time necessary to allow 50% of test mosquito populations to be knocked down (KDT50) was determined using the PoloPlus software 1.0 (Leora Software Services, Northampton Business Center, Northampton, UK).\nvia log-probit analysis, and the Resistance Ratio (RR) calculated as the KDT50 of the wild strain divided by the KDT50 of the susceptible Kisumu strain.\nIt appeared that 50 μg/bottle of clothianidin, 75 μg/bottle of acetamiprid, and 200 μg/bottle of imidacloprid were the minimum concentrations that caused 100% mortality on the susceptible Kisumu strain at 24 h post-exposure after a minimum of 30 min exposure for clothianidin and 1 h exposure for both acetamiprid and imidacloprid in CDC bottles. They were therefore considered as diagnostic concentrations for the entirety of the study.\nKnocked down mosquitoes were recorded for both acetamiprid and imidacloprid insecticides tested in the three localities, which rendered possible the determination of Resistance Ratios (RR), With regard to clothianidin, we were unable to determine the time needed for 50% of the population to be knocked down, as more than 90% mosquitoes dead in less than 15 min exposure to this chemical and did not allow generation of sufficient data points for a regression curve. For acetamiprid, the TKD50 of the Kisumu susceptible strain was 13.74 (95% CI: 10.47-16.08) min. This time has slightly increased among the wild mosquito populations. However, the RR remained at < 2 for the three locations . As for imidacloprid, the TKD50, which was 18.25 (95% CI: 14.94-21.88) min in the Kisumu strain, increased to 104.6 (95% CI: 77.2-197.7) min among the non-agricultural area of Vitre mosquito populations, and 111.6 (95% CI: 78.3-247.4) min in the rice cultivation area of Tiassale. Only one mosquito was knock down at the cocoa area of Gagnoa. This resulted in an RR varying from 5.747 for Vitre to 6.132 in Tiassale and indefinite in Gagnoa .\nResistance ratio of wild Anopheles coluzzii populations from non-agricultural (Vitre) and agricultural areas (Tiassale and Gagnoa) exposed to three neonicotinoids\n删除重复语句：<u>Resistance ratio of wild Anopheles coluzzii populations from non-agricultural (Vitre) and agricultural areas (Tiassale and Gagnoa) exposed to three neonicotinoids</u>\nKDT50: The time necessary to allow 50% of test mosquito populations to be knocked down.

The mosquito populations from Tiassale and Gagnoa appeared to be resistant to acetamiprid with mortalities less than 85% even 5 days post-exposure. In Vitre however, mosquitoes displayed 99% mortality after 24 h post exposure thus reflecting complete susceptibility . Concerning imidacloprid, the mosquito populations were resistant to this compound in the three localities . The highest mortality was recorded in Vitre followed by Tiassale, and the lowest observed in Gagnoa. Mortalities after 24 h post-exposure decreased from 60% in Vitre, non-agricultural area, to 37% in Tiassale and 13% in Gagnoa, both agricultural settings. After 5 days, mortalities at the three localities were still less than 75%.\nA total of 50 female mosquitoes were characterized per locality for species identification. It appeared that all individuals from Gagnoa were identified as An. coluzzii (100%), in Tiassale 86% of the mosquitoes were An. coluzzii (43 individuals were An. coluzzii and six were An. gambiae) and in Vitre 96% of the mosquitoes were An. coluzzii (48 individuals) and 4% (two individuals) were hybrids of An. coluzzii and An. gambiae.\nThe present study explores for the first-time resistance to neonicotinoids in the principal malaria vector An. gambiae. It raises the question of the importance of the impact of insecticides used in agriculture on the development of resistance in insects of public health interest. Indeed, the neonicotinoids are compounds exclusively used in agriculture. In Côte d’Ivoire, imidacloprid and acetamiprid are widely used for cocoa crop protection 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>, and to a considerable extent in the protection of rice fields against pests 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The fact that they have never been used in public health suggests that they may have triggered the observed resistance in Anopheles. According to Lines 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>, for an insecticide used in agriculture to be the source of insecticide resistance selection in public health insects, resistance to this compound should be observed before its use for vector control and the level of resistance should be high in areas where this compound is used compared to areas where only vector-based treatments are available. However, multipleresistance, which encompasses neonicotinoids and other agrochemicals, is also a possibility as these insecticides are used in a program that includes applications of herbicides and fungicides. The subsequent exposure of mosquito populations to multiple biocides might select for several metabolic pathways with a putative side effect on tolerance to a broader range of insecticides, including neonicotinoids. In other insects, resistance to neonicotinoids involves either a modification of the insecticide target site, preventing the insecticide from reaching its site of action following a gene polymorphism, or an increase in the degradation of the insecticide by metabolic enzymes. The neonicotinoid insecticides kill by disrupting the normal physiological workings of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a ligand-gated ion channel responsible for mediating excitatory cholinergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system of invertebrates 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The first incidences of resistance to neonicotinoids appeared 5 years after their introduction around 1996, in a worst case scenario in glasshouse production systems where multiple insecticide applications occurred within a finite pest population that also had a high reproductive rate. Today, resistance to these products is present in a substantial number of pests and the Arthropod Pesticide Resistance Database lists more than 500 cases of resistance to neonicotinoids 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\nMutations on the nAChR responsible for neonicotinoid resistance appear to be very rare in nature 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>, but when individuals are subjected to extensive selection pressures under laboratory conditions, mutations on these receptors associated with resistance are observed. Cloning of nAChR subunits of Nilaparvata lugens, the brown planthopper, after selection pressure with imidacloprid over 35 generations in laboratory conditions revealed that a replacement of tyrosine with a serine was associated with a 250-fold resistance level to imidacloprid 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Another mutation on nAChR corresponding to an arginine to threonine substitution, also known as an R81T mutation, was described as the first proven case of target-site modification leading to control failure of Myzus persicae, the green peach aphid, with neonicotinoids under field conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Metabolic resistance appears to be much more common 通用删除6(英):<u>[2, 20]</u>. Elevated expression levels of glutathione-S-transferases and esterases have been associated with resistance to Diaphorina citri 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> and Aphis gossypii 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Over expression of P450s monoxygenases are also frequently reported in many resistant cases.

There are a range of insecticide classes used in agriculture that have not yet been applied to public health, such as the neonicotinoids. Some of these likely will provide additional modes of action for insecticide resistance management, particularly until new modes of action dedicated to vector control become available.\nThe neonicotinoid family is composed of eight active ingredients which includes imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, thiacloprid, nitenpyram, acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran and nithiazine. These have a unique mode of action from other insecticides currently used in public health, hence their potential value in resistance management. They act by selectively targeting the invertebrate nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and disrupting excitatory cholinergic neurotransmission leading to paralysis and death 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Neonicotinoids are widely used in agriculture. Their pest spectrum, systemic activity and relatively low risk to non-target organisms have resulted in their widespread use. They constituted more than 25% of the insecticides sold globally in 2014 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Imidacloprid, the first neonicotinoid developed for commercial use, was introduced in 1991. While it is currently the most widely-used neonicotinoid, several others have been developed and implemented since its inception.\nInterest in neonicotinoids for vector control is focused around clothianidin, which was developed by both Sumitomo (solo, under the brand name SumiShield) and Bayer (as a combination with deltamethrin, under the brand name Fludora Fusion). These lead to a need to better understand the current susceptibility profiles of Anopheles spp. malaria mosquitoes to this family of compounds, especially in areas where agricultural usage is high. Several studies have proposed the link between agricultural pesticide use and the development of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors 通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,5,6,7,8]</u>, although direct causal links have been difficult to establish, as these studies focused on insecticide modes of action that are used both in agriculture and in public health.\nIn the study described herein, neonicotinoids were never involved in any vector control strategy in Côte d’Ivoire, so any potential resistance observed in Anopheles spp. vectors to these products could only be attributed to their use in agriculture. Three neonicotinoids were assessed in this study: clothianidin, acetamiprid and imidacloprid. We sought to evaluate, for the first time, the resistance level of natural malaria vectors to neonicotinoids in different agrochemical use contexts, and to generate data that could serve as a basis for discussion of novel neonicotinoidbased vector control strategies. Addressing these also will clarify important knowledge gaps on the role of agrochemicals in the development of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors and implications for malaria vector control interventions.\nThe study was conducted at three different geographical areas: Vitre (5°15′44 \" N, 3°45’14\" W), Tiassale (5°53′54 \" N, 4°49’42\" W) and Gagnoa (6°08′00″ N, 5°56′00″ W) in Côte d’Ivoire, that varied by agricultural profile (i.e. the main crops grown in that area) and the subsequent use of agrochemicals. Vitre is a peri-urban area located 30 km to the southeast of Abidjan, the economic capital of Côte d’Ivoire. Its climate is tropical, with a short dry season, and a rainy season marked by high rainfall most months of the year (average precipitation of 1912 mm of rain) and an average temperature of 26.5 °C. Food production, which is the main agricultural activity of the region is not as practiced as lagoon fishing which constitutes the main economic activity of residents. Gagnoa is located approximately at 270 km northeast of Abidjan. The prevailing climate is humid tropical and has four seasons including a long rainy season followed by a short dry season, and then a short rainy season followed by a long dry season. Temperatures range from 21 to 35 °C during the year. Gagnoa is located in a densely forested area, which is now severely degraded by the ubiquitous cacao crop; together with cassava constitutes the main economic activity of the region. Other agricultural activities include growing maize, yams, rice, coffee, plantain and other food products. A pervasive use of pyrethroids and neonicotinoids has been recorded in this region in crop protection (primarily against cocoa pests). These two insecticide classes account for more than 90% of all insecticides used in the region 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Tiassale is located between Abidjan and Gagnoa in southern Côte d’Ivoire, about 120 km northwest of Abidjan. The climate is tropical and also characterized by four seasons. A long rainy season during which falls 2/3 of the annual rainfall, a short dry season, then a short rainy season followed by a long dry season. Tiassale is a rice-growing irrigated area with an intensive use of agrochemicals throughout the year including pyrethroids accounting for approximately 85%, and neonicotinoids accounting for approximately 9% of all agrochemicals used 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\nThe study was conducted between June and August 2017 corresponding to the rainy season favourable to breeding site creation. Mosquito larvae were sampled from multiple breeding sites at each locality and pooled together, then re-distributed evenly in development trays containing fresh water. They were provided access to powdered TetraFin® fish food, and were reared to adults under insectary conditions of 25-28 °C and 70-80% relative humidity (RH) at the Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques en Cote d'Ivoire. Adults were maintained in 35 cm3 cages and allowed access to 10% sugary water.\nThe determination of a diagnostic concentration was made using bottle bioassays. The treatment of bottles was conducted in compliance with US Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[10, 11]</u>. Acetamiprid used was formulated as Optimal 20SP whereas imidacloprid and clothianidin were technical materials. These chemicals were obtained from Bayer CropScience Ltd. Each chemical was mixed in acetone (or acetone and Mero for clothianidin) at different concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 μg/bottle and used for testing against the susceptible An. gambiae Kisumu mosquitoes to determine the diagnostic concentration. The diagnostic concentration was defined as the minimum concentration that killed 100% of susceptible mosquitoes after 0.5-1 h exposure and a 24 h holding period.\nThe bioassays were performed with bottles in an upright position according to CDC guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> using 20 to 25 non-blood-fed, wild adult female An. gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes, 3 to 5 days old. Four replicates were tested per condition . During the exposure period, knocked down mosquitoes (mosquito lies on its back, mosquito that cannot stand, mosquito that cannot fly in coordinate manner and mosquito that can take off briefly but falls down immediately) were counted every 5 min . After the corresponding exposure time defined with the susceptible strain, mosquitoes were removed from the bottles and placed into net-covered plastic cups containing a 10% honey solution. They were observed for mortality daily for five consecutive days . Testing was performed at 25-27 °C and 70-90% RH.\nA total of 50 adult mosquitoes from the negative control batches were processed for molecular identification. Genomic DNA of whole mosquitoes was extracted according to Collins et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. In brief, whole mosquitoes previously soaked individually in 200 μl of 2% cetyl trimethyl were crushed and incubated at 65 °C for 5 min. Then, 200 μl of chloroform was added and the resulting mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 12000 rpm. The supernatant was pipetted into a new 1.5 ml tube to which 200 μl isopropanol was added; DNA was precipitated by spinning the mixture for 15 min at 12000 rpm. The supernatant was removed and the pellet of DNA formed at the bottom of tubes was purified with 70% ethanol. A further centrifugation step at 12000 rpm for 5 min was used to rinse the DNA, the excess ethanol was removed, and the resulting pellet was dried on the lab bench overnight. The extracted DNA was reconstituted in 20 μl DNase-free water (Sigma-Aldrich, United Kingdom) prior to storage at - 20 °C.\nSpecimens were identified to species by Sine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. PCR reactions were carried out in a 25 μl reaction which contained 1 pmol of each of the following primer: F6.1A of sequence 5′-TCGCCTTAGACCTTGCGTTA-3′ used to determine An. coluzzii formerly known as An. gambiae M molecular form and the R6.1B of sequence 5′-CGCTTCAAGAATTCGAGATAC-3′ for An. gambiae formerly known as An. gambiae S molecular form. The other reagents included 0.2 mmol/L of each dNTP, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 2.5 U Taq polymerase, and 1 μl of DNA template extracted from individual mosquitoes. The thermocycler program was: 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 25 s, 54 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min, a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min, and a 4 °C hold. The resulting products were allowed to migrate on a 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. The profile of the expected bands by species was 479 bp for An. coluzzii and 249 bp for An. gambiae s.s. after visualization with an ultra violet illuminator.\nTest data were interpreted based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>, stating that: mortality < 90% is indicative of resistance, mortality levels from 90 to 97% is suggestive of probable resistance and needs further investigation, and mortality ≥98% is indicative of susceptibility. The mortality of a test sample was calculated by summing the number of dead mosquitoes across all four exposure bottles and expressing this as a percentage of the total number of exposed mosquitoes. The Abbott formula 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> was used to correct test mortality if mortality in the control was 5-20%. The test was repeated if mortality in the control was more than 20%. The time necessary to allow 50% of test mosquito populations to be knocked down (KDT50) was determined using the PoloPlus software 1.0 (Leora Software Services, Northampton Business Center, Northampton, UK).\nvia log-probit analysis, and the Resistance Ratio (RR) calculated as the KDT50 of the wild strain divided by the KDT50 of the susceptible Kisumu strain.\nIt appeared that 50 μg/bottle of clothianidin, 75 μg/bottle of acetamiprid, and 200 μg/bottle of imidacloprid were the minimum concentrations that caused 100% mortality on the susceptible Kisumu strain at 24 h post-exposure after a minimum of 30 min exposure for clothianidin and 1 h exposure for both acetamiprid and imidacloprid in CDC bottles. They were therefore considered as diagnostic concentrations for the entirety of the study.\nKnocked down mosquitoes were recorded for both acetamiprid and imidacloprid insecticides tested in the three localities, which rendered possible the determination of Resistance Ratios (RR), With regard to clothianidin, we were unable to determine the time needed for 50% of the population to be knocked down, as more than 90% mosquitoes dead in less than 15 min exposure to this chemical and did not allow generation of sufficient data points for a regression curve. For acetamiprid, the TKD50 of the Kisumu susceptible strain was 13.74 (95% CI: 10.47-16.08) min. This time has slightly increased among the wild mosquito populations. However, the RR remained at < 2 for the three locations . As for imidacloprid, the TKD50, which was 18.25 (95% CI: 14.94-21.88) min in the Kisumu strain, increased to 104.6 (95% CI: 77.2-197.7) min among the non-agricultural area of Vitre mosquito populations, and 111.6 (95% CI: 78.3-247.4) min in the rice cultivation area of Tiassale. Only one mosquito was knock down at the cocoa area of Gagnoa. This resulted in an RR varying from 5.747 for Vitre to 6.132 in Tiassale and indefinite in Gagnoa .\nResistance ratio of wild Anopheles coluzzii populations from non-agricultural (Vitre) and agricultural areas (Tiassale and Gagnoa) exposed to three neonicotinoids\n删除重复语句：<u>Resistance ratio of wild Anopheles coluzzii populations from non-agricultural (Vitre) and agricultural areas (Tiassale and Gagnoa) exposed to three neonicotinoids</u>\nKDT50: The time necessary to allow 50% of test mosquito populations to be knocked down.

The mosquito populations from Tiassale and Gagnoa appeared to be resistant to acetamiprid with mortalities less than 85% even 5 days post-exposure. In Vitre however, mosquitoes displayed 99% mortality after 24 h post exposure thus reflecting complete susceptibility . Concerning imidacloprid, the mosquito populations were resistant to this compound in the three localities . The highest mortality was recorded in Vitre followed by Tiassale, and the lowest observed in Gagnoa. Mortalities after 24 h post-exposure decreased from 60% in Vitre, non-agricultural area, to 37% in Tiassale and 13% in Gagnoa, both agricultural settings. After 5 days, mortalities at the three localities were still less than 75%.\nA total of 50 female mosquitoes were characterized per locality for species identification. It appeared that all individuals from Gagnoa were identified as An. coluzzii (100%), in Tiassale 86% of the mosquitoes were An. coluzzii (43 individuals were An. coluzzii and six were An. gambiae) and in Vitre 96% of the mosquitoes were An. coluzzii (48 individuals) and 4% (two individuals) were hybrids of An. coluzzii and An. gambiae.\nThe present study explores for the first-time resistance to neonicotinoids in the principal malaria vector An. gambiae. It raises the question of the importance of the impact of insecticides used in agriculture on the development of resistance in insects of public health interest. Indeed, the neonicotinoids are compounds exclusively used in agriculture. In Côte d’Ivoire, imidacloprid and acetamiprid are widely used for cocoa crop protection 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>, and to a considerable extent in the protection of rice fields against pests 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. The fact that they have never been used in public health suggests that they may have triggered the observed resistance in Anopheles. According to Lines 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>, for an insecticide used in agriculture to be the source of insecticide resistance selection in public health insects, resistance to this compound should be observed before its use for vector control and the level of resistance should be high in areas where this compound is used compared to areas where only vector-based treatments are available. However, multipleresistance, which encompasses neonicotinoids and other agrochemicals, is also a possibility as these insecticides are used in a program that includes applications of herbicides and fungicides. The subsequent exposure of mosquito populations to multiple biocides might select for several metabolic pathways with a putative side effect on tolerance to a broader range of insecticides, including neonicotinoids. In other insects, resistance to neonicotinoids involves either a modification of the insecticide target site, preventing the insecticide from reaching its site of action following a gene polymorphism, or an increase in the degradation of the insecticide by metabolic enzymes. The neonicotinoid insecticides kill by disrupting the normal physiological workings of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a ligand-gated ion channel responsible for mediating excitatory cholinergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system of invertebrates 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The first incidences of resistance to neonicotinoids appeared 5 years after their introduction around 1996, in a worst case scenario in glasshouse production systems where multiple insecticide applications occurred within a finite pest population that also had a high reproductive rate. Today, resistance to these products is present in a substantial number of pests and the Arthropod Pesticide Resistance Database lists more than 500 cases of resistance to neonicotinoids 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\nMutations on the nAChR responsible for neonicotinoid resistance appear to be very rare in nature 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>, but when individuals are subjected to extensive selection pressures under laboratory conditions, mutations on these receptors associated with resistance are observed. Cloning of nAChR subunits of Nilaparvata lugens, the brown planthopper, after selection pressure with imidacloprid over 35 generations in laboratory conditions revealed that a replacement of tyrosine with a serine was associated with a 250-fold resistance level to imidacloprid 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Another mutation on nAChR corresponding to an arginine to threonine substitution, also known as an R81T mutation, was described as the first proven case of target-site modification leading to control failure of Myzus persicae, the green peach aphid, with neonicotinoids under field conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Metabolic resistance appears to be much more common 通用删除6(英):<u>[2, 20]</u>. Elevated expression levels of glutathione-S-transferases and esterases have been associated with resistance to Diaphorina citri 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> and Aphis gossypii 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Over expression of P450s monoxygenases are also frequently reported in many resistant cases. Enhanced expression level of this enzyme family has been strongly associated with resistance to neonicotinoids in M. persicae 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>, Bemisia tabaci 通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25,26]</u>, Trialeurodes vaporariorum 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>, Nilaparvata lugens 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>, Leptinotarsa decemlineata 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> and many other pests 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.

Circulating anti-desmoglein 3 autoantibody, the major pathogenic autoantibody in pemphigus vulgaris (PV), has been proved pathogenic in PNP. Because of many clinical differences between PNP and PV, we speculate about the involvement of other autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of PNP. Envoplakin (EPL) and periplakin (PPL) are recognized by most PNP sere. Their linker subdomains are highly homologous and necessary for the association of intermediate filaments.Methods We characterized the autoantibodies against the linker subdomains of EPL and PPL in PNP patients' sera and their associated tumors by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorence. We also applied the purified autoantibodies against EPL and PPL from PNP sera to cultured human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK), to evaluate the changes of cell-cell adhesion.Results Autoantibodies against EPL and PPL were detected in most PNP patients by ELISA, and the decrease of these autoantibodies after removal of the tumors was roughly comparable to the improvement of clinical symptoms. Cultured tumor cells from PNP patients secreted these autoantibodies. Specific immunoglobulin receptors for EPL and PPL were found on B lymphocytes in tumors from PNP. Furthermore, purified anti-EPL and anti-PPL autoantibodies from PNP sere were capable of dissociating cultured human epidermal keratinocytes.Conclusion Autoantibodies against EPL and PPL may also be pathogenic in PNP。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:31:52", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:31:58", "cost": 6.131}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:32", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:31:57", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:31:51"}

One possible approach to early AD diagnosis is to look into the olfactory sensory dysfunction.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Research has showed that AD patients always have an impaired ability to detect, discriminate, and identify odors.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> The scores of the AD groups in the odor identification ability tests were significantly lower than those of normal old-adult groups.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Many clinical investigations have demonstrated that impairment in odor identification, superior to deficits in verbal episodic memory, is a better index in predicting cognitive decline in cognitively intact participants, who were followed-up 2–4 years before cognitive decline and AD dementia.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Other observations also strongly argue for olfactory marker as a complementary tool for the early screening of AD patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> These findings suggest that targeting the olfactory dysfunction may be rewarding in searching for a potential approach to an early diagnosis of AD.\nOf the technologies currently employed in AD research, radiotracer for amyloid imaging of (18F)-Florbetapen (Flor) and (11C)-Pittsburg Compound B (PIB) have been applied to observe in vivo Aβ deposition in AD, for soluble Aβ in the cytoplasm of neurons and extracellular amyloid plaques are the core pathological biomarkers of AD. However, because of the inherent limitations of the imaging principle, both of them can only reveal the extracellular amyloid plaque and cannot display intracellular amyloid,通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> meaning that the techniques are applicable only after the formation of extracellular Aβ plague at the middle stage of AD. Actually, due to the limited sensibility of (18F)-Flor and (11C)-PIB, amyloid deposition can only be detected at the late stage of AD.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> Fortunately, many recent investigations have showed that positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with a radio-labelled glucose analog, 2-deoxy-2-(18F) fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]-FDG), can precisely reveal the decreased glucose metabolism in the AD brain, which results from Aβ deposition and its deleterious effects on neurons and astrocytes. Similar results have been replicated in mice models.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> This scanning technology has also been used in AD patients and demonstrated classical glucose metabolic changes in temporal, parietal, posterior cingulate, and inferior parietal cortices.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18]</u> But these significant changes occur only years after the appearance of clinical symptoms.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,19]</u> Up to date, no research has employed this promising technology to investigate the glucose metabolism of the olfactory bulb in AD model mice.\nRecently, a new kind of transgenic animal model, which contains all 5 human mutations related to familial AD (Swedish, Florida, and London human APP mutations; M146L and L286V PS1 mutations, designated as 5XFAD), has been invented for AD research.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Intracellular amyloid and gliosis and other neuropathological characteristics of AD can be detected in 5XFAD mice at 2 months of age, and cognitive deficits are observed at 5–6 months of age, much earlier than in other transgenic mouse models.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Here, we attempted to investigate whether the reduction of glucose metabolism in the olfactory bulb of 5XFAD mice occurs earlier than that in other cerebral regions and prior to other incidents such as cognitive impairment and olfactory dysfunction.\n5XFAD APP/PS1 doubly transgenic B6/SJL mice were kindly provided by Prof. Mary Jo LaDu (Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL, USA). These transgenic hemizygous mice were bred to produce the subjects used in the study, and the genotype of the animals was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis with DNA from tail biopsy. As a result, a total of 14 male 5XFAD mice (3 months of age, n = 7, 6 months of age, n = 7) and 14 male wild-type (WT) counterparts (3 months of age, n = 7, 6 months of age, n = 7) were enrolled for this study. The animals were housed in cages (30 cm × 20 cm × 15 cm; 3–4 mice per cage) on a 12 h light cycle (lights on at 6:30 pm) at 22°C. The cage contained wood-chip bedding material and a small polyethylene tube and were covered with a metal cage top. The mice were allowed free access to food and tap water. All protocols and procedures used in the study observed the National Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee of Fujian Medical University.\nMorris water maze test is one of the most common methods to detect the symptoms of dementia and frequently employed to assess AD-related cognitive impairment. All mice (5XFAD mice, 3 months of age, n = 7, 6 months of age, n = 7, WT counterparts, 3 months of age, n = 7, 6 months of age, n = 7) are enrolled for this test.\nThe maze (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands) was a black pool (120 cm in diameter) filled with a mixture of water and milk (30 cm in depth). A colorless platform (10 cm in diameter) was submerged 2 cm beneath the surface of the mixture and the temperature was set at 23 ± 1°C. Before each behavioral test, mice were given 1 h to adapt to the light-controlled testing room. During the testing, the mice were placed in the pool at one of the four locations, which was changed on each trial. The animals were allowed 60 s to locate the platform and to stay there for 30 s. If they failed to locate the platform within 60 s, they were guided to the platform, and left there for 30 s. After each trial, the animals were towel dried and returned to their home cages. Mice underwent four swimming trials daily for 4 days with a 20 min interval between trials.\nAll trials were videotaped and swim path tracked using Ethovision Video-Tracking Software (v3.1.16 Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen). For each trial, escape latency and total times crossing the platform were calculated. On the fifth day, the animals were placed in the pool for 60 s and tested in a probe trial with the platform removed. Escape latency and total times crossing the location of the removed platform were taken as a measurement of the memory of the platform position.\nTwo independent behavioral tests were performed to indentify the olfactory function. All mice were enrolled to perform both tests one after another. The experimenter was blinded to the genotype information during the tests. The first test was buried food pellet test (Shanghai Xinruan, Co. Ltd. China). As described,通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> before the test, the mice were placed on a food-restricted diet of 0.2 g chow each day for 3 days but allowed free access to water. For the subsequent 3 days, they underwent behavioral testing. Before the behavioral trials, they were given 1 h to adapt to the testing room. In each trial, mice were placed in a black test cage (45 cm × 24 cm × 20 cm), in which a food pellet (0.5 g) was buried 0.5 cm below the surface of the bedding material (3 cm in depth). The location of the food pellet was changed every day randomly. The latency was recorded from the moment the mice were placed in the cage to the moment they grasped the food pellet with the forepaws or teeth. After the mice had consumed the pellet, they were returned to the cages. The bedding material was changed after each daily trial. As a control, a visible pellet test with the food on top of the bedding was conducted, and mice were allowed to consume the food pellet after the test.\nThe second test was olfactory maze test (Shanghai Xinruan, Co. Ltd.). The maze was a black platform pool (76.2 cm in diameter) bounded by a circular wall (20 cm in height). Located within this circular wall were 6 fixed, open corners with equal distance between one another 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. Within the corners, the food pellet was hidden from sight but could be found by smelling. Before the test, mice were placed on a food-restricted diet of 0.2 g chow each day for 3 days but allowed free access to water. For the subsequent 3 days, they underwent behavioral testing. Before the behavioral trials, the animals were given 1 h to adapt to the testing room. In each trial, a mouse chow pellet (0.5 g) was placed behind one of the corners randomly, and then mice were placed at the center of the platform. The latency was calculated from the time when the mice were placed at the center of the platform to the moment they grasped the food pellet. The animals were returned to the cages after they consumed the pellet. As a control, a visible pellet test following each daily trial was performed with the food pellet placed on a visible corner of the platform and the mice were allowed to consume the food before returning to the cages. The platform was washed with 70% ethanol after each trial to eliminate the odor.\nAfter PET-computed tomography (CT) scan, all mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal chloral hydrate (125 mg/kg) and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and then with PBS. After the mice had been decapitated, the whole brain containing the olfactory bulb was dissected and postfixed in paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 24 h. After being dehydrated with increasing concentrations of sucrose, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C, the dissected tissues were further sectioned with a freezing microtome 删除2：<u>(CM1950, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany)</u> from the olfactory bulb to the caudal hypothalamus into slices (30 µm in thickness) and stored at -20°C in cryoprotectant solution with 30% glycerin, 30% ethylene glycol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 40% PBS (0.1 mol/L). Immunofluorescence was performed according to a published protocol of our laboratory.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> In brief, sections were washed with tris-buffered saline (TBS), then blocked at room temperature for 1 h with TBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA, and further incubated at 4°C for 48 h with the polyclonal rabbit anti-Aβ (6E10, which recognizes the 1–16 amino acid sequence of human Aβ, 1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TA, USA) in TBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA. The primary antibody was omitted in control sections. After incubation, the sections were washed with TBS 6 times (10 min per wash) and incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000; ABCAM, Cambridge, MA, USA) in TBS at room temperature for 1 h. Then the sections were further incubated with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min. After a 30 min wash, the sections were mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides and coverslipped with prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, China). These slides were examined under a confocal microscope (Zeiss, 780, Germany) to detect Aβ in consistent parameter settings including objectives, laser intensities, PMT voltages, offsets, and pinhole sizes.\nBefore the imaging procedure, all the 5XFAD and age-matched WT mice were weighed, and then restrained in a tailveiner restrainer and injected via the tail vein with (18F)-FDG (Beijing PET, Co, Ltd, China) at a dose of 500–600 μCi in 100–120 μL saline according to their weights. The animals were subsequently returned to their cages. After 40 min for the uptake of (18F)-FDG, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of 96% O2 and 4% isoflurane, and placed into the animal dedicated PET-CT camera (Inveon microPET, Germany) for CT attenuation correction scan and high density PET image reconstruction. The spatial restructuring was facilitated with ordered subset expectation maximization with three-dimensional resolution recovery (OSEM3D, implementation of C Michel). The CT image of the skull of each animal was co-registered with the mouse brain resonance image template, in which the volumes of interest (VOIs) were already drawn.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> After co-registration, the spatial mathematic data were transformed into the animals’ fused PET images to produce a correct match between PET image and the brain template. For the purpose of quantification, the FDG uptake of the VOIs was obtained and shown in standard uptake value (SUV), and regional SUV was quantified with PMOD version 3.2 (PMOD Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland). During data acquisition, anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% isoflurane vaporized in O2 through an orofacial mask.\nData from all procedures were expressed as mean ± standard error (SE). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) software package and diagrams were plotted with Prism GraphPad 5.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, USA). Indices in acquisition trails such as escape latency, total times crossing the platform in Morris water maze test, latency time in Olfaction behavioral test, and SUV in PET-CT were analyzed with One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of repeated measures. All statistical analysis of 5XFAD group in comparison with WT group was rechecked with Student’s t-test. In all cases, P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\nAt 3 months, no significant difference was found between WT and 5XFAD mice in the escape latency, total times crossing the platform 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. At 6 months, the latency of the 6-month-old 5XFAD mice was significantly longer than that of 3-month-old 5XFAD mice (P = 0.0034) and of 6-month- old WT mice (P = 0.0262); no significant difference was reported between the two groups of WT mice. In addition, the total times crossing the platform of the 6-month-old 5XFAD mice were significantly reduced when compared with those of 3-month-old 5XFAD mice (P = 0.0223) and of 6-month-old WT mice (P = 0.0157); no significant difference was found between the two groups of WT mice.\nThe first behavioral analysis of olfactory function was buried food pellet recovery test. The latency was recorded from the time when the mice were placed in the cage to the moment they grasped the food pellet. At 3 months, no significant difference in the latency was found between the groups in each daily trial 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. In contrast, at 6 months, a significantly greater latency time was found in 5XFAD mice in each daily trial when compared with that of age-matched WT mice (day 1 P = 0.0012, day 2 P = 0.0031, day 3 P = 0.0160). As control, the latency time for recovery of a visible food pellet did not differ significantly across the groups regardless of age.\nIn the olfactory maze test, the latency was calculated from the moment the animals were placed in the platform to the moment they recovered the hidden food pellet. In each daily trial, no significant difference in the latency was reported between WT and 5XFAD mice at 3 months of age. However, at 6 months, a significantly greater latency time in 5XFAD mice was found when compared with that of age-matched WT mice (day 1 P = 0.0002, day 2 P < 0.0001, day 3 P = 0.0045). In the control test, the latency time for recovery of a visible food pellet did not differ significantly across the groups regardless of age.\nIn the present study, Aβ deposit, including soluble Aβ in the cytoplasm of neurons and extracellular amyloid plaques, was detected by Aβ immunolabeling with Aβ antibody 6E-10. In WT mice at either age, no amyloid deposits were present 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>. In 3 months old 5XFAD mice, intracellular Aβ deposits were found, but not in extracellular regions of the neocortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. In 6 months old 5XFAD mice, intracellular Aβ was detected throughout the brain, and olfactory bulb and extracellular Aβ plagues were also observed in the neocortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb.\nThe reconstruction of PET-CT images demonstrated remarkable (18F)-FDG uptake. As shown, at the age of 6 months, (18F)-FDG uptake in the whole brain of 5XFAD mice was obviously lower than that in age-matched WT mice. Because of different injected doses and animal weights, and small size of the olfactory bulb, the differences of (18F)-FDG uptake in the olfactory bulb between 5XFAD and WT mice could not be visually detected 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>. However, image quantification of SUV showed more details: At 3 months, no significant difference in SUV between 5XFAD, and WT mice was found in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex; at 6 months, the uptake of (18F)-FDG in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of 5XFAD mice was remarkably reduced when compared with that of WT mice (P = 0.0121 and P < 0.0001, respectively).\nHowever, different from that in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, the uptake of (18F)-FDG in the olfactory bulb of the 3 months old 5XFAD mice was significantly lower than that of WT mice of the same age (P = 0.023), which was exacerbated in the 6 months old 5XFAD mice when they were compared with the age-matched WT mice (P < 0.0001). This finding suggests that the decrease of (18F)-FDG uptake in the olfactory bulb occurs earlier than that in other cerebral regions.\nIn the present study, we investigated Aβ deposit, cognitive impairment, olfactory dysfunction, and the reduction of glucose metabolism in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 5XFAD mice at the ages of 3 and 6 months. Of note, in 3 months old 5XFAD mice, we found that the decline of (18F)-FDG uptake in the olfactory bulb occurred earlier than other incidents.\nThe neural mechanisms of odor processing in rodents have already been well-understood. First, the odor input is transmitted to the olfactory bulb by sensory neurons, which is then decoded and recoded in the piriform cortex and finally flocks together in the hippocampus.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Although the mechanisms of AD-related olfactory sensory loss have already been explored through the use of transgenic mouse models通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> and studies have documented olfactory deficits in APP transgenic mice,通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> the role of Aβ in contributing to AD-related olfactory impairment and the involvement of these cerebral regions remain largely obscure.\nThe current study employed buried food pellet test to investigate the olfactory behaviors of the animals通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> and olfactory maze test to justify the findings. Other olfactory tests such as odor discrimination test通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u> and a 2-nozzle drink test通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> have also been used in mice, but these tests involve training, and thus other sensory and higher cortical functions are implicated in the results, suggesting the potential presence of other cofounders. In current study, we observed similar cognitive outcomes to those of Morris water maze test: The latency of 6 months old 5XFAD mice was significantly longer than that of age-matched WT mice and 3 months old 5XFAD mice; no significant difference was found between WT and 5XFAD mice at the age of 3 months. In both olfactory function tests, we observed improvement in the performance during the subsequent repeated 3 daily tests, probably due to the learning and conditioning effect. The latency time for recovery of a visible food pellet did not differ significantly in all groups, indicating that the prolonged acquisition for 5XFAD mice is not due to visual acuity disorder. These findings suggest that the olfactory dysfunction of 5XFAD mice occurs between 3 and 6 months.\nFunctional neuroimaging techniques have been widely used to assess nerve dysfunction. In particular, among all the functional brain imaging techniques, FDG-PET has the unique ability to assess the local cerebral glucose metabolic rate and can provide information on the distribution of neuronal death and synaptic dysfunction in AD in vivo.通用删除6(英):<u>[31,32]</u> In our study, consistent with the result of Aβ accumulation and memory impairment, (18F)-FDG uptake of the 3 months old 5XFAD mice was not significantly different from that of age-matched WT mice but significantly lower than that of the 6 months old 5XFAD mice in the region of hippocampus and cerebral cortex, implying that glucose uptake dysfunction通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> or impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism and synaptic damage通用删除6(英):<u>[33,34]</u> may play a significant role in the progression of AD. At the beginning of the AD, intracellular Aβ starts to accumulate and damage the mitochondrial energy metabolism, but because of the possible compensation of other healthy cells, the phenomenon cannot be detected by PET-CT until enough Aβ deposits result in the observed reduction in (18F)-FDG uptake.\nOn the contrary, the SUV of the olfactory bulb in the 3 months old 5XFAD mice was significantly lower than that in WT mice, which increased in severity with age. This discrepancy between the olfactory bulb and other cerebral regions makes the reduction of (18F)-FDG uptake in the olfactory bulb an earlier in vivo AD-related biomarker in 5XFAD mice. Olfactory dysfunction is a common and early symptom of many neurodegenerative diseases, particularly of AD, Parkinson’s disease, and mild cognitive impairment heralding its progression to dementia.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> Aβ deposits are detected in the olfactory bulb in AD postmortem brains and are severer than in other cerebral regions,通用删除6(英):<u>[35,36]</u> indicating that Aβ deposition in the olfactory bulb may occur faster than other regions, resulting in an earlier reduction of (18F)-FDG uptake. Another reason is nonfibrillar Aβ deposition within the olfactory bulb, which is another AD-related issue, also occurs earlier than that in other brain regions.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> In addition, postnatal interneurons arise from the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and constantly mature into the neurons in the olfactory bulb通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> while the differentiation and proliferation of those in other regions stop postnatally, which means that the olfactory bulb is more metabolically active and more easily damaged and needs more glucose than other regions of the brain.\nTaken together, our data indicate that the reduction of glucose metabolism in the olfactory bulb is an earlier AD-related biological marker in 5XFAD mice, which provides a potential new therapeutic approach to early diagnose AD patients and to make an optimal prognosis possible. Because of the distinct anatomic structure of human body, different from that of mice, the evaluation of SUV in human olfactory bulb may pose some difficulties. Therefore, the progress of neuroimaging technology in this field is enthusiastically anticipated.\nWe thank Prof. Mary Jo LaDu (Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL, USA) for kindly providing the 5XFAD mice.

As a control, a visible pellet test with the food on top of the bedding was conducted, and mice were allowed to consume the food pellet after the test.\nThe second test was olfactory maze test (Shanghai Xinruan, Co. Ltd.). The maze was a black platform pool (76.2 cm in diameter) bounded by a circular wall (20 cm in height). Located within this circular wall were 6 fixed, open corners with equal distance between one another 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. Within the corners, the food pellet was hidden from sight but could be found by smelling. Before the test, mice were placed on a food-restricted diet of 0.2 g chow each day for 3 days but allowed free access to water. For the subsequent 3 days, they underwent behavioral testing. Before the behavioral trials, the animals were given 1 h to adapt to the testing room. In each trial, a mouse chow pellet (0.5 g) was placed behind one of the corners randomly, and then mice were placed at the center of the platform. The latency was calculated from the time when the mice were placed at the center of the platform to the moment they grasped the food pellet. The animals were returned to the cages after they consumed the pellet. As a control, a visible pellet test following each daily trial was performed with the food pellet placed on a visible corner of the platform and the mice were allowed to consume the food before returning to the cages. The platform was washed with 70% ethanol after each trial to eliminate the odor.\nAfter PET-computed tomography (CT) scan, all mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal chloral hydrate (125 mg/kg) and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and then with PBS. After the mice had been decapitated, the whole brain containing the olfactory bulb was dissected and postfixed in paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 24 h. After being dehydrated with increasing concentrations of sucrose, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C, the dissected tissues were further sectioned with a freezing microtome 删除2：<u>(CM1950, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany)</u> from the olfactory bulb to the caudal hypothalamus into slices (30 µm in thickness) and stored at -20°C in cryoprotectant solution with 30% glycerin, 30% ethylene glycol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 40% PBS (0.1 mol/L). Immunofluorescence was performed according to a published protocol of our laboratory.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> In brief, sections were washed with tris-buffered saline (TBS), then blocked at room temperature for 1 h with TBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA, and further incubated at 4°C for 48 h with the polyclonal rabbit anti-Aβ (6E10, which recognizes the 1–16 amino acid sequence of human Aβ, 1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TA, USA) in TBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA. The primary antibody was omitted in control sections. After incubation, the sections were washed with TBS 6 times (10 min per wash) and incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000; ABCAM, Cambridge, MA, USA) in TBS at room temperature for 1 h. Then the sections were further incubated with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min. After a 30 min wash, the sections were mounted on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides and coverslipped with prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, China). These slides were examined under a confocal microscope (Zeiss, 780, Germany) to detect Aβ in consistent parameter settings including objectives, laser intensities, PMT voltages, offsets, and pinhole sizes.\nBefore the imaging procedure, all the 5XFAD and age-matched WT mice were weighed, and then restrained in a tailveiner restrainer and injected via the tail vein with (18F)-FDG (Beijing PET, Co, Ltd, China) at a dose of 500–600 μCi in 100–120 μL saline according to their weights. The animals were subsequently returned to their cages. After 40 min for the uptake of (18F)-FDG, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of 96% O2 and 4% isoflurane, and placed into the animal dedicated PET-CT camera (Inveon microPET, Germany) for CT attenuation correction scan and high density PET image reconstruction. The spatial restructuring was facilitated with ordered subset expectation maximization with three-dimensional resolution recovery (OSEM3D, implementation of C Michel). The CT image of the skull of each animal was co-registered with the mouse brain resonance image template, in which the volumes of interest (VOIs) were already drawn.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> After co-registration, the spatial mathematic data were transformed into the animals’ fused PET images to produce a correct match between PET image and the brain template. For the purpose of quantification, the FDG uptake of the VOIs was obtained and shown in standard uptake value (SUV), and regional SUV was quantified with PMOD version 3.2 (PMOD Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland). During data acquisition, anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% isoflurane vaporized in O2 through an orofacial mask.\nData from all procedures were expressed as mean ± standard error (SE). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) software package and diagrams were plotted with Prism GraphPad 5.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, USA). Indices in acquisition trails such as escape latency, total times crossing the platform in Morris water maze test, latency time in Olfaction behavioral test, and SUV in PET-CT were analyzed with One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of repeated measures. All statistical analysis of 5XFAD group in comparison with WT group was rechecked with Student’s t-test. In all cases, P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\nAt 3 months, no significant difference was found between WT and 5XFAD mice in the escape latency, total times crossing the platform 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. At 6 months, the latency of the 6-month-old 5XFAD mice was significantly longer than that of 3-month-old 5XFAD mice (P = 0.0034) and of 6-month- old WT mice (P = 0.0262); no significant difference was reported between the two groups of WT mice. In addition, the total times crossing the platform of the 6-month-old 5XFAD mice were significantly reduced when compared with those of 3-month-old 5XFAD mice (P = 0.0223) and of 6-month-old WT mice (P = 0.0157); no significant difference was found between the two groups of WT mice.\nThe first behavioral analysis of olfactory function was buried food pellet recovery test. The latency was recorded from the time when the mice were placed in the cage to the moment they grasped the food pellet. At 3 months, no significant difference in the latency was found between the groups in each daily trial 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. In contrast, at 6 months, a significantly greater latency time was found in 5XFAD mice in each daily trial when compared with that of age-matched WT mice (day 1 P = 0.0012, day 2 P = 0.0031, day 3 P = 0.0160). As control, the latency time for recovery of a visible food pellet did not differ significantly across the groups regardless of age.\nIn the olfactory maze test, the latency was calculated from the moment the animals were placed in the platform to the moment they recovered the hidden food pellet. In each daily trial, no significant difference in the latency was reported between WT and 5XFAD mice at 3 months of age. However, at 6 months, a significantly greater latency time in 5XFAD mice was found when compared with that of age-matched WT mice (day 1 P = 0.0002, day 2 P < 0.0001, day 3 P = 0.0045). In the control test, the latency time for recovery of a visible food pellet did not differ significantly across the groups regardless of age.\nIn the present study, Aβ deposit, including soluble Aβ in the cytoplasm of neurons and extracellular amyloid plaques, was detected by Aβ immunolabeling with Aβ antibody 6E-10. In WT mice at either age, no amyloid deposits were present 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>. In 3 months old 5XFAD mice, intracellular Aβ deposits were found, but not in extracellular regions of the neocortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. In 6 months old 5XFAD mice, intracellular Aβ was detected throughout the brain, and olfactory bulb and extracellular Aβ plagues were also observed in the neocortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb.\nThe reconstruction of PET-CT images demonstrated remarkable (18F)-FDG uptake. As shown, at the age of 6 months, (18F)-FDG uptake in the whole brain of 5XFAD mice was obviously lower than that in age-matched WT mice. Because of different injected doses and animal weights, and small size of the olfactory bulb, the differences of (18F)-FDG uptake in the olfactory bulb between 5XFAD and WT mice could not be visually detected 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>. However, image quantification of SUV showed more details: At 3 months, no significant difference in SUV between 5XFAD, and WT mice was found in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex; at 6 months, the uptake of (18F)-FDG in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of 5XFAD mice was remarkably reduced when compared with that of WT mice (P = 0.0121 and P < 0.0001, respectively).\nHowever, different from that in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, the uptake of (18F)-FDG in the olfactory bulb of the 3 months old 5XFAD mice was significantly lower than that of WT mice of the same age (P = 0.023), which was exacerbated in the 6 months old 5XFAD mice when they were compared with the age-matched WT mice (P < 0.0001). This finding suggests that the decrease of (18F)-FDG uptake in the olfactory bulb occurs earlier than that in other cerebral regions.\nIn the present study, we investigated Aβ deposit, cognitive impairment, olfactory dysfunction, and the reduction of glucose metabolism in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 5XFAD mice at the ages of 3 and 6 months. Of note, in 3 months old 5XFAD mice, we found that the decline of (18F)-FDG uptake in the olfactory bulb occurred earlier than other incidents.\nThe neural mechanisms of odor processing in rodents have already been well-understood. First, the odor input is transmitted to the olfactory bulb by sensory neurons, which is then decoded and recoded in the piriform cortex and finally flocks together in the hippocampus.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Although the mechanisms of AD-related olfactory sensory loss have already been explored through the use of transgenic mouse models通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> and studies have documented olfactory deficits in APP transgenic mice,通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> the role of Aβ in contributing to AD-related olfactory impairment and the involvement of these cerebral regions remain largely obscure.\nThe current study employed buried food pellet test to investigate the olfactory behaviors of the animals通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> and olfactory maze test to justify the findings. Other olfactory tests such as odor discrimination test通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u> and a 2-nozzle drink test通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> have also been used in mice, but these tests involve training, and thus other sensory and higher cortical functions are implicated in the results, suggesting the potential presence of other cofounders. In current study, we observed similar cognitive outcomes to those of Morris water maze test: The latency of 6 months old 5XFAD mice was significantly longer than that of age-matched WT mice and 3 months old 5XFAD mice; no significant difference was found between WT and 5XFAD mice at the age of 3 months. In both olfactory function tests, we observed improvement in the performance during the subsequent repeated 3 daily tests, probably due to the learning and conditioning effect. The latency time for recovery of a visible food pellet did not differ significantly in all groups, indicating that the prolonged acquisition for 5XFAD mice is not due to visual acuity disorder. These findings suggest that the olfactory dysfunction of 5XFAD mice occurs between 3 and 6 months.\nFunctional neuroimaging techniques have been widely used to assess nerve dysfunction. In particular, among all the functional brain imaging techniques, FDG-PET has the unique ability to assess the local cerebral glucose metabolic rate and can provide information on the distribution of neuronal death and synaptic dysfunction in AD in vivo.通用删除6(英):<u>[31,32]</u> In our study, consistent with the result of Aβ accumulation and memory impairment, (18F)-FDG uptake of the 3 months old 5XFAD mice was not significantly different from that of age-matched WT mice but significantly lower than that of the 6 months old 5XFAD mice in the region of hippocampus and cerebral cortex, implying that glucose uptake dysfunction通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> or impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism and synaptic damage通用删除6(英):<u>[33,34]</u> may play a significant role in the progression of AD. At the beginning of the AD, intracellular Aβ starts to accumulate and damage the mitochondrial energy metabolism, but because of the possible compensation of other healthy cells, the phenomenon cannot be detected by PET-CT until enough Aβ deposits result in the observed reduction in (18F)-FDG uptake.\nOn the contrary, the SUV of the olfactory bulb in the 3 months old 5XFAD mice was significantly lower than that in WT mice, which increased in severity with age. This discrepancy between the olfactory bulb and other cerebral regions makes the reduction of (18F)-FDG uptake in the olfactory bulb an earlier in vivo AD-related biomarker in 5XFAD mice. Olfactory dysfunction is a common and early symptom of many neurodegenerative diseases, particularly of AD, Parkinson’s disease, and mild cognitive impairment heralding its progression to dementia.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> Aβ deposits are detected in the olfactory bulb in AD postmortem brains and are severer than in other cerebral regions,通用删除6(英):<u>[35,36]</u> indicating that Aβ deposition in the olfactory bulb may occur faster than other regions, resulting in an earlier reduction of (18F)-FDG uptake. Another reason is nonfibrillar Aβ deposition within the olfactory bulb, which is another AD-related issue, also occurs earlier than that in other brain regions.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> In addition, postnatal interneurons arise from the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and constantly mature into the neurons in the olfactory bulb通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> while the differentiation and proliferation of those in other regions stop postnatally, which means that the olfactory bulb is more metabolically active and more easily damaged and needs more glucose than other regions of the brain.\nTaken together, our data indicate that the reduction of glucose metabolism in the olfactory bulb is an earlier AD-related biological marker in 5XFAD mice, which provides a potential new therapeutic approach to early diagnose AD patients and to make an optimal prognosis possible. Because of the distinct anatomic structure of human body, different from that of mice, the evaluation of SUV in human olfactory bulb may pose some difficulties. Therefore, the progress of neuroimaging technology in this field is enthusiastically anticipated.\nWe thank Prof. Mary Jo LaDu (Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL, USA) for kindly providing the 5XFAD mice.

MM was defined according to the criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG).通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> This study was retrospective, and all patients’ data remained anonymous. Therefore, the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. This study was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by Beijing Peoples’ Hospital Ethics Committees.\nThe basic characteristics of the patients\n删除重复语句：<u>The basic characteristics of the patients</u>\nIQR: Interquartile range; ISS: International Staging System; ADL: Activity of Daily Living; IADL: Instrumental Activity Of Daily Living; –: Not applicable.\nThe primary objective of this analysis was to identify a simple scoring system based on geriatric parameters to predict overall survival (OS). The secondary objectives included an evaluation of the impact of the frailty scoring system on treatment-related toxicity and progression-free survival (PFS).\nThe GA consisted of the following three tools: Katz’s Activities of Daily Living (ADL) index, Lawton’s Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) index, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The ADL and the IADL scales were adopted to assess the self-care activities, tasks of household management and independence status. The patients’ general conditions, ISS scores, beta-2-microglobulin and albumin levels, and some chromosomal abnormalities were assessed and collected. We also assessed adverse events (AEs) in these patients, and we graded these events according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI-CTC) for Adverse Events version 3.0.\nWe used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival and compared between risk groups using log-rank testing. Estimates of the predictive effect of GA for OS were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs). A value of P ≤ 0.05 was considered to be significant differences. The statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) version 22.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).\nThis retrospective study included 628 newly diagnosed MM patients. The median age was 58 years, and the majority of patients (68.79%) were <65 years 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.\nAmong the 628 patients, 50.95% were Stage III, 26.91% were Stage II, and 22.13% were Stage I MM according to the ISS. Four hundred and twenty-two patients (67.2%) had ADL scores ≤4, 347 (55.25%) had IADL scores ≤5, and 152 (24.2%) had CCIs ≥2. Nearly, half of the patients received bortezomib-based treatment.\nIn this real practice study of MM, a multivariate Cox regression model showed that geriatric components influenced OS. In the frail patients, including those >75 years old, functional declines indicated by the ADL and IADL scores and the presence of comorbidities were associated with worse OS. Reduced OS was observed for patients aged >75 years (HR: 1.25), for patients with ADL scores ≤4 (HR: 1.36) and IADL scores ≤5 (HR: 1.31), and for patients with CCI scores ≥2 (HR: 1.11) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>. The OS did not differ between the fit and the intermediately fit patients. An ISS-adjusted multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of death was higher for patients older than 75 years. The proportions of the frail patients in the ISS I, II, and III risk groups and the OSs of these groups are illustrated 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>. Grade 3 or higher hematologic AEs were documented in 45 (35.4%) fit, 34 (34%) intermediately fit, and 121 (30.2%) frail patients. The risks of developing a grade ≥3 hematologic AEs were not significantly higher in the intermediately fit (HR: 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54–1.47, P = 1.000) or frail patients (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.70–1.93, P = 0.558) compared with the fit patients. Grade 3 or higher nonhematologic AEs were examined. The risk of developing a grade 3 or higher nonhematologic AE was slightly increased in the intermediately fit group (HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 0.89–2.77, P = 0.121) and significantly increased in the frail patients (HR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.11–2.90, P = 0.018) compared with the fit patients 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>. Drug discontinuation for any cause other than progression and death was reported in 25 (19.7%) fit, 22 (22%) intermediately fit, and 140 (34.9%) frail patients. The risk of drug discontinuation was higher in the intermediately fit patients (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.16- 8.26, P = 0.882) and significantly higher in the frail patients (HR: 3.41, 95% CI: 0.78–14.99, P < 0.105) than that in the fit patients. The combination of the ISS with the frailty score identified six groups. The median follow-up time was 13.4 months (8–33 months). The survival curves for these six groups are shown in Figure 1. The frail, ISS II/III patients were considered to be very high-risk patients and exhibited a 3-year OS of 49%. The fit, ISS I patients were deemed to be low-risk patients and exhibited the best prognoses and a 3-year OS of 90%.\nThe final Cox regression model* of the patients\n删除重复语句：<u>The final Cox regression model* of the patients</u>\n*HRs and relative risks are for overall survival in patients with the factors as compared with those without the factors. The model was adjusted for International Staging System and therapy. Harrell’s C index=0.75 (95% CI: 0.51–0.94), Akaike information criterion=585.90.

CI: Confidence interval.\nUnivariate and multivariate analysis of the impact of the frailty profile for patients on overall survival, progression-free survival, discontinuation rate, and incidence of Grade 3 or higher toxicity\n删除重复语句：<u>Univariate and multivariate analysis of the impact of the frailty profile for patients on overall survival, progression-free survival, discontinuation rate, and incidence of Grade 3 or higher toxicity</u>\n*Adjusted for ISS and therapy. HR: Hazard ratio; CI: Confidence interval; ISS: International Staging System; –: Not applicable.\nThe median age observed in the study was similar to the age reported by Dr. Lu et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> This retrospective analysis revealed that the frailty score, which combined age, functional status and comorbidities, was associated with survival and toxicity and could be useful to guide dosage adjustments for the treatment of Chinese MM patients. The frailty profile was relevant to progression, nonhematologic AEs and treatment discontinuation irrespective of the ISS stage and type. The study validated the recent IMWG publication of Dr. Palumbo et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>\nIn our analysis, the 3-year OS rates were 63% in the fit, 63% in the intermediately fit and 50% in the frail patients. In our results, OS did not significantly differ between groups, primarily because the doses were reduced during the treatment of the fit patients at some centers. The reduced survival of the frail patients was due to reductions in doses and age. A significantly higher cumulative incidence of nonhematologic toxicities and a significantly increased rate of drug discontinuation were observed in the frail patients compared with the fit patients, and the nonhematologic AEs and drug discontinuations might have reduced survival. The findings suggest that dose reductions reduced the occurrence of hematological toxicity but did not affect the toxicity of hematology.\nFollowing the combination of the frailty score with the established ISS, the 3-year OS rates were found to be 49% in the frail, ISS II/III group and 90% in the fit, ISS I group. Maybe people with more advanced stage might have worse physical activity and tolerance with regimen. We hope the combination of the two independent parameters will produce a single index that significantly improved the prognostic value and will consequently serve as an important prediction strategy in the future.\nThe chronological order of the patient’s age, the patient’s performance status, and the doctor’s clinical judgment are insufficient characteristics to define vulnerable populations. The GA could be used in routine clinical practice and in research to ensure that appropriate elderly patients were selected to facilitate more accurate cross-trial comparisons. Frail patients might benefit from mild methods or even palliative/less supportive treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16,17]</u>\nThe power of this analysis was great due to the widely representative and fairly homogeneous group of real-world data provided by the six Chinese centers. The GAs were prospectively obtained prior to the initiation of chemotherapy and reflected the patients' baseline health statuses rather than the toxicities induced by the therapies. Older people required special care in terms of treatment decisions, and efficacy and side effects must be carefully balanced.\nThe study is subject to some limitations. This study was retrospective, the value of the information was not very high, and the ADL and IADL scores from the different centers were not uniform. The treatments differed, and these differences biased the survival time data. Dose adjustments for the frail patients resulted in weak doses, and significant differences were consequently not observed between the fit and frail patients.\nIn conclusion, this study of real-world MM treatment in China revealed that in the mainland of China, the majority of patients were young, in the later ISS stages, and in poor physical condition. The fit, ISS I patients survived the longest. The specific disease risk factors of a patient need to be established prior to selecting a treatment.\nThe authors would like to thank all the patients who participated in the source studies and Stefanie K for providing editorial assistance.\nThis work was partly supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.81670192).\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:38:07", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:38:15", "cost": 7.393}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:32", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:38:13", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:38:06"}

Studies have suggested that NF1 associated GISTs (NF1-GISTs) manifest at younger ages than sporadic GISTs; they tend to be located in the small intestine and they affect females predominantly.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> Most sporadic GISTs are driven by activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA. However, these mutations in NF1-GISTs are very rare. Various mutation types GISTs coexisting in an NF1 patient are rarer still. Herein, we report a case of multiple GISTs in an NF1 patient. Mutation analysis of KIT and PDGFRA was performed in three tumors from different locations. Interestingly, the molecular analysis of the three tumors showed that one mutation was found in KIT exon 11 of the gastric GIST in this case, whereas the other two tumors from the duodenum and jejunum were identified as wild-type KIT and PDGFRA.\nA 69-year-old woman was admitted with complaints of intermittent melena and fatigue for the past 2 years. On examination, there were several café-au-lait spots and diffuse cutaneous neurofibromas over her body. On further inquiry, the patient revealed that her mother also had the similar lesions on her body. Based on this history, a diagnosis of NF1 was made. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor (1.8 cm × 1.8 cm) in the posterior wall of the stomach and another mass (3.9 cm × 3.4 cm) in the descending part of the duodenum. The CT and endoscopic ultrasound images suggested that the lesions in both stomach and duodenum were likely to be GISTs.\nSurgery was performed. During exploration, a 1.4 cm tumor was seen in the stomach and a 3.0 cm tumor was in the duodenum. The latter had abundant blood supply located in the descending part of duodenum.

From the biomechanical point of view, articular cartilage contains a lot of water and has a strong capacity to withstand compressive stress but has weak capacities to withstand tensile and shear stress. Heterogeneities in the density and rigidity of subchondral bone in OA, along with mutated material composition and disorganized microstructure, result in abnormal tensile stress and shear stress toward articular cartilage, thus facilitating cartilage degeneration. However, the characteristics of subchondral bone alterations remain unresolved, and a better understanding of these alterations may contribute to the development of bone-targeting therapies.\nClinical data have demonstrated that osteoarthritic subchondral bone turnover increases dramatically,通用删除6(英):<u>[6,11]</u> which results in disorganized bone architecture, decreased mineralization, and weakened biomechanical properties.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13,14]</u> Subchondral osteoblasts and osteoclasts manifest abnormal functions,通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> producing various cytokines, growth factors, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, which could accelerate cartilage degradation.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> However, most of these studies were focused on end-stage disease, which reveals little about early deregulation of bone turnover.\nMany animal models have been developed to study the pathophysiology of OA and to evaluate potential therapeutics.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u> Alterations in the subchondral bone have been detected with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry,通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u> histomorphometry,通用删除6(英):<u>[21,22,23,24]</u> or micro-computed tomography (micro-CT).通用删除6(英):<u>[9,25,26]</u> These changes include increased bone resorption in the early stage of OA, indicated as reduced bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume, trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) and connectivity, and increased bone accretion later in the disease, with increases in bone volume and Tb.Th, decreases in trabecular number (Tb.N) and separation, and subchondral sclerosis.\nHowever, bone is a complex tissue, the principal function of which is to resist mechanical forces, with its overall properties depending not only on quantity but also on quality, as characterized by its architecture, material composition (mineral and collagen), and intrinsic mechanical properties.通用删除6(英):<u>[27,28]</u> Presently, there is no report on the alterations in the overall properties of subchondral bone during OA progression. Confocal Raman spectroscopy systems, which are capable of probing the physiochemical properties of bone tissue based on the ratios of relative Raman peak intensity generated by the mineral and collagen phases,通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> has been used to evaluate the mineral-to-collagen ratio of bone in recent years. Nanoindentation, which emerged as a powerful tool for measuring the mechanical properties of small and complex biomaterials, has been used to investigate variations in the mechanical properties of trabecular and cortical bone in osteoporosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31]</u> Thus, using histology, micro-CT, Raman spectroscopy and nanoindentation, the current study observed the potential changes in the microarchitecture, tissue mineral density (TMD), mineral-to-collagen ratio, and intrinsic mechanical properties to evaluate the properties of subchondral bone in the commonly used rat medial meniscal tear (MMT) model of OA.\nAdult male Sprague Dawley rats (12 weeks old, weighing 276 ± 16 g) from Sino-British Sippr/BK Lab Animal Ltd. (Shanghai, China) were used in the present study. The animals were group housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum. The animals received standard laboratory chow containing 1.56% calcium, 0.8% phosphorus, and 800 IU/kg Vitamin D. The Animal Care and Experiment Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine approved all experimental procedures.\nThe rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate in phosphate-buffered saline (0.01 mol/L) after 1 week of acclimatization. The MMT model was induced as previously described.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Briefly, the medial collateral ligament of the right knee was transected, and the medial meniscus was reflected proximally toward the femur and cut through at its narrowest point. For the controls (Sham), the wounds were closed after exposing the medial collateral ligament. A total of 128 animals (64 for MMT and Sham groups, respectively) were used to observe changes in cartilage and subchondral bone. Animals were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the operation.\nThe entire knee joint was dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h. Eight joints from each group at every time point were decalcified in 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid for 3 weeks. The joints were then bisected along the collateral ligament in the frontal plane, and both sections were embedded in the same paraffin block. The samples were cut into 5-μm sections and prepared for toluidine blue O staining to evaluate cartilage degeneration. The other 8 undecalcified joints from the Sham and MMT groups at each time point were used to evaluate the properties of subchondral bone, including micro-CT imaging, confocal Raman microspectroscopy, and nanoindentation.\nOn the basis of the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) recommendations for the histological assessment of OA in the rat,通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> 3 sections from each knee at 200-mm steps were stained with toluidine blue O and subsequently evaluated for cartilage degeneration. For toluidine blue O staining, the sections were stained with 0.04% w/v toluidine blue O 删除2：<u>(Sigma, T0394, USA)</u> in 0.1 mol/L sodium acetate (pH 4.0) for 10 min, rinsed briefly, air-dried and mounted. The medial tibial plateau was divided into three regions of equal width, and cartilage degeneration in each zone was scored \"none\" to \"severe\" (numerical values 0–5) using the criteria described in Table 1. The original surface of the tissue was estimated. Then, the percentage area of each zone containing cartilage exhibiting loss of chondrocytes or loss of matrix was estimated, and a score was assigned to that zone based on that percentage. The total cartilage degeneration score was calculated by adding the values obtained for each zone.\nOsteoarthritis Research Society International recommended cartilage degeneration score for rats\n删除重复语句：<u>Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommended cartilage degeneration score for rats</u>\nStructural alterations and the tissue mineral content in the subchondral bone were evaluated using micro-CT. The knee joints were scanned by micro-CT (μCT 80; Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) with an isotropic voxel resolution of 10 μm. As shown in our previous study,通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> a portion (2.0 mm ventrodorsal length) of the load-bearing region at the medial tibial plateau was identified as a region of interest 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. Both subchondral bone plate (BP) and trabecular bone (Tb) parameters were calculated.\nThe chemical composition of the subchondral bone tissue (mineral-to-collagen ratio, υ1-PO43−/proline) was characterized by confocal Raman microspectroscopy (Renishaw Inc. Hoffman Estates, IL, USA) as described previously.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,35]</u> After micro-CT scanning, joint samples were dehydrated in a graded alcohol series, embedded in methyl methacrylate (MMA) and sliced in the frontal plane using a Leica SP1600 saw microtome. The section surface was ground on successive grits of wet silicon carbide paper and polished by hand with 1 μm alumina slurry, and 3 sections of 30 μm thickness from each sample were obtained and analyzed. A 50X objective focused the laser (785 nm laser diode source) on a 3 μm region within the medial tibial plateau, and Raman scattered light was collected by a spectrograph with 0.5 cm−1 spectral resolution. The measured spectra consisted of three accumulations with an integration time of 10 s each. Using custom-developed software (MATLAB, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), the background fluorescence in the spectra was subtracted by a modified polynomial fitting algorithm.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> Underlying the regions of articular cartilage damage, spectra were collected from three locations within the subchondral BP and eight locations within the Tb. The υ1 -PO43−/proline ratio was then calculated as the raw υ1 phosphate peak intensity (υ1-PO43−, 962 cm−1) per proline peak intensity (856 cm−1) and averaged per section.\nThe mechanical properties at the tissue level were quantified by nanoindentation as described previously.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> Following the confocal Raman microspectroscopy, the medial tibial plateau of MMA-embedded knee sections were probed using a TriboIndenter (Hysitron Inc. Minneapolis, MN, USA). A Berkovitch diamond tip (inclination angle 142.35°, radius 200 nm) was pressed into the surface using a trapezoidal loading scheme as follows: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Loading up to a nominal load of 1000 μN at a rate of 200 μN/s; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> holding at Pmax for 5 s; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> unloading to zero load at a rate of 200 μN/s. Thermal drift was corrected in the measurement software (Triboscan) by measuring the indenter drift for a maximum of 40 s before the start of every indent and applying this correction to the measured data. From the resulting force-displacement curve, the elastic modulus (Er) and hardness (H) of the tissue at the point of indention (0.25 μm resolution) was calculated following the method of Oliver and Pharr.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> Underlying the regions of articular cartilage damage, three locations on BP and eight locations on Tb per section were chosen, and four indents for each location were tested and averaged per section.\nAll of the statistical analyses were performed by blinded authors who were unaware of the treatments given. The results were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). A comparison between the Sham and MMT groups was performed with an independent-samples t-test. P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS for Windows, version 11.5 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).\nAs indicated by toluidine blue O staining 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>, MMT induced cartilage degeneration primarily on the outer regions of the medial tibia platform. Cartilage matrix and chondrocyte loss occurred and worsened in a time-dependent manner from 2 to 12 weeks postsurgery, whereas the Sham joints showed no obvious changes at any time point. At 2 weeks, matrix and chondrocyte loss mainly affected the superficial and upper middle zone. Subsequently, these changes reached the deep zone and extended more substantially into the medial tibial plateau at 4 weeks. Severe degeneration occurred at 8 weeks with full thickness involvement into the tidemark, which became more widespread at 12 weeks. Specifically, the cartilage degeneration scores for the MMT joints were 3.60 ± 0.52, 6.33 ± 0.74, 9.18 ± 1.13, and 12.85 ± 1.36 at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, respectively.\nRepresentative pictures of the knee joints from Sham and MMT groups obtained by micro-CT scanning are shown in Figure 3. In general, subchondral bone of the medial tibial plateau showed dynamic alterations following OA induction from bone resorption at the early stages (2 and 4 weeks) to bone accretion at the advanced stages (8 and 12 weeks). Specifically, compared with the Sham groups, the thickness of subchondral bone plate (BP.Th) in the MMT groups showed no significant changes at 2 and 4 weeks (P > 0.05, respectively), but increased significantly at 8 and 12 weeks (P < 0.05 and P< 0.01, respectively). The bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of Tb decreased at 2 and 4 weeks (P < 0.01, respectively) and increased at 8 and 12 weeks (P < 0.05, respectively). These changes were accompanied by the Tb.Th changing from thinner (2 and 4 weeks, P< 0.05, respectively) to thicker (8 and 12 weeks, P< 0.01, respectively), the trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp) from broader (2 and 4 weeks, P< 0.05 and P< 0.01, respectively) to narrower (8 and 12 weeks, P< 0.05 and P< 0.01, respectively), and the Tb.N and connectivity density (Cnn.D) being reduced at all times (P < 0.01). With respect to TMD, compared with the Sham groups, both the subchondral BP and Tb displayed no significant changes at 2 and 4 weeks (P > 0.05, respectively), but decreased at 8 and 12 weeks (P < 0.05, respectively).\nThe mineral-to-collagen ratio of the subchondral bone tissue, calculated as the υ1 -PO43− peak intensity per proline peak intensity (PO43−/proline) using confocal Raman microspectroscopy, is shown in Figure 4. In general, no significant difference in mineral-to-collagen ratio was observed among the Sham groups, whereas, a reduced mineral-to-collagen ratio was found in MMT animals that were aggravated with the progression of the disease. Specifically, the mineral-to-collagen ratio of the subchondral BP in MMT animals was reduced from 10.14 ± 1.94 at 2 weeks to 8.21 ± 1.45 at 12 weeks. Simultaneously, the mineral-to-collagen ratio of the Tb in MMT animals was reduced from 9.09 ± 1.97 at 2 weeks to 6.66 ± 1.43 at 12 weeks.\nThe intrinsic bone tissue mechanical properties, displayed as elastic modulus Er and hardness H quantified by nanoindentation, are shown in Figures 5 and Figure 6. The mechanical properties of the subchondral bone in the Sham groups showed no significant changes throughout the course of the experiment, whereas the mechanical properties of subchondral bone in the MMT groups were gradually reduced as the disease progressed following the MMT operation. Specifically, the elastic modulus of the subchondral BP in MMT animals was reduced from 21.75 ± 3.64 GPa at 2 weeks to 17.41 ± 3.88 GPa at 12 weeks, whereas the hardness was reduced from 0.96 ± 0.13 GPa at 2 weeks to 0.76 ± 0.13 GPa at 12 weeks. With respect to the Tb, the elastic modulus in MMT animals was reduced from 19.62 ± 3.64 GPa at 2 weeks to 14.08 ± 3.88 GPa at 12 weeks, whereas the hardness was reduced from 0.88 ± 0.11 GPa at 2 weeks to 0.68 ± 0.12 GPa at 12 weeks.\nThe rat MMT model is well-established and commonly used to study the pathophysiology of OA and to evaluate potential therapeutics.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,33]</u> Consistent with previous results,通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> the present study demonstrated that cartilage degeneration and subchondral alterations occurred in a time-dependent manner in the rat MMT model. Bone resorption dominates the early stage of disease, manifested as a decreased BV/TV ratio, reduced Tb.N and Cnn.D, thinned Tb.Th, and broadened Tb.Sp. With the progression of the disease, bone alterations shift from bone resorption to a bone formation at an advanced stage, manifested as increased BV/TV ratio, thickened Tb.Th and narrowed Tb.Sp.\nBone is a complex tissue, its overall properties depending not only on quantity, as manifested by BMD and BV/TV, but also on quality, as embodied in TMD, architecture, material composition, and mechanical properties.通用删除6(英):<u>[27,28]</u> For the first time, the present study observed the changes in the material composition and mechanical properties of subchondral bone in a rat MMT model of OA. Our data revealed that both the subchondral BP and Tb demonstrated a gradually reduced mineral-to-collagen ratio, elastic modulus and hardness with the progression of the disease. Consistent with our findings, a subchondral bone from patients with late OA showed decreased mineralization.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,39]</u> The potential mechanism by which mineralization and mechanical properties were reduced may lie in the increased bone turnover of the osteoarthritic subchondral bone.通用删除6(英):<u>[13,40]</u> Bone turnover, which is mediated by osteoclast-osteoblast coupling as the main biological determinant of bone mineralization, increases dramatically in the pathogenesis of OA.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> This accounts for much of the bone that lacked an opportunity to fully mineralize, resulting in the corresponding reduction of mechanical properties. Due to reduced intrinsic mechanical properties, subchondral osteoblast enhanced anabolic activity, and increased bone formation通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> to bear abnormal joint stress,通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> which led to an increased BV/TV ratio, thickened BP and Tb.Th, and narrowed Tb.Sp. Consequently, incomplete mineralization, reduced intrinsic mechanical properties, increased bone formation and abnormal joint stress contribute together to flattening, depression and sclerosis of the articular surface, which can be observed on radiographs or magnetic resonance imaging.\nSubchondral bone consists of the corticalized BP and the underlying Tb.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> Inconsistent results with respect to the BP.Th in OA were obtained in previous studies. Samples from patients with late OA displayed thickened subchondral BPs.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> In animal experiments, some observed a thinned subchondral BP,通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45,46]</u> whereas others observed a thickened subchondral BP.通用删除6(英):<u>[24,47,48]</u> The current study demonstrated that the BP.Th showed no obvious difference at the early stage but found thickening at the late stage in the rat MMT model. The inconsistency may be attributed to the adoption of different animal models or measurements and/or differences in the time points or stages of disease progression observed. The subchondral BP and Tb showed similar trends in TMD, the mineral-to-collagen ratio and mechanical properties with the progression of disease in the present MMT model. Compared with the BP, the Tb changed earlier and more obviously, similar to the phenomenon in osteoporosis when Tb shows more obvious changes than cortical bone owing to the high bone turnover rate in Tb.通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>\nThe precise causes leading to dynamic alterations in subchondral bone with disease progression remain unknown. The possible mechanisms of increased subchondral bone remodeling in early OA may include repair of microscopic damage,通用删除6(英):<u>[50,51]</u> vascular invasion induced by pro-angiogenic factors,通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u> and bone and cartilage interactions through micropores通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> in the subchondral bone.

Further study of subchondral bone is needed from the aspect of molecular biology. Finally, the present findings may have some implications for the treatment of OA with bone-modifying agents. Previous preclinical studies have revealed that targeting subchondral bone with bone-modifying agents,通用删除6(英):<u>[8,23,55,56]</u> such as the anti-bone resorption drugs of estrogen, calcitonin, bisphosphonates and OPG, the pro-osteogenesis drug teriparatide, and the bidirectional regulation drug strontium ranelate, has protective effects on osteoarthritic articular cartilage, and a number of clinical trial results also support the positive roles of osteoprotective agents in inhibiting the degradation of cartilage type II collagen and delaying cartilage degeneration in OA.通用删除6(英):<u>[57,58,59]</u> However, these protective effects have not been consistently confirmed by clinical data.通用删除6(英):<u>[41,60]</u> The present findings that the properties of subchondral bone are dynamic with disease progression indicate that abnormal subchondral bone cannot always be modified, and the stage of disease progression may influence the efficacy of bone-modifying therapy.\nIn conclusion, alterations in the bone volume, microarchitecture, TMD, mineral-to-collagen ratio, and intrinsic mechanical properties of subchondral bone change in a time-dependent manner as the disease progresses in the rat MMT model of OA.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81272036 and No. 81301590)</u> and Sectors Fund Project of the Ministry of Health of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 201302007)</u>.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/08 17:02:20", "endTime": "2024/10/08 17:03:13", "cost": 53.341}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:32", "update_time": "2024-10-08 01:03:13", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 01:02:19"}

A CAC prevalence of 50% among people aged 40-49 years and 80% in those aged 60-69 years has been documented.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Vascular calcification, especially CAC, is associated with cardiovascular events. CAC is often located at the site of atherosclerotic lesions and can also occur at the early stage of atherosclerosis. CAC is closely related to coronary atherosclerosis, so it contributes to the diagnosis of coronary heart disease. The more severe the CAC, the greater is the probability of severe coronary stenosis, which increases the difficulty and management of coronary artery stenosis. The high mortality in patients with chronic renal disease (CRD) is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the cause of death of >50% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), whereas coronary artery disease accounts for half of all CVD-associated deaths.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> CAC is very common in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), and CAC severity correlates with the deterioration of renal function.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Understanding the relationship between CRF and CAC may help the management of coronary heart disease in patients with CRF. Furthermore, targeted treatment that can slow down CAC progression has been a research focus in recent years.\nFor many years, vascular calcification was considered to be a passive, degenerative, and end-stage process of atherosclerosis and inflammation. However, recent studies have shown that CAC is an organized, regulated, proactive process.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> CAC involves expression of an altered phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and expression of bone-related proteins such as osteopontin, osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Hence, CAC is thought to be a controlled metabolic process that is very similar to the formation of new bone, with hydroxyapatite as the main component of its calcium salts instead of calcium phosphate.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u>\nRecent studies on calcification formation have, in general, involved three aspects. The first aspect is osteoblast differentiation (i.e. transformation of the VSMC phenotype). The Msh homeobox 2 gene and Wnt signaling pathway can be activated if a change occurs in the surrounding environment (pro-inflammatory cytokines, high levels of calcium/phosphate). This activates the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osterix, which are the key transcription factors that induce osteoblast differentiation.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>\nThe second aspect is expression of bone-associated proteins. Runx2 regulates the expression of bone-related proteins such as osteocalcin, osteopontin, as well as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Osterix is located downstream of Runx2, and its main role is to increase the expression of osteopontin and ALP.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Thus, VSMCs undergo phenotypic transformation and downregulation of expression of the contractile proteins smooth muscle (SM) 22 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Hence, they change from a contracted phenotype to a synthetic phenotype of the dedifferentiation state and differentiate into osteoblasts, thereby causing vascular calcification.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> ALP is a key enzyme in vascular calcification, and oxidative stress can stimulate an increase in ALP activity in VSMCs. ALP can hydrolyze phosphate bonds, resulting in an increase in the local concentration of phosphate, which provides a good microenvironment for calcification. Osteocalcin is a marker of the late differentiation of osteoblasts. Osteocalcin and hydroxyapatite have a high degree of affinity and can cause hydroxyapatite deposition, which leads to vascular calcification.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> In addition, other related proteins, cytokines, and other interactions are involved in the regulation of vascular calcification.\nThe third aspect is mineralization. The synthesis of bone-related proteins by VSMCs is accompanied by the release of matrix vesicles and apoptotic bodies, and some studies have shown that apoptosis and vesicle formation are the initial events of vascular calcification.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Vesicles have active ALP and contain large amounts of calcium and phosphorus; deposition of the latter two chemicals can result in the formation of apatite crystals and the release of calcium and phosphorus into the extracellular environment. Calcified nodules can be formed under the action of extracellular matrix proteins and cytokines, which eventually leads to vascular calcification.\nCRF refers to a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) caused by CRD and its related metabolic disorders and symptoms. In CRF, metabolic acidosis and electrolyte imbalance (e.g. hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia) are common. The latter can cause hyperthyroidism and a decline in autocrine secretion (e.g. a decrease in serum levels of erythropoietin and active Vitamin D) followed by an increase in levels of uremic toxins.\nCAC is also affected by sex, age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and high levels of cholesterol. CAC prevalence tends to increase exponentially with an increase in risk factors. CVD is a major cause of death in patients with CRF. An eGFR reduction equivalent to Stage-2 CRD can stimulate early vascular calcification.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> Kestenbaum et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> found that CAC is common in people with Stage-3 CRD, progresses rapidly, and may contribute to cardiovascular risk. Wajeh et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> compared the prevalence of CAC between a group with early (Stages 1 and 2) CRD (29 patients) and a group with advanced (Stages 4 and 5) CRD (26 patients). They found that CAC was present in 38% and 73% of patients in early CRD and advanced CRD groups, respectively. Some investigators have reported an eGFR <60 ml/min (Stage 3–5 CRD) to be associated with an eightfold increased odds ratio for a CAC score >400 versus a CAC score ≤10 compared with no CRD after adjustment for all covariates.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Górriz et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> followed up 742 patients with non-maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) CRD Stages 3–5 for 3 years and showed a correlation between reduction in basal eGFR and increase in CAC.\nCAC starts early in the course of CRD and progresses further with the deterioration of renal function. However, some studies on MHD patients have investigated CAC. Chen et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> reported that 60.83% of patients on MHD had significant abdominal aortic calcification. Studies conducted in Germany showed calcification of the carotid artery to be present in 61.4% of MHD patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> Peritoneal dialysis can help patients to remove most of the metabolites retained in their body, slows down the decline of residual renal function, maintains hemodynamic stability, and prolongs survival, but ≤80% of patients have the complications of vascular calcification 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nRecent studies have shown that arterial calcification and atherosclerosis are chronic inflammatory diseases. 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Among the risk factors that can stimulate vascular endothelial dysfunction, denaturation of macrophages and endothelial surfaces, followed by the deposition of low-density lipoprotein, initiates the inflammatory response. This leads to increased expression of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, C-reactive protein (CRP), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), IL-1, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. This stimulates endothelial cells to release BMPs, thus activating the BMP/Smad pathway and promoting the differentiation of VSMCs and stromal cells into osteoblasts. IL-1 and IL-6 are the important pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vitro studies have shown that IL-1 and TNF-α enhance the expression of Wnt signaling and BMP2 in osteoblasts.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> IL-1 can also stimulate ALP activity and mineralization by inducing a mechanism that is independent of Runx2 in VSMCs.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> IL-6 can promote TNF-α expression and increase Runx2 expression associated with sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 1 (PiT1) and aid calcium deposition in mice.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> Persistent activation of the inflammatory response leads to activation of inflammation-related signaling pathways, macrophages, and T-lymphocytes, thereby leading to the osteoblast-like differentiation of VSMCs.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Studies have shown that levels of pro-inflammatory factors in the peripheral blood such as CRP and TNF-α are increased significantly in CAC patients. Related studies have confirmed a correlation between levels of IL-22, IL-37, and CAC.通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u>\nIn CRF, the eGFR is decreased which leads to gradual emergence of disorders of the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus. Hyperphosphatemia can cause vascular injury directly, thereby inducing endothelial cells to release cytokines. Phosphorus is mediated mainly in SMCs by PiT1, which causes VSMCs to lose expression of the SM contractile proteins α-SMA and SM22 and instead express the bone markers Runx2, osteocalcin, and ALP, thereby causing vascular calcification.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> High levels of phosphorus can also induce VSMCs to secrete BMP2, which further stimulates the activation of related transcription factors. This action can also induce the apoptosis of VSMCs, and apoptotic bodies result in calcification. In ESRD, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, calcium, and uremic environments can increase PiT1 expression in VSMCs, thereby increasing phosphorus deposition and promoting vascular calcification.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>\nCalcium and phosphate promote vascular calcification in synergy, but it is believed that the behavior of calcium is mediated mainly by the induction of apoptosis. The latter promotes the release of membrane-bound vesicles and further deposition of calcium and phosphate with apoptotic VSMC lesion.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> High levels of phosphorus can stimulate the differentiation of VSMCs into osteoblasts, but they may also promote mineralization.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> In patients with CRF and ESRD, an increase in serum levels of phosphorus is often linked to the appearance of secondary metabolic disorders such as Vitamin D disorders and hyperparathyroidism. Studies have shown that even low levels of calcium or normal levels of phosphorus and even with normal renal function, high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) can lead to vascular calcification. PTH can affect the expression of pro-inflammatory factors and has a negative role in the regulation of vascular remodeling.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Talmor-Barkan et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> found that PTH can activate protein kinase C/K pathways and induce expression of nitric oxide, advanced glycation end products, and IL-6. High secretion of PTH disrupts the balance between osteoclasts and osteoblasts, allowing large amounts of phosphorus to be released into the blood. This results in a reduction in the amount of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D) produced, thereby reducing the level of Vitamin D in plasma.\nSeveral studies have shown that Vitamin D can regulate serum levels of calcium and phosphorus and improve the cardiovascular function and survival of patients with CRD. Active Vitamin D inhibits the phagocytosis of cholesterol by macrophages and reduces foam cell formation, leading to a decrease in macrophage activity, which reduces the risk of arterial calcification and atherosclerosis. Vitamin D can regulate renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity and control the flow of calcium ions in VSMCs simultaneously.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Vitamin D also inhibits BMP expression and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby reducing calcium deposition in the blood vessels.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> If levels of active Vitamin D are low, the regulatory functions mentioned above decrease. This leads to increased macrophage activity, resulting in strong phagocytosis, increased formation of foam cells, and RAS activity. Hence, calcium ions are deposited within SMCs to promote arteriosclerosis and calcification.\nFibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a hormone-like FGF secreted by bones. If serum levels of FGF23 increase in patients with CRD, FGF23 can inhibit phosphorus reabsorption in PiT1 (which is expressed in proximal tubules) to induce phosphorylation and inhibition of 1,25(OH)2D synthesis, thereby increasing PTH secretion.通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> In the meantime, high serum levels of FGF23 can lead to vascular endothelial dysfunction.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> However, to maintain a normal phosphorus level in the body, FGF23 must combine with the membrane protein klotho. The FGF23–klotho system is indispensable as an endocrine axis that maintains phosphate balance.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> The klotho gene encodes a single-channel transmembrane protein that is expressed predominantly in the kidneys, whereas vascular VSMCs also provide functional expression of klotho.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> In fact, klotho can be found in the blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, klotho is present in two forms: membrane and secreted. The former is an exclusive co-receptor of FGF23, whereas secreted klotho is independent of the FGF23 humoral factor. An absence of klotho affects different tissues in different ways.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> In the mechanism of CAC, first, secreted klotho inhibits the activity of PiT1 and PiT-1 mRNA, thereby inhibiting calcification and maintaining VMSC differentiation.通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> Second, klotho can inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway to reduce osteoblast differentiation and VSMC calcification; klotho can also reduce phosphorus absorption by inhibiting PiTs in renal proximal tubules.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> With the decline of renal function, the eGFR and klotho expression decreases, leading to a big loss of a very important factor that inhibits vascular calcification. Along with increased expression of FGF23, the PTH level increases, causing decreased activity of Vitamin D. Taken together, these factors promote VSMC differentiation and coronary calcification.\nFetuin-A is a glycoprotein of fetal globulin released into the blood after being secreted from the liver. It is present in the extracellular fluid and accounts for 50% inhibition of the deposition of calcium and phosphorus.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> Fetuin-A in serum is absorbed by VSMCs and is concentrated in intracellular vesicles. Fetuin-A forms a soluble mineral complex with calcium and phosphorus, thereby inhibiting the formation and precipitation of apatite precursors, and therefore, inhibiting calcification. Subsequently, fetuin-A is secreted by apoptotic and surviving VSMC vesicles.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> Extracellular fetuin-A can inhibit apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> In addition, fetuin-A enhances the phagocytosis of vesicles through VSMCs. Furthermore, it can inhibit the activation of inflammatory cells, reduce the release of inflammatory factors, and reduce the effects of inflammation on vascular endothelial injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45]</u> However, Xinling et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> found that the fetuin-A level in patients with ESRD undergoing MHD was significantly lower than that in patients with Stage-2/3 CRD and that the fetuin-A level was negatively correlated with the calcification score in patients undergoing MHD. In addition, CRD patients are often in a state of malnutrition, micro-inflammation, or inflammation, and in such cases, downregulation of expression of proteins such as fetuin-A is possible.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> Price et al. treated rats with high doses of Vitamin D for several hours to ensure that their serum level of calcium reached 10 mmol/L and returned it to normal concentrations within 1 day. They observed that the serum level of fetuin-A fell to half of its initial concentration. When the calcification burden increases to a certain extent in long-term CRD, a compensatory system, such as fetuin-A release, may eventually be depleted.通用删除6(英):<u>[47,48]</u> If this hypothesis of an initial overproduction of fetuin-A and late CRF is correct, then future studies should try to identify factors that affect the expression and secretion of fetuin-A 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.\nOPG is a soluble secretory glycoprotein, a member of the TNF receptor family, and is distributed widely in the liver, heart, lungs, kidneys, and bones. It is also present in the endothelial cells and SMCs and operates through autocrine and paracrine ways.通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> During CAC formation, several inflammatory factors and cytokines can upregulate the expression and release of OPG in VSMCs and endothelial cells. OPG can prevent the vascular damage caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines by improving the viability of endothelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>\nRANKL is a cytokine synthesized by osteoblasts and bone-marrow stromal cells that promote bone differentiation. It binds to RANK in the membranes of endothelial cells and mediates BMP2 release by vascular endothelial cells, leading to vascular calcification.通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> OPG and RANKL combine with RANK competitively, inhibit the RANKL/RANK system, and inhibit vascular calcification. Simultaneously, OPG also inhibits osteoclast differentiation, reduces the bone resorption activity of mature osteoclasts, and induces apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u> Experimental and clinical data suggest that renal expression of OPG mRNA is associated with a degree of renal impairment and that the increase in OPG level observed in vivo may be compensatory and protective but does not prevent injury completely; OPG may slow the progress of tissue damage.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> Numerous studies have shown that serum concentrations of OPG and the CAC score are positively correlated. Studies have shown that OPG is associated with the number of coronary artery lesions and to be correlated with the number of coronary plaques.\nStudies have shown that, compared with age- and sex-matched healthy populations, the risk of death in MHD patients is increased by 10–20-fold.通用删除6(英):<u>[40,54]</u> MHD is the preferred treatment for patients with ESRD, but the degree of CAC in MHD patients is 2–5-fold higher than that of patients with angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease.通用删除6(英):<u>[41,55]</u> In one study, 79% of CRD patients had vascular calcification before they received MHD and, afterward, the proportion was close to 100%,通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u> suggesting that, besides the factors mentioned above, other factors that affect calcification might be involved.\nUremic toxins are considered to be a new type of cardiovascular risk factor in CRD patients. Uremic toxins are divided into three categories of compounds: water-soluble small molecules, molecular, and macromolecular. MHD eliminates most uremic toxins, but it cannot remove toxins bound to macromolecular proteins.\nIndoxyl sulfate is a class of albumin-bound uremic toxin that cannot be cleared by MHD. Tryptophan contained in food undergoes transformation within intestinal flora and oxidation in the liver to form indole sulfuric acid and is then cleared by the kidneys. Indoxyl sulfate can induce leukocyte adhesion in vascular endothelial cells and enhance TNF-α activity and vascular inflammation, leading to vascular calcification.通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u> Indoxyl sulfate can upregulate NADHP oxidase and stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species. Indoxyl sulfate induces the expression of osteocyte-specific proteins in SMCs, thereby accelerating CAC.通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u> Indoxyl sulfate enhances phosphorus absorption by SMCs by stimulating the expression of PiT1 and its mRNA.通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> At the cellular level, animal experiments have demonstrated that indoxyl sulfate can promote methylation of the klotho gene by upregulating expression of DNA methyltransferase and then downregulation of klotho expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u> In CRD, other toxins may also be involved in CVD pathogenesis, but their biologic effects have not been shown.\nVascular calcification in patients with CRF is an active cell-mediated process involving VSMC apoptosis and vesicle release, inhibitors of calcification, and control of this balance by promoters. Vascular calcification is the most serious complication in CRD patients. The only treatment for vascular calcification is prevention. More in-depth understanding of the various factors leading to CRD is needed.\n删除3：<u>This study was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81573732)</u>.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:32:18", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:33:22", "cost": 63.719}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:32", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:33:21", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:32:17"}

The methods of treatment for esophageal submucosal lesions include surgical enucleation, endoscopic submucosal dissection, endoscopic enucleation, and submucosal tunneling with endoscopic removal (STER). Courses of treatment for esophageal leiomyomas are related to a variety of factors, including tumor size, location, morphology, and the patient’s symptoms.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The size and location of the tumor are the key factors in the selection of excision methods.

STER was another effective and safe endoscopic resection techniques for submucosal tunneling which are located in the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. Adequate length in the incision and the lesion is a requirement for the establishment of a tunnel. Hence, STER technique was limited to be used in lesions which located in the upper of the esophagus. The main features of this case included locating in the upper esophagus, the outward growth from the lumen and originating in the muscularis propria of the esophagus.

The results will help neurophysiologists determine the appropriate position of the patient’s elbow during SSNCS.\nThis cross-sectional study included 59 CubTS patients (35 men, 24 women) in CubTS group, mean age 51.1 ± 13.5 years (range: 18–83 years), all of whom recruited from outpatients of the Peking University First Hospital between September, 2011 and December, 2014. There were seventy (27 right and 43 left) elbows included, among them 11 patients had bilateral lesions (eight men, three women). Approval from the hospital Institutional Review Board was obtained prior to the study.

The mean age of patients in the healthy group was compared to that in the CubTS group, no statistically significant difference was found (P = 0.69). All volunteers were normal in routine NCS.\nNeurophysiological tests were performed with a keypoint electromyography machine (Keypoint, Bendimed, Denmark). The sensitivity setting of 2–10 mv/division, sweep speed of 2 millisecond/division, filter setting of 2 Hz to 10 KHz, and a 0.1-millisecond2 wave pulse were maintained throughout all measurements. Seven markers were taken as following: drawing a line from the medial epicondyle of the humerus to the apex of olecranon, marking the midpoint of this line, from this midpoint six stimulation markers were placed, respectively, along the course of the ulnar nerve at 2 cm intervals. The seven markers were listed as following: 6 cm below the midpoint (BE6), 4 cm below the midpoint (BE4), 2 cm below the midpoint (BE2), the midpoint (E), 2 cm above the midpoint (AE2), 4 cm above the midpoint (AE4), and 6 cm above the midpoint (AE6). The ulnar nerve was stimulated with the cathode at each marker. The recording electrode was placed over the belly of the abductor digiti minimi, and the reference electrode was placed over its distal tendon. Subjects were in a warm, shielded, and quiet room and asked to lie in a supine position and relax during testing. The room temperature was maintained at 22–25°C, and extremity skin temperature was measured at 32°C or above.\nBefore tests were performed, we ensured that supramaximal stimulation was achieved and adequate pressure was applied to the stimulating electrodes to enable focal stimulation without the spread. Latencies were measured from stimulus to onset of compound muscle action potential (CMAP), and the amplitude measurements were calculated from baseline to negative peak. The latency and CMAP of each segment were recorded.\nAll subjects were first tested with the upper limbs abducted to 70° from horizontal by a goniometer fixed at 70°, with the forearm supinated and the wrist in neutral position, then the seven markers were drawn and stimulated. The elbow was then adjusted to full extension, 0° from horizontal. After repositioning, the seven markers were drawn again and stimulated. SSNCS was performed with the elbow in both positions (full extension and 70° flexion) and data were recorded.\nPractice parameters for electrophysiological diagnostic criteria of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow:通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the nerve conduction time of each segment was mean + 2 standard deviations (SDs) longer than the same segment in the healthy group; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> conduction block was found in proximal segment compared with the successive distal segment that CMAP was reduced by 20% or more and duration was increased by 10% or less.\nThe statistical package SPSS 14.0 was used to analyze data (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Data of the healthy group that was distributed in a normal fashion was expressed as the mean ± SD, and independent samples t-test was used for comparison of latency of each segment of the right and left arms at 70° elbow flexion by SSNCS, and latency of each segment of the right and left arms at elbow full extension by SSNCS. Mean + 2 SD was used to define the upper limit of each segment. Then, latency of each segment in CubTS group was compared with the upper limit, and abnormal latency was judged according to it.\nLatency and CMAP of the CubTS group that was in abnormal distribution were expressed as median and quartiles. Paired nonparametric test analysis was used for comparison of latency of each segment by SSNCS at 70° elbow flexion and elbow full extension, and CMAP of each segment by SSNCS at 70° elbow flexion and elbow full extension. Bivariate correlation and Bland–Altman were used to test the consistency of latency of each pair segment by SSNCS at 70° elbow flexion and elbow full extension, and CMAP of each segment by SSNCS at 70° elbow flexion and elbow full extension. The Chi-squared test was used to test the significance of abnormality of each pair segment at 70° elbow flexion and elbow full extension. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThirty healthy volunteers and sixty arms in total were performed SSNCS. The latency and CMAP of each stimulation of the bilateral ulnar nerve were recorded with the elbow at 70° elbow flexion and elbow full extension. Latencies of the left arms were compared with the right arms at 70° elbow flexion and full extension, respectively. No statistically significant differences was found between the right and left arms both at 70° elbow flexion and elbow full extension. Hence, we used these sixty ulnar nerves as control samples, and mean + 2 SD was used to define the upper limit latency of each segment at 70° elbow flexion and elbow full extension positions, respectively 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.

These two segments were also the most vulnerable locations of CubTS, which were very important in diagnosis of CubTS. Bland-Altman analysis revealed the consistency of elbow position at full extension and at 70° flexion, but the utmost difference of latency and CMAP of two methods could be 0.5 ms and 20 mv, respectively, which could not be accepted in clinical use.

There was also no significant difference in abnormalities detected by SSNCS while the elbow was at full extension compared with 70° flexion. In addition, the result of latency and CMAP of each segment with elbow at full extension were correlated with that at 70° flexion by SSNCS. Maintaining the patient’s elbow at full extension or 70° flexion during SSNCS made no difference in diagnosis of CubTS.\nSSNCS are now widely used for diagnosis and prognosis of CubTS, and our previous studies have proved its sensitivity and accuracy.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,5]</u> However, technical problems reduced the credibility of SSNCS, some reports said flexed elbow would add technique error in NCS while others vice versa. Kim et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> reported that false positives in SSNCS were mainly caused by ulnar nerve displacement due to elbow flexion. Ulnar nerve conduction velocity across the elbow (BE2-AE2) was reported overestimated by approximately 5.33 ± 2.29 m/s in the ulnar nerve displacement group.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The cause of this inaccuracy was that the elbow flexion position could potentially lead to nerve dislocation. Koo et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> reported that elbow flexed at 135° or 90° might not be optimal because of the possibility of a hypermobile ulnar nerve at the elbow. Furthermore, this had been recently reemphasized by high-resolution ultrasonography.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,6]</u> Flexion also can cause increasing strain of the ulnar nerve, making the length of the nerve inaccurate.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> On the other hand, the ulnar nerve is slack when the elbow is fully extended and may cause an inaccurate length of the ulnar nerve by surface measurement.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> At this position, the length will be measured less than the truth, causing an artificially slow conduction velocity, misleading the diagnosis of CubTS. Checkles et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> reported that compared with the forearm segment, the velocity of the segment across the elbow was 1.5% faster when the elbow was flexed, and 20% slower when the elbow was extended, the variation of the across-elbow velocity with the elbow fully extended was much greater than that with the elbow flexed. To solve this paradoxical problem, two studies had investigated the influence of elbow position in sensitivity of CubTS diagnosis by NCS but drew different conclusions. Bielawski and Hallett通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> found no significant difference in diagnosis CubTS between flexion and extension position of the elbow by NCS. In contrast, Kothari and Preston通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> found that elbow flexion was more sensitive than the full extension in diagnosis of CubTS, but in this experiment, they only used NCS as a criteria to diagnose CubTS.\nIn the present study, we found no statistically significant difference in latency and CMAP between full elbow extension and 70° elbow flexion as measured by SSNCS. There was also no statistically significant difference in abnormality and diagnosis of CubTS between full elbow extension and 70° elbow flexion as measured by SSNCS. This result was consistent with Bielawski and Hallett’s findings in routine NCS.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Although mild elbow flexion accorded with the true length of the ulnar nerve better, this discrepancy was slight and might not be detected by neural electrophysiological tests such as SSNCS. Campbell通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> dissected 29 cadaver elbows and found that the ulnar nerve migrates distally a maximum of 1.4 cm at the most extreme flexion. In mild-moderate flexion, length divergence may be even less and would be therefore harder to discover through neural electrophysiological tests. Otherwise, the ulnar nerve is sometimes hypermobile and may cause dislocation when the elbow is flexed and decrease the sensitivity of routine NCS and SSNCS. Jacobson and Jebson通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> reported displacement of the ulnar nerve at the postcondylar groove when the elbow was flexed. Kim et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> found that ulnar nerve displacement occurred in 24.3% of 78 elbows, approximately 20.5% of these were subluxation, and 3.8% were dislocation.\nIn addition, we noticed that elbow flexion could potentially cause distance measurement error. Elbow flexion increased the difficulty for SSNCS investigators to fix the angle of the elbow and keep all the subjects in the same position. In addition, the 2 cm intervals had to be remarked in the flexion position, which added the difficulty of measurement. Having the patient’s elbow flexed in 70° accurately was not convenient for clinical use. During SSNCS, distances were shorter than routine NCS, which was tested in 10 cm intervals and potentially had the greater influence of distance measurement error.\nIn our study, maintaining the patient’s elbow in full extension or 70° flexion made no statistically significant difference in diagnosis of CubTS, and results were highly correlated across the elbow where most CubTS occurred. Having the patient’s elbow at 70° flexion may increase measurement error and inconvenience for SSNCS investigators, so we suggest that maintain the patient’s elbow in full extension during SSNCS testing can also be used in diagnosing CubTS.\nIn addition, as showed in the scatter diagrams, data from segments that were more than 4 cm distal to the medial epicondyle of humerus were dispersed 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1 and Figure 2]</u> indicating that data of segments that were more than 4 cm distal to the medial epicondyle of humerus were not stable and might be not reliable. This supports the American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine’s recommendation that stimulation at positions more than 3 cm distal to the medial epicondyle of humerus should be avoided as the nerve is usually deep within the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle by this point, and there is substantial risk of submaximal stimulation.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> We suggest that results from 4 cm below the medial epicondyle of humerus should be used cautiously to diagnose CubTS.\nIn conclusion, there was no statistically significant difference in diagnosis of CubTS by SSNCS with the patient’s elbow in full extension compared with the elbow in 70° flexion. Hence, we suggest positioning the elbow in full extension during SSNCS can also be used. In addition, results measured 4 cm distal to the midpoint of the line between the medial epicondyle of humerus and the apex of olecranon should be cautiously used to diagnose CubTS.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:27:21", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:28:01", "cost": 39.184}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:32", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:28:00", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:27:20"}

Although there is an up-regulation of the protective procoagulation after trauma, nearly one-third of patients have presented TIC, which is an important preventable factor for progressive brain injury and uncontrollable massive bleeding, and closely related to the prognosis of trauma patients.删除4：<u>3,4,5,6</u> In the present article, we reviewed transitions in the concept of TIC and mechanical progress.\nTIC is a clinical syndrome featuring coagulopathy occurring in the early stage of trauma that is caused by activation of coagulation, fibrinolytic, and anti-coagulation pathways due to various factors, such as tissue injury and bleeding. In 1954, Scott et al7 initially reported coagulopathy in trauma patients who were wounded during the Korean and Vietnam wars. The study suggested that loss of coagulation factors and platelets was the basis for coagulopathy, while considerable fluid infusion and blood transfusion induced hemodilution and further aggravated the coagulopathy. In 1982, the American Trauma Society8 proposed the \"bloody vicious cycle,\" which includes acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy, as an important cause of death in patients with coagulopathy in the early stage of trauma. This term was gradually replaced by other terms, such as \"lethal triad\" and \"iatrogenic trauma coagulopathy,\" and is also the theoretical basis for damage control resuscitation. A large number of studies have confirmed that TIC is not merely the result of systemic acquired coagulopathy (SAC) caused by acidosis and hypothermia following traumatic shock or hemodilution following resuscitation, because early coagulopathy is caused by trauma alone within 30 min after trauma before fluid resuscitation is initiated.删除4：<u>9,10,11,12,13,14,15</u> The current opinion is that coagulopathy in the early stage of trauma is an endogenous acute coagulopathy (EAC) existing independently, and is essentially different from coagulation disorders caused by acquired factors. With progression, SAC may aggravate coagulation disorders and take part in the mechanism underlying TIC together with that of SAC.删除4：<u>16</u> In 2006, international experts launched the \"educational initiative on critical bleeding in trauma (EICBT),\" which suggested that TIC is a new disease entity, and proposed concepts, such as \"coagulopathy of trauma\" and \"acute coagulopathy of trauma shock.\" Unfortunately, our understanding of post-traumatic TIC is still inadequate, and there is still a lack of international standards in the definition and diagnostic criteria for TIC.\nFor a long time, it has been controversial whether or not TIC in patients with severe trauma is equal to the hyperfibrinolysis predominance type of DIC.删除4：<u>17</u> In the 1980s, it was reported that the coagulation indicators had reached the diagnostic criteria of DIC in some early-stage trauma patients who presented with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), low fibrinogen and anti-thrombin levels, and increased fibrinogen degradation products and D-dimer levels.删除4：<u>10</u> These changes often indicate uncontrolled thrombin formation and hyperfibrinolysis. In contrast, Brohi et al18,19 considered that the above-described abnormalities of coagulation indicators are more closely related to trauma and hypoperfusion, and suggested that the severity of acute coagulopathy of trauma shock (ACoTS)-induced hypoperfusion determines coagulation abnormalities. They considered that local endothelial damage in the early stage of trauma causes activation of coagulation factors X, II, V, and VIII to produce thrombin. Since the clearance of thrombin slows in a state of shock, and it combines with thrombomodulin and neighboring endothelial cells, and thereby further activates activated protein C, thus resulting in inactivation of activated factors V and VIII and plasminogen inhibitor-1 to further decrease thrombin production and enhance anti-coagulation and fibrinolysis. Although changes in coagulation parameters may be similar, this process is quite different from that of classical DIC induced by other diseases, such as sepsis. In addition, there is no evidence of thrombus formation in the microcirculation of trauma patients with excessive bleeding,18 and no consumption of clotting substances, such as platelets in some patients with coagulopathies. Therefore, it is believed that ACoTS should be regarded as a coagulation disorder quite different from DIC.删除4：<u>19,20</u> In 2014, Wada et al21 proposed DIC classification criteria based on the degree of hyperfibrinolysis, which explained the features of fibrinolysis-dominant DIC in the early stage of trauma using the coagulation mechanism, and provided a theoretical basis for early clotting factor replacement and administration of anti-fibrinolytic medications. At the same time, the CRASH-II study22 not only proved that early anti-fibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid might improve prognosis, but also confirmed the existence of the hyperfibrinolysis-predominant type of DIC in the early stage of trauma.\nTIC is a complicated pathophysiologic state, the exact mechanism of which has not been fully elucidated.删除4：<u>23</u> TIC is generally considered to be related to many factors, including tissue injury, shock and secondary acidosis, hypothermia, and the bloody vicious cycle caused by acquired factors, such as hemodilution, inflammation, and endothelial damage.删除4：<u>24</u> As the recognition of the cell-based coagulation model,25 more and more studies have focused attention on the cellular activation mechanisms underlying TIC. Herein we reviewed the effects of endothelial damage on TIC and several new molecular mechanisms leading to endothelial injury during trauma.\nEndothelial cells are monolayer cells covering the surface of arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. The total weight of endothelial cells is approximately 1.5 kg and the total area may be 4000-7000 square meters.删除4：<u>26,27</u> The endothelial glycocalyx (EG), which is located on the surface of endothelial cells, is a 0.2-1 μm layer rich in negatively charged anti-adhesion and anticoagulant carbohydrates. Both substances form the \"vascular portal\" to take part in important physiologic functions, such as the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis, and blood-tissue exchange. When tissues are injured, activation of the endothelial cells induces up-regulation of coagulation, which results in local hemostasis; while inflammation secondary to traumatic stress and shock will magnify the pro-coagulant activation of endothelium, resulting in systemic thrombin generation and endogenous consumptions of amounts of coagulation factors and platelets. Currently, it is considered that the microvascular thrombosis after trauma maybe dissolved quickly by enhanced fibrinolysis because of no clot found in TIC patients.删除4：<u>1</u>\nRecent studies shows that EG is destroyed or degraded to release some components such as chondroitin sulfate and heparin sulfate into the blood in severe trauma patients, which results in self-heparinization,28,29 and is an important mechanism for enhancing endogenous anti-coagulation during TIC. A prospective study conducted by Ostrowski et al30 showed that the plasma level of heparin-like substances was relatively high in 4 of 77 (5.2%) acute trauma patients. Second, the activated protein C pathway is one of the main initiating factors for TIC. Activation of protein C in the circulation occurs after protein C binds to the protein C receptor in endothelial cells, which inhibits coagulation by affecting factors V and VIII, and promotes fibrinolysis by affecting plasminogen inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). A prospective study conducted by Cohen et al31 showed that increased severity of injury and hypoperfusion is related to protein C level, coagulation parameters (PT and PTT), and hyperfibrinolysis. A decrease in the factor V and VIII levels was closely related to the severity of injury and the degree of hypoperfusion, which suggests that the activated protein C pathway plays an important role in TIC. Many papers have shown that the levels of coagulation factors are relatively low, while fibrinolysis is enhanced in TIC patients.删除4：<u>32,33</u> This may be related to the degradation of fibrinolysis inhibitors caused by protein C activation; however, some scholars prefer to believe that it is the result of the tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) secreted by the endothelial cells after being activated by stresses, such as injury. Chapman et al34 reported that compared to patients without fibrinolysis, trauma patients with hyperfibrinolysis had significantly high tPA levels and significantly low free PAI-1 levels, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in total PAI-1 levels, including free PAI-1 and bound PAI-1, which suggests that hyperfibrinolysis in patients with TIC may be related to the release of tPA, but not related to inhibition of PAI-1. In conclusion, endothelial injury induced coagulation imbalance and in turn to TIC by activating coagulation and then enhanced anticoagulation and fibrinolysis.\nEndothelial cells in various places may have different functions according to the requirements of surrounding tissues. In general, large arteries participate in the conduction of blood and materials, middle and small arteries are resistance vessels, and capillaries are responsible for material exchange. Therefore, it should be further determined whether or not coagulation changes in various blood vessels are the same, while the relationship between the features of coagulation changes in the microcirculation and endothelial cells should be investigated to find a more effective prevention and treatment strategy on the basis of the microcirculation and coagulopathy.\nRecent studies have shown that the DAMPs in the early stage of trauma bind to the pattern recognition receptors on endothelial cells and other immune cells, to activate the intracellular signaling pathway, initiate the innate immune system in the body, and result in inflammation and coagulation cascade. It has been reported that high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1), as an important medium of DAMPs, acts on Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4) and then activates its downstream signals, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of traumatic coagulopathy,35 and is closely related to bleeding, shock, and hypoperfusion. The level of TLR4 reflects not only the degree of severity in trauma, but also the intension of secondary innate immune response caused by hypotension or shock.删除4：<u>36</u>\nProtease activated receptors (PARs) are G protein-coupled receptors widely distributed in endothelial cells. The family of PARs includes four members (PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4). As the main thrombin receptor, PAR1 is closely related to inflammation and coagulation. Thrombin binds to the endothelial cell receptor, PAR1, to further activate platelets, while the platelet is an important activator among the cell-based coagulation model, and is the prerequisite for amplification and spread of the coagulation cascade. In addition, activated PAR1 may lead to activation of transcription factors to up-regulate the expression of tissue factor (TF) and Von-Willebrand factor (vWF),37,38 while the latter two factors are involved in the coagulation process, including the initiation of coagulation cascade and platelet aggregation, respectively. Activation of PAR1 can also make endothelial cells produce mediators related to cell adhesion and trans-endothelial cell migration, including cytokines (IL-1 and IL-8), growth factors, cell adhesion molecules (such as E-selectin and P-selectin), intercellular adhesion molecules, and vascular cell adhesion molecules. Moreover, activation of endothelial cell PAR1 may lead to up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic gene expression,39 which induces apoptosis of endothelial cells to change the secretion of coagulation and fibrinolysis factors. It is reported that thrombin and its PARs participated in the molecular mechanism of cerebral injury caused by ischemia, hemorrhage and brain trauma. It is closely associated with the degree of cerebral hemorrhage, encephaledema and cerebral angiospasm.删除4：<u>40</u> Although recent researches on the molecular pathogenesis of TIC are limited, it is reasonable to speculate that the interaction between thrombin and its endothelial receptor PAR1 could play an important role in the mechanism, and inhibition of PAR1 expression should be an effective target in the early treatment of TIC.\nNlrp3 is an intracellular Nod-like receptor that acts as a danger signal receptor, is activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) stimulation, induce the recruitment of the apoptosis speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC) to inform the inflammasome. It is a multiprotein complex and necessary for caspase-1 and IL-1β activation.删除4：<u>41,42</u> IL-1β is a key mediator, plays a synergistic role with TNF-α, amplifies inflammatory signals, and generates the \"inflammation cascade\" .删除4：<u>43,44</u> Caspase-1 is a key regulator of tissue damage-induced inflammation, not only takes part in the amplification of inflammation, but also enhances cell pyroptosis.删除4：<u>45</u> Using a mouse model of hemorrhagic shock, Jie et al46 showed that IL-1β release induced by the activation of Nlrp3 inflammasome in pulmonary endothelial cells is an important mechanism by which pulmonary inflammation is amplified into pulmonary injury. Multi-factors like oxidative stress, hypoxia and hemorrhagic shock can activate inflammasome.删除4：<u>47</u> Besides, high expression of plasma IL-1β dependent on the activation of Nlrp3 inflammasome was closely related to the pathogenesis and the severity of DIC in the early stage of trauma, which is associated with the fact that inflammatory cytokines induced further activation of endothelium and complement system and facilitated in the biological changes of fibrinolysis.删除4：<u>12,48</u>\nTIC is an endogenous coagulopathy caused by inflammation and shock after trauma. Hypothermia, acidosis, and hemodilution may aggravate TIC. Even though it is controversial whether or not TIC belongs to DIC, most scholars believe that fibrinolysis-type DIC is the characteristic manifestation of TIC in the early stage of trauma. The current review does not clarify the mechanism underlying TIC entirely; however, it points out that the endothelial cell-centered inflammation-coagulation pathway participated in coagulation, anti-coagulation, and fibrinolysis in patients with TIC. Recent studies have verified that the TLR4, PAR1, and Nlrp3 inflammasomes may serve as the major molecular mechanism underlying endothelial cell activation and subsequent TIC occurrence. More studies should be carried out to further explore the molecular mechanism underlying TIC and provide an effective strategy for the early treatment of TIC.\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2017.03.002</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "25", "content": "【0】Trauma is the third leading cause of death in the United States,1 and results in 10% of all deaths worldwide.删除4：<u>2</u> Specifically, brain injury and massive bleeding are the leading causes of death in trauma patients. Although there is an up-regulation of the protective procoagulation after trauma, nearly one-third of patients have presented TIC, which is an important preventable factor for progressive brain injury and uncontrollable massive bleeding, and closely related to the prognosis of trauma patients.删除4：<u>3,4,5,6</u> In the present article, we reviewed transitions in the concept of TIC and mechanical progress.\nTIC is a clinical syndrome featuring coagulopathy occurring in the early stage of trauma that is caused by activation of coagulation, fibrinolytic, and anti-coagulation pathways due to various factors, such as tissue injury and bleeding. In 1954, Scott et al7 initially reported coagulopathy in trauma patients who were wounded during the Korean and Vietnam wars. The study suggested that loss of coagulation factors and platelets was the basis for coagulopathy, while considerable fluid infusion and blood transfusion induced hemodilution and further aggravated the coagulopathy. In 1982, the American Trauma Society8 proposed the \"bloody vicious cycle,\" which includes acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy, as an important cause of death in patients with coagulopathy in the early stage of trauma. This term was gradually replaced by other terms, such as \"lethal triad\" and \"iatrogenic trauma coagulopathy,\" and is also the theoretical basis for damage control resuscitation. A large number of studies have confirmed that TIC is not merely the result of systemic acquired coagulopathy (SAC) caused by acidosis and hypothermia following traumatic shock or hemodilution following resuscitation, because early coagulopathy is caused by trauma alone within 30 min after trauma before fluid resuscitation is initiated.删除4：<u>9,10,11,12,13,14,15</u> The current opinion is that coagulopathy in the early stage of trauma is an endogenous acute coagulopathy (EAC) existing independently, and is essentially different from coagulation disorders caused by acquired factors. With progression, SAC may aggravate coagulation disorders and take part in the mechanism underlying TIC together with that of SAC.删除4：<u>16</u> In 2006, international experts launched the \"educational initiative on critical bleeding in trauma (EICBT),\" which suggested that TIC is a new disease entity, and proposed concepts, such as \"coagulopathy of trauma\" and \"acute coagulopathy of trauma shock.\" Unfortunately, our understanding of post-traumatic TIC is still inadequate, and there is still a lack of international standards in the definition and diagnostic criteria for TIC.\nFor a long time, it has been controversial whether or not TIC in patients with severe trauma is equal to the hyperfibrinolysis predominance type of DIC.删除4：<u>17</u> In the 1980s, it was reported that the coagulation indicators had reached the diagnostic criteria of DIC in some early-stage trauma patients who presented with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), low fibrinogen and anti-thrombin levels, and increased fibrinogen degradation products and D-dimer levels.删除4：<u>10</u> These changes often indicate uncontrolled thrombin formation and hyperfibrinolysis. In contrast, Brohi et al18,19 considered that the above-described abnormalities of coagulation indicators are more closely related to trauma and hypoperfusion, and suggested that the severity of acute coagulopathy of trauma shock (ACoTS)-induced hypoperfusion determines coagulation abnormalities. They considered that local endothelial damage in the early stage of trauma causes activation of coagulation factors X, II, V, and VIII to produce thrombin. Since the clearance of thrombin slows in a state of shock, and it combines with thrombomodulin and neighboring endothelial cells, and thereby further activates activated protein C, thus resulting in inactivation of activated factors V and VIII and plasminogen inhibitor-1 to further decrease thrombin production and enhance anti-coagulation and fibrinolysis. Although changes in coagulation parameters may be similar, this process is quite different from that of classical DIC induced by other diseases, such as sepsis. In addition, there is no evidence of thrombus formation in the microcirculation of trauma patients with excessive bleeding,18 and no consumption of clotting substances, such as platelets in some patients with coagulopathies. Therefore, it is believed that ACoTS should be regarded as a coagulation disorder quite different from DIC.删除4：<u>19,20</u> In 2014, Wada et al21 proposed DIC classification criteria based on the degree of hyperfibrinolysis, which explained the features of fibrinolysis-dominant DIC in the early stage of trauma using the coagulation mechanism, and provided a theoretical basis for early clotting factor replacement and administration of anti-fibrinolytic medications. At the same time, the CRASH-II study22 not only proved that early anti-fibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid might improve prognosis, but also confirmed the existence of the hyperfibrinolysis-predominant type of DIC in the early stage of trauma.\nTIC is a complicated pathophysiologic state, the exact mechanism of which has not been fully elucidated.删除4：<u>23</u> TIC is generally considered to be related to many factors, including tissue injury, shock and secondary acidosis, hypothermia, and the bloody vicious cycle caused by acquired factors, such as hemodilution, inflammation, and endothelial damage.删除4：<u>24</u> As the recognition of the cell-based coagulation model,25 more and more studies have focused attention on the cellular activation mechanisms underlying TIC. Herein we reviewed the effects of endothelial damage on TIC and several new molecular mechanisms leading to endothelial injury during trauma.\nEndothelial cells are monolayer cells covering the surface of arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. The total weight of endothelial cells is approximately 1.5 kg and the total area may be 4000-7000 square meters.删除4：<u>26,27</u> The endothelial glycocalyx (EG), which is located on the surface of endothelial cells, is a 0.2-1 μm layer rich in negatively charged anti-adhesion and anticoagulant carbohydrates. Both substances form the \"vascular portal\" to take part in important physiologic functions, such as the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis, and blood-tissue exchange. When tissues are injured, activation of the endothelial cells induces up-regulation of coagulation, which results in local hemostasis; while inflammation secondary to traumatic stress and shock will magnify the pro-coagulant activation of endothelium, resulting in systemic thrombin generation and endogenous consumptions of amounts of coagulation factors and platelets. Currently, it is considered that the microvascular thrombosis after trauma maybe dissolved quickly by enhanced fibrinolysis because of no clot found in TIC patients.删除4：<u>1</u>\nRecent studies shows that EG is destroyed or degraded to release some components such as chondroitin sulfate and heparin sulfate into the blood in severe trauma patients, which results in self-heparinization,28,29 and is an important mechanism for enhancing endogenous anti-coagulation during TIC. A prospective study conducted by Ostrowski et al30 showed that the plasma level of heparin-like substances was relatively high in 4 of 77 (5.2%) acute trauma patients. Second, the activated protein C pathway is one of the main initiating factors for TIC. Activation of protein C in the circulation occurs after protein C binds to the protein C receptor in endothelial cells, which inhibits coagulation by affecting factors V and VIII, and promotes fibrinolysis by affecting plasminogen inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). A prospective study conducted by Cohen et al31 showed that increased severity of injury and hypoperfusion is related to protein C level, coagulation parameters (PT and PTT), and hyperfibrinolysis. A decrease in the factor V and VIII levels was closely related to the severity of injury and the degree of hypoperfusion, which suggests that the activated protein C pathway plays an important role in TIC. Many papers have shown that the levels of coagulation factors are relatively low, while fibrinolysis is enhanced in TIC patients.删除4：<u>32,33</u> This may be related to the degradation of fibrinolysis inhibitors caused by protein C activation; however, some scholars prefer to believe that it is the result of the tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) secreted by the endothelial cells after being activated by stresses, such as injury.

In 1954, Scott et al7 initially reported coagulopathy in trauma patients who were wounded during the Korean and Vietnam wars. The study suggested that loss of coagulation factors and platelets was the basis for coagulopathy, while considerable fluid infusion and blood transfusion induced hemodilution and further aggravated the coagulopathy. In 1982, the American Trauma Society8 proposed the \"bloody vicious cycle,\" which includes acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy, as an important cause of death in patients with coagulopathy in the early stage of trauma. This term was gradually replaced by other terms, such as \"lethal triad\" and \"iatrogenic trauma coagulopathy,\" and is also the theoretical basis for damage control resuscitation. A large number of studies have confirmed that TIC is not merely the result of systemic acquired coagulopathy (SAC) caused by acidosis and hypothermia following traumatic shock or hemodilution following resuscitation, because early coagulopathy is caused by trauma alone within 30 min after trauma before fluid resuscitation is initiated.删除4：<u>9,10,11,12,13,14,15</u> The current opinion is that coagulopathy in the early stage of trauma is an endogenous acute coagulopathy (EAC) existing independently, and is essentially different from coagulation disorders caused by acquired factors. With progression, SAC may aggravate coagulation disorders and take part in the mechanism underlying TIC together with that of SAC.删除4：<u>16</u> In 2006, international experts launched the \"educational initiative on critical bleeding in trauma (EICBT),\" which suggested that TIC is a new disease entity, and proposed concepts, such as \"coagulopathy of trauma\" and \"acute coagulopathy of trauma shock.\" Unfortunately, our understanding of post-traumatic TIC is still inadequate, and there is still a lack of international standards in the definition and diagnostic criteria for TIC.\nFor a long time, it has been controversial whether or not TIC in patients with severe trauma is equal to the hyperfibrinolysis predominance type of DIC.删除4：<u>17</u> In the 1980s, it was reported that the coagulation indicators had reached the diagnostic criteria of DIC in some early-stage trauma patients who presented with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), low fibrinogen and anti-thrombin levels, and increased fibrinogen degradation products and D-dimer levels.删除4：<u>10</u> These changes often indicate uncontrolled thrombin formation and hyperfibrinolysis. In contrast, Brohi et al18,19 considered that the above-described abnormalities of coagulation indicators are more closely related to trauma and hypoperfusion, and suggested that the severity of acute coagulopathy of trauma shock (ACoTS)-induced hypoperfusion determines coagulation abnormalities. They considered that local endothelial damage in the early stage of trauma causes activation of coagulation factors X, II, V, and VIII to produce thrombin. Since the clearance of thrombin slows in a state of shock, and it combines with thrombomodulin and neighboring endothelial cells, and thereby further activates activated protein C, thus resulting in inactivation of activated factors V and VIII and plasminogen inhibitor-1 to further decrease thrombin production and enhance anti-coagulation and fibrinolysis. Although changes in coagulation parameters may be similar, this process is quite different from that of classical DIC induced by other diseases, such as sepsis. In addition, there is no evidence of thrombus formation in the microcirculation of trauma patients with excessive bleeding,18 and no consumption of clotting substances, such as platelets in some patients with coagulopathies. Therefore, it is believed that ACoTS should be regarded as a coagulation disorder quite different from DIC.删除4：<u>19,20</u> In 2014, Wada et al21 proposed DIC classification criteria based on the degree of hyperfibrinolysis, which explained the features of fibrinolysis-dominant DIC in the early stage of trauma using the coagulation mechanism, and provided a theoretical basis for early clotting factor replacement and administration of anti-fibrinolytic medications. At the same time, the CRASH-II study22 not only proved that early anti-fibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid might improve prognosis, but also confirmed the existence of the hyperfibrinolysis-predominant type of DIC in the early stage of trauma.\nTIC is a complicated pathophysiologic state, the exact mechanism of which has not been fully elucidated.删除4：<u>23</u> TIC is generally considered to be related to many factors, including tissue injury, shock and secondary acidosis, hypothermia, and the bloody vicious cycle caused by acquired factors, such as hemodilution, inflammation, and endothelial damage.删除4：<u>24</u> As the recognition of the cell-based coagulation model,<mark>25</mark> more and more studies have focused attention on the cellular activation mechanisms underlying TIC. Herein we reviewed the effects of endothelial damage on TIC and several new molecular mechanisms leading to endothelial injury during trauma.\nEndothelial cells are monolayer cells covering the surface of arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. The total weight of endothelial cells is approximately 1.5 kg and the total area may be 4000-7000 square meters.删除4：<u>26,27</u> The endothelial glycocalyx (EG), which is located on the surface of endothelial cells, is a 0.2-1 μm layer rich in negatively charged anti-adhesion and anticoagulant carbohydrates. Both substances form the \"vascular portal\" to take part in important physiologic functions, such as the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis, and blood-tissue exchange. When tissues are injured, activation of the endothelial cells induces up-regulation of coagulation, which results in local hemostasis; while inflammation secondary to traumatic stress and shock will magnify the pro-coagulant activation of endothelium, resulting in systemic thrombin generation and endogenous consumptions of amounts of coagulation factors and platelets. Currently, it is considered that the microvascular thrombosis after trauma maybe dissolved quickly by enhanced fibrinolysis because of no clot found in TIC patients.删除4：<u>1</u>\nRecent studies shows that EG is destroyed or degraded to release some components such as chondroitin sulfate and heparin sulfate into the blood in severe trauma patients, which results in self-heparinization,<mark>28,29 </mark>and is an important mechanism for enhancing endogenous anti-coagulation during TIC. A prospective study conducted by Ostrowski et al30 showed that the plasma level of heparin-like substances was relatively high in 4 of 77 (5.2%) acute trauma patients. Second, the activated protein C pathway is one of the main initiating factors for TIC. Activation of protein C in the circulation occurs after protein C binds to the protein C receptor in endothelial cells, which inhibits coagulation by affecting factors V and VIII, and promotes fibrinolysis by affecting plasminogen inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). A prospective study conducted by Cohen et al31 showed that increased severity of injury and hypoperfusion is related to protein C level, coagulation parameters (PT and PTT), and hyperfibrinolysis. A decrease in the factor V and VIII levels was closely related to the severity of injury and the degree of hypoperfusion, which suggests that the activated protein C pathway plays an important role in TIC. Many papers have shown that the levels of coagulation factors are relatively low, while fibrinolysis is enhanced in TIC patients.删除4：<u>32,33</u> This may be related to the degradation of fibrinolysis inhibitors caused by protein C activation; however, some scholars prefer to believe that it is the result of the tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) secreted by the endothelial cells after being activated by stresses, such as injury. Chapman et al34 reported that compared to patients without fibrinolysis, trauma patients with hyperfibrinolysis had significantly high tPA levels and significantly low free PAI-1 levels, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in total PAI-1 levels, including free PAI-1 and bound PAI-1, which suggests that hyperfibrinolysis in patients with TIC may be related to the release of tPA, but not related to inhibition of PAI-1. In conclusion, endothelial injury induced coagulation imbalance and in turn to TIC by activating coagulation and then enhanced anticoagulation and fibrinolysis.\nEndothelial cells in various places may have different functions according to the requirements of surrounding tissues. In general, large arteries participate in the conduction of blood and materials, middle and small arteries are resistance vessels, and capillaries are responsible for material exchange. Therefore, it should be further determined whether or not coagulation changes in various blood vessels are the same, while the relationship between the features of coagulation changes in the microcirculation and endothelial cells should be investigated to find a more effective prevention and treatment strategy on the basis of the microcirculation and coagulopathy.\nRecent studies have shown that the DAMPs in the early stage of trauma bind to the pattern recognition receptors on endothelial cells and other immune cells, to activate the intracellular signaling pathway, initiate the innate immune system in the body, and result in inflammation and coagulation cascade. It has been reported that high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1), as an important medium of DAMPs, acts on Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4) and then activates its downstream signals, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of traumatic coagulopathy,35 and is closely related to bleeding, shock, and hypoperfusion. The level of TLR4 reflects not only the degree of severity in trauma, but also the intension of secondary innate immune response caused by hypotension or shock.删除4：<u>36</u>\nProtease activated receptors (PARs) are G protein-coupled receptors widely distributed in endothelial cells. The family of PARs includes four members (PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4). As the main thrombin receptor, PAR1 is closely related to inflammation and coagulation. Thrombin binds to the endothelial cell receptor, PAR1, to further activate platelets, while the platelet is an important activator among the cell-based coagulation model, and is the prerequisite for amplification and spread of the coagulation cascade. In addition, activated PAR1 may lead to activation of transcription factors to up-regulate the expression of tissue factor (TF) and Von-Willebrand factor (vWF),37,38 while the latter two factors are involved in the coagulation process, including the initiation of coagulation cascade and platelet aggregation, respectively. Activation of PAR1 can also make endothelial cells produce mediators related to cell adhesion and trans-endothelial cell migration, including cytokines (IL-1 and IL-8), growth factors, cell adhesion molecules (such as E-selectin and P-selectin), intercellular adhesion molecules, and vascular cell adhesion molecules. Moreover, activation of endothelial cell PAR1 may lead to up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic gene expression,39 which induces apoptosis of endothelial cells to change the secretion of coagulation and fibrinolysis factors. It is reported that thrombin and its PARs participated in the molecular mechanism of cerebral injury caused by ischemia, hemorrhage and brain trauma. It is closely associated with the degree of cerebral hemorrhage, encephaledema and cerebral angiospasm.删除4：<u>40</u> Although recent researches on the molecular pathogenesis of TIC are limited, it is reasonable to speculate that the interaction between thrombin and its endothelial receptor PAR1 could play an important role in the mechanism, and inhibition of PAR1 expression should be an effective target in the early treatment of TIC.\nNlrp3 is an intracellular Nod-like receptor that acts as a danger signal receptor, is activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) stimulation, induce the recruitment of the apoptosis speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC) to inform the inflammasome. It is a multiprotein complex and necessary for caspase-1 and IL-1β activation.删除4：<u>41,42</u> IL-1β is a key mediator, plays a synergistic role with TNF-α, amplifies inflammatory signals, and generates the \"inflammation cascade\" .删除4：<u>43,44</u> Caspase-1 is a key regulator of tissue damage-induced inflammation, not only takes part in the amplification of inflammation, but also enhances cell pyroptosis.删除4：<u>45</u> Using a mouse model of hemorrhagic shock, Jie et al46 showed that IL-1β release induced by the activation of Nlrp3 inflammasome in pulmonary endothelial cells is an important mechanism by which pulmonary inflammation is amplified into pulmonary injury. Multi-factors like oxidative stress, hypoxia and hemorrhagic shock can activate inflammasome.删除4：<u>47</u> Besides, high expression of plasma IL-1β dependent on the activation of Nlrp3 inflammasome was closely related to the pathogenesis and the severity of DIC in the early stage of trauma, which is associated with the fact that inflammatory cytokines induced further activation of endothelium and complement system and facilitated in the biological changes of fibrinolysis.删除4：<u>12,48</u>\nTIC is an endogenous coagulopathy caused by inflammation and shock after trauma. Hypothermia, acidosis, and hemodilution may aggravate TIC.

The total weight of endothelial cells is approximately 1.5 kg and the total area may be 4000-7000 square meters.删除4：<u>26,27</u> The endothelial glycocalyx (EG), which is located on the surface of endothelial cells, is a 0.2-1 μm layer rich in negatively charged anti-adhesion and anticoagulant carbohydrates. Both substances form the \"vascular portal\" to take part in important physiologic functions, such as the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis, and blood-tissue exchange. When tissues are injured, activation of the endothelial cells induces up-regulation of coagulation, which results in local hemostasis; while inflammation secondary to traumatic stress and shock will magnify the pro-coagulant activation of endothelium, resulting in systemic thrombin generation and endogenous consumptions of amounts of coagulation factors and platelets. Currently, it is considered that the microvascular thrombosis after trauma maybe dissolved quickly by enhanced fibrinolysis because of no clot found in TIC patients.删除4：<u>1</u>\nRecent studies shows that EG is destroyed or degraded to release some components such as chondroitin sulfate and heparin sulfate into the blood in severe trauma patients, which results in self-heparinization,<mark>28,29 </mark>and is an important mechanism for enhancing endogenous anti-coagulation during TIC. A prospective study conducted by Ostrowski et al<mark>30</mark> showed that the plasma level of heparin-like substances was relatively high in 4 of 77 (5.2%) acute trauma patients. Second, the activated protein C pathway is one of the main initiating factors for TIC. Activation of protein C in the circulation occurs after protein C binds to the protein C receptor in endothelial cells, which inhibits coagulation by affecting factors V and VIII, and promotes fibrinolysis by affecting plasminogen inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). A prospective study conducted by Cohen et al31 showed that increased severity of injury and hypoperfusion is related to protein C level, coagulation parameters (PT and PTT), and hyperfibrinolysis. A decrease in the factor V and VIII levels was closely related to the severity of injury and the degree of hypoperfusion, which suggests that the activated protein C pathway plays an important role in TIC. Many papers have shown that the levels of coagulation factors are relatively low, while fibrinolysis is enhanced in TIC patients.删除4：<u>32,33</u> This may be related to the degradation of fibrinolysis inhibitors caused by protein C activation; however, some scholars prefer to believe that it is the result of the tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) secreted by the endothelial cells after being activated by stresses, such as injury. Chapman et al<mark>34 </mark>reported that compared to patients without fibrinolysis, trauma patients with hyperfibrinolysis had significantly high tPA levels and significantly low free PAI-1 levels, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in total PAI-1 levels, including free PAI-1 and bound PAI-1, which suggests that hyperfibrinolysis in patients with TIC may be related to the release of tPA, but not related to inhibition of PAI-1. In conclusion, endothelial injury induced coagulation imbalance and in turn to TIC by activating coagulation and then enhanced anticoagulation and fibrinolysis.\nEndothelial cells in various places may have different functions according to the requirements of surrounding tissues. In general, large arteries participate in the conduction of blood and materials, middle and small arteries are resistance vessels, and capillaries are responsible for material exchange. Therefore, it should be further determined whether or not coagulation changes in various blood vessels are the same, while the relationship between the features of coagulation changes in the microcirculation and endothelial cells should be investigated to find a more effective prevention and treatment strategy on the basis of the microcirculation and coagulopathy.\nRecent studies have shown that the DAMPs in the early stage of trauma bind to the pattern recognition receptors on endothelial cells and other immune cells, to activate the intracellular signaling pathway, initiate the innate immune system in the body, and result in inflammation and coagulation cascade. It has been reported that high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1), as an important medium of DAMPs, acts on Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4) and then activates its downstream signals, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of traumatic coagulopathy,35 and is closely related to bleeding, shock, and hypoperfusion. The level of TLR4 reflects not only the degree of severity in trauma, but also the intension of secondary innate immune response caused by hypotension or shock.删除4：<u>36</u>\nProtease activated receptors (PARs) are G protein-coupled receptors widely distributed in endothelial cells. The family of PARs includes four members (PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4). As the main thrombin receptor, PAR1 is closely related to inflammation and coagulation. Thrombin binds to the endothelial cell receptor, PAR1, to further activate platelets, while the platelet is an important activator among the cell-based coagulation model, and is the prerequisite for amplification and spread of the coagulation cascade. In addition, activated PAR1 may lead to activation of transcription factors to up-regulate the expression of tissue factor (TF) and Von-Willebrand factor (vWF),37,38 while the latter two factors are involved in the coagulation process, including the initiation of coagulation cascade and platelet aggregation, respectively. Activation of PAR1 can also make endothelial cells produce mediators related to cell adhesion and trans-endothelial cell migration, including cytokines (IL-1 and IL-8), growth factors, cell adhesion molecules (such as E-selectin and P-selectin), intercellular adhesion molecules, and vascular cell adhesion molecules. Moreover, activation of endothelial cell PAR1 may lead to up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic gene expression,39 which induces apoptosis of endothelial cells to change the secretion of coagulation and fibrinolysis factors. It is reported that thrombin and its PARs participated in the molecular mechanism of cerebral injury caused by ischemia, hemorrhage and brain trauma. It is closely associated with the degree of cerebral hemorrhage, encephaledema and cerebral angiospasm.删除4：<u>40</u> Although recent researches on the molecular pathogenesis of TIC are limited, it is reasonable to speculate that the interaction between thrombin and its endothelial receptor PAR1 could play an important role in the mechanism, and inhibition of PAR1 expression should be an effective target in the early treatment of TIC.\nNlrp3 is an intracellular Nod-like receptor that acts as a danger signal receptor, is activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) stimulation, induce the recruitment of the apoptosis speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC) to inform the inflammasome. It is a multiprotein complex and necessary for caspase-1 and IL-1β activation.删除4：<u>41,42</u> IL-1β is a key mediator, plays a synergistic role with TNF-α, amplifies inflammatory signals, and generates the \"inflammation cascade\" .删除4：<u>43,44</u> Caspase-1 is a key regulator of tissue damage-induced inflammation, not only takes part in the amplification of inflammation, but also enhances cell pyroptosis.删除4：<u>45</u> Using a mouse model of hemorrhagic shock, Jie et al46 showed that IL-1β release induced by the activation of Nlrp3 inflammasome in pulmonary endothelial cells is an important mechanism by which pulmonary inflammation is amplified into pulmonary injury. Multi-factors like oxidative stress, hypoxia and hemorrhagic shock can activate inflammasome.删除4：<u>47</u> Besides, high expression of plasma IL-1β dependent on the activation of Nlrp3 inflammasome was closely related to the pathogenesis and the severity of DIC in the early stage of trauma, which is associated with the fact that inflammatory cytokines induced further activation of endothelium and complement system and facilitated in the biological changes of fibrinolysis.删除4：<u>12,48</u>\nTIC is an endogenous coagulopathy caused by inflammation and shock after trauma. Hypothermia, acidosis, and hemodilution may aggravate TIC. Even though it is controversial whether or not TIC belongs to DIC, most scholars believe that fibrinolysis-type DIC is the characteristic manifestation of TIC in the early stage of trauma. The current review does not clarify the mechanism underlying TIC entirely; however, it points out that the endothelial cell-centered inflammation-coagulation pathway participated in coagulation, anti-coagulation, and fibrinolysis in patients with TIC. Recent studies have verified that the TLR4, PAR1, and Nlrp3 inflammasomes may serve as the major molecular mechanism underlying endothelial cell activation and subsequent TIC occurrence. More studies should be carried out to further explore the molecular mechanism underlying TIC and provide an effective strategy for the early treatment of TIC.\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2017.03.002</u>", "index": 10619, "show": true, "start": 10567, "end": 10569, "province": ["文本干净度", "页码/数字"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "37,38", "content": "【0】Trauma is the third leading cause of death in the United States,1 and results in 10% of all deaths worldwide.删除4：<u>2</u> Specifically, brain injury and massive bleeding are the leading causes of death in trauma patients.

In 1954, Scott et al7 initially reported coagulopathy in trauma patients who were wounded during the Korean and Vietnam wars. The study suggested that loss of coagulation factors and platelets was the basis for coagulopathy, while considerable fluid infusion and blood transfusion induced hemodilution and further aggravated the coagulopathy. In 1982, the American Trauma Society8 proposed the \"bloody vicious cycle,\" which includes acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy, as an important cause of death in patients with coagulopathy in the early stage of trauma. This term was gradually replaced by other terms, such as \"lethal triad\" and \"iatrogenic trauma coagulopathy,\" and is also the theoretical basis for damage control resuscitation. A large number of studies have confirmed that TIC is not merely the result of systemic acquired coagulopathy (SAC) caused by acidosis and hypothermia following traumatic shock or hemodilution following resuscitation, because early coagulopathy is caused by trauma alone within 30 min after trauma before fluid resuscitation is initiated.删除4：<u>9,10,11,12,13,14,15</u> The current opinion is that coagulopathy in the early stage of trauma is an endogenous acute coagulopathy (EAC) existing independently, and is essentially different from coagulation disorders caused by acquired factors.

In contrast, Brohi et al18,19 considered that the above-described abnormalities of coagulation indicators are more closely related to trauma and hypoperfusion, and suggested that the severity of acute coagulopathy of trauma shock (ACoTS)-induced hypoperfusion determines coagulation abnormalities. They considered that local endothelial damage in the early stage of trauma causes activation of coagulation factors X, II, V, and VIII to produce thrombin. Since the clearance of thrombin slows in a state of shock, and it combines with thrombomodulin and neighboring endothelial cells, and thereby further activates activated protein C, thus resulting in inactivation of activated factors V and VIII and plasminogen inhibitor-1 to further decrease thrombin production and enhance anti-coagulation and fibrinolysis. Although changes in coagulation parameters may be similar, this process is quite different from that of classical DIC induced by other diseases, such as sepsis. In addition, there is no evidence of thrombus formation in the microcirculation of trauma patients with excessive bleeding,18 and no consumption of clotting substances, such as platelets in some patients with coagulopathies.

Moreover, activation of endothelial cell PAR1 may lead to up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic gene expression,39 which induces apoptosis of endothelial cells to change the secretion of coagulation and fibrinolysis factors.

Although there is an up-regulation of the protective procoagulation after trauma, nearly one-third of patients have presented TIC, which is an important preventable factor for progressive brain injury and uncontrollable massive bleeding, and closely related to the prognosis of trauma patients.删除4：<u>3,4,5,6</u> In the present article, we reviewed transitions in the concept of TIC and mechanical progress.\nTIC is a clinical syndrome featuring coagulopathy occurring in the early stage of trauma that is caused by activation of coagulation, fibrinolytic, and anti-coagulation pathways due to various factors, such as tissue injury and bleeding. In 1954, Scott et al7 initially reported coagulopathy in trauma patients who were wounded during the Korean and Vietnam wars. The study suggested that loss of coagulation factors and platelets was the basis for coagulopathy, while considerable fluid infusion and blood transfusion induced hemodilution and further aggravated the coagulopathy. In 1982, the American Trauma Society8 proposed the \"bloody vicious cycle,\" which includes acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy, as an important cause of death in patients with coagulopathy in the early stage of trauma. This term was gradually replaced by other terms, such as \"lethal triad\" and \"iatrogenic trauma coagulopathy,\" and is also the theoretical basis for damage control resuscitation. A large number of studies have confirmed that TIC is not merely the result of systemic acquired coagulopathy (SAC) caused by acidosis and hypothermia following traumatic shock or hemodilution following resuscitation, because early coagulopathy is caused by trauma alone within 30 min after trauma before fluid resuscitation is initiated.删除4：<u>9,10,11,12,13,14,15</u> The current opinion is that coagulopathy in the early stage of trauma is an endogenous acute coagulopathy (EAC) existing independently, and is essentially different from coagulation disorders caused by acquired factors. With progression, SAC may aggravate coagulation disorders and take part in the mechanism underlying TIC together with that of SAC.删除4：<u>16</u> In 2006, international experts launched the \"educational initiative on critical bleeding in trauma (EICBT),\" which suggested that TIC is a new disease entity, and proposed concepts, such as \"coagulopathy of trauma\" and \"acute coagulopathy of trauma shock.\" Unfortunately, our understanding of post-traumatic TIC is still inadequate, and there is still a lack of international standards in the definition and diagnostic criteria for TIC.\nFor a long time, it has been controversial whether or not TIC in patients with severe trauma is equal to the hyperfibrinolysis predominance type of DIC.删除4：<u>17</u> In the 1980s, it was reported that the coagulation indicators had reached the diagnostic criteria of DIC in some early-stage trauma patients who presented with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), low fibrinogen and anti-thrombin levels, and increased fibrinogen degradation products and D-dimer levels.删除4：<u>10</u> These changes often indicate uncontrolled thrombin formation and hyperfibrinolysis. In contrast, Brohi et al18,19 considered that the above-described abnormalities of coagulation indicators are more closely related to trauma and hypoperfusion, and suggested that the severity of acute coagulopathy of trauma shock (ACoTS)-induced hypoperfusion determines coagulation abnormalities. They considered that local endothelial damage in the early stage of trauma causes activation of coagulation factors X, II, V, and VIII to produce thrombin. Since the clearance of thrombin slows in a state of shock, and it combines with thrombomodulin and neighboring endothelial cells, and thereby further activates activated protein C, thus resulting in inactivation of activated factors V and VIII and plasminogen inhibitor-1 to further decrease thrombin production and enhance anti-coagulation and fibrinolysis. Although changes in coagulation parameters may be similar, this process is quite different from that of classical DIC induced by other diseases, such as sepsis. In addition, there is no evidence of thrombus formation in the microcirculation of trauma patients with excessive bleeding,18 and no consumption of clotting substances, such as platelets in some patients with coagulopathies. Therefore, it is believed that ACoTS should be regarded as a coagulation disorder quite different from DIC.删除4：<u>19,20</u> In 2014, Wada et al21 proposed DIC classification criteria based on the degree of hyperfibrinolysis, which explained the features of fibrinolysis-dominant DIC in the early stage of trauma using the coagulation mechanism, and provided a theoretical basis for early clotting factor replacement and administration of anti-fibrinolytic medications. At the same time, the CRASH-II study22 not only proved that early anti-fibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid might improve prognosis, but also confirmed the existence of the hyperfibrinolysis-predominant type of DIC in the early stage of trauma.\nTIC is a complicated pathophysiologic state, the exact mechanism of which has not been fully elucidated.删除4：<u>23</u> TIC is generally considered to be related to many factors, including tissue injury, shock and secondary acidosis, hypothermia, and the bloody vicious cycle caused by acquired factors, such as hemodilution, inflammation, and endothelial damage.删除4：<u>24</u> As the recognition of the cell-based coagulation model,<mark>25</mark> more and more studies have focused attention on the cellular activation mechanisms underlying TIC. Herein we reviewed the effects of endothelial damage on TIC and several new molecular mechanisms leading to endothelial injury during trauma.\nEndothelial cells are monolayer cells covering the surface of arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. The total weight of endothelial cells is approximately 1.5 kg and the total area may be 4000-7000 square meters.删除4：<u>26,27</u> The endothelial glycocalyx (EG), which is located on the surface of endothelial cells, is a 0.2-1 μm layer rich in negatively charged anti-adhesion and anticoagulant carbohydrates. Both substances form the \"vascular portal\" to take part in important physiologic functions, such as the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis, and blood-tissue exchange. When tissues are injured, activation of the endothelial cells induces up-regulation of coagulation, which results in local hemostasis; while inflammation secondary to traumatic stress and shock will magnify the pro-coagulant activation of endothelium, resulting in systemic thrombin generation and endogenous consumptions of amounts of coagulation factors and platelets. Currently, it is considered that the microvascular thrombosis after trauma maybe dissolved quickly by enhanced fibrinolysis because of no clot found in TIC patients.删除4：<u>1</u>\nRecent studies shows that EG is destroyed or degraded to release some components such as chondroitin sulfate and heparin sulfate into the blood in severe trauma patients, which results in self-heparinization,<mark>28,29 </mark>and is an important mechanism for enhancing endogenous anti-coagulation during TIC. A prospective study conducted by Ostrowski et al<mark>30</mark> showed that the plasma level of heparin-like substances was relatively high in 4 of 77 (5.2%) acute trauma patients. Second, the activated protein C pathway is one of the main initiating factors for TIC. Activation of protein C in the circulation occurs after protein C binds to the protein C receptor in endothelial cells, which inhibits coagulation by affecting factors V and VIII, and promotes fibrinolysis by affecting plasminogen inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). A prospective study conducted by Cohen et al31 showed that increased severity of injury and hypoperfusion is related to protein C level, coagulation parameters (PT and PTT), and hyperfibrinolysis. A decrease in the factor V and VIII levels was closely related to the severity of injury and the degree of hypoperfusion, which suggests that the activated protein C pathway plays an important role in TIC. Many papers have shown that the levels of coagulation factors are relatively low, while fibrinolysis is enhanced in TIC patients.删除4：<u>32,33</u> This may be related to the degradation of fibrinolysis inhibitors caused by protein C activation; however, some scholars prefer to believe that it is the result of the tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) secreted by the endothelial cells after being activated by stresses, such as injury. Chapman et al<mark>34 </mark>reported that compared to patients without fibrinolysis, trauma patients with hyperfibrinolysis had significantly high tPA levels and significantly low free PAI-1 levels, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in total PAI-1 levels, including free PAI-1 and bound PAI-1, which suggests that hyperfibrinolysis in patients with TIC may be related to the release of tPA, but not related to inhibition of PAI-1. In conclusion, endothelial injury induced coagulation imbalance and in turn to TIC by activating coagulation and then enhanced anticoagulation and fibrinolysis.\nEndothelial cells in various places may have different functions according to the requirements of surrounding tissues. In general, large arteries participate in the conduction of blood and materials, middle and small arteries are resistance vessels, and capillaries are responsible for material exchange. Therefore, it should be further determined whether or not coagulation changes in various blood vessels are the same, while the relationship between the features of coagulation changes in the microcirculation and endothelial cells should be investigated to find a more effective prevention and treatment strategy on the basis of the microcirculation and coagulopathy.\nRecent studies have shown that the DAMPs in the early stage of trauma bind to the pattern recognition receptors on endothelial cells and other immune cells, to activate the intracellular signaling pathway, initiate the innate immune system in the body, and result in inflammation and coagulation cascade. It has been reported that high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1), as an important medium of DAMPs, acts on Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4) and then activates its downstream signals, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of traumatic coagulopathy,<mark>35</mark> and is closely related to bleeding, shock, and hypoperfusion. The level of TLR4 reflects not only the degree of severity in trauma, but also the intension of secondary innate immune response caused by hypotension or shock.删除4：<u>36</u>\nProtease activated receptors (PARs) are G protein-coupled receptors widely distributed in endothelial cells. The family of PARs includes four members (PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4). As the main thrombin receptor, PAR1 is closely related to inflammation and coagulation. Thrombin binds to the endothelial cell receptor, PAR1, to further activate platelets, while the platelet is an important activator among the cell-based coagulation model, and is the prerequisite for amplification and spread of the coagulation cascade. In addition, activated PAR1 may lead to activation of transcription factors to up-regulate the expression of tissue factor (TF) and Von-Willebrand factor (vWF),<mark>37,38</mark> while the latter two factors are involved in the coagulation process, including the initiation of coagulation cascade and platelet aggregation, respectively.

FLCN has a wide expression pattern in various tissues, including the skin and its appendages, the distal nephron of the kidney, stromal cells, and type 1 pneumocytes of the lung.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Although exact molecular functions of FLCN gene are unknown, it is believed to be a tumor suppressor gene which is known to be involved in several signaling pathways, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> Different types of mutation have been found along the entire FLCN gene, such as insertions, deletions, missense, splicing, and nonsense mutations.

Detailed clinical information on the affected members, including their medical history, body weight and height, smoking status, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging, and the treatment of pneumothorax was retrospectively collected.\nPeripheral blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to standard procedures. The coding regions of the FLCN gene consisting of exons 4 to 14 and flanking sequences were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.

A Mann-Whitney non-parametric test was used to compare the continuous variance between groups. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Chicago, IL, USA), a value of P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\nThe pedigree of this Chinese family with PSP includes four generations and 14 affected family members 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. Pedigree analysis revealed an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Specific symptoms of inherited diseases were not found and other related lung diseases were excluded among the members of the extended family. The clinical information and characteristics of ten affected family members for whom such information was available are listed in Table 1. Among the ten affected family members, with a total of 18 episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax, the median age for the initial onset of pneumothorax was 42.5 years (IQR: 28.8-57.2 years). There were no significant differences in repeated episodes of pneumothorax and the age at the first episode when the patients were grouped by either sex or smoking history 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table 2, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A95]</u>. As shown in Figure 2, the proband had bilateral multiple pulmonary cysts and pneumothorax on CT imaging. Patient II-3 and III-6 died of stroke and lung cancer, respectively. No clinical evidence of skin fibrofolliculoma or renal abnormalities was discovered in the family.\nDirect sequencing of the coding exons of the FLCN gene from genomic DNA of the proband led to the discovery of a novel nonsense mutation in the pedigree. The proband was heterozygous for a c.1273C>T transversion that changes a glutamic acid at codon 425 to a nonsense codon  in exon 11 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>. Another five affected family members who consented to genetic testing were positive for the FLCN c.1273C>T mutation. This novel mutation was predicted to cause pre-mature termination of the translated FLCN protein and/or to trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, leading to a loss-of-function effect. No other sequence variants were detected in the coding regions of this gene.\nThis study presented the clinical and genetic characteristics of a large Chinese family with spontaneous pneumothorax. A novel nonsense mutation c.1273C>T  of FLCN gene in exon 11 was identified, all patients who had undergone genetic testing for FLCN gene carried this mutation. According to the diagnostic criteria for BHD syndrome proposed by Menko et al,通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> the genetic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of BHD syndrome in this family in the absence of skin lesions or renal tumors.\nBHD syndrome typically exhibits clinical heterogeneity and patients do not always have the three characteristic manifestations (skin, kidney, and lung involvement). Pulmonary symptoms are often among the most common manifestations.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Similar clinical patterns were found in the present study. PSP was the early onset symptom of our patients with BHD syndrome, while no clinical evidence of skin fibrofolliculoma or renal abnormalities has yet been discovered. Such incomplete penetrance of the disease may exist especially in Asian populations. Japanese researchers suggested that recurrent episodes of pneumothorax and characteristic features of lung lesions were more informative as diagnostic criteria for BHD syndrome in the Japanese population.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u> In the Chinese population, Ren et al通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> reported that the FLCN gene mutations contribute to both familial and sporadic PSP patients, but none of the mutation carriers had skin or renal features of BHD syndrome. The present findings, along with several previous studies confirmed that for familial or sporadic PSP individuals, may harbor mutations of FLCN gene even in the absence of the renal and skin lesions typical of BHD syndrome.\nIn the affected family members, there were similar numbers of men and women, and the median age of onset of pneumothorax was 42.5 years, which was consistent with the results from two recent studies of the large families with BHD syndrome. Skolnik et al通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> reported that the mean age at diagnosis was 42 years, and Xing et al通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> suggested that the median age at initial onset was 41.5 years from another large Chinese family with BHD syndrome. Smoking history is not the risk factor for the disease, which was also indicated in this family. Recurrent pneumothorax ratio of our study was 40%, which was similar to a recurrent pneumothorax rate of 42% in the largest single-family that has been reported.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>\nOver 100 patterns of mutation in the FLCN gene have been reported in the Leiden Open Variation Database. Geographic variation in these mutations has been noted from the findings of several large cohort studies. Analysis of Caucasian data demonstrated that a cytosine deletion or duplication within a poly-C tract (c.1285dupC or delC) in exon 11 of FLCN gene was common.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> In Japan, a mutational analysis of BHD including 312 patients with BHD syndrome from 120 different families was performed, which identified 31 FLCN sequence variants. Such results led to a conclusion that BHD syndrome in Japanese was associated with three FLCN mutational hotspots. Besides the C8 tract of exon 11, the other two hotspots are c.1533_1536delGATG in exon 13 and c.1347_1353dup CCACCCT in exon 12.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> A recent genetic study of Chinese patients with BHD syndrome also identified the C8 tract in exon 11 of FLCN gene as a mutation hotspot, suggesting the consistency of this finding among different ethnic populations. Although no other significant mutation hotspots were found in this report, the results indicated that the mutation spectrum in the Chinese population is even more extensively distributed over the entire FLCN gene than that in Caucasians.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> This is exemplified by the novel nonsense mutation (c.1273C>T) discovered in the present study, which is located in exon 11 near the C8 tract mutation hotspot.\nThe majority of FLCN mutations are predicted to truncate the protein, indicating that BHD syndrome arises through a haploinsufficiency mechanism. Emerging evidence has linked FLCN gene with a number of molecular pathways and cellular processes. For example, studies of FLCN-deficient models suggested that FLCN gene may modulate AKT-mTOR signaling in a context-dependent manner.通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25]</u> Down-regulation of FLCN leads to increased cell-cell adhesion and loss of cell polarity, which may result in increased vulnerability to physical forces induced by respiration.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> Loss of function of FLCN may lead to epithelial apoptosis, alveolar enlargement and impaired pulmonary function through E-cadherin, liver kinase B1, and the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, consequently leading to pneumothorax.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> However, the exact mechanism by which the FLCN gene and involved pathways contribute to this syndrome still needs to be further understood.\nThis study has demonstrated the importance of considering BHD syndrome when patients have recurrent pneumothorax and/or positive family history. Genetic testing of the FLCN gene is the most reliable method for the clinical molecular diagnosis of BHD syndrome, especially in Asian patients who do not have skin and renal manifestations. Our results suggested that FLCN mutation screening should be conducted in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax, particularly those with a positive family history. PSP is often the earliest phenotypic manifestation in BHD syndrome, while the skin and renal symptoms are associated with advancing age.通用删除6(英):<u>[22,28]</u> It has been reported that FLCN mutation carriers have an increased risk of developing renal cell carcinoma.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> Hence, early detection of renal neoplasm in such patients is recommended.\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, affected family members in this study were mostly identified from consultations at the Department of Thoracic Surgery and respiratory clinic, so few of them underwent skin examinations or renal screening. As such, it is possible that diagnoses of skin and renal lesions were missed. Second, the genetic results from this single-family and the function of the novel mutation were only predicted here, although this co-segregating nonsense mutation might be strongly pathogenic. Therefore, more studies with larger populations of Chinese patients with BHD syndrome accompanied by detailed clinical information and further functional analysis of FLCN gene are warranted.\nIn conclusion, this study reported a large Chinese family with spontaneous pneumothorax caused by a novel nonsense mutation in exon 11 of FLCN gene, in which the diagnosis of BHD was confirmed. Our finding of the novel mutant locus in this family expands the mutation spectrum of BHD syndrome in the Chinese population.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81400045)</u>, and the Clinical Scientific Special Research Fund of Wu Jieping Medical Foundation (Nos. 320.6750.16217 and 320.6750.15052).</u>\n删除7：<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": " http://links.lww.com/CM9/A95.

Although it is not a life-threatening disease, BPH causes problems that seriously impact the quality of life (QoL).通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was previously widely accepted as the gold standard for surgical treatment of BPH;通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,4,5]</u> however, a great number of laser procedures have gradually replaced TURP in recent years. Among these new techniques, photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) with a lithium triborate (LBO) laser can effectively remove prostate tissue through vaporization. However, compared with the TURP, PVP has a longer operative time and a lower tissue clearance rate.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Moreover, the absence of postoperative pathologic specimens is another crucial challenge in PVP.\nThe disadvantages of the PVP technique could be eliminated by the use of an end-firing fiber, which would allow the laser to be conducted directly to the tip of the fiber with no deflection; this would also enable intraoperative tissue resection. Limited studies have evaluated the use of an end-firing LBO laser in BPH treatment, which is called photoselective vaporesection of the prostate (PVRP),通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u> and the surgical technique has not been standardized. In the present study, we described our initial experience using the PVRP technique for the treatment of BPH.\nThis prospective study was approved by the ethics committee of Beijing Hospital. From August 2013 to July 2014, a total of 35 BPH patients were enrolled in this study after signing informed consent. All procedures were performed by one doctor with more than 10 years of experience with TURP and 4 years of experience with thulium laser resection of the prostate. Indications for surgery were according to the European Association of Urology guidelines for nonneurogenic male LUTS.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Preoperative patient evaluation included present medical history, physical examination, International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSSs), QoL score, serum level of total prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume determined through transrectal ultrasound, maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), urinalysis, and urinary bacterial culture. Inclusion criteria were age <85 years, IPSS >8, prostate volume >50 ml, and Qmax <10 ml/s; exclusion criteria were suspected prostate cancer or detrusor dysfunction.\nA negative preoperative urine culture was mandatory for all patients, and 1.5 g of cefuroxime was administrated at the beginning of the procedure as an antibiotic prophylaxis. Patients with a positive preoperative urine culture (bacteria >105 colony-forming units/ml) received appropriate antibiotic therapy as per the urine bacterial culture results for a minimum period of 72 h before the operation. Aspirin and clopidogrel were ceased at least 7 days before surgery.\nOperative time, laser emission time, intraoperative blood loss, and intraoperative complications were recorded. Clinical data were also recorded, including postoperative duration of hospital stay, catheterization time, and perioperative complications. All patients were instructed to return for follow-up in the 1st and the 3rd month postoperatively. Clinical data were obtained at follow-up examinations to appraise the surgery efficacy and evaluate the adverse effects.\nThe aim of our technique was to investigate the advantages of an end-firing fiber vaporization plus resection. Previous studies on PVRP reported several techniques;通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u> all procedures were performed using an LBO crystal laser with a maximum power of 160 W with an end-firing laser fiber (532 nm, Realton Corp. Beijing, China); meanwhile, a 26F laser resectoscope was used to acquire good vision and enhance the resection efficiency. The key steps of the procedure of PVRP are shown in Figure 1.\nWe first divided the prostate into several regions by vaporization after distending the bladder. Two lines were marked initially; these lines originated at 5 o’clock and 7 o’clock at the bladder neck and continued along the boundaries between the median and lateral lobes before terminating at the proximal margin of the verumontanum. We then vaporized the prostate tissue along these lines until the prostate capsule emerged. These two lines were merged into one line adjacent to the verumontanum. We then vaporized the tissue at 12 o’clock from the apex of the prostate to the bladder neck by rotating the cystoscope for 180°. This technique enhanced the resection rate of tissue around the prostate roof.\nWe used vaporesection to easily remove the wedge-shaped middle lobe located between the two grooves from 5 o’clock to 7 o’clock. Once vaporesection was completed, we could clearly identify the lower margin of both lateral lobes.\nBefore removing the lateral lobes, we prepared another two similar grooves that originated from the bladder neck at 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock to the proximal end of the verumontanum. We then vaporized the tissue along these lines until the prostate capsule appeared. The tissue around the lateral gland was then removed. After this, we began to remove the remnant gland along the existing boundary of the capsule.\nWhen the majority of the tissue had been removed, protruding tissue, especially in the apex of the gland, sometimes disrupted the integrity of the cavity. To avoid intraoperative complications (i.e. capsule perforation or sphincter injury), we used vaporization rather than resection to trim the tissue near the external urethral sphincter and reduced the power below 80 W.\nAll variables were reported as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The pre- and peri-operative variables were evaluated for statistically significant differences with the analysis of variance. For appraising the efficacy of the surgery, two-sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Ten patients with a history of acute urinary retention received preoperative catheterization.\nPerioperative data are listed in Table 1. The mean laser emission time accounted for nearly 50% of the mean operative time. The blood loss in most patients was <200 ml; however, the average deviated due to some moderate bleeding cases. Almost 90% of patients had the catheter removed within 6 days postoperatively.

The IPSS storage score, IPSS voiding score, IPSS nocturia score, and the QoL score significantly decreased by 75.3%, 83.6%, 51.4%, and 71.7%, respectively (all P < 0.001). For the objective parameters, the mean prostate volume and the serum level of total prostate-specific antigen decreased to 42.6% and 36.2%, respectively. The mean Qmax increased nearly 2-fold compared to baseline and reached a maximum of 15.6 ml/s. We did not collect baseline data for the postvoid residual as the catheterization therapy used in some patients may have led to statistical bias. The mean postvoid residual during follow-up was only 11.9 ± 6.5 ml.\nTable 3 presents the peri- and post-operative complications. According to the modified Clavien-Dindo classification system,通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> only two cases were Grade 3B and all others were Grade 1 or 2. Prostate capsule perforation was identified in a single case, which did not require specific therapy. No other perioperative complications were found. Three patients experienced high febrility due to acute UTI caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli on postoperative days 5–6; all three patients received antibiotics and recovered rapidly. Five patients were diagnosed with UTI at the first follow-up due to unrelieved LUTS and urinalysis results; all recovered after effective antibiotic courses. Only a single patient experienced persistent urinary incontinence in the early postoperative period without evidence of UTI; this urinary incontinence was fully resolved after pelvic floor muscles training for several weeks. Another patient with difficulty in voiding was diagnosed with bladder neck contracture through cystoscopy; this was resolved after a bladder neck incision was performed under general anesthesia on the 40th day after PVRP.\nPeri- and post-operative complications in 35 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia who underwent photoselective vaporesection of the prostate\n删除重复语句：<u>Peri- and post-operative complications in 35 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia who underwent photoselective vaporesection of the prostate</u>\nComplications were graded according to the modified Clavien-Dindo classification system. TURP: Transurethral resection of the prostate.\nAlthough TURP is still accepted as the gold standard in BPH surgical treatment, laser surgeries have gradually become more popular due to better tolerance, less intraoperative blood loss, satisfactory efficacy, and shorter postoperative recovery.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11,12]</u> Currently, the most commonly used BPH laser procedure worldwide uses laser generated by lithium potassium titanyl phosphate or LBO crystals;通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> traditionally, these are classified as side-firing lasers compared to other types of laser, such as holmium laser and thulium laser. PVP surgery was initially associated with a longer operative time compared to TURP due to limitation of the output power.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Recently, this disadvantage was resolved by the introduction of high output power equipment that significantly decreased the operative time, particularly for cases with massive prostates.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Furthermore, the incidence of the fatal perioperative complication known as TURP syndrome has considerably declined due to saline irrigation,通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> and the reliable efficacy of LUTS with PVP compared to other types of lasers was verified by a series of studies.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18,19]</u> However, PVP associated with side-firing laser emission also has some disadvantages, including an energy loss of nearly 20% and a short lifespan of the laser fiber.通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21,22,23,24]</u> Moreover, PVP increases the possibility of missed diagnosis in prostate cancer due to complete tissue vaporization.\nThe introduction of an end-firing fiber successfully overcame all of the above-mentioned disadvantages of PVP. First, the tip is capable of transmitting laser to the tissues with almost no energy loss intraoperatively. Second, when fiber debris collects on the tip, it is straightforward to maintain the ideal output power by simply removing the affected parts. Finally, laser resection enables the collection of specimens for postoperative pathologic examination. Hence, using an end-firing fiber could enhance the tissue removal rate and improve the intraoperative safety.\nHerein, we share our preliminary experiences with PVRP. First, PVRP enabled better exposure of the prostate capsule with proper demarcation and reduced the risk of capsule perforation. Second, tissue removal should be carried out along the surgical capsule, especially with the groove at 12 o’clock, which facilitates tissue resection around the roof of the prostatic urethra and provides a satisfactory tissue removal rate. Third, it is essential to remove the middle lobe initially to acquire a wider channel in the prostatic urethra and enhance the operative visualization. In cases with large middle lobes with bladder neck involvement, we strongly recommend that markers should be drawn on the middle lobe before it is removed separately. Fourth, unlike the thulium laser, LBO laser cannot be absorbed by water; thus, the potential risk of tissue perforation is increased when the laser beam is concentrated at a certain place for a long time. This issue can be easily avoided by distending the bladder, frequently moving the fiber tip and decreasing the output power when the fiber tip is close to the bladder neck and prostate apex. Finally, for the great majority of the glands, the LBO laser produced a satisfactory hemostatic effect. We usually decrease the output power to about 50 W and maintain an appropriate distance between the fiber tip and hemorrhage site, otherwise excessive tissue vaporization might incur capsule perforation. The exception to this is bleeding in the bladder neck where the vascularity shows huge variability among patients; in highly vascular areas, LBO laser may be inappropriate for the management of hemorrhage. The likelihood of severe bleeding seems to correlate with the prostate volume, and bipolar TURP loop should be employed in these cases. In this study, four of 35 procedures were converted to TURP to achieve hemostasis. Other researchers reached a similar conclusion that bleeding is the most common intraoperative complication and is also the main reason for longer operative time.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> A hemostat can reportedly help manage intractable bleeding during the procedure.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> There is a learning curve for beginners to fully grasp the hemostasis technique.\nIn the study, LBO laser showed a significant advantage for the treatment of BPH and markedly improved both the subjective and objective parameters of patients compared to their baseline data. All perioperative complications were classified as a mild or moderate according to the modified Clavien-Dindo system. In a follow-up of 3 months, the efficacy remained stable among all patients and no adverse events were reported. In addition, the PVRP technique enabled the collection of specimens for pathological examination. The operative time in the study seems to be longer than that in previous studies;通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u> this might be attributed to the preponderance of large prostates and our stage of limited experience.\nThere are several limitations in this study. First, the small number of subjects and short-term postoperative follow-up might impair the reliability of the results. However, the primary objective of this study was to introduce the novel PVRP technique and outline the key steps of the procedure. We will include a larger number of cases in a future study to confirm the results of PVRP. Second, a control arm of patients undergoing TURP should be established before the study. Third, the limitations of PVRP should not be avoided; we consider that PVRP would not be superior to traditional techniques in cases involving a small prostate.\nIn conclusion, PVRP demonstrates satisfactory short-term clinical outcomes and safety in the treatment of LUTS caused by BPH. In addition, this promising technique has apparent advantages in enhancing tissue resection rate and obtaining pathological specimens. A larger quantity of cases and long-term follow-up data are needed to confirm the efficacy, durability, and safety of PVRP.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Table 3 presents the peri- and post-operative complications.

In addition, this promising technique has apparent advantages in enhancing tissue resection rate and obtaining pathological specimens. A larger quantity of cases and long-term follow-up data are needed to confirm the efficacy, durability, and safety of PVRP.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "index": 9049, "show": true, "start": 9049, "end": 10213, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:43:39", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:44:14", "cost": 35.177}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:32", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:44:14", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:43:39"}

The syndesmosis consists of the anteroinferior tibiofibular ligament, posteroinferior tibiofibular ligament, inferior transverse tibiofibular ligament, and interosseous membrane. Internal fixations of the syndesmosis were recommended by most authors to repair the associated ruptured ligaments,通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> which bring about the adverse consequences of limiting the physiological micromovement of the tibiofibular joint to some extent.\nTo this end, we have designed a syndesmosis elastic hook (SEH) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u> (Xiamen Double Engine Medical Material Co. Ltd. China), for which we have obtained the national patent (Patent Number: 201220005912.4). The hook is in the form of serpentine semi-ring and made of stainless steel. It passes round the fibula using fork-like pickpocket and it is secured to the tibia by a single 3.5 mm cancellous bone screw passing through the nail hole on the SEH. The elastic hook can not only effectively fix the tibiofibular syndesmosis, but also retain the physiological micromotion of tibiofibular joint. We have performed the biomechanical testing for the SEH, and cyclic axial loadings were applied to specimens with the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis injuries fixing with the SEH at 2, 5, 8, and 12 weeks.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> With fatigue test, the SEH restored 95% of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis stability effect.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> The purpose of this study was to report a new surgical technique for the treatment of ankle fractures together with diastasis of the tibiofibular syndesmosis with SEH and to retrospectively evaluate the outcome of these patients with clinical follow-up.\nFrom February 2011 to August 2012, a consecutive series of 29 patients (17 males and 12 females, 13 left legs and 16 right legs, aged 16–49 years, with an average age of 35 years) diagnosed with ankle fracture underwent surgery in our department, which were isolated Weber Type-B or C fractures according to X-ray examination results and the Danis–Weber classification. Eleven patients were injured in traffic accident, seven were injured in sports, five were injured in crush injury, and six in falling injury. All cases were fresh closed ankle fractures with no significant associated injuries. Patients with open fractures, large area of soft tissue injury, and multiple fractures were excluded from the study.\nThe surgical procedures were performed under spinal anesthesia with the patient in the supine position on the operating table by the same surgeon as soon as soft tissue edema was controlled. Throughout the procedure, we did not use the tourniquet to reduce postoperative swelling of the limb. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment was started preceding 30 min of operation and continued for 24 h postoperatively. Lateral malleolar fractures were approached through a length of 6–8 cm curved incision, and lateral metallic one-third tubular plates were used in fixation of fractures with 3.5 mm screws. Three 3.5 mm sized cortical screws were inserted to the proximal of the fracture and four 3.5 mm sized cancellous screws were inserted to the distal of the fracture.\nThe ankle mortise stability was tested with standard cotton test and lateral rotation stress to the fibula under intraoperative fluoroscopy to clearly identify ligament disruption of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis. Patients were included in the study only when the radiographic measurements were more than 3.0 mm of widening of the tibiofibular separation space.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> The syndesmosis was held reduced with a large towel clamp and SEH was placed across syndesmosis from the fibula to the tibia which was secured to the tibia by a 3.5 mm cortical bone screw passed through the 3.5 mm hole in diameter of the hook. The tibiofibular syndesmosis ligaments were not repaired. Once subsequent surgical procedure was completed, the ankle joint stability was tested in all directions.\nPostoperatively, patients were immediately immobilized in a below-knee plaster cast for 3 weeks. Early weight bearing was allowed as pain alleviated after 6 weeks, with the use of a nonweight-bearing splint. Clinical and X-ray follow-up were obtained at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and annual thereafter. Functional outcome of patient was assessed by means of the ankle fracture scoring scale of Olerud and Molander.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\nThe statistical description of patients and clinical follow-up results are depicted in Table 1. Six patients were lost to follow-up before the fracture healed, and the mean duration of follow-up was 3.5 (range 2-6) months. Although there were no complications in these patients, no ankle scores are available for them.\nData of the 23 patients\n删除重复语句：<u>Data of the 23 patients</u>\nThe remaining 23 patients were followed up for at least 12 months, and the average follow-up period was 34 (range 24–48) months. Twenty-one (91.30%) out of 23 patients returned to their original work within 10 (range 8–16) weeks, two patients changed the work immediately after the injury.\nThe mean ankle score for the remaining 23 patients at their 48 months was 96 points 通用删除8(英):<u>[range 90–100; Table 1]</u>. Based on the cotton test or lateral rotation stress to the fibula, all the 23 patients were followed up with a negative hook test. Patients with low scores were mainly due to the lack of ankle flexion exercise, which led to the stiffness and swelling of ankle joint. Only one patient had none-to-mild occasional pain, which can be alleviated by oral nonsteroidal painkillers.\nThe follow-up radiograph showed that all ankle fractures had healed in an anatomical position at an average of 5 months (range, 3–6 months), with fracture lines disappearing 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. There was no evidence of breakage of SEH, and we removed it in four cases due to strong demand of patients. All patients were routinely given antibiotics postoperative 24 h, and there were no infection complications.\nSyndesmosis injuries arise in 10–15% of all patients with ankle fractures.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Several authors have demonstrated that restoration of the syndesmosis as well as anatomic reduction of any associated fracture of the fibula or the medial malleolus is equally important.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The literature showed that widening and chronic instability of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis have been correlated with poor functional outcomes and the development of osteoarthritis.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Therefore, the surgical fixation is usually recommended for the treatment of syndesmotic injuries.\nMany surgical methods of fixation have been described to stabilize the syndesmosis in the literature: the syndesmosis hook,通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> syndesmosis screw,通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Arthrex’s TightRope,通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> bolt,通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> or bioabsorbable screw,通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> to reduce and hold the syndesmosis in position anatomically until the syndesmosis healing with early fiber formation. However, there is no consensus regarding the most reliable treatment for providing the most effective clinical outcomes.\nThe ankle syndesmosis is considered as a dynamic fibrous joint. With dorsiflexion of the foot, the distal tibiofibular joint space widens to deepen the ankle mortise to accommodate the wider portion of the trapezoidal talus. This relative motion is very important between the articulating bones for the physiological function of ankle mortise during weight-bearing walking and ankle range of motion. Therefore, combining with clinical considerations, the operative methods for treating syndesmosis injuries through the aforementioned fixations will limit the postoperative motion of the distal tibiofibular joint to some extent, which are thus restricted for the treatment of syndesmosis injuries.\nThe SEH is designed according to the physiologic micro-movement feature of the syndesmosis, including resilient serpentine linker, fork-like pickpocket across the fibula end, and single cancellous screw hole of the distal tibial end, which can not only effectively fix the distal injured tibiofibular syndesmosis, but also retain the micro-movable feature of it. There is no need to remove the SEH prior to walking, and we have conducted biomechanical testing to support the clinical use.\nIn this series of patients, some of the complications such as loosening, breakage, and migration have not been observed. Only five patients felt uncomfortable after we removed the fixations. The technique described in this study fulfills the principles of biological fixation and allows early functional exercises, which is a simple and quick operative procedure providing reliable syndesmotic reduction.\nIn conclusion, the use of SEH of fixation of syndesmosis can provide stable fixation with a very low rate of complications and achieve satisfactory functional outcome. We believe that it is one of the suitable options for treating ankle syndesmosis injuries. However, it is necessary to continue to follow up on the clinical effects of this fixation method.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by Nanjing Military Region; Contract Grant Number: 11MA078.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 09:51:20", "endTime": "2024/10/09 09:51:33", "cost": 12.552}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:32", "update_time": "2024-10-08 17:51:31", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 17:51:18"}

For old patients, as the time of using tourniquet become shorter, the risk of artery intimal injury and atheromatous plaque disruption will decrease.\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2016.01.007</u>", "index": 8008, "show": true, "start": 8008, "end": 8139, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:37:35", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:38:37", "cost": 62.042}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:38:37", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:37:35"}

Special consideration for this procedure is necessary in very young children as there are risks unique to this age group. The purpose of this article is to review the safety of general anesthesia for adenotonsillectomy with a focus on those issues related to young children.\nThe majority of adenotonsillectomy procedures are performed as ambulatory surgery, with <3% requiring inpatient care.删除4：<u>1</u> Indications for surgery include recurrent throat infections and sleep-disorder breathing or obstructive sleep apnea.删除4：<u>1</u> For children 0~3 years old, the indication for surgery is almost always obstruction, including tonsil and/or adenoid hypertrophy, upper airway obstruction, or sleep disordered breathing.删除4：<u>3</u> Adenotonsillectomy has been shown to reduce obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by approximately 70% in healthy pediatric patients.删除4：<u>4</u>\nAdenotonsillectomy is typically performed with general endotracheal anesthesia. Airway management with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is sometimes used for adenoidectomy alone.删除4：<u>5</u> Preoperative considerations for children undergoing adenotonsillectomy include the child’s age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, anesthetic history, any associated comorbidities or genetic syndromes, as well as a history of recent illness especially focused on recent upper respiratory infections (URI) in the month preceding surgery. Special considerations must also be given to a history of easy bruising, prolonged bleeding or a family history of bleeding disorders so that an appropriate workup may be completed prior to surgery. Given the increased risk of complications with underlying obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) any signs or symptoms of OSA should be inquired about. In addition, any diagnostic studies evaluating potential complications of OSA, such as pulmonary hypertension or left ventricular hypertrophy, should be reviewed. Physical exam should include an airway exam assessing any anatomic features that may make intubation difficult such as macroglossia, mandibular hypoplasia, micrognathia, retrognathia, maxillary or mid face hypoplasia as well as limited c-spine mobility. A pulmonary exam to check for any wheezing or rhonchi is important, and patients with reactive airway disease should be optimized. Admission after adenotonsillectomy should be considered for children less than 3 years old, patients with a medical co-morbidity, severe OSA, a bleeding diathesis, or families that live an excessive distance from the hospital.\nPerioperative respiratory events remain one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy.删除4：<u>6</u> The severity of obstructive sleep apnea remains a major risk factor for the development of perioperative respiratory events such as post operative pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or airway obstruction.删除4：<u>7</u> Obesity appears to be the most significant factor associated with OSA in children.删除4：<u>4</u> OSA symptoms include loud snoring, gasps, and pauses in breathing.

Since polysomnography may not always be readily available, the McGill oximetry score can also be used to assess for the risk of sleep apnea; however this test is not appropriate for patients with syndromes or neuromuscular disorders because their desaturations could be secondary to central events, not just obstructive ones. Compared to polysomnography, overnight oximetry is readily available at most hospitals. It is simple, inexpensive and can be completed in the patients’ home. The score has four levels of severity based on number and depth of desaturation. No desaturations <90% is a score of 1 (no risk); three or more clusters of desaturations < 90% is a score of 2 (mild risk); three or more clusters of desaturations <85% is a score of 3 (moderate risk); and three or more clusters of desaturations <80% is a score of 4 or severe risk. The McGill Oximetry score can be used to estimate the severity of OSA and shorten the treatment process for patients with more severe disease, especially in centers with long waits for polysomnography.\nDespite preoperative diagnostic testing and tools to identify high risk patients, some patients may present only after manifesting, an abnormal response in the intraoperative or postoperative period. A difficult mask induction which would suggest high pharyngeal closing pressure,13,14 excessive respiratory sensitivity to opioids,15,16 a delayed emergence from anesthesia,17 or a persistent oxygen requirement especially during sleep following adenotonsillectomy should alert the provider to the potential for severe OSA.删除4：<u>18, 19, 20, 21</u>\nIn patients with severe OSA, there have been multiple studies that have shown that there is an increased opioid sensitivity with analgesia at much lower doses than patients undergoing the same procedure but without a history of OSA (T&A for recurrent tonsillitis vs OSA).删除4：<u>22,23</u> This is likely to be related to an alteration of the mu receptor that occurs with repeated episodes of oxygen desaturation.删除4：<u>22,24, 25, 26</u> The clinical implications are that a standard dose of opioid may in fact be a relative overdose in children with severe OSA. The American Society of Anesthesiologists has published practice guidelines for the perioperative management and assessment of both pediatric and adult patients in the perioperative period.删除4：<u>27</u> These guidelines recommend the careful selection of intraoperative medications secondary to the increased susceptibility of this patient population to the respiratory depressant airway effects of sedatives, opioids, and inhaled anesthetics. The guidelines also recommend keeping a patient in a monitored setting until they are no longer at risk of postoperative respiratory depression as determined by observing patients in an unstimulated environment, preferably while sleeping. Similarly, the AAP and American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Foundation have guidelines for risk assessment and preoperative management of these patients including when polysomnography should be performed.删除4：<u>11,28</u>\nChildren experience, on average, 6~8 upper respiratory infections per year and airway reactivity can persist for several weeks after the resolution of symptoms. Risks of general anesthesia in a patient with a current or recent URI include: laryngospasm, bronchospasm, stridor, cough, hypoxia, and unanticipated admission or need for intensive care. When anesthetizing patients with URIs, one of these events occurs >30% of the time in either the operating room or the post-anesthesia care unit.删除4：<u>26</u> Serious perioperative events, however, such as unplanned admission or need for postoperative ventilation and ICU care occur rarely.删除4：<u>29,30</u>\nSpecific URI symptoms and their severity increase the risk of perioperative complications. These include: lethargy, high fever, toxic appearance, abnormal breath sounds or oxygen saturation, productive cough, copious secretions, and nasal congestion. In addition, patient specific risk factors include history of prematurity, younger age, reactive airway disease, and exposure to smoke. Surgeries requiring endotracheal intubation and those involving the airway, such as adenotonsillectomy, are associated with higher risk as well.删除4：<u>29, 30, 31</u> These complications and risk factors need to be considered when evaluating the patient’s optimization for surgery. Whether or not to proceed with the procedure is at the discretion of the anesthesiologist in collaboration with the surgeon, patient, and the patient’s family.\nAnesthesia for adenotonsillectomy most frequently consists of general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube. In young children, an inhalational induction with a volatile anesthetic is performed the vast majority of the time. An inhalational induction allows the IV to be placed without causing the patient any discomfort or distress, and may be technically easier. Once an IV is secured and the plane of anesthesia is appropriate, the patient is intubated. Maintenance of anesthesia includes an inhaled or intravenous agent in addition to analgesics and anti-emetics. Controversy exists over whether deep or awake extubation is preferable. There is no evidence that states that one technique is better than the other and is up to the discretion of the anesthesiologist.删除4：<u>32</u>\nThe risk of airway fires is one of the safety hazards that are common to anesthesiologists and otolaryngologists. Airway fires have been the subject of many anesthesia closed claims.删除4：<u>33</u> Adenotonsillectomy, which uses electrocautery in close proximity to the endotracheal tube, is one of the surgeries that presents the greatest risk of airway fire due to the close proximity of all three components of the fire triad (oxygen, fuel, and heat from electrocautery).删除4：<u>34</u> Steps should be taken to prevent trapping of high concentrations of oxygen (closed system like ETT better than open) as well as limit leakage of oxygen. Leakage of oxygen has improved with the transition of uncuffed to cuffed endotracheal tubes in infants and children.删除4：<u>35</u> Any gauze or sponges used during surgery should be wet to prevent combustion.删除4：<u>36</u> Oxygen concentrations used in high-risk fire procedures like adenotonsillectomy should be less than 30%34 and nitrous oxide should be avoided as it is a flammable gas.删除4：<u>37</u> The ASA task force on operating room fires advises all staff to undergo education, perform drills or simulation and adequately prepare for the management of fires.删除4：<u>33</u> The management of a potential airway fire includes the stop-page of oxygen flow, removal of flammable agents such as the endotracheal tube and drapes, extinguish the fire with saline and secure the patient’s airway.删除4：<u>36</u>\nThe incidence of critical complications that require immediate intervention and that could lead to major disability or death during general anesthesia in children is low. Respiratory events are the most common critical events in children.删除4：<u>38, 39, 40</u> One large register in North America found critical adverse events occurred during 0.14% of pediatric anesthetics.删除4：<u>39</u> However, a large prospective study in Europe showed critical respiratory, cardiovascular, neurologic, and anaphylactic events occurred more frequently and in 4.8% of pediatric anesthetics and sedations.删除4：<u>40</u> Risk factors for critical events include young age, comorbidities, and higher ASA status.删除4：<u>38, 39, 40</u> The analysis further suggested that children 3 years old and younger should be managed in tertiary care centers by anesthesiologists with pediatric training.删除4：<u>40</u> In addition, ENT surgery and snoring, regardless of type of surgery, have been shown to be independent risk factors for adverse events in children.删除4：<u>38,40</u> When considering perioperative cardiac arrest specifically during non-cardiac procedures, the occurrence is extremely low at 2.9 per 10,000 anesthetics. Only 7.8% of those events were attributed to anesthesia and 88% of patients had a history of congenital heart disease.删除4：<u>41</u> In regards to death or neurologic injury after tonsillectomy specifically, children that are at risk for OSA have a larger proportion of events that were attributed to apnea, whereas all others had a larger proportion of events attributed to hemorrhage.删除4：<u>2</u>\nAnother shared safety hazard is the post-operative tonsil hemorrhage. Post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage is divided into primary (first 24 h) and secondary hemorrhage with rates of 0.2%~2.2% and 0.1%~0.3% respectively.删除4：<u>42</u> Primary hemorrhage is generally more serious because it is usually more profuse and brisk.删除4：<u>43</u> Secondary hemorrhage commonly occurs between post-operative days 5 and 10 secondary to premature separation of the scab covering the tonsil bed.删除4：<u>44</u> Post operative tonsil hemorrhage is a surgical emergency and presents many challenges to the anesthesiologist including the risk of aspiration secondary to a stomach full of blood, volume depletion with potential cardiovascular collapse, a potential difficult airway due to blood and edema as well as an anxious patient/family.45 A thorough review of the previous anesthetic record can provide helpful information regarding the patients’ airway, recognizing that the airway may be more difficult secondary to the reasons listed above. The prior record may be helpful in ascertaining prior blood loss and fluid administration as well as medications administered, especially in primary tonsil hemorrhage.\nPrior to presentation to the operating room, fluid resuscitation should begin. A patient that has a history of dizziness and orthostatic hypotension may suggest a loss of at least 20% of the circulating blood volume and indicates the need for aggressive resuscitation.删除4：<u>43</u> The outpouring of catecholamines may mask hypotension in an awake child that becomes evident on induction of anesthesia secondary to vasodilation from induction drugs resulting in profound hypotension. In order to prevent hypotension upon induction, a reduction in the dose of induction agents while continuing to aggressively resuscitate with Ⅳ fluids and/or transfusion may be performed. A rapid sequence induction with either succinylcholine or rocuronium will allow for rapid intubation to gain control of the airway to minimize the risk of aspiration. The surgeon should be available to assist, if needed, by holding pressure utilizing a tonsil ball to decrease bleeding and improve visualization and to help secure the airway. Extubation should only occur when the patient is awake and able to control their airway reflexes. Post-tonsillar hemorrhage represents a significant portion of the claims against otolaryngologists but some of the highest awards were not directly related to blood loss but rather to airway complications as a result of the bleeding.删除4：<u>7</u> This underscores the need for good communication between anesthesiologists and otolaryngologists to ensure a safe and stable airway as well as to minimize morbidity and mortality.\nAs enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have become more prevalent, there have been a few pediatric pilot studies and QI projects looking at various opioid-sparing protocols to decrease opioid requirements during and after adenotonsillectomy. These protocols would be very beneficial in the severe OSA patient population where there is increased respiratory sensitivity to inhaled gases, heightened opioid sensitivity, and altered ventilatory control. Opioid sparing protocols are also beneficial given the ongoing opioid crisis as well as intermittent opioid drug shortages occurring secondary to the COVID pandemic. Most of the pilot studies have looked at some combination of oral dextromethorphan, acetaminophen, NSAID’s, dexmedetomidine or clonidine, and ketamine.删除4：<u>46,47</u> There needs to be larger pediatric studies to validate the findings of the initial pilot studies and elucidate the best combination and doses of the various non-opioid adjuncts.\nAnalgesic medications prescribed postoperatively need to be selected carefully. There is increasing evidence that significant genetic variation exists in regard to drug metabolism, specifically for codeine. Approximately 10% of children have a defect in CYP2D6 metabolism and are unable to convert codeine to morphine. They, therefore, have no analgesic effect. About 0.5%~2% of children rapidly convert codeine to morphine producing a high serum concentration and a relative overdose. In patients with OSA and opioid sensitivity, this is particularly dangerous. Therefore the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has published a warning against the use of codeine in children for post-tonsillectomy analgesia.删除4：<u>43</u>\nSince 1999, there have been many published animal studies that demonstrated detrimental effects of general anesthetic medications on the developing brain.删除4：<u>48, 49, 50, 51, 52</u> These early studies seemed to generate more questions than answers and continued research is necessary. It was not clear if the doses and lengths of exposures could be extrapolated to what is commonly seen in surgical procedures in children and there are obviously significant anatomical differences in the brain of animals and humans.\nStudies have also been conducted in children, with mixed results. Some support the findings in animal studies, particularly in long and/or repeated exposures to anesthesia at high doses.删除4：<u>53, 54, 55</u> Other studies, including randomized trials, do not show any effect on the developing brain.删除4：<u>56,57</u> Even a single anesthesia exposure at a young age was recently associated with parental report of behavior issues but no difference in general intelligence.删除4：<u>58</u> It is important to note that it is impossible to eliminate confounding factors in these studies as many of the participants have comorbidities that result in the need for surgery. Additional studies in both children and animals are ongoing. Many of these studies are supported and facilitated by collaborative organizations such as the International Anesthesia Research Society and the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) \"SmartTots\" (Smarttots.org).\nGiven the concern for neurotoxicity, it is reasonable to consider combining procedures that require general anesthesia in young children. Logistically this can be difficult as it often involves coordination between several services. However, studies have found combining procedures to be feasible and to reduce cost.删除4：<u>59,60</u>\nIn 2016, however, the FDA issued a warning on the use of general anesthesia in young children.删除4：<u>61</u> The warning is specific to repeated or lengthy use of general anesthetic and sedation drugs during surgeries or procedures in children less than 3 years old or pregnant women during their third trimester. The medications included in the warning consist of these most commonly used general anesthetic medications for procedures such as adenotonsillectomy. Although adenotonsillectomy would not require a long exposure to general anesthesia, there is always the possibility that a child will require another exposure before the age of 3. It is therefore crucial to weigh this specific risk of anesthesia when evaluating the benefits of proceeding with surgery. Given that the indication for adenotonsillectomy in young children is almost exclusively obstruction and that OSA carries the risk of serious complications, there is often significant benefit in proceeding.\nAdenotonsillectomy remains one of the most common operative procedures performed in children. Despite being a commonly performed procedure, it is not without risk. There are, however, many things that can be done to mitigate these risks. Optimizing the patient pre-operatively, including ensuring no recent URI’s, as well as recognizing patients at an increased risk for perioperative complications secondary to OSA or other comorbidities, can help ensure the best possible outcome. Good communication intraoperatively between the anesthesiologist and surgeon can minimize the risk of airway fire and is important in managing any complications that may arise perioperatively. Other safety considerations include weighing the risk vs benefits of proceeding with surgery in children less than the age of 3 given the FDA warning regarding the use anesthetics in this patient population. Further research in the area of neurotoxicity as well as opioid sparing anesthetics and ERAS protocols may make this common surgery even safer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "通用删除1(英):(Snoring, Trouble Breathing and Un-Refreshed,", "content": "【0】Tonsillectomy with and without adenoidectomy is a frequently performed surgical procedure with >289,000 cases occurring yearly in children <15 years old.删除4：<u>1</u> Although a common procedure, it is not without significant risk.删除4：<u>2</u> Risks range from minimal to life threatening and can be related to preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors and events.

Post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage is divided into primary (first 24 h) and secondary hemorrhage with rates of 0.2%~2.2% and 0.1%~0.3% respectively.删除4：<u>42</u> Primary hemorrhage is generally more serious because it is usually more profuse and brisk.删除4：<u>43</u> Secondary hemorrhage commonly occurs between post-operative days 5 and 10 secondary to premature separation of the scab covering the tonsil bed.删除4：<u>44</u> Post operative tonsil hemorrhage is a surgical emergency and presents many challenges to the anesthesiologist including the risk of aspiration secondary to a stomach full of blood, volume depletion with potential cardiovascular collapse, a potential difficult airway due to blood and edema as well as an anxious patient/family.45 A thorough review of the previous anesthetic record can provide helpful information regarding the patients’ airway, recognizing that the airway may be more difficult secondary to the reasons listed above. The prior record may be helpful in ascertaining prior blood loss and fluid administration as well as medications administered, especially in primary tonsil hemorrhage.\nPrior to presentation to the operating room, fluid resuscitation should begin. A patient that has a history of dizziness and orthostatic hypotension may suggest a loss of at least 20% of the circulating blood volume and indicates the need for aggressive resuscitation.删除4：<u>43</u> The outpouring of catecholamines may mask hypotension in an awake child that becomes evident on induction of anesthesia secondary to vasodilation from induction drugs resulting in profound hypotension. In order to prevent hypotension upon induction, a reduction in the dose of induction agents while continuing to aggressively resuscitate with Ⅳ fluids and/or transfusion may be performed. A rapid sequence induction with either succinylcholine or rocuronium will allow for rapid intubation to gain control of the airway to minimize the risk of aspiration. The surgeon should be available to assist, if needed, by holding pressure utilizing a tonsil ball to decrease bleeding and improve visualization and to help secure the airway. Extubation should only occur when the patient is awake and able to control their airway reflexes. Post-tonsillar hemorrhage represents a significant portion of the claims against otolaryngologists but some of the highest awards were not directly related to blood loss but rather to airway complications as a result of the bleeding.删除4：<u>7</u> This underscores the need for good communication between anesthesiologists and otolaryngologists to ensure a safe and stable airway as well as to minimize morbidity and mortality.\nAs enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have become more prevalent, there have been a few pediatric pilot studies and QI projects looking at various opioid-sparing protocols to decrease opioid requirements during and after adenotonsillectomy. These protocols would be very beneficial in the severe OSA patient population where there is increased respiratory sensitivity to inhaled gases, heightened opioid sensitivity, and altered ventilatory control. Opioid sparing protocols are also beneficial given the ongoing opioid crisis as well as intermittent opioid drug shortages occurring secondary to the COVID pandemic. Most of the pilot studies have looked at some combination of oral dextromethorphan, acetaminophen, NSAID’s, dexmedetomidine or clonidine, and ketamine.删除4：<u>46,47</u> There needs to be larger pediatric studies to validate the findings of the initial pilot studies and elucidate the best combination and doses of the various non-opioid adjuncts.\nAnalgesic medications prescribed postoperatively need to be selected carefully. There is increasing evidence that significant genetic variation exists in regard to drug metabolism, specifically for codeine. Approximately 10% of children have a defect in CYP2D6 metabolism and are unable to convert codeine to morphine. They, therefore, have no analgesic effect. About 0.5%~2% of children rapidly convert codeine to morphine producing a high serum concentration and a relative overdose. In patients with OSA and opioid sensitivity, this is particularly dangerous. Therefore the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has published a warning against the use of codeine in children for post-tonsillectomy analgesia.删除4：<u>43</u>\nSince 1999, there have been many published animal studies that demonstrated detrimental effects of general anesthetic medications on the developing brain.删除4：<u>48, 49, 50, 51, 52</u> These early studies seemed to generate more questions than answers and continued research is necessary. It was not clear if the doses and lengths of exposures could be extrapolated to what is commonly seen in surgical procedures in children and there are obviously significant anatomical differences in the brain of animals and humans.\nStudies have also been conducted in children, with mixed results. Some support the findings in animal studies, particularly in long and/or repeated exposures to anesthesia at high doses.删除4：<u>53, 54, 55</u> Other studies, including randomized trials, do not show any effect on the developing brain.删除4：<u>56,57</u> Even a single anesthesia exposure at a young age was recently associated with parental report of behavior issues but no difference in general intelligence.删除4：<u>58</u> It is important to note that it is impossible to eliminate confounding factors in these studies as many of the participants have comorbidities that result in the need for surgery. Additional studies in both children and animals are ongoing. Many of these studies are supported and facilitated by collaborative organizations such as the International Anesthesia Research Society and the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) \"SmartTots\" (Smarttots.org).\nGiven the concern for neurotoxicity, it is reasonable to consider combining procedures that require general anesthesia in young children. Logistically this can be difficult as it often involves coordination between several services. However, studies have found combining procedures to be feasible and to reduce cost.删除4：<u>59,60</u>\nIn 2016, however, the FDA issued a warning on the use of general anesthesia in young children.删除4：<u>61</u> The warning is specific to repeated or lengthy use of general anesthetic and sedation drugs during surgeries or procedures in children less than 3 years old or pregnant women during their third trimester. The medications included in the warning consist of these most commonly used general anesthetic medications for procedures such as adenotonsillectomy. Although adenotonsillectomy would not require a long exposure to general anesthesia, there is always the possibility that a child will require another exposure before the age of 3. It is therefore crucial to weigh this specific risk of anesthesia when evaluating the benefits of proceeding with surgery. Given that the indication for adenotonsillectomy in young children is almost exclusively obstruction and that OSA carries the risk of serious complications, there is often significant benefit in proceeding.\nAdenotonsillectomy remains one of the most common operative procedures performed in children. Despite being a commonly performed procedure, it is not without risk. There are, however, many things that can be done to mitigate these risks. Optimizing the patient pre-operatively, including ensuring no recent URI’s, as well as recognizing patients at an increased risk for perioperative complications secondary to OSA or other comorbidities, can help ensure the best possible outcome. Good communication intraoperatively between the anesthesiologist and surgeon can minimize the risk of airway fire and is important in managing any complications that may arise perioperatively. Other safety considerations include weighing the risk vs benefits of proceeding with surgery in children less than the age of 3 given the FDA warning regarding the use anesthetics in this patient population. Further research in the area of neurotoxicity as well as opioid sparing anesthetics and ERAS protocols may make this common surgery even safer.", "index": 3946, "show": true, "start": 3946, "end": 4000, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:41:30", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:42:48", "cost": 77.844}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:42:48", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:41:30"}

Analysis of location distribution and characteristic distribution was performed for two main CT findings — GGO and patchy consolidation. The association with interlobular septal thickening was also analyzed. If initial CT showed no abnormal findings, the normal findings were reported and a follow-up second CT was performed. CT findings were interpreted and compared longitudinally to monitor disease development.\nCharacteristics and classification of CT abnormalities:\nClass 1. Small lesions: subpleural and with a diameter of ≤15 mm;Class 2. Coalescing small lesions: subpleural and with a diameter or long diameter ≤25 mm;Class 3.

In this study, CT findings were classified into four phases: early phase, progression phase, severe phase, and recovery phase based on the Radiologic Diagnosis of Pneumonia Caused by Novel Coronavirus Infection: Chinese Society of Radiology Expert Recommendations (Version 1) 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\nEvery chest CT in this study was reviewed and read by two radiologists with >10 years of experience. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third radiologist who had >35 years of experience. The radiologists who read the CT images were blinded to the patient’s clinical information, but the radiographic staging of CT was based on the combination of CT findings, rapidity of disease progression, and clinical staging. Patients’ clinical staging was determined by two experienced internists based on individual patient’s clinical conditions.\nThe inclusion and exclusion criteria were strictly followed, and it was a multicenter research.\nWe did not calculate the sample size, because this was an observational descriptive study, and the number of COVID-19 bases increased rapidly.\nDescriptive analysis was performed by indicating the mean and standard deviation for quantitative variables and the percentage for qualitative variables. The analyses were carried out using Excel software. There was no follow-up loss and no missing data.\nThere were 130 potentially eligible patients for this study, and we examined them for eligibility; 78 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2, and 3 patients had inadequate clinical data. The study enrolled 49 patients [23 males (46.9%) and 26 females (53.1%), mean age: 55 通用删除7(英):<u>(24-84)</u> years] with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. All the patients completed follow-up 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>. Characteristics of study participants: The symptom onset in patients was as follows: fever (n = 48), cough (n = 49), fatigue (n = 20), myalgia (n = 10), rhinorrhea (n = 45), sore throat (n = 39), and diarrhea (n = 2).\nThe interval days between symptom onset to first CT study were as follows: 0-3 days in 9 patients, 4-7 days in 14 patients, 8-14 days in 21 patients, and 15-20 days in 5 patients. Two patients had an initial negative CT: one patient had negative CT on day 0 of symptoms, but a repeat CT on day 4 showed bilateral lower lobe peripheral GGO; the other patient had negative CT on day 4 of symptoms, but a repeat CT on day 8 showed bilateral lower lobe large consolidations with worsening of symptoms. Further, 14 patients had at least one follow-up repeat CT. Among the 49 cases, 9 patients experienced clinical deterioration and 9 patients died. The average follow-up time was 7 days, and no participant had missing data for any variable of interest.\nTable 1 shows the location and characteristics of CT abnormalities. Twenty-two patients had simple GGO; of these, bilateral and inferior lung involvement was observed in 19 (86.4%) and 19 (86.4%) patients, respectively. All 22 patients had posterior and peripheral lung involvement. Thirty patients had GGO with interlobular septal thickening, among which 26 (86.7%) had bilateral lung involvement, 28 (93.3%) had posterior lung involvement, 23 (76.7%) had inferior lung involvement, and 29 (96.7%) had peripheral lung involvement. Thirty patients had GGO with consolidation, among which 28 (93.3%) had bilateral lung involvement, 28 (93.3%) had posterior lung involvement, 21 (70.0%) had inferior lung involvement, and 29 (96.7%) had peripheral lung involvement. Twenty-four patients had simple lung consolidation, among which 22 (91.6%) had bilateral lung involvement, 23 (95.8%) had posterior lung involvement, and 17 (70.8%) had inferior lung involvement; all 24 had peripheral lung involvement.\nLocation of CT abnormalities.\n删除重复语句：<u>Location of CT abnormalities.</u>\nData are expressed as numbers.\nCT: Computed tomography; GGO: Ground-glass opacity.\nTable 2 shows the characteristic distribution of CT abnormalities.

GGO with interlobular septal thickening (43.3%) and GGO with consolidation (41.4%) developed mainly in the 8-14 days group. Simple consolidation also developed mainly in the 8-14 days group (50.0%) . Owing to the small sample size, there was no significant difference after statistical analysis.There was no observed airspace nodules, centrilobular nodules, or tree-in-bud sign, or cavity formation.

Reexamination showed changes in fibrous exudation and gradual absorption, and improved fibrosis.This case contained most of the imaging findings of COVID-19 with a typical complete course of disease.</u>\nOur study showed that GGO is the main radiographic feature of COVID-19 on CT. Most patients had pulmonary lesions on the posterior, inferior, and peripheral lung fields on CT. The development of GGO with interlobular septal thickening, GGO with consolidations, and consolidations only occurred mainly between day 8 and 14. The subsequent strong immune response causes quick development of consolidations, which suggests entering the progression phase. Pleural effusions were rarely seen. Lymph node enlargement or cavitary lesions were not observed.\nFor elderly patients or patients with baseline comorbidities such as diabetes or immunocompromised status, there was an increased risk of multiple infections. In these patients, the CT findings are relatively more complex and may show a combination of multiple features. Severe pneumonia develops rapidly and may progress into diffuse bilateral consolidations (e.g. \"white lungs\" ). Small pleural effusions are also seen in these patients. The diseased lungs are unable to perform gas exchange, thereby causing ARDS and suffocation.\nInterestingly, most of our patients only developed very thin subpleural GGO around day 3 of the illness. Some patients even had completely normal initial CT. Our initial thought was that GGO develops rapidly after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the thin GGO without septal thickening represents new progressive lesions. However, our findings showed that GGO did not emerge until several days after onset of symptoms followed by requirement of hospitalization and progression into severe stage disease. Despite a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab test, many patients only had mild-to-moderate symptoms. We believe that a small group of patients had a self-limiting course of upper respiratory infection, whereas most patients developed lung involvement with a small amount of them progressing into a severe or critical ill stage. Therefore, we believe it is critical to repeat the chest CT on day 5-7 of symptoms to monitor lung involvement. Some patients showed rapid progression from peripheral GGO to diffuse central GGO within 24-48 h. One patient in this study progressed rapidly since day 3 of symptom onset and developed both GGO and infiltrates involving the bilateral central and peripheral lung fields. The diseased lungs demonstrated butterflyshaped distribution. On day 14 of the illness, linear interstitial fibrosis was developed on top of GGO, consolidations, and air bronchograms.\nA previous study suggested that the lung injury caused by COVID-19 is mainly from alveolar injury and proliferation of type II epithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. One study suggests that in COVID-19, there are no significant alveolar wall or interlobular septal changes, rather desquamating inflammation and bronchitis. Furthermore, there is pulmonary hyaline membrane formation, a large number of alveolar infiltrates of inflammatory cells, and patchy hemorrhagic focal necrosis, and the alveolar infiltrate tends to organize in patients with prolonged clinical course 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Another study had similar findings of diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Histological findings of previous studies, to some extent, explained why interlobular septal thickening was not observed in initial CTs but only on follow-up CTs together with reticular appearance (cobblestone sign).\nIn this study, we found that bilateral lung involvement is common in COVID-19. Simple GGO was seen in 44.8% of patients, among which 86.4% had bilateral lung involvement and 86.4% had inferior lung involvement. All simple GGO patients had posterior and peripheral lung involvement. GGO with interlobular septal thickening was seen in 61.2% of patients, most had posterior lung involvement or peripheral lung involvement. GGO with consolidation was seen in 61.2% of patients, among which most had bilateral lung involvement, posterior lung involvement, or peripheral lung involvement. Simple lung consolidation was seen in 48.9% of patients, among which most had bilateral lung involvement or posterior lung involvement, and all had peripheral lung involvement. In sum, posterior, inferior, and peripheral lung fields were those mainly involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is consistent with results from previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,11,12,13]</u>. This study enrolled patients from multiple centers, and hence, the results are likely more convincing than those from single-center analyses.\nIn terms of the correlation between CT findings and clinical course, we found that simple GGO had a similar occurrence rate in 0-3 days (31.8%), 4-7 days (27.2%), and 8-14 days (31.8%). GGO with interlobular septal thickening presented mainly between day 8 and 14 (50.0%). Due to the small sample size, there was no significant statistical difference after statistical analysis. In a study by Pan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>, CT lung abnormality due to COVID-19 was found most prominent around day 10 after symptom onset. Studies with larger samples are needed for further investigation.\nCOVID-19 has various presentations and progresses rapidly. Chest CT is essential for timely diagnosis, severity evaluation, and guiding further follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>. Whether CT findings can help clinical staging still needs further discussion. In this study, we found that GGO was most common in patients with mild disease (54.5%), whereas GGO with interlobular thickening and GGO with consolidation were often seen in severe disease (41.4% and 48.3%, respectively). Simple consolidation was mainly seen in critically ill patients. Therefore, clinicians should be warned by the appearance of simple consolidation on CT. The laboratory data and patient’s signs and symptoms should be used in combination with CT in guiding clinical management.\nTo conclude, in our COVID-19 patient sample, GGO is the earliest finding on CT. As the disease progresses, thickening of the interalveolar septum and alveolar sac septum develops, and fine reticular opacities start to show up on the CT. Then, consolidation develops followed by fibrosis or absorption. Fibrosis on CT presents as highly dense patchy shadows, especially when mixed with linear or reticular opacities with various thicknesses. The more severe cases would develop scarring atelectasis and reduction of the local lung volume. On CT, we also observed a pattern of progression of opacities. Initially, COVID-19 presents as scattered small GGOs of lung periphery (involving the costal subpleural areas as well as interlobar, mediastinal, and peridiaphragmatic subpleural areas). The small GGOs start fusing together and form a continuous circumferential infiltrate of lung peripheries. Then, the infiltrates progress to the central lung field and spread to the entire lung. Another observed feature is that posterior and inferior lung fields usually develop infiltrates first and also worsen first. It is only at the \"white lung\" phase that infiltrates begin to appear in the anterior/apical upper lobe or basal lower lobe. Pleural effusion is uncommon and only small pleural effusion was observed in the late stage of the disease. Interlobular septal wall thickening was rarely seen. This is consistent with the description in the first pathological report of COVID-19 wherein no interlobular septal thickness was observed 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>.\nSARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the respiratory tract and 82% of the droplets range from 0.74 μm to 2.12 μm in size 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. In most cases, the virus hits the subpleural areas of the peripheral lung first where gas exchange takes place. Very rarely do central lung lesions develop first without subpleural area involvement. Hence, we infer that viral particles first arrive at the lung periphery where there are rich alveoli, and damage the alveolar wall; this presents on CT as interstitial (interalveolar septum and septum of alveolar sac) inflammatory infiltrates and edema. At this time, lung parenchyma can also be damaged, presenting as alveoli filled with half air and half infiltrates. The severe disease would affect gas exchange and causes significant hypoxia. We found that there is a correlation between the clinical course and radiographic development on CT in COVID-19. The disease severity (clinical stage) is associated with the rapidity of disease progression and is thereby associated with the progression of CT findings that range from mild to severe illness.\nThis study was a retrospective, observational study. Some potentially useful clinical data such as blood gas results were not collected. However, we endeavored to collect other data such as white blood cell and lymphocyte counts. Moreover, because of the study period, we were unable to analyze the longterm prognosis of the enrolled patients; therefore, we analyzed the short-term prognosis. We also enrolled only 49 patients; thus, further studies with a larger sample size are needed to validate our findings. Although this was a multicenter study, we thought the CT characteristics that cannot totally represent COVID-19.\nPosterior, inferior, and peripheral lung involvements were the key CT findings in COVID-19 patients in our study. GGO with interlobular septal thickening, GGO with consolidations, and simple consolidation were mainly seen between days 8 and 14 from symptom onset. Lung consolidation may represent disease progression to a severe stage. Simple consolidation or \"white lung\" may suggest a critically ill stage. CT characteristics of COVID-19 are varied and change quickly. Chest CT is essential in early diagnosis, severity evaluation, and guiding further follow-up patients with COVID-19.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:40:15", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:41:15", "cost": 60.217}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:41:15", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:40:14"}

In addition, few studies have reported trends in MMR caused by various specific causes of obstetric hemorrhage. Evaluation of MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage and the proportions of underlying death causes is important with respect to carrying out further interventions in maternal mortality.\nIn this study, we aimed to analyse the temporal trends of MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage and its specific causes in Chinese mainland from 2000 to 2019, to identify whether the rate of change has accelerated or slowed down during this period, and to confirm the causes of obstetric hemorrhage that need further focused intervention in the future.\nData used in the present study were collected from the National Maternal and Child Health Surveillance System (NMCHSS) between 2000 and 2019. The NMCHSS was established by the Ministry of Health of China in 1996 and includes three surveillance systems: maternal mortality, under-5 child mortality, and birth defects. Ninetyseven urban districts and 79 rural counties were stratified and randomly sampled into the NMCHSS based on 17 socioeconomic strata, covering 31 provinces and 60 million residents in Chinese mainland.删除4：<u>8,9,10</u> See the list of surveillance sites in the Supplemental Digital Content删除6：<u></u>. Given the annual decrease of maternal and child deaths and to ensure the national representation, surveillance sites in the NMCHSS were expanded to 336 urban districts and rural counties in 2006.11 Specialists at the county-level maternal and child health hospitals were responsible for collecting the number of live births and maternal deaths, as well as the case report cards of maternal deaths. Data were reported through the national web-based registration system to municipal maternal and child health hospitals, provincial maternal and child health hospitals, and the National Office for Maternal and Child Health Surveillance. Each maternal death was reviewed by the maternal death review committee at the county level, municipal level, provincial level, and national level according to the WHO-recommended method.删除4：<u>12,13,14</u> The final underlying cause of death was confirmed by the national review and was coded per the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10.8,11\nTo investigate the underreporting of live births and maternal deaths in the NMCHSS, a set of strict quality control measures were established. The surveillance staff at each level of maternal and child health hospital visited the other departments that also collected maternal mortality information, such as the National Disease Surveillance Points system of the Chinese Center for Disease Control, Household Registration Department of the Ministry of Public Security, and death registration of civil affairs departments (such as crematoria) to verify the numbers and causes of maternal deaths. Finally, based on the results of quality control, the underreporting of deaths and misdiagnosis of causes were corrected.\n删除3：<u>This study was approved by the ethics committee of the West China Second University Hospital (protocol ID: 2010015).

The causes of PPH included postpartum uterine atony, retained placenta, soft birth canal laceration, uterine rupture, uterine inversion, and late PPH. The definitions of the abovementioned causes of obstetric hemorrhage are based on the ninth edition of Obstetrics and Gynecology textbook.删除4：<u>16</u> We used the National Bureau of Statistics of China’s official definitions of urban districts and rural counties.删除4：<u>17</u> The definitions of eastern, central, and western regions are consistent with those in the National Maternal and Child Health Surveillance Manual.删除4：<u>18</u>\nThe characteristics, i.e. distribution of age, education, ethnicity, parity, and region, of maternal deaths due to obstetric hemorrhage were described in four discrete 5-year periods (2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014, and 2015-2019) and for the first and last years of the study (i.e. 2000 and 2019). Linear trends for changes in characteristics were assessed using linear or logistic models with year treated as a continuous variable. Analyses were based on maternal characteristics with non-missing values. Pie charts were used to show changes in the composition of the causes of obstetric hemorrhage from 2000 to 2019. The MMR and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for regions or causes were estimated by Poisson’s distribution. Joinpoint regression (also known as change point analysis) was used to assess the accurate temporal patterns by detecting points of deviation from a linear slope.删除4：<u>19</u> Joinpoint Regression Program version 4.9.0.0 删除6：<u></u> from the National Cancer Institute was used for this analysis.删除4：<u>20</u> As maternal death is a rare event, it is difficult to maintain an annual variation according to an absolute value, but more likely to vary according to a relative value (i.e. percentage). Therefore, the annual percent change (APC) was used to describe the rate of change, and log-linear model was chosen based on the software manual’s recommendations.删除4：<u>20</u> All other analyses were performed using Stata version 16.1 (Stata Corp. College Station, TX, USA). A two-tailed P value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\nThe national MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage was 18.4 per 100,000 live births (95% CI: 15.0-22.2) in 2000. It peaked in 2001 (22.1 per 100,000 live births, 95% CI: 18.3-26.4) and fell to the lowest in 2019 (1.6 per 100,000 live births, 95% CI: 1.0-2.3). Regional MMR experienced similar trends, with all figures peaking in 2001, except for the western region. In the western region, the MMR peaked in 2002 (65.1 per 100,000 live births, 95% CI: 49.5-84.2). The trends of MMR (95% CI) due to obstetric hemorrhage across different areas of China are presented in Figure 1.\nFor a long time, the national MMR caused by obstetric hemorrhage was at a low level, peaking at around 2.0 per 100,000 live births for specific causes of obstetric hemorrhage. However, the national MMR caused by PPH experienced a substantial reduction process and decreased from 17.0 per 100,000 live births (95% CI: 13.8-20.7) in 2000 to 1.3 per 100,000 live births (95% CI: 0.9-2.0) in 2019. The national MMR caused by postpartum uterine atony and retained placenta decreased most noticeably. The trends of national MMR (95% CI) due to obstetric hemorrhage specified by different causes are presented in Figure 2.\nJoinpoint analysis of national MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage by year showed no change points: significantly declined by 13.0% (95% CI: 11.5-14.5, P < 0.001) per year from 2000 to 2019 . There were also no change points in urban areas and the eastern region: the APC was -11.2% and -10.4%, respectively. However, there were two changes in rural areas: from 2000 to 2003, the APC was 3.3% but not statistically significant (P= 0.715); whereas, from 2003 to 2011, the MMR significantly declined by 18.7% (95% CI: 14.3-22.9, P < 0.001) per year, and from 2011 to 2019, the APC fell to -9.1% (P= 0.004). A similar situation was noted in the western region: from 2000 to 2003, the APC was 1.7% but not statistically significant (P= 0.865); whereas, from 2003 to 2009, the MMR significantly declined by 24.3% (95% CI: 16.6-31.3, P < 0.001) per year; and from 2009 to 2019, the APC fell to -11.7% (P < 0.001). Although there were two change points in the central region, the APC was not statistically significant in the first two time periods (P= 0.071 for 2000-2007 and P= 0.102 for 2007-2010). The MMR significantly declined by 7.8% (95% CI: 2.2-13.0, P= 0.011) per year only between 2010 and 2019.\nThere were no change points in joinpoint analysis of national MMR caused by APH, placenta previa, postpartum uterine atony, and retained placenta ; the respective APCs were -8.7% (P < 0.001), -12.0% (P < 0.001), -10.5% (P < 0.001), and -21.0% (P < 0.001). There were two change points in PPH and uterine rupture. The MMR caused by PPH significantly declined by 8.0% (95% CI: 1.9-13.6, P= 0.015) per year from 2000 to 2007. The APC of MMR caused by PPH accelerated further to -25.0% (P= 0.010) between 2007 and 2011 and then decreased to -7.8% (P= 0.026) between 2011 and 2019. However, the MMR caused by uterine rupture decreased significantly by 27.8% (95% CI: 10.3-41.8, P= 0.007) per year only in the middle period 通用删除7(英):<u>(2005-2011)</u>.\nThe proportion of maternal deaths due to APH increased from 7.6% (8/105) in 2000 to 14.3% (4/28) in 2019 (χ2=1.20, P= 0.274). For maternal deaths due to PPH, the proportion of postpartum uterine atony increased from 39.0% (41/105) in 2000 to 60.7% (17/28) in 2019 (χ2 = 4.22, P = 0.040); moreover, the proportion of uterine rupture also increased from 12.3% (13/105) in 2000 to 14.3% (4/28) in 2019 (χ2=0.07, P= 0.789). However, the proportion of retained placenta decreased from 37.1% (39/ 105) in 2000 to 7.1% (2/28) in 2019 (χ2=9.33, P= 0.002). The changes in the composition of specific cause of maternal deaths due to obstetric hemorrhage are presented in Figure 5.\nFrom 2000 to 2019, 1831 maternal deaths caused by obstetric hemorrhage were collected in the NMCHSS database . The mean age of maternal deaths increased from 28.6 in 2000 to 32.9 in 2019 (Pfor trend < 0.001). There was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of maternal deaths in mothers aged ≥35 years (Pfor trend < 0.001) from 2000 to 2019. Meanwhile, the proportion of maternal deaths in those who were educated to junior middle school and higher also increased significantly (Pfor trend < 0.001). In contrast, differences in proportions by ethnicity (Han vs. Non-Han), parity (primipara vs. multipara), region, or urban vs. rural were not statistically significant (the Pfor trend were 0.932, 0.400, 0.128, and 0.170, respectively).\nCharacteristics for maternal deaths due to obstetric haemorrhage in Chinese mainland, 2000-2019.\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics for maternal deaths due to obstetric haemorrhage in Chinese mainland, 2000-2019.</u>\n* The P value for linear trend was for 2000-2019.\n† Three maternal deaths had missing value for age, nine had missing value for education, and three had missing value for parity.\n‡ t value.\n§ z values.\n‖Comparison between the proportion of maternal deaths that occurred in the western region and other regions.\nThe main finding of our study is that the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage declined significantly during the years 2000-2019. Maternal deaths due to retained placenta showed a considerable decline. However, although MMR due to postpartum uterine atony also declined and is now at a low level, it remained the most common cause of maternal death due to obstetric hemorrhage in 2019, followed by rupture. With respect to specific regions, MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage was most pronounced in rural areas and western regions, with both having a slight rise, then a quick fall, then a moderate decline. With respect to specific causes, APH changed little and stayed low, while PPH decreased significantly, particularly for postpartum uterine atony and retained placenta. The rate of decline in MMR due to retained placenta was the fastest, reaching almost twice the rate due to postpartum uterine atony.\nA study covering 7 million births showed that the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage in the USA was 2.3 per 100,000 births between 2003 and 2011.21 Donati et al. reported that MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage in Italy was 2.9 per 100,000 live births during the period 2000-2007.22 Two studies described the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage in France at around 1.0 per 100,000 live births after 2010.23,24 Blagoeva Atanasova et al.25 reported that this ratio was <1.0 per 100,000 live births in Spain between 1999 and 2015. Overall, the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage in high-income countries was already at a very low level 10 years ago. In contrast, the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage was substantially greater in low-and middle-income countries. One recent study from ten low-and middle-income countries, including sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Haiti showed that the average MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage in these regions was 67.0 per 100,000 deliveries.删除4：<u>26</u> Gulumser et al.7 reported that the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage was 4.1 per 100,000 live births in Turkey from 2012 to 2015. A previous study reported that the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage was 16.6 per 100,000 live births in China in 2005.8 Our study confirmed that China’s recent MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage was approaching that of a high-income country.\nThe vast majority of studies have focused on maternal mortality over a certain time period. There is very little literature that focuses specifically on temporal trends in maternal mortality due to obstetric hemorrhage. One study showed that the overall MMR in the USA remained stable between 2003 and 2011, but the proportion of obstetric hemorrhage that caused maternal death increased significantly from 8.2% to 22.0%.删除4：<u>21</u> Based on this result, we could infer that the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage was on the rise in the USA. Some countries, such as Turkey, have not changed in recent years.7 A few countries, such as Italy, reported that the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage significantly decreased.删除4：<u>6</u> Li et al.8 reported that the average annual decline rate of MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage was 6.93% in China from 1996 to 2005. However, this study did not report temporal trends for each specific cause of obstetric hemorrhage. Our study found that the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage declined even faster in the period 2000-2019 than in the 10-year period from 1996 to 2005. In addition, we found that the rate of decline in MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage varied by region and cause, with some (eg, rural areas and PPH) declining more rapidly initially and then becoming slower, and others (eg, uterine rupture) experiencing an initial rapid decline and then stagnating or perhaps even rebounding in recent years.\nThe Chinese government has invested heavily in maternal and child health, particularly in reducing maternal mortality.删除4：<u>27</u> In 2000, obstetric hemorrhage accounted for 40.5% of maternal deaths in China (mainly retained placenta and postpartum uterine atony),28 and most of them were preventable. To ensure the achievement of MDG5, the \"Reducing maternal mortality and eliminating neonatal tetanus\" program (one of the best known maternal and child health intervention program) was implemented by the State Council Committee for Women and Children together with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance since 2000.14 This program began to expand in 2004, reached the maximum number of counties in 2010, ended in 2013, and was then integrated into the National Essential Public Health Programs in 2014.14,29,30 The program covered rural populations in the central and western regions, established hospital delivery subsidy for low-income mothers to encourage hospital delivery, assisted in the establishment of obstetric emergency centers and \"green channel\" (Green channel refers to a simple, safe and fast way or channel, such as simplifying some procedures of reception, admission, referral, multidisciplinary consultation and rescue.) express referral networks, and provided training for grass root-level clinicians to improve their service of midwifery skills, such as manual removal of the placenta, repairing vaginal laceration, and other first aid skills.删除4：<u>14</u> Most of these basic skills trainings were aimed at obstetric hemorrhage, the major cause of maternal deaths. As a result, an extremely rapid decrease in the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage was observed in our results for the central and western regions, as well as for the MMR due to retained placenta. It is worth noting that MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage in rural and western areas or that caused by PPH experienced an accelerated decline around 2004-2010 (significantly faster than other time periods), and these change points also coincided highly with the time points for the expansion of coverage of counties in the \"Reducing maternal mortality and eliminating neonatal tetanus\" program. In addition, some economically developed provinces, such as Beijing and Shanghai, achieved significant reductions in maternal deaths due to PPH by strengthening the management of delivery sites for floating populations, as well as the network management of maternal near miss.删除4：<u>31,32</u>\nAlthough our study shows that the MMR in China is currently low, obstetric hemorrhage remains the leading cause of maternal mortality in China.删除4：<u>11</u> In particular, it should be noted that there are significant differences in the decline rate of MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage in different regions or because of different causes. With the change of national fertility policy and the implementation of the \"two-child\" and \"three-child\" policies, the proportion of mothers of advanced age or with a history of cesarean section has increased significantly,33 and the risk of obstetric hemorrhage has also consequently increased. Reduction of maternal mortality due to obstetric haemorrhage remains an important challenge to ensure maternal safety in China, despite the current low mortality level. Maybe we can learn from the experience of high-income countries. A study from Italy suggests that improving the quality of care through the development of evidence-based and carefully selected research and training bundle set designed specifically for health professionals involved in pregnancy and delivery assistance to enhance maternal mortality surveillance system may help reduce maternal deaths due to obstetric hemorrhage.删除4：<u>6</u> Clinicians need to be actively involved in maternal near miss and maternal death reviews, providing long-term feedback on the bundles of interventions developed through these reviews, improving actions, and enhancing training on effective measures to create a cycle that will significantly decrease in maternal deaths due to obstetric hemorrhage. In addition, given the particular context of China’s new fertility policy, the \"three-child\" policy, we should pay particular attention to pregnant women who are older or have a history of cesarean sections. It is important not only to provide adequate prenatal care, but also to carefully assess the mode of delivery for this population. Continuous, careful, and whole-process monitoring is critical for women who have had a previous cesarean section and opt for vaginal delivery. Clinicians should anticipate uterine rupture and be prepared for emergency cesarean section and blood transfusion at any moment to limit the risk of maternal mortality from uterine rupture.\nThe strength of our study is that the data were collected based on the national maternal death surveillance network and the underlying causes of all cases were determined by the national maternal death review committee, making the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage and cause-specific MMR accurate, reliable, and nationally representative. However, our study also has some limitations. First, because the MMR in China has been at a low level in recent years, a larger population needs to be included and evaluated to ensure data accuracy. The population covered by the NMCHSS needs to be expanded in the future. Second, data from surveillance systems inevitably suffer from underreporting and therefore should be adjusted according to the underreporting rate to obtain more accurate data. Given the lack of a specific underreporting rate for maternal deaths due to obstetric hemorrhage over the past years, it is not possible to adjust the observed data from the surveillance system in this study. Hence, there is a potential underestimation of the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage, but this does not affect the estimation of trends in rates.\nIn conclusion, the intervention practice in China in the past 20 years has proven that it is possible to quickly reduce the MMR due to obstetric hemorrhage. Clinicians and caregivers need to be aware that the MMR due to some specific causes, such as uterine rupture, has been at a plateau and have started to rise. China needs to build on the experience of high-income countries to develop more effective interventions to reduce maternal deaths due to obstetric hemorrhage, especially because of postpartum uterine atony and uterine rupture.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:47:44", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:48:07", "cost": 22.73}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:48:07", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:47:44"}

These surgical therapies include anterior cervical spine surgery (ACSS) including both anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion, anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, and artificial cervical disc replacement, which is the most widely used technique since it was proposed in 1955.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> The popularity of ACSS is advantageous due to minimal trauma and low bleeding observed in patients and can directly remove the compression caused by herniated discs and osteophytes. Nevertheless, since the deep gap front cervical vertebral body is small and adjoins the trachea, the postoperative hematoma is one of the most important complications in ACSS, resulting in dyspnea and can even threaten the lives of patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Thus, it is conventional to place a drainage tube when performing ACSS, which is conducive to emptying the bleeding from within the wound cavities and reducing the incidence of postoperative hematoma.\nDespite the advantages of inserting a drainage tube in ACSS, there are some drawbacks, especially in terms of imposing restrictions on the development of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) which was firstly proposed by Kehlet and coauthors通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> in 1997, a view which is still respected by many scholars worldwide today. First, the patients with drainage tubes may need to bed rest for around 1 to 3 days post-surgery, which can result in complications such as low back pain, urinary tract infections, and deep vein thrombosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Second, the insertion of a drainage tube may cause localised pain and scars in the placement area after surgery. Moreover, patients are prone to feelings of fear and anxiety in the drainage tube removal process during the perioperative period, thereby reducing the patient’s overall experience and satisfaction levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Therefore, placement of drainage is less beneficial in comparison to orthopedic \"no drainage\" concepts, which in turn is a vital part of the implementation of ERAS in the orthopedic departments.\nIn addition to the disadvantages observed with drainage, with the improvement of surgical techniques and advances in hemostasis materials, it has been accepted that modern operation times and intraoperative blood loss of ACSS has significantly decreased, as has the incidence of postoperative hematoma, in comparison to historical procedures. This provides the theoretical possibility, and increased safety for not inserting a drainage tube, thus providing us with new way of thinking that it may not be essential to insert drainage in ACSS patients. In order to confirm the feasibility of ACSS without drainage, we retrospectively analyzed the drainage volumes of 92 patients with drainage at normal pressure following single- or double-level ACSS in West China Hospital of Sichuan University from 2016 to 2017. The results indicated that in the case of sufficient hemostasis, 83.7% of patients’ postoperative drainage volume was less than 10 mL, whilst 94.6% produced volumes more than 30 mL. According to an expert consensus on the implementation of ERAS in ACSS,通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> the current standard drainage volume to removing tubing stands at less than 50 mL/day. Therefore, most of the above-mentioned patients theoretically reached the standard of \"no placement of drainage\" .\nSubsequently, we analyzed the data and concluded the key points of not inserting a drainage tube in ACSS . On one hand, preoperative clinical characteristics of patients such as poor-control hypertension, weakened blood coagulation, and multi-level surgery (exceeding double levels) are closely associated with increased postoperative drainage volumes, indicating that drainage should be placed in during surgery, a fact which should be noted before surgery. On the other hand, postoperative drainage volume in ACSS also depends on the surgical techniques and observations made by the surgeon(s) during operations. The main points regarding surgical techniques and observations were also made and could be seen as Best Practice. 1) Exposing the vertebral body through the intermuscular space using sharp dissection and avoiding excessively pulling a muscle, helps ensure no significant bleeding during the process of the disclosure. 2) Verify that there is no active bleeding or oozing of blood within the spinal canal and around implants after completing the process of decompression and implantation. 3) Ensure careful hemostasis and ensure that 1 to 2 minutes of observations are carried out following suturing of the longus colli, and wash the surgical zone with saline. 4) When the platysma has been sutured, reconfirm whether there is any active bleeding or oozing of blood before closing the incision. Notably, it is also necessary to place the drainage in when the operation takes more than 2 h if occurs cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurs.\nFurthermore, according to the aforementioned key points, since 2018, Professor Hao Liu’s team had stopped placing drainage tubes in patients during single- or double-level ACSS. In May 2020, we retrospectively collected and analyzed clinical data from 488 patients with the same baseline levels. A total of 236 patients underwent the \"no drainage tube\" ACSS, and none of them showed postoperative hematoma, highlighting this procedure may be safe, and it may be feasible cease placing drainage in ACSS patients if their postoperative drainage volumes are accurately evaluated. In addition, the clinical data of patients both with and without drainage were compared to each other. Although there were no significant differences in postoperative neurological functions and the incidence of dysphagia between the two groups, the time taken to get out of bed and be discharged from hospital care was significantly shorter in patients without drainage tubes compared to those with tubes inserted. However, the current standard we used to evaluate the placement of drainage in ACSS is still empirical and difficult to generalize. In addition, ACSS without drainage requires high levels of surgical technique and experience, which is not suitable for beginners.\nIn conclusion, based on these retrospective studies, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that not placing drainage in ACSS patients is safe and feasible under meticulous manipulation and strict evaluation of the patient’s postoperative drainage volumes. Moreover, patients without a drainage tube have significantly shorter bed rest and hospitalization periods, feel less pain and physical and psychological stress, have better experiences, and report higher satisfaction levels during the perioperative period. However, multi-factorial analysis of the influencing factors relating to postoperative drainage volume in ACSS should be undertaken in the future studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:15:22", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:15:30", "cost": 8.456}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:15:30", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:15:20"}

It is widely believed that genetic and environmental factors work together to cause hyperproliferation and dysregulated differentiation of keratinocytes (parakeratosis), which leads to thickening of the epidermis (acanthosis).通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Both innate and adaptive immune systems are involved in the dysregulated immune responses of psoriasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> The inflammatory cells that infiltrate the lesions primarily consist of dendritic cells, T cells, and neutrophils.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u> As the etiology of psoriasis is still unclear, the current treatment is far from satisfactory, and there is an urgent need to identify a more effective therapy for the disease.\nKeratin 17 (K17) is a type I intermediate filament that provides mechanical support for keratinocytes to maintain the functional integrity of the epidermis.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u> K17 expression is nearly undetectable in the normal epidermis but overexpressed in hyperproliferative states, such as psoriasis and wound healing.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7,8]</u> Recent studies have reported that K17 is far more than a cytoskeletal protein, noting its involvement in various diseases from dermatoses to cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Our research group has focused on the role of K17 in psoriasis for nearly two decades and determined that K17 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u> K17 has epitopes similar to those of the M6 Streptococcus protein in order to induce T cells to produce interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in psoriatic patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Under stress, keratinocytes are damaged or activated, and K17 epitopes are recognized and presented by dendritic cells or activated keratinocytes.

All of these factors constitute a K17/T cell/cytokine autoimmune loop that is involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Moreover, we found that K17 is the therapeutic target of several common drugs and strategies for treating psoriasis, including paeoniflorin, salvianolic acid B, and narrowband ultraviolet B irradiation.通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17,18]</u> Collectively, previous studies have fully elucidated that K17 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, and targeting K17 may serve as a potential treatment mechanism for the disease. However, few studies have discussed treating psoriasis by directly inhibiting K17 expression via gene therapy.\nIn the present study, we utilized BALB/c mice to establish imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis and then evaluated the efficacy of K17 small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the treatment of psoriasis. The results indicated that, compared to the mice treated with negative control (NC) siRNA, the K17 siRNA application significantly alleviated IMQ-induced psoriatic dermatitis, as evidenced by decreased ear symptoms and inflammatory infiltration. Moreover, keratinocyte differentiation was improved while proliferation was inhibited after applying K17 siRNA. Our study demonstrated that K17 siRNA may be an effective treatment mechanism for psoriasis.\nThe siRNAs specific for mouse K17 were designed and chemically synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The sequences were as follows: K17 siRNA1, sense 5′-GGGAGCAACAGUUAUUCCATT-3′, antisense 5′-UGGAAUAACUGUUGCUCCCTT-3′; K17 siRNA2, sense 5′-CUACAGCGCUUAUUACCAUTT-3′, antisense 5′-AUGGUAAUAAGCGCUGUAGTT-3′. The sequences for the scrambled NC siRNA were sense 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′ and antisense 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′.\nEight-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine of Fourth Military Medical University (Xi’an, China). All experimental procedures involving mice were performed in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Review Committee for the Use of Animals of Fourth Military Medical University. For the generation of psoriatic dermatitis in mice, we applied a 5% IMQ cream (Aldara; 3M Health Care Ltd. Loughborough, UK) topically on both ears of the mice. To evaluate the effect of K17 inhibition on the development of psoriasis, 2.5 nmol K17 siRNA was mixed with 2 μL Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and 5 mmol/L emulsion matrix and applied topically to the left ear of the mice every day for 7 days after applying IMQ. The right ear of the mice was treated with NC siRNA.\nEar thickness was measured with a microcaliper (Type 0-12.7; YUEQING JINGCHENG, China) at a fixed location 3 mm from the edge of the ear, and an average numerical reading was recorded. On day 11, the ears of IMQ-treated mice were cut off after euthanization with CO2, fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde for 8 to 12 h, and embedded in paraffin. Six-micrometer-thick sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The H&E-stained sections were scanned using the Hamamatsu Digital Pathology System, and epidermal thickness was measured using NDP.view software (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan).\nThe embedded ear skin samples of the mice were cut into 4-μm sections and stained with anti-mouse K16 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), K17 (Abcam), K1 (Abcam), K10 (Abcam), CD3 (Abcam), and Ly6G (Abcam), followed by staining with an appropriate Cyanine 3-conjugated secondary antibody (Abcam). Then, the cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 solution (Abcam) for an additional 15 min at 37°C. Finally, the images were captured with LSM 880 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).\nTotal RNA from ear skin tissues was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RT-qPCR was conducted using SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II (Takara, Japan) on a CFX384 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). All primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The β-actin was used as a reference transcript. The relative gene expression levels were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method. The primer sequences are listed below. All sequences were 5′-3′: IL-17A forward, CTCAGACTACCTCAACCGTTCC, reverse, ATGTG GTGGTCCAGCTTTCC; IL-22 forward, ATGAGTTT TTCCCTTATGGGGAC, reverse, GCTGGAAGTTGGACACCTCAA; IL-23p40 forward, GACCATCACTGTCAAAGAGTTTCTAGAT, reverse, AGGAAAGTCT TGTTTTTGAAATTTTTTAA; S100A9 forward, ACTC TTTAGCCTTGAAGAGCAAG, reverse, TTCTTGCTC AGGGTGTCAGG; CCL20 forward, CAGGCAGAAGCAAGCAACTAC, reverse, AGCTTCATCGGCCATCT GTC; CXCL1 forward, ACCCAAACCGAAGTCATAGC, reverse, ACAGGTGCCATCAGAGCAGT; β-actin forward, GTGACGTTGACATCCGTAAAGA, reverse, GCCGGACTCATCGT ACTCC.\nAll data in our study were obtained from at least three independent experiments and are presented as mean ± standard error. Data between 2 groups were analyzed with unpaired statistical analyses using the Student’s t-test, and comparisons between groups were performed using a one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. A P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California).\nTo explore whether local direct inhibition of K17 expression by specific siRNAs can treat psoriasis, eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were administered a 5% IMQ cream on both ears to induce psoriatic dermatitis every day for 10 days. To optimize the efficacy of the application method, we applied two well-designed K17 siRNAs (K17 siRNA1 and 2) alone or in combination. The combination is hereafter referred to as siRNA Mix, which is a mixture of K17 siRNA1 and K17 siRNA2 in equal quantities. From day 3 to day 10 as indicated, K17 siRNA1, 2, or mixed siRNA were applied to the left ears of the mice while the right ears were treated in parallel with negative control (NC siRNA) every day after IMQ application 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. Compared to that of the Blank group, the phenotype of IMQ-treated mice was significantly exacerbated, suggesting that the IMQ-induced psoriasis mouse model was successfully constructed. Moreover, the erythema and scales of the mice treated with K17 siRNA alone or in combination were significantly decreased compared to those of the mice treated with NC siRNA on day 10 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>. RT-qPCR analysis was performed to detect the knockdown effect of K17 siRNA in locally treated skin, and the results showed that K17 expression was significantly decreased by more than 50% after treatment with K17 siRNA (vs. NC siRNA, K17 siRNA1 group: t = 4.035, P = 0.0157; K17 siRNA2 group: t= 4.035, P= 0.0060; siRNA Mix group: t= 6.506, P= 0.0074) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1C]</u>. The dynamic ear thickness of the mice treated with K17 siRNA was significantly decreased compared to that of the mice treated with NC siRNA from day 6 to day 10 and peaked on day 10 (P < 0.05 vs. the Blank and NC siRNA groups). However, there was no difference in ear thickness from day 3 to day 6 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1D]</u>. Skin biopsies were performed on day 10, and examination of the H&E-stained sections showed that inflammatory cell infiltration in the dermis of the K17 siRNA-treated psoriatic mice was significantly decreased 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>. Epidermal thickness measured from the H&E-stained sections showed that epidermal hyperplasia in the K17 siRNA-treated mice was also significantly lower than that of the NC siRNA-treated group (vs. NC siRNA, K17 siRNA1 group: t = 12.75, P = 0.0002; K17 siRNA2 group: t= 15.20, P= 0.0001; siRNA Mix group: t= 11.08, P= 0.0004) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1E]</u>. However, there was no significant difference between the single use and combined use K17 siRNA-treated groups, as evidenced by the psoriatic indicators. These results indicated that local inhibition of K17 expression with K17 siRNA could alleviate the symptoms of psoriasis-like dermatitis induced by IMQ.\nK16 and K1/K10 are hyperproliferation- and differentiation-associated keratins, respectively, in keratinocytes.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> To determine whether K17 siRNA treatment might affect the expression of K16, K1, and K10 in psoriasis, we detected K16/K1/K10 expression levels by immunofluorescence analysis. We found that, consistent with previous reports, K17 was not detectable in a steady state but was overexpressed in psoriatic ear skin lesions. After the treatment of psoriasis lesions with K17 siRNA, including K17 siRNA1/2 and Mix, K17 expression was suppressed by approximately 50%, further confirming the interference effect (vs. NC siRNA, K17 siRNA1 group: t= 4.971, P= 0.0016; K17 siRNA2 group: t= 6.066, P= 0.0005; siRNA Mix group: t= 3.911, P = 0.0113) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2A and B]</u>. K16 expression, which is characteristic of proliferation, was also significantly inhibited in the K17 siRNA-treated group (vs. NC siRNA, K17 siRNA1 group: t= 4.156, P= 0.0043; K17 siRNA2 group: t= 2.834, P= 0.0253; siRNA Mix group: t = 2.734, P = 0.0250) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2A and C]</u>. The expression levels of K1/K10 in keratinocytes, which are characteristic of differentiation, were significantly increased after K17 siRNA treatment compared to those of control mice (vs. NC siRNA, K17 siRNA1 group: K1, t= 4.782, P= 0.0050; K10, t= 3.365, P= 0.0120; K17 siRNA2 group: K1, t= 4.104, P= 0.0093; K10, t= 4.168, P= 0.0042; siRNA Mix group: K1, t= 3.065, P= 0.0221; K10, t= 10.83, P < 0.0001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2A, D, and E]</u>. No differences were found among the K17 siRNA1, K17 siRNA2, and Mix groups. These data suggest that K17 siRNA can suppress the proliferation but promote the differentiation of keratinocytes.\nAs psoriasis lesions are characterized by T cell and neutrophil infiltration, we further detected CD3+ T cell and Ly6G+ neutrophil counts by immunofluorescence analysis. The results showed that the numbers of CD3+ T cells and Ly6G+ neutrophils were significantly increased in the IMQ- and NC siRNA-treated groups compared to the Blank group (vs. Blank, K17 siRNA1 group: CD3+ T cells, t= 5.839, P= 0.0011 and Ly6G+ neutrophils, t= 6.625, P = 0.0012; K17 siRNA2 group: CD3+ T cells, t = 3.767, P = 0.0093 and Ly6G+ neutrophils, t = 7.353, P = 0.0003; siRNA Mix group: CD3+ T cells, t = 3.232, P = 0.0231 and Ly6G+ neutrophils, t = 4.994, P= 0.0025). However, after K17 siRNA treatment, the numbers of both CD3+ T cells and Ly6G+ neutrophils in psoriatic lesions were significantly decreased compared to those in the group treated with NC siRNA (vs. the NC siRNA group, K17 siRNA1 group: CD3+ T cells, t = 9.549, P < 0.0001 and Ly6G+ neutrophils, t = 5.976, P = 0.0010; K17 siRNA2 group: CD3+ T cells, t = 8.079, P < 0.0001 and Ly6G+ neutrophils, t = 6.036, P = 0.0005; siRNA Mix group: CD3+ T cells, t= 6.651, P = 0.0002 and Ly6G+ neutrophils, t= 5.071, P = 0.0014) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3A-D]</u>. These results confirmed that suppressing K17 expression with K17 siRNA can decrease the infiltration of inflammatory cells and subsequently inhibit skin inflammatory responses upon IMQ application.\nIL-17, IL-22, IL-23, and chemokines, including CXCL1 and CCL20, are signature inflammatory cytokines in psoriatic lesions that have been shown to be involved in the excessive immune response in psoriasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,19]</u> Therefore, the ear skin lesions of mice were harvested for RT-qPCR analysis to determine cytokine expression levels. The results showed that the expression levels of IL-17, IL-22, and IL-23p40 were significantly lower in K17 siRNA-treated mice than in NC siRNA-treated mice (P < 0.05 vs. the NC siRNA group) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4A-C]</u>. We also analyzed the expression of S100A9, which is an important antimicrobial peptide overexpressed in psoriatic skin that has been suggested to play critical roles in psoriasis,通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> and found that S100A9 mRNA expression was significantly decreased after K17 siRNA treatment (vs. the NC siRNA group, K17 siRNA1 group: t= 9.169, P= 0.0008; K17 siRNA2 group: t = 3.464, P = 0.0405; siRNA Mix group: t = 11.21, P = 0.0004) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4D]</u>. Chemokines, including CCL20 and CXCL1, are important for the onset and maintenance of psoriasis. The results showed that the expression levels of CCL20 and CXCL1 were significantly decreased in K17 siRNA-treated mice compared to the control mice treated with NC siRNA (CCL20, K17 siRNA1/2 or Mix group: P < 0.0001; CXCL1, K17 siRNA1 group: t = 2.862, P = 0.0353; K17 siRNA2 group: t= 3.009, P= 0.0396; siRNA Mix group: t= 2.454, P = 0.0495) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4E and F]</u>. These data indicated that K17 siRNA application can ameliorate the inflammation of IMQ-induced psoriasis by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in the suppression of inflammatory responses.\nPsoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that is prone to clinical relapse. For some patients, it is a lifelong condition with serious physical and mental health consequences for themselves and their families.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,21]</u> The etiology of psoriasis is very complex and involves various factors, including heredity, immune dysfunction, endocrine disorder, and environmental factors.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a more effective treatment for psoriasis. Current research has identified an effective gene therapy targeting K17 for psoriasis. In this study, by applying K17 siRNA or NC siRNA to mice with IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis, we analyzed the characteristic indicators of psoriasis to evaluate inflammation severity. We discovered that topical K17 siRNA application can improve psoriatic inflammation. Upon treatment with K17 siRNA, the physical symptoms, epidermal hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell infiltration of the affected mice were significantly decreased compared to those of the control mice.\nK17 is a keratin family member, and its expression in keratinocytes represents a highly activated and proliferative stage under pathological conditions like those of psoriasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Increasing studies have demonstrated that K17 plays a critical role in the psoriasis maintenance, aggravation, and relapse. Our group has been investigating the associations between K17 and psoriasis and recently proposed a K17/T cell/cytokine positive feedback regulatory loop in psoriasis based on the latest findings.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> The K17 loop implies that K17 links aberrant keratinocyte proliferation, the production of psoriatic-related cytokines, and autoreactive T cells in this disease, which are key events in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Therefore, K17 may be an attractive target for treating psoriasis. The findings of this study showed that, as expected, inhibition of K17 expression significantly alleviated psoriatic inflammation.\nConsistent with our proposed K17 loop, K17 links aberrant keratinocyte proliferation with the production of psoriasis-related cytokines in psoriasis. Our results also indicated that inhibition of K17 expression can suppress the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, as evidenced by a reduction in K16 expression. We also found that the expression levels of chemokines CXCL1 and CCL20, which mainly recruit neutrophils and dendritic cells to local lesions, respectively, were both significantly decreased after inhibiting K17 expression. Recent accumulating evidence has clarified that K17 is not only a cytoskeletal protein but also a regulatory protein.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Thus, we hypothesized that the mechanism of suppressing K17 expression to improve inflammation might involve reducing the recruitment of neutrophils or dendritic cells to local lesions by decreasing the production of associated chemokines from keratinocytes. Further studies are needed to explore this concept.\nOver the past decade, RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a powerful tool for therapeutic gene silencing, as it offers the possibility to silence virtually any known pathology-causing gene with high selectivity and efficiency.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> RNAi technology has previously been explored as a treatment option for psoriasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24]</u> Studies have reported that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) small hairpin RNA, anti-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, anti-TNF-α siRNA, anti-IL-6, and anti-defensin beta 4 have been evaluated in a psoriasis xenograft transplantation model or the IMQ mouse model.通用删除6(英):<u>[23,25,26,27]</u> In the current study, we used K17 siRNA to treat IMQ-induced psoriatic dermatitis and observed a significant improvement in inflammation. Considering the specific expression of K17 in keratinocytes rather than circulatory distribution, siRNA targeting K17 may have a better effect in the treatment of psoriasis.\nThe efficacy of gene therapy for skin diseases depends on the use of effective pathways, delivery methods, and skin structural characteristics. In the current study, given the consideration of reducing the likelihood of local and systemic toxicity, we gave preference to topical application. To enhance the delivery of siRNA, we fully mixed liposomes (Lipofectamine 3000) and an emulsion matrix with K17 siRNA before application. The findings indicated that K17 siRNA1 and 2 alone or in combination significantly decreased the expression of K17, resulting in a marked improvement of IMQ-induced dermatitis, evidenced by significant alleviation of erythema and scales as well as reduction in epidermal thickness. The results are consistent with our previous study reporting topical treatment with liposome-encapsulated K17 siRNA in a psoriasis xenograft transplantation model.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Although we tested different psoriasis research models, we reached the same conclusion that K17 siRNA can relieve psoriatic inflammation, which further confirmed the potential of K17 siRNA to treat psoriasis. Compared to the previous study, we designed and screened two different K17 siRNAs with positive therapeutic effects.\nCollectively, the results of the present study further confirm the essential role of K17 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Anti-K17 gene therapy using siRNA can significantly ameliorate psoriatic inflammation. Therefore, targeting K17 may become a potential mechanism for the treatment of psoriasis in the near future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:10:14", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:11:01", "cost": 46.512}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:11:00", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:10:13"}

We conducted this study to document whether there is any correlation between age of the patient, time since injury and meniscal injury with short-term functional outcomes of arthroscopically assisted anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in Indian population presenting to a tertiary health care centre.\nWe conducted a prospective study on patients who underwent ACL reconstruction from October 2013 to February 2015. All patients presenting to the orthopaedic department with symptomatic ACL deficient knee between 0 and 18 years were included for the purpose of this study. Patients who had prior knee surgery, infection, associated posterior cruciate ligament injury, associated grade III collateral ligament injury, associated meniscal injury with more than two third of its diameter and more than grade one Kellegren-Lawrence arthritis were excluded from the study. Institute Ethics Committee approval was obtained for the study. Informed consent was obtained from the patients after explaining them the procedure. Forty-three patients were included for the purpose of this study during this period. All these patients underwent ACL reconstruction with either bone patellar tendon graft or quadrupled hamstring graft.\nPrior to surgery, all patients were subjected to standard ACL preoperative rehabilitation protocol, so that at the time of surgery all had full knee ROM without any knee effusion. Baseline data collected included age, sex, time since injury and mode of injury. Functional scores in the form of Lysholm score, IKDC subjective score and modified IKDC knee examination score were recorded.\nAll the patients underwent surgery under regional anesthesia. In operating room, examination under anesthesia was done to assess knee laxity. Under tourniquet, diagnostic arthroscopy was done for each patient. Meniscus status assessed and necessary procedure carried out in the form of meniscectomy or repair. The integrity of articular cartilage, ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and the intraarticular cavity was assessed. Then the appropriate graft was harvested using standard technique for each graft. The patellar tendon graft was harvested through a midline incision with the knee in 90-degree flexion. The central 1/3rd of the tendon or 10 mm was harvested whichever was smaller. Around 25 mm bony cut was made from the patella and 25 mm cut in the tibial tuberosity. The hamstring graft harvesting was done through a 3 cm incision anteromedially on the tibia starting approximately 4 cm distal to joint line and 3 cm medial to the tibial tuberosity. The sartorius fascia found here was carefully reflected to find the gracilis and semitendinosus tendons running deep to it. They were then harvested one by one using securing non-absorbable sutures and tendon stripper.\nThe grafts were then passed through drilled tunnels after preparation of the notch and secured with bioscrew (ArthrexInc, Florida, USA) in both femoral and tibial tunnels when bone patellar tendon graft was used. When quadrupled hamstrings were used, the graft was fixed with endobutton (Retrobutton, ArthrexInc, Florida, USA) for the femur and bioscrew for the tibia.\nPostoperatively, the knee was protected with a knee brace and rehabilitation was started as per standard protocol .删除4：<u>9</u> Patients were usually discharged at 5-6 days postoperatively. Suture removal was done on the 14th day. Then patients were regularly followed up every two weeks till six weeks and then monthly till six months. At 6 months postoperation, reassessment of Lysholm and modified IKDC scores was done. The results thus obtained were tabulated and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests (paired t-test for parametric variables, Chi-square tests for nonparametric variables). Association was studied with Pearson correlation.\nSix months follow-up was completed by only 33 patients at the time of study. Of the 33 patients who completed 6 months follow-up, 24 patients (72.7%) were in the age group of 18-30 years. Nine patients belonged to age group of 30-50 years (27.3%). Thirty-two patients were male and 1 was female. Twenty (60.6%) patients had left sided injury and 13 (39.4%) patients had right sided injury.\nSixteen (51.6%) patients were injured during a sports-related activity and volleyball injuries accounted for half of all sports-related injuries. Ten (32.2%) patients were injured in a road traffic accident (RTA). Five (16.1%) patients had a history of fall from height/into depth.\nThirty-two (96.9%) patients had complaints of instability of the knee, this being the most common symptom. Pain was the next most common symptom, with 29 (87.9%) patients complaining of it. Twenty-two (66.8%) patients complained of swelling of knee. Ten (30.3%) patients had complaints of knee locking episodes/catching and 7 (21.3%) patients complaining of crepitus on knee ROM/walking.\nFor convenience, patients were divided into 2 age groups: 18-30 years and 30-50 years. Twenty-four patients fell in the 18-30 years group and 9 in 30-50 years group. We looked for any difference in postoperative Lysholm and IKDC scores among the various age groups for any correlation.\nThe 18-30 years age group had improvement in mean Lysholm score of 61.62 preoperatively to 94.17 at six months postoperatively. The age group of 30-50 years had improvement in mean Lysholm score from 54.19 preoperatively to 91.87 at six months follow-up.

Seven (21.2%) patients had presented before 6 months post-injury. 12 (36.4%) patients presented between 6 months-1 year after injury. 14 (42.4%) patients presented after more than a year since the time of injury.\nAt 6 months, the mean Lysholm scores were 93.86 ± 3.024 for the group who presented <6 months post-injury, 92 ± 5.494 for the group who presented between 6 months and 1 year and 94.64 ± 3.104 for the group who presented after 1 year.

The p value for the differences of IKDC scores between these groups was 0.655 . Hence, there were no statistically significant differences between the scores of patients operated at various times since injury.\nTwelve (36.3%) patients had only medial meniscus injury. Three (9%) patients had only lateral meniscus injury. Five (15.4%) patients had both medial and lateral meniscus injuries.\nTaking Lysholm scores at 6 months into account, the group without meniscal injuries had a mean score of 94.23 ± 3.39 while the group with meniscal injuries had a mean score of 93.05 ± 4.63. Similarly taking IKDC scores at 6 months into account, the group without meniscal injuries had a mean score of 92.42 ± 1.77 while the group with meniscal injuries had a mean score of 90.29 ± 5.04.\nWe found the correlation between meniscus injuries and Lysholm and IKDC scores was not statistically significant (p value = 0.40 for Lysholm and 0.09 for IKDC scores).\nFive patients had pain at 6 months postoperatively. One patient had a stitch abscess on a protruding vicryl suture, which subsided with suture removal and clean dressing. Two patients had some persistent instability while climbing up albeit much lesser than preoperation. Both had anterior laxity upto 5 mm. However, both were clinically asymptomatic.\nThe results from our study shows that age of the patient, time since injury and associated meniscal injury less than two thirds of its diameter do not significantly influence the short term functional outcomes in ACL reconstruction.\nThe age distribution of patients in our study shows that ACL injuries are common in the physically active population group of 18-30 years, with diminishing incidence thereafter.\nMore than half of the patients (51.6%) were injured during a sporting activity. 32.2% were injured in a road traffic accident. Worldwide, however, 70.4% of ACL injuries are in sports-related activities .删除4：<u>4</u> These differences can be attributable to the lower prevalence of competitive sports in the population studied.\nAlso more often than not, females are more prone to ACL injuries as per the literature.删除4：<u>10</u> However, our study had only 1 female patient. 42.4% patients presented after more than 1-year post-injury. The earliest time gap observed was 4 months and the maximum delay observed was 9 years between injury and surgery. However, we found no statistically significant differences in the functional scores (Lysholm and IKDC) of these patients. Longer follow-up is required to detect degenerative changes when they set in. Our study was conducted in a population of predominantly rural background where still indigenous treatment techniques such as native bandaging hold a prominent place in injury management. Indian rural population usually present to modern tertiary healthcare facilities after some time of intentional neglect or after a period of native treatment. We had 2 patients (one in each group) who had at least 1 month of indigenous treatment before approaching our hospital. However at the time of surgery both patients were optimised to have full knee ROM without any effusion, so the postoperative function is not biased. In a study by Tow et al2 the time delay between injury to surgery ranged from 3 weeks to 35 months. In the study by Boonriong et al11 the hamstring group had a mean duration from injury to surgery of 9.5 months while the bone patellar tendon bone group had a mean delay of 18 months. Our study did not have any significant difference in time delay between these two groups. Also the scores between the various groups as per delay had no significant differences statistically.\nThe frequency of meniscal injuries ranges from 48% to 65% in association with ACL injuries, and more often medial meniscus is involved.删除4：<u>12</u> We also found 60.7% patients had associated meniscus injuries, with 36.3% patients having only medial meniscus injuries. 9% patients had only lateral meniscus injuries and 15.4% patients had both medial and lateral meniscus injuries. We found no statistical significance between meniscus injuries and postoperative scores (p value = 0.4 for Lysholm and 0.09 for IKDC score). Tow et al2 found that 58% of patients who had undergone meniscectomy exhibited poorly on IKDC scores while 31% without meniscectomy exhibited poorly on IKDC scores. These differences were statistically significant again showing that meniscectomy correlates with poorer scores. Sofu et al13 evaluated the results of meniscectomy on scores after ACL reconstruction. They found that after at least 2 years, meniscectomy correlates with poorer clinical outcomes as gauged by feeling of apprehension, poorer IKDC scores and delayed return to sports activities.\nIn our study, 5 patients reported knee pain 6 months postoperatively. 3 out of these 5 patients had a meniscus lesion, dealt with surgically by partial meniscectomy. 4 of them had presented later than 1-year post-injury. Also, 2 of these patients had osteoarthritic knee changes intraoperatively.\nThe main limitation of our study was the small sample size and short follow-up. Also we had only one patient more than forty years. Hence whether the outcome is affected by age cannot be commented in patients with age more than forty years.\nTo conclude, age of the patient, time since injury and associated meniscal injury do not influence the short term functional outcome scores in ACL reconstruction. A larger study with longer follow-up could probably shed more light on the role of these variables.\nSupplementary data related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2017.10.002.\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2017.10.002</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "通用删除1(英):(p = 0.339, ", "content": "【0】Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is one of the commonest injuries dealt with in sports trauma.

All these patients underwent ACL reconstruction with either bone patellar tendon graft or quadrupled hamstring graft.\nPrior to surgery, all patients were subjected to standard ACL preoperative rehabilitation protocol, so that at the time of surgery all had full knee ROM without any knee effusion. Baseline data collected included age, sex, time since injury and mode of injury. Functional scores in the form of Lysholm score, IKDC subjective score and modified IKDC knee examination score were recorded.\nAll the patients underwent surgery under regional anesthesia. In operating room, examination under anesthesia was done to assess knee laxity. Under tourniquet, diagnostic arthroscopy was done for each patient. Meniscus status assessed and necessary procedure carried out in the form of meniscectomy or repair. The integrity of articular cartilage, ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and the intraarticular cavity was assessed. Then the appropriate graft was harvested using standard technique for each graft. The patellar tendon graft was harvested through a midline incision with the knee in 90-degree flexion. The central 1/3rd of the tendon or 10 mm was harvested whichever was smaller. Around 25 mm bony cut was made from the patella and 25 mm cut in the tibial tuberosity. The hamstring graft harvesting was done through a 3 cm incision anteromedially on the tibia starting approximately 4 cm distal to joint line and 3 cm medial to the tibial tuberosity. The sartorius fascia found here was carefully reflected to find the gracilis and semitendinosus tendons running deep to it. They were then harvested one by one using securing non-absorbable sutures and tendon stripper.\nThe grafts were then passed through drilled tunnels after preparation of the notch and secured with bioscrew (ArthrexInc, Florida, USA) in both femoral and tibial tunnels when bone patellar tendon graft was used. When quadrupled hamstrings were used, the graft was fixed with endobutton (Retrobutton, ArthrexInc, Florida, USA) for the femur and bioscrew for the tibia.\nPostoperatively, the knee was protected with a knee brace and rehabilitation was started as per standard protocol .删除4：<u>9</u> Patients were usually discharged at 5-6 days postoperatively. Suture removal was done on the 14th day. Then patients were regularly followed up every two weeks till six weeks and then monthly till six months. At 6 months postoperation, reassessment of Lysholm and modified IKDC scores was done. The results thus obtained were tabulated and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests (paired t-test for parametric variables, Chi-square tests for nonparametric variables). Association was studied with Pearson correlation.\nSix months follow-up was completed by only 33 patients at the time of study. Of the 33 patients who completed 6 months follow-up, 24 patients (72.7%) were in the age group of 18-30 years. Nine patients belonged to age group of 30-50 years (27.3%). Thirty-two patients were male and 1 was female. Twenty (60.6%) patients had left sided injury and 13 (39.4%) patients had right sided injury.\nSixteen (51.6%) patients were injured during a sports-related activity and volleyball injuries accounted for half of all sports-related injuries. Ten (32.2%) patients were injured in a road traffic accident (RTA). Five (16.1%) patients had a history of fall from height/into depth.\nThirty-two (96.9%) patients had complaints of instability of the knee, this being the most common symptom. Pain was the next most common symptom, with 29 (87.9%) patients complaining of it. Twenty-two (66.8%) patients complained of swelling of knee. Ten (30.3%) patients had complaints of knee locking episodes/catching and 7 (21.3%) patients complaining of crepitus on knee ROM/walking.\nFor convenience, patients were divided into 2 age groups: 18-30 years and 30-50 years. Twenty-four patients fell in the 18-30 years group and 9 in 30-50 years group. We looked for any difference in postoperative Lysholm and IKDC scores among the various age groups for any correlation.\nThe 18-30 years age group had improvement in mean Lysholm score of 61.62 preoperatively to 94.17 at six months postoperatively. The age group of 30-50 years had improvement in mean Lysholm score from 54.19 preoperatively to 91.87 at six months follow-up.

Seven (21.2%) patients had presented before 6 months post-injury. 12 (36.4%) patients presented between 6 months-1 year after injury. 14 (42.4%) patients presented after more than a year since the time of injury.\nAt 6 months, the mean Lysholm scores were 93.86 ± 3.024 for the group who presented <6 months post-injury, 92 ± 5.494 for the group who presented between 6 months and 1 year and 94.64 ± 3.104 for the group who presented after 1 year.

The p value for the differences of IKDC scores between these groups was 0.655 . Hence, there were no statistically significant differences between the scores of patients operated at various times since injury.\nTwelve (36.3%) patients had only medial meniscus injury. Three (9%) patients had only lateral meniscus injury. Five (15.4%) patients had both medial and lateral meniscus injuries.\nTaking Lysholm scores at 6 months into account, the group without meniscal injuries had a mean score of 94.23 ± 3.39 while the group with meniscal injuries had a mean score of 93.05 ± 4.63. Similarly taking IKDC scores at 6 months into account, the group without meniscal injuries had a mean score of 92.42 ± 1.77 while the group with meniscal injuries had a mean score of 90.29 ± 5.04.\nWe found the correlation between meniscus injuries and Lysholm and IKDC scores was not statistically significant (p value = 0.40 for Lysholm and 0.09 for IKDC scores).\nFive patients had pain at 6 months postoperatively. One patient had a stitch abscess on a protruding vicryl suture, which subsided with suture removal and clean dressing. Two patients had some persistent instability while climbing up albeit much lesser than preoperation. Both had anterior laxity upto 5 mm. However, both were clinically asymptomatic.\nThe results from our study shows that age of the patient, time since injury and associated meniscal injury less than two thirds of its diameter do not significantly influence the short term functional outcomes in ACL reconstruction.\nThe age distribution of patients in our study shows that ACL injuries are common in the physically active population group of 18-30 years, with diminishing incidence thereafter.\nMore than half of the patients (51.6%) were injured during a sporting activity. 32.2% were injured in a road traffic accident. Worldwide, however, 70.4% of ACL injuries are in sports-related activities .删除4：<u>4</u> These differences can be attributable to the lower prevalence of competitive sports in the population studied.\nAlso more often than not, females are more prone to ACL injuries as per the literature.删除4：<u>10</u> However, our study had only 1 female patient. 42.4% patients presented after more than 1-year post-injury. The earliest time gap observed was 4 months and the maximum delay observed was 9 years between injury and surgery. However, we found no statistically significant differences in the functional scores (Lysholm and IKDC) of these patients. Longer follow-up is required to detect degenerative changes when they set in. Our study was conducted in a population of predominantly rural background where still indigenous treatment techniques such as native bandaging hold a prominent place in injury management. Indian rural population usually present to modern tertiary healthcare facilities after some time of intentional neglect or after a period of native treatment. We had 2 patients (one in each group) who had at least 1 month of indigenous treatment before approaching our hospital. However at the time of surgery both patients were optimised to have full knee ROM without any effusion, so the postoperative function is not biased. In a study by Tow et al2 the time delay between injury to surgery ranged from 3 weeks to 35 months. In the study by Boonriong et al11 the hamstring group had a mean duration from injury to surgery of 9.5 months while the bone patellar tendon bone group had a mean delay of 18 months. Our study did not have any significant difference in time delay between these two groups. Also the scores between the various groups as per delay had no significant differences statistically.\nThe frequency of meniscal injuries ranges from 48% to 65% in association with ACL injuries, and more often medial meniscus is involved.删除4：<u>12</u> We also found 60.7% patients had associated meniscus injuries, with 36.3% patients having only medial meniscus injuries. 9% patients had only lateral meniscus injuries and 15.4% patients had both medial and lateral meniscus injuries. We found no statistical significance between meniscus injuries and postoperative scores (p value = 0.4 for Lysholm and 0.09 for IKDC score). Tow et al2 found that 58% of patients who had undergone meniscectomy exhibited poorly on IKDC scores while 31% without meniscectomy exhibited poorly on IKDC scores. These differences were statistically significant again showing that meniscectomy correlates with poorer scores. Sofu et al13 evaluated the results of meniscectomy on scores after ACL reconstruction. They found that after at least 2 years, meniscectomy correlates with poorer clinical outcomes as gauged by feeling of apprehension, poorer IKDC scores and delayed return to sports activities.\nIn our study, 5 patients reported knee pain 6 months postoperatively. 3 out of these 5 patients had a meniscus lesion, dealt with surgically by partial meniscectomy. 4 of them had presented later than 1-year post-injury. Also, 2 of these patients had osteoarthritic knee changes intraoperatively.\nThe main limitation of our study was the small sample size and short follow-up. Also we had only one patient more than forty years. Hence whether the outcome is affected by age cannot be commented in patients with age more than forty years.\nTo conclude, age of the patient, time since injury and associated meniscal injury do not influence the short term functional outcome scores in ACL reconstruction. A larger study with longer follow-up could probably shed more light on the role of these variables.\nSupplementary data related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2017.10.002.\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2017.10.002</u>", "index": 7091, "show": true, "start": 7091, "end": 7112, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "通用删除1(英):(p = 0.138,"}, {"text": "Supplementary data related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2017.10.002.\n\nPeer review under responsibility of Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University.删除6：\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2017.10.002", "content": "【0】Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is one of the commonest injuries dealt with in sports trauma.

The standard treatment of an ACL deficient knee is an intra-articular reconstruction, of which the quadrupled hamstring graft and the bone-patellar-tendon-bone graft are the two most commonly used methods. Several previous studies demonstrated no difference in the functional outcomes of the two grafts.删除4：<u>2,3,4</u> Functional outcome post-ACL reconstruction depends on demographic, psychologic, intra-operative and postoperative factors. Little has been discussed in the literature regarding the patient and injury-related factors and their association with functional outcomes.

The present study aimed to examine the optimal time for human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBCs) transplantation after myocardial infarction (MI).Methods The animals underwent MI by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and received an intravenous injection of equal volumes of HUCBCs or phosphate buffered saline at days 1,5,10 and 30 after MI. HUCBCs were detected by immunostaining against human human leucocyte antigen (HLA). Cardiac function, histological analysis and measurement of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were performed 4 weeks after cell transplantation. Results HUCBCs transplantation could improve cardiac function in rats that received transplantation at 5 and 10 days after MI. The best benefit was achieved in rats that received cells at 10-day after MI. Survival of engrafted HUCBCs, angiogenesis and VEGF expression were more obvious in the 10-day transplantation group than in the other transplantation groups. No evidence of cardiomyocyte regeneration was detected in any transplanted rats. Conclusions HUCBCs transplantation could improve cardiac function in rats that received HUCBCs at days 5 and 10 after MI with the optimal time for transplantation being 10 days post MI. Angiogenesis, but not cardiomyocyte regeneration, played a key role in the cardiac function improvement。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:13:30", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:13:40", "cost": 10.859}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:13:40", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:13:29"}

It accounts for nearly 500,000 deaths annually in the USA and Europe.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3]</u> Conventionally, CA is categorized as cardiac and noncardiac origin. Unless it is caused by asphyxia, trauma, or any other noncardiogenic disease, it is presumed to be cardiac origin. The exact causes of many CA cases are unknown, and the rate of survival is still low.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Venous thromboembolism has a high incidence in the world.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u> Studies from Western Europe, North America, Australia, and Southern Latin America (Argentina) yielded consistent results with annual incidences ranging from 0.75 to 2.69 per 1000 individuals in the population.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Thrombosis from the deep venous system could block the pulmonary artery which leads to very serious consequences, especially high-risk pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) which is an important reason for CA.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u> It may contribute to 8–13% of unexplained CA cases,通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u> which may be potentially reversible processes.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>\nPTE has impacts on pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange.

The patient of CA caused by PTE is difficult to rescue because of diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. There are no diagnostic or prognostic tests currently available for detecting and tracking PTE except image.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,14]</u> Previous studies have focused more on nonfatal PE and the diagnosis and treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension,通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> less involved in the occurrence of CA caused by PTE. The dynamic pathogenesis and pathophysiology of lung function of CA caused by PTE are still not very clear.\nIn view of these, we designed this experiment, a CA porcine model caused by PTE, to investigate the dynamic characteristics of pulmonary function in postresuscitation after thrombolytic treatment.\n删除3：<u>This study was approved by the Capital Medical University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Institutional protocol number: 2010-D-013) and the treatments for animal were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 通用删除1(英):<u>(NIH Publications No. 8023. revised 1978)</u>. We have taken all steps to minimize the animal’s pain and suffering.</u>\nTwenty-four castrated Beijing Landrace male pigs aging 10–12 weeks with an average weight of 30 ± 2 kg were used in this study. Animals were fasted overnight but had free access to water. After premedication with intramuscular midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) and atropine (1 mg), anesthesia was induced by intravenous (IV) bolus of propofol (2 mg/kg) and fentanyl (5 µg/kg), and maintained with continuous IV infusion of pentobarbital (8 mg·kg−1·h−1) and fentanyl (5 µg·kg−1·h−1). Animals were intubated by a cuffed 6.5 mm endotracheal tube and ventilated by a volume-controlled ventilator (Evita 4, Drager Medical, Lubeck, Germany) with tidal volume of 8 ml/kg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths/min with 30% oxygen. End-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (PetCO2) was measured with an in-line mainstream infrared capnograph (CO2SMO Plus Monitor; Respironics Inc. Murrysville, PA, USA). PetCO2 was maintained between 35 and 45 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) by adjusting respiratory parameters before inducing CA. Room temperature was adjusted to 27°C.\nA 5-French (Fr) arterial catheter (Pulsiocath PV2015L20, PULSION Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) was inserted into the left femoral artery; a 5-Fr central venous catheter (ARROWg + ard Blue Central Venous Catheters; Arrow International, Inc. USA) was placed into the left femoral vein. They were connected to a PiCCO device (PULSION Medical Systems, Munich, Germany). A Swan-Ganz catheter (Swan-Ganz CCO mbo CCO/SvO2 7.5 Fr; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) was advanced to the right external jugular vein and flow directed into the pulmonary artery. A large bore catheter (diameter 1 cm) was inserted into the right ventricle through the left external jugular vein for injecting blood clots.\nFor the embolus preparation, 50 ml venous blood was drawn into a 50 ml syringe, and 50 units lyophilizing thrombin solution was added into the syringe. Then, the blood was left for half an hour at room temperature to get a stable, gelatinous clot. The clot was fragmented into emboli which were 1.5 cm in diameter. 10–15 ml of thrombi was suspended in saline solution which was placed in a 50 ml syringe.\nThe animals were stabilized for 1 h before beginning the experiment. Then, the thrombi were injected into pulmonary artery through the large bore catheter within 1 min until circulation arrest occurred which presented as systolic aortic pressure <30 mmHg.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> After 2 min of untreated CA, the pigs were treated with recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (50 mg) (Alteplase, Boehringer Ingelheim, Shanghai, China).通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed and the compression-to-ventilation ratio was 30:2; ventilation was performed using a bag respirator with room air. Epinephrine (0.02 mg/kg) was given intravenously followed by CPR. If ventricular fibrillation occurred, defibrillation shock was performed at 150 J. If the defibrillation was unsuccessful, after each 2 min of CPR, a 10 s pause was interjected to prepare for the next defibrillation attempt. The electrocardiogram and the quality of chest compressions were monitored by a HeartStart MRx monitor/defibrillator (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Holland) with Q-CPR technology. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was defined as the presence of an organized rhythm with a mean aortic pressure of ≥60 mmHg maintained more than 10 consecutive min.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>\nAfter successful resuscitation, the pigs underwent a 6 h intensive care period and mechanical ventilation was resumed with the same setting as before CA. At the end of the study, the pigs were euthanized with an IV bolus of propofol 60 mg and then 10 mol/L potassium chloride.\nHigh-probability ventilation-perfusion lung scans were performed at baseline and 4 h after ROSC for the surviving animal. Images were acquired with a 128 × 128 dual-head gamma camera (Helix; Elgems, Haifa, Israel). A total of 740 MBq 99mTC aerosols were inspired through a closed delivery system by tracheal intubation and ventilation images were obtained. Then, 550 MBq 99mTc was injected through the jugular vein, and perfusion images were obtained.\nHeart rate, blood pressure, central venous pressure, electrocardiogram, and blood temperature were monitored (M8001A, Philips Medizin Systeme Boeblingen GmbH, Germany). Arterial blood samples were drawn for blood gas analyses (GEM Premier 3000 Blood Gas Analyzer; Instrumentation Laboratory, Lexington, MA, USA). Oxygenation index (OI), respiratory index (RI), and lactate were derived from arterial blood gas analysis. Oxygen delivery (DO2) was calculated from cardiac index and arterial oxygen content (CaO2). Dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) and airway resistance (Raw) were got from ventilator (Evita 4, Drager Medical, Germany). Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) and pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) were obtained from a PiCCO device (PULSION Medical Systems, Munich, Germany). PetCO2 was measured using an in-line mainstream infrared capnograph (CO2SMO Plus Monitor; Respironics Inc. Murrysville, PA, USA). Moreover, ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio was calculated. All the above-mentioned parameters were registered at baseline, ROSC immediately, and 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h after ROSC. After the pigs were euthanized, its lung was performed with conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining and blinded histopathology evaluation.\nData distributed normally were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Continuous variables of surviving animal with normal distribution were compared by repeated measures analysis of variance. Moreover, the Bonferroni was used for adjustment of multiple comparisons. All P values were two-tailed and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19.0 statistics software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).\nAll of the 24 animals achieved CA after thrombi (10–15 ml) injection, and 14 (58.3%) animals reached ROSC, among which 3 survived after 1 h and 11 (45.8%) survived after 6 h.\nAll pigs had high-probability ventilation-perfusion lung scans before experiments, and pigs which survived 6 h performed the scans again at 4 h after ROSC. At baseline, 99mTc was distributed well into the alveoli and capillaries of lungs 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a and Figure 1b]</u>.

The Cdyn decreased after resuscitation and showed significant difference at ROSC immediately and 1 h after ROSC compared with baseline (P < 0.05). The OI decreased significantly at any time after ROSC (P < 0.05). EVLWI and PVPI showed significantly different at ROSC immediately compared with baseline and 1h after ROSC (P < 0.05); PVPI at ROSC immediately was also different from 6 h after ROSC (P < 0.05). The Raw increased significantly at ROSC immediately and 1 h after ROSC (P < 0.05). RI also increased after ROSC and showed significantly different among baseline, ROSC immediately, and 2 h after ROSC (P < 0.05). DO2 decreased at ROSC immediately compared to baseline (P < 0.05).\nLung function analysis of surviving pigs\n删除重复语句：<u>Lung function analysis of surviving pigs</u>\n1 cmH2O = 0.098 kPa; 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa. *P<0.05 versus baseline; †P<0.05 versus ROSC immediately. Raw: Airway resistance; OI: Oxygenation index; RI: Respiratory index; DO2: Oxygen delivery; Cdyn: Dynamic lung compliance; EVLWI: Extravascular lung water index; PVPI: Pulmonary vascular permeability index; ROSC: Return of spontaneous circulation.\nPulmonary infarction was found in the lung specimen. Very significant histopathologic lung injuries were found after ROSC: interalveolar septum thickening, bleeding and inflammatory cell infiltration in interalveolar septum, fibrin effusion and bleeding in alveoli, and hemagglutination in pulmonary artery 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>.\nCA is one of the most severe clinical heart emergencies, to which high-risk PTE plays an important role as a noncardiogenic cause. Many CA deaths were attributed to cardiac origins except those patients with deep vein thrombosis, oral contraceptives, thrombophilia or pulmonary hypertension, and increased right ventricular found with ultrasound were suspected to be caused by PTE, and those who were survival after CPR with thrombolysis therapy were diagnosed as PTE. Data of the lung function of patients with PTE have been ongoing for a long time通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20,21]</u> and also the data of heart arrest.通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23]</u> However, the study about CPR with thrombolysis of CA caused by PTE was reported rarely. Based on this, we performed CPR with thrombolysis in a CA porcine model caused by PTE to investigate the success rate of ROSC, short-time survival rate, and the pulmonary function variations.\nIn our study, success rate of ROSC and 6 h survival rate were 58.3% and 45.8%, respectively, which demonstrated that the CPR with thrombolysis was an effective measure to the CA caused by PTE. Lung infarction in specimen and hemagglutination in pulmonary artery in histopathology which was a sign of thrombosis were found in animals which were survivals until 6 h after ROSC; Cdyn, OI, and DO2 deteriorated significantly; Raw and RI increased significantly; V/Q ratio increased significantly which demonstrated dead space ventilation and pulmonary shunt; lung ventilation/perfusion scans showed mismatches at 4 h after ROSC which demonstrated perfusion defect; EVLWI and PVPI decreased significantly at ROSC immediately compared to baseline, and compared to ROSC immediately, they increased significantly at 1 h after ROSC; all above indicated that pulmonary dysfunction remained abnormal after ROSC that provided theoretical basis for anticoagulation after ROSC.\nThe dysfunctions of gas delivery and exchange are the studying focuses on treatment of postresuscitation,通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25]</u> to which V/Q ratio, oxygen transport, and oxygen utilization are crucial factors. The Raw was a transient increase which was different from CA model caused by ventricular fibrillation.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> It may attribute to platelet aggregation, endothelial cell injury, release of inflammatory mediators such as serotonin, histamine, bradykinin, platelet activating factor, and endothelin which could cause bronchial smooth muscle contraction. The EVLWI and PVPI are predicators for the acute lung injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27,28]</u> EVLW refers to the fluid within the lung but outside the vascular compartment. Because of the obstruction of pulmonary circulation and the pulmonary vasoconstriction which was caused by hypoxia, in our study, the EVLWI showed decrease significantly at ROSC immediately. After 1 h after ROSC, the EVLWI increased abnormally which may be because of elevated hydrostatic pressure caused by pulmonary circulation recovery and pulmonary vascular permeability attributed to hypoxia and acidosis, respectively.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> PVPI is calculated as the ratio between EVLWI and the pulmonary blood volume. It is found to be higher in ARDS and ALI than in hydrostatic lung edema. It may help differentiate between hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic lung edema.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,30]</u> In the histopathology, we found bleeding and inflammatory cell infiltration in interalveolar septum, fibrin effusion, and bleeding in alveoli. Hence, the PVPI variation may be because of not only permeability of the alveolocapillary barrier and lung inflammation but also the integrity of the lymph drainage and alveolar fluid clearance which may be involved in PTE.\nPost-CA syndrome has association with high mortality because of not only poor neurological outcome and cardiac dysfunction but also respiratory dysfunction. After recovery of pulmonary circulation, lung injury simultaneously became an important issue. We observed the surviving animals from ROSC immediately to 6 h after ROSC. The Cydn decreased from 26.72 ± 2.20 to 20.38 ± 1.31 ml/mmHg (1 h after ROSC), Raw increased form 12.72 ± 2.12 to 17.16 ± 2.24 cmH2O·L−1·s−1 1 h after ROSC (1 cmH2O = 0.098 kPa), and OI decreased from 473.97 ± 23.84 to 245.15 ± 34.64 mmHg 6 h after ROSC. Pulmonary dysfunction remained for a period after ROSC which may contribute to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> Lung is the target organ of PTE, according to whose pathophysiology it is essential to make the appropriate therapeutic measures. Inappropriate mechanical ventilator settings could do harm to the lung. Protective mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes is standard of care for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> and also is associated with a lower risk of development of pulmonary complications in patients without ARDS.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> In our study, EVLWI at 1 h after ROSC increased significantly. Positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) has a beneficial effect on pulmonary edema. PPV could reduce hypoxemic-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and decrease metabolic demand. Former studies have shown that the application of positive end-expiratory pressure could increase the alveolar fluid clearance rate and decrease the EVLWI.通用删除6(英):<u>[34,35]</u>\nThere were still limitations in our study. First, the injected thrombosis size was large; thrombi quantities were different among pigs. Second, the CPR was manually performed, its quality could not be 100% consistent, even by an independent, well-trained experimenter and monitored by Q-CPR technology. Third, the success rate of ROSC was relatively low. Fourth, the lung anatomy of pig is different from human.\nIn conclusion, the variations of lung function in CA caused by PTE are different from those by cardiogenic diseases. Moreover, lung dysfunction remains abnormal significantly even after CPR with thrombolysis therapy; it is essential to continue anticoagulation and symptomatic treatment after ROSC.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81372025)</u> and the 2015 Annual Special Cultivation and Development Project for Technology Innovation Base of Beijing Key Laboratory of Cardiopulmonary Cerebral Resuscitation 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. Z151100001615056)</u>.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:02:53", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:03:46", "cost": 52.819}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:03:45", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:02:52"}

Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is now widely used for the treatment of atherosclerotic lesions in various arteries. Restenosis is a major concern following angioplasty, and yet with no good solutions. Previous experimental studies suggested that there is an association between VV and atherosclerotic plaque formation and intimal hyperplasia. As occlusion of VV correlates well with neointima formation, but inhibition of VV neovascularization correlates with reduced plaque growth,通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> VV may play several different roles in different phases of atherosclerosis or postangioplasty restenosis. The causative mechanism is still unclear.\nMeng et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> described the postangioplasty change of VV in an animal experiment, and reported that double-injured arteries had a greater number of VV, increased luminal surface, an elevation in the intima/media ratio, an accumulation of macrophages and smooth muscle cells in the intima, but decreased VV density, as compared to sham or single-injured arteries. While a previous study showed similar results, but increased VV density after angioplasty,通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> the differences in VV density may be due to the different stages of restenosis as the authors argued. In the Meng’s study, low VV density was observed at an early phase of restenosis just 4 weeks after angioplasty, as indicated by a lack of severe intimal hyperplasia, which is not long enough for a complete remodeling of the injured area. Lower VV density with increased sheer VV number implies that intimal growth surpassed the VV neovascularization. Low VV density correlates with hypoxia, oxidative stress and microinflammation,通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> thus may lead to intimal growth and further VV neovascularization. On the other hand, it is also possible that the low VV density is caused by intimal hyperplasia, and further VV neovascularization is induced by hypoxia and oxidative stress. VV neovascularization can not only serve as a compensatory mechanism for the delivery of more oxygen and nutrients to the injured vessel walls, but also function as a conduit for macrophages or inflammatory factor infiltration that promotes restenosis. Anyhow, all we have now are all associational evidence, the full mechanism and the real causative role of VV in different phases of atherosclerosis or restenosis is not yet known. Meng et al. provided interesting new evidence on VV function, suggesting that modifying VV growth could provide therapeutic effects.

At present, most domestic studies use questionnaires to set up a self-assessment Likert 5-level item for overall job satisfaction rate to assess job satisfaction. These surveys on job satisfaction rate in different scales, different regions and different hospital levels show that the satisfaction rate ranges from 25.1% to 52%通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u>. Lower job satisfaction rate could affect the retention of health professional and the quality of medical services, leading to poor patient prognosis通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. China currently lacks a continuous survey assessment of job satisfaction rates wih large representative sample across the country. This study is based on data from the China Healthcare Improvement Evaluation Survey(CHIES) in 2018—2019 for two consecutive years. We describes the job satisfaction rate of doctors and nurses in the sample hospitals.\nThe data of this study are based on the surveys of health professional in the CHIES in 2018(the third survey) and 2019(the fourth survey). The survey was conducted in 136 major tertiary public hospitals in 31 provinces across the country, including 93 provincial hospitals and 43university teaching hospitals.\nAfter data cleaning and deleting the questionnaires filled by non-clinical departments such as administrative logistics and questionnaires with obvious logical errors, a total of 99,218 valid questionnaires were obtained. The effective response questionnaire for doctors was 44,075 and the effective response questionnaire for nurses was 55,143 in both survey years.\nDoctors and nurses of each survey hospital were stratified and proportionally sampled according to their professional levels, each taking 130~150 samples. For medical institutions with a total of less than 300 doctors and nurses, all health professional who meet the survey requirements should participate in the survey.\nThe health professional survey uses a uniform medical survey questionnaire which set up in the online survey system of \"Healthy China\" WeChat application. The sampled medical institutions organized sampled health professional to use personal smartphones to fill out questionnaires. All answered questionnaire data were sent to a secured account guarded by the government portal. Members of the local expert groups are responsible for answering questions and guidance at the hospital site.\nBecause only the evaluation items for the job satisfaction rate were set up in the 2018 and 2019 surveys, so the research uses the 2018 and 2019 two-year questionnaire entries as \"Overall, I am satisfied with the job I am currently doing\" Likert level 5 entries(there are\" very dissatisfied\" ,\" unsatisfied\" ,\" general\" ,\" satisfied\" and\" very satisfied\" 5 options) to measure the overall job satisfaction rate of medical staff. Those who responded as \"very satisfied\" and \"satisfied\" were defined as \"satisfactory\" ; those who responded as \"unsatisfied\" and \"very dissatisfied\" were defined as \"unsatisfied\" ; those who responded as \"fair\" were defined as \" general\" . The percentage of the frequency that is finally defined as \"satisfactory\" is used to measure the satisfaction rate.\nDescriptive analysis of the distribution of different sociodemographic characteristics of health professionaland the attitude distribution to \"Overall, I am satisfied with the work I am currently doing\" . The data obtained were statistically processed and analyzed with Excel, SPSS 25.0.\nComparing the results of the two evaluations, the overall satisfaction rate of health professionals was 42.7% in 2018 and 47.8% in 2019, which was increased by 5.1%. In both years, nurses were generally more satisfied with their job that the doctors; the differences were, 14.1% in 2018 and 11.4% in 2019, respectively. However, doctors had more improvement on their job satisfaction during the past two years(7.1%) than that of nurses(4.4%).\nTable 1 shows that the regions with the highest and lowest doctor satisfaction rates for two consecutive years are the same, with the highest in the east and the lowest in the west. Although the satisfaction rate of doctors in the eastern, central, and western regions has increased over the past two years, the level of satisfaction rates has hovered between 38%~43%.\nThe satisfaction rate of doctors in different region and hospital type\n删除重复语句：<u>The satisfaction rate of doctors in different region and hospital type</u>\nBy hospital type, although doctors in general hospitals and Maternal and Child hospitals were lower than those in TCM hospitals in 2018, the satisfaction rate of doctors in Maternal and Child hospitals increased the fastest in two years(increased by 9.9% in 2018—2019), then caught up with the TCM hospital. The degree of change in the central region(8.7%) was higher than in the east and west.\nThe three departments with the lowest doctor satisfaction rates in 2018 were pediatrics(27.1%), emergency department(28.9%), and internal medicine(32.4%). The three departments with the lowest doctor satisfaction rates in 2019 were anesthesiology(37.2%), pediatrics(37.6%), and internal medicine(38.1%). Over the two years, the overall satisfaction rate of emergency doctors increased the most (17.3%).\nTable 2 shows that the satisfaction rate of nurses in the eastern region is the highest in two years and the increase is the highest(5.4%), while the western region is the lowest in two years. Less than half of clinical nurses are satisfied with their work.\nThe satisfaction rate of nurses in different region and hospital type\n删除重复语句：<u>The satisfaction rate of nurses in different region and hospital type</u>\nBy hospital type, the satisfaction rate of nurses is the highest in general hospitals for two consecutive years; the satisfaction rates of nurses in general hospitals and Maternal and Child hospitals have increased. Although the nurse satisfaction rate was the lowest in Maternal and Child hospitals in 2018(45.5%) and the same situation as doctors in the same year, the increase was the largest in 2019 (6.6%). In contrast, the rate of TCM hospitals decreased by 2.2% in 2019, which is the lowest among all hospital types.\nThe three departments with the lowest nurse satisfaction rate in 2018 were pediatrics(40.4%), emergency department(42.2%), and anesthesia departments(42.8%). The three departments with the lowest nurse satisfaction rate in 2019 were dermatology(44.5%), emergency department(46.0%), and anesthesiology(48.6%). During the two years, the overall satisfaction rate of TCM and dermatology nurses decreased by 4.5% and 5.6%, respectively. The overall satisfaction rate of pediatric nurses increased the most(10.4%).\nThere are fewer national and large-scale surveys of overall job satisfaction in healthcare. Compared with the results of other previous research surveys, the fourth survey of physicians’ practice published by the Chinese Medical Doctor Association in 2011 pointed out that physicians' satisfaction with the current practice environment was only 19.02.%通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The overall satisfaction rate of the survey in 45 institutions in 9 provinces and cities in China in 2013 was 19.1%通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. It can be seen that before the implementation of the National Healthcare Improvement Initiative, the overall satisfaction rate of medical care was lower.\nBasically, the results in 2018 and 2019 show that the overall satisfaction rate of health professional has gradually increased in the past two years, but still only about 40% of doctors and about 50% of nurses are generally satisfied with their work. The job satisfaction rate of doctors and nurses remain at a relatively low level. In the surveys, the satisfaction rate of nurses was higher than the satisfaction rate of doctors, which is consistent with the results of other domestic studies通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. This phenomenon may be related to the general workload of nurses is lower than doctors, the medical risk is relatively low, and the quality of sleep is better doctor, further research and analysis is needed. Therefore, improving the overall satisfaction rate of health professional needs continuous attention.\nFrom a regional perspective, the satisfaction rate of doctors and nurses have the same trend, with the highest rates in the eastern region, and the rest in the central and western regions. Analysis of this phenomenon is related to the level of regional development: the eastern region has more developed economy, higher income level, better personal career development, higher quality of the population in the eastern region and higher professional identity from public. The comprehensive effect makes the satisfaction rate of medical staffs.\nRegarding the doctor group, the surveys showed that the difference between the central, western regions and the eastern region in 2019 was obviously smaller than that in 2018, indicating that the central and western regions have achieved better results in improving doctors’ job satisfaction during the two years. At the same time, the difference between the central and western regions increased from 0.5%通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u> to 2.4%通用删除7(英):<u>(2019)</u>; the rate in the central region increased the most in two years, indicating that the central region has been outstanding in improving doctor satisfaction rates. Therefore, we can focus on measures to improve doctor satisfaction in the central region, and publicize and promote better and effective work experience.\nRegarding the nurse group, the surveys showed that the difference in nurse satisfaction rates between regions has not changed obviously, but it should be noted that the satisfaction rate in the western region has been lower than the central region by 7.3% for two consecutive years, which is much larger than the difference between the central and eastern regions, indicating that the measures need to be further strengthened to reduce regional differences, such as improving the working environment and increasing learning opportunities. In 2019, the satisfaction rate of nurses in all regions has improved compared with 2018. The satisfaction rate in the eastern region has increased the most, but the increase in the regional intervals is not much different, indicating that the satisfaction rate of the nurse group is steadily improving across the country. The eastern region needs to lead well.\nRegarding the doctor group, the overall satisfaction rate in general hospitals and Maternal and Child hospitals fluctuated greatly. It may cause by the doctor group itself has problems such as heavy workload, poor physical health, and higher stress 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>, as well as doctor-patient relationship. Above all, the work attitudes of doctors will fluctuate greatly and be susceptible to social events通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Besides, the tertiary general hospital has enormous amount of patients with more severe diseases and complications, more complicated diagnosis and comprehensive treatments, and at the same time, they also needs to do teaching and research, which may lead to the lowest satisfaction rate of doctors in general hospitals. The change of doctor satisfaction rate in Maternal and Child hospitals needs to be continuously tracked to further explore the reasons and trends.\nComparing to the doctor group, nurses were relatively younger and less clinical responsibilities, have more human resources to work in tertiary general hospitals, and relatively better conditions such as salary and working environment than that of TCM hospital, and maternal and child hospitals.\nRegarding the doctor group, the pediatrician’s satisfaction rate was the lowest in 2018 (27.1%), and even the pediatrician’s satisfaction rate(37.6%) was only lower than the minimum satisfaction rate(anesthesiology,37.2%) 0.4% higher in 2019. The \"second-child\" policy was launched in 2016. So, in 2017, the increase in maternal births in older maternal age with more complications通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> will make the problems of newborn survival and critical care treatment more prominent, which will arise the medical dispute. At the same time, the supply-demand ratio of pediatricians is only about 0.35, which can no longer meet the needs of \"two-child\" policy通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. The workload and pressure increase, and the potential risks of medical disputes increase, falling into a vicious circle between \"stress and overload\" and \"labour loss\" , which in turn affects the pediatrician’s satisfaction rate to a low level. Therefore, it is important to intervene for the pediatrician the government and hospitals should give greater support to encourage pediatricians to practice under multiple pressures.\nCompared with other departments, internal medicine and emergency room patients are more complicated and leading a larger workload; internal physicians are more anxious, and emergency doctors have higher requirements for communicating with patient family because of the critical conditions of the patients, so various reasons cause the satisfaction rate is low通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. However, the satisfaction rate of emergency doctors shows a relatively large fluctuation, so it should be valued.\nRegarding the nurse group, the reasons for the low level of satisfaction of emergency room nurses are basically the same as those of doctors. Besides, the majority of nurses are female, ensuring the safety and reducing the workload will have a significant impact on them通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. The satisfaction rate of pediatric nurses has increased greatly, but the satisfaction rate has only reached half. Therefore, for pediatric nurses, authorities and hospitals should take timely intervention measures to stabilize their job satisfaction rate and ensure a steady upward trend.\nHowever, there is little research support and analysis for the reason that the satisfaction rate of anesthesiology and dermatology health professionals at a lower level. Therefore, continuous attention by assessment is required, which has to attach further research.\nThe sample hospitals in this study are all major tertiary public hospitals and teaching hospitals, which are very representative of the best tertiary public hospitals in China. However, the lack of investigations of prefecture-level and county-level hospitals and primary medical institutions is not representative of the overall situation of doctors and nurses across the country. Therefore, the further investigation is needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/08 17:01:51", "endTime": "2024/10/08 17:02:16", "cost": 25.703}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 01:02:16", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 01:01:50"}

The computer-based online prediction suggested C-X-C motif ligand 14 (CXCL14) as a target gene of miR-34c.

All experimental procedures were conducted in line with the ethical guidelines for the study of experimental pain in conscious animals.</u>\nA total of 120 Wistar rats (8-9 weeks old, 230-250 g) were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Xinjiang Medical University. A rat model with SCI was established by the modified Allen method. In brief, the rats were fixed on a stereotaxic apparatus in a prone position with the T10 spinal segment exposed. A round thin copper pad (diameter = 3 mm, size = 7 mm2, weight = 0.1 g) was put on the surface of the exposed T10 spinal segment, and then a 10-g load was dropped on the copper pad at a height of 5 cm to induce the SCI model. Rats in the sham group only had the T10 spinal segment exposed and then had the skin sewed back up. The rats were numbered by weight. The numbers were divided by ten, and the rats with the same number remainder were allocated into the same group. Then the rats were randomly allocated in this manner into the sham group, SCI group, NC-LV group (negative control [NC] for lentiviral vector [LV]), miR-34c-LV group, short hairpin (sh)-NC group, and sh-CXCL14 group, with 20 rats in each group. Rats in the sham group were injected with 100 μL sterile saline through the caudal vein. Rats in the SCI group were injected with 100 μL sterile saline outside the dura mater 1 day after surgery, while rats in the NC-LV, miR-34c-LV, sh-NC, and sh-CXCL14 groups were injected with the corresponding vectors (all purchased from Vigene Bioscience Co. Ltd. Shandong, China).\nThe target mRNAs of miR-34c were predicted using StarBase 删除6：<u></u>. The DNA segment containing the binding site between the 3′-UTR of CXCL14 and miR-34c was inserted into the luciferase reporter gene vector to construct the CXCL14-wild type (WT) vector, and the corresponding mutant type (MUT) vector CXCL14-MUT was constructed as well. Well-constructed CXCL14-WT and CXCL14-MUT vectors were co-transfected with either miR-34c mimic or the mimic NC into 293T cells. Then the luciferase activity of cells was measured.\nThe spinal cord tissues of each group of rats were extracted at different time points after model establishment. Total RNA from the tissues was extracted using an RNAiso Plus kit (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, Liaoning, China). RT was performed using a PrimeScript RT kit (Takara), and then the real-time qPCR was performed on a Stepone Plus PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc. Carlsbad, CA, USA). The 10 μL PCR reaction volume contained 1.6 μL complementary DNA, 5 μL 2 × SYBR Green Taq PCR mixture (Takara), 0.2 μL forward primer (10 mmol/L), 0.2 μL reverse primer (10 mmol/L), and 3 μL double distilled water. The PCR conditions were as follows: pre-denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 60 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing at 58°C for 10 s and extension for 10 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. U6 was set as an internal reference for miR-34c and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the relative expression of miR-34c and CXCL14 was determined by the 2-ΔΔCt method. The primers are shown in Table 1.\nPrimer sequences for RT-qPCR.\n删除重复语句：<u>Primer sequences for RT-qPCR.</u>\nRT-qPCR: Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction; miR: microRNA; CXCL14: C-X-C motif ligand 14; GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.\nThe spinal cord tissues of each group of rats were extracted at different time points after model establishment. Then the tissue homogenate was prepared using Radio-Immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) cell lysis buffer (Gibco Company, Grand Island, NY, USA) and a protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company, St Louis, MO, USA). Then the tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min to collect the supernatant as protein samples. The concentration of the collected proteins was detected using a bicinchoninic acid kit 通用删除11(英):<u>(P0012, Beyotime Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Shanghai, China)</u>. Then the samples were preserved at -80°C and run on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were sealed in skimmed milk for 2 h and then incubated with the primary antibodies CXCL14 (ab36622), JAK2 (ab108598), p-JAK2 (ab32101), STAT3 (ab68153), p-STAT3 (ab76315), and GAPDH (ab181602) (All provided by Abcam Inc. Cambridge, MA, USA) at room temperature for 2 h. Then the membranes were washed in tris-buffered saline tween 3 times, 10 min each time, and then treated via dropper with a developer (A38555, ThermoFisher, St. Louis, USA), and photographed under a protein developer (Wes, ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The signal intensity of the protein bands was determined on an Image Quant 350 (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT, USA). GAPDH was set as an internal reference, and the relative protein expression was evaluated based on the gray value ratio of the target protein relative to GAPDH.\nThe grip strength of rats was measured using a grip strength meter (TSE Systems, Thuringia, Germany). The rats were set on the meter with a forepaw on one side grasping the medal bar on the meter. Then the tip of the rat’s tail was lifted quickly until the paws were released to evaluate the grip strength of the paws. The grip strength (g) of both right and left forepaws of each rat was calculated with four repeated experiments. The strength was 0 if the rat could not grasp the medal bar. Adequate intervals are provided between every two experiments to ensure the accuracy of the measurement outcomes. The grip strength of both left and right forepaws was measured at 1, 3, and 5 days before surgery and 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 days after model establishment, respectively.\nSpinal sections (3 μm) were prepared for TUNEL assay. An apoptosis detection kit (Roche Ltd. Basel, Switzerland) was utilized to measure apoptosis. The sections were baked at 60°C for 1 h, dewaxed, and reacted with 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a boiling water bath for 10 min and then cooled down at room temperature. Then the samples were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and labeled, and the remaining procedures were conducted as per the kit’s instructions to measure cell apoptosis. The nuclei and nuclear membrane of apoptotic cells were labeled in dark brown. The cross-section of the spinal cord of each rat was chosen at random and observed. The apoptotic cells were observed under an optical microscope (Olympus, CH30, Japan) at a 200× magnification with five fields randomly selected.\nThe spinal cord tissues of rats were collected, washed 3 times with PBS, and treated with RIPA and protease inhibitor to prepare the tissue homogenate. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min to collect the supernatant, and then the concentrations of the SCI recovery-related proteins thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), prostacyclin (PGI2), and ganglioside (GM) were measured using the corresponding ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).\nThe SPSS 21.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data analysis. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test checked whether the data were normally distributed. Measurement data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Differences between every two groups were evaluated using a t-test, while differences among multiple groups were compared using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Tukey multiple comparisons test was used for the pairwise comparisons after the ANOVA analysis. The P value was obtained from a two-tailed test, and a P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nDifferentially expressed miRNAs between rats in the sham group and SCI group were analyzed using the GeneChipTM miRNA 4.1 Array Strip (Thermo Fisher). The raw data was homogenized and then analyzed using a Limma Rstudio Package. A total of 189 differentially expressed miRNAs were screened out with |Log2Fold Change| > 2 and P < 0.05 as the criteria, among which 104 miRNAs were up-regulated and 85 were down-regulated. A heatmap for the top 30 differentially expressed miRNAs is presented in Figure 1A, suggesting that miR-34c presents the highest differential expression. In addition, it has been reported before that miR-34c expression may be decreased following SCI.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Then, a rat model with SCI was established, and the grip strength of rat forepaws was determined. The GSM results showed that the grip strength of both right and left forepaws was considerably decreased at different time points before and after SCI model establishment 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B-D]</u> 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Tables 1-3, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A281]</u>. The RT-qPCR results suggested that miR-34c expression was decreased in SCI rats at different time points after model establishment compared to the sham-operated ones (1 day: 3.76 ± 0.41 vs. 1.21 ± 0.14, t= 10.14, P < 0.05; 3 days: 3.94 ± 0.43 vs. 1.16 ± 0.13, t= 11.05, P < 0.05; 5 days: 4.31 ± 0.39 vs. 1.08 ± 0.12, t= 12.84, P < 0.05; 7 days: 3.78 ± 0.44 vs. 0.95 ± 0.10, t= 11.25, P < 0.05) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1E]</u>.\nTo further investigate whether miR-34c expression affects the rats’ recovery from SCI, artificial up-regulation of miR-34c was introduced in rats by transfecting miR-34c-LV. To validate the transfection efficiency, RT-qPCR was performed, and the results suggested that miR-34c expression was up-regulated in SCI rats after miR-34c-LV transfection compared to NC-LV transfection (1 day: 0.89 ± 0.09 vs. 2.97 ± 0.32, t= 11.05, P < 0.01; 3 days: 0.76 ± 0.08 vs. 2.74 ± 0.36, t= 10.52, P < 0.01; 5 days: 0.72 ± 0.08 vs. 2.68 ± 0.28, t = 10.41, P < 0.01; 7 days: 0.68 ± 0.10 vs. 2.61 ± 0.29, t = 10.25, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2A]</u>. The GSM results presented that miR-34c-LV transfection led to increased grip strength of rat forepaws 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2B-D]</u> 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Tables 4-6, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A281]</u>. Moreover, the TUNEL assay suggested that the apoptosis of neurons in rat spinal cord tissues was significantly reduced when miR-34c was up-regulated (53.61 ± 6.07 vs. 2.67 ± 3.08, t= 7.36, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2E and Figure 2F]</u>. To further identify the neuronal recovery, the levels of TRH, PGI2, and GM in rat spinal cord tissues were measured using ELISA, and the results showed that the levels of the above factors were increased (TRH, 6.94 ± 0.75 vs. 19.07 ± 1.86, t = 6.60, P < 0.01; PGI2, 12.34 ± 1.09 vs. 37.49 ± 3.52, t = 13.68, P < 0.01; GM, 8.69 ± 0.83 vs. 32.61 ± 3.48, t= 13.02, P < 0.01) following miR-34c-LV transfection 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2G]</u>. Moreover, the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway has been recognized to be closely linked with SCI.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Herein, we measured the expression and phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in rat spinal cord tissues using a western blot analysis. The results suggested that after miR-34c-LV transfection, the expression of JAK2 and STAT3 showed no significant changes (JAK2, 1.67 ± 0.18 vs. 1.74 ± 0.16, t = 0.63, P= 0.95; STAT3, 1.46 ± 0.16 vs. 1.49 ± 0.15, t = 7.75, P = 0.99), but the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 reduced significantly (p-JAK2, 1.32 ± 0.14 vs. 0.46 ± 0.06, t = 0.27, P < 0.01; p-STAT3, 1.19 ± 0.13 vs. 0.38 ± 0.04, t= 7.30, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2H and Figure 2I]</u>. These results identified that overexpression of miR-34c could promote rat recovery from SCI and inactivate the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.\nTo further identify the exact mechanism involved in miR-34c-mediated SCI recovery, we measured the aberrantly expressed mRNAs in the GSE102964 microarray using the Limma Rstudio package with |Log2Fold Change|> 1.5 and P < 0.05 as the screening criteria. A total of 96 mRNAs were identified with differential expression, among which six mRNAs were down-regulated while 90 mRNAs were up-regulated, and the heatmap for the representative differentially expressed mRNAs is shown in Figure 3A. Moreover, the target mRNAs of miR-34c were predicted on miRSearch, and the outcomes were compared with the differentially expressed genes acquired by GSE102964 microarray, with CXCL14 found intersected 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3B]</u>. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were applied to analyze the CXCL14 expression in rats. The results presented that the mRNA and protein expression was increased in rats with SCI compared to the sham-operated ones (mRNA: 1 day: 1.06 ± 0.12 vs. 3.24 ± 0.35, t= 10.68, P < 0.01; 3 days: 1.03 ± 0.11 vs. 3.41 ± 0.36, t= 11.66, P < 0.01; 5 days: 0.97 ± 0.08 vs. 3.18 ± 0.29, t = 10.83, P < 0.01; 7 days: 0.91 ± 0.09 vs. 3.27 ± 0.35, t= 11.57, P < 0.01; protein: 1 day: 0.65 ± 0.08 vs. 2.85 ± 0.34, t = 12.32, P < 0.01; 3 days: 0.59 ± 0.05 vs. 2.81 ± 0.29, t = 12.43, P < 0.01; 5 days: 0.54 ± 0.04 vs. 2.94 ± 0.31, t= 13.44, P < 0.01; 7 days: 0.61 ± 0.06 vs. 2.91 ± 0.27, t= 12.88, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3C-E]</u>. Then the binding site between miR-34c and CXCL14 was predicted on a bio-information system 删除6：<u></u> and validated through a dual luciferase reporter gene assay 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3F and Figure 3G]</u>, which showed that overexpression of miR-34c inhibited the luciferase activity of the CXCL14 reporter vector (1.36 ± 0.16 vs. 0.49 ± 0.06, t= 0.76, P < 0.01). To further confirm the target relationship between miR-34c and CXCL14, we measured the mRNA and protein expression of CXCL14 after miR-34c upregulation. The results suggested that over-expression of miR-34c led to decreased CXCL14 expression in the spinal cord tissues of rats with SCI (mRNA: 1 day: 3.37 ± 0.36 vs. 1.24 ± 0.13, t = 10.31, P < 0.01; 3 days: 3.29 ± 0.34 vs. 1.35 ± 0.11, t= 9.39, P < 0.01; 5 days: 3.36 ± 0.28 vs. 1.39 ± 0.12, t= 9.54, P < 0.01; 7 days: 3.42 ± 0.35 vs. 1.27 ± 0.15, t = 10.41, P < 0.01; protein: 1 day: 2.79 ± 0.29 vs. 1.26 ± 0.14, t= 7.96, P < 0.01; 3 days: 2.89 ± 0.26 vs. 1.19 ± 0.13, t= 8.85, P < 0.01; 5 days: 2.98 ± 0.32 vs. 1.17 ± 0.12, t= 9.42, P < 0.01; 7 days: 2.87 ± 0.34 vs. 1.29 ± 0.15, t= 8.22, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3H-J]</u>. The above findings indicated that miR-34c could directly bind to CXCL14.\nTo further identify the role of CXCL14 in SCI, artificial silencing of CXCL14 was introduced in SCI rats through transfection with a sh-CXCL14 vector. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis results suggested that the mRNA and protein expression of CXCL14 was significantly decreased after sh-CXCL14 vector transfection (mRNA, 1 day: 3.45 ± 0.37 vs. 1.18 ± 0.11, t= 10.72, P < 0.01; 3 days: 3.37 ± 0.34 vs. 1.09 ± 0.10, t= 10.77, P < 0.01; 5 days: 3.49 ± 0.38 vs. 1.16 ± 0.12, t= 11.01, P < 0.01; 7 days: 3.37 ± 0.31 vs. 1.14 ± 0.09, t= 10.54, P < 0.01; protein: 1 day: 2.89 ± 0.29 vs. 0.89 ± 0.09, t= 11.68, P < 0.01; 3 days: 2.81 ± 0.27 vs. 0.94 ± 0.09, t= 10.92, P < 0.01; 5 days: 2.79 ± 0.29 vs. 0.98 ± 0.08, t= 10.57, P < 0.01; 7 days: 2.86 ± 0.28 vs. 0.86 ± 0.10, t= 11.68, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4A-C]</u>.

TUNEL assay also found that silencing of CXCL14 resulted in decreased number of apoptotic neurons in the spinal cord tissues of SCI rats (55.74 ± 6.24 vs. 26.75 ± 2.84, t = 7.32, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4G and Figure 4H]</u>. Moreover, it was found that the concentrations of TRH, PGI2, and GM in rat spinal cord tissues were increased when CXCL14 was silenced (TRH, 7.34 ± 0.81 vs. 18.67 ± 1.98, t = 5.57, P < 0.01; PGI2, 11.89 ± 1.14 vs. 39.76 ± 3.88, t= 13.70, P < 0.01; GM, 9.08 ± 0.86 vs. 31.08 ± 3.95, t= 10.81, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4I]</u>. Western blot analysis also found that silencing of CXCL14 led to decreased phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in SCI rats (JAK2, 1.79 ± 0.17 vs. 1.63 ± 0.19, t= 1.43, P > 0.99; STAT3, 1.52 ± 0.16 vs. 1.58 ± 0.13, t= 0.54, P > 0.99, p-JAK2, 1.36 ± 0.16 vs. 0.49 ± 0.05, t = 7.80, P < 0.01; p-STAT3, 1.04 ± 0.12 vs. 0.34 ± 0.05, t= 7.30, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4J and Figure 4K]</u>. These results suggested that the silencing of CXCL14 could promote the SCI recovery in rats and inhibit the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.\nSCI leads to cytolysis and necrosis of spinal cord tissues in the first phase and secondary complications in the later phase, seriously influencing the CNS and leading to poor quality of life for patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> miRNAs are important gene mediators that also play crucial roles in almost every aspect of SCI with neural growth, neurogenesis, glial differentiation, and other processes frequently involved.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> Here, our study identified miR-34c as a promoter of neural regeneration in SCI using a rat model, which might alleviate SCI through down-regulating CXCR14 expression and inactivating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.\nInitially, a microarray analysis was performed to screen out the mostly aberrantly expressed miRNAs in SCI with miR-34c identified. Decreased miR-34c expression in rats following SCI was further quantified via RT-qPCR. A large number of miRNAs have been identified to be abnormally expressed and exert key functions in SCI, such as miR-362-3p,通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> miR-133b,通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> and miR-486.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Likewise, miR-34c has been suggested to be down-regulated in rats with SCI通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> and in rats with spinal nerve ligation-induced lesions.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> However, the specific role of miR-34c in SCI progression, to the best of our knowledge, has not been elucidated before. Herein, based on the above finding, we further introduced over-expression of miR-34c in SCI rats. It was found that over-expression of miR-34c promoted the neural recovery and function in SCI rats, presenting as increased grip strength of rat forepaws and increased concentrations of SCI recovery-related proteins TRH, PGI2, and GM in rat spinal tissues. TRH is well known for its broad-spectrum neuropharmacological action and it is crucial in CNS recovery following brain and spinal injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>PGI2 was reported to reduce impaired mobility following SCI through inhibiting tumor necrosis factor production and the neutrophil accumulation that follows.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> Likewise, the involvement of GM on nerve function recovery has been identified previously.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> Taken together, these results suggested that miR-34c could promote SCI recovery in rats.\nFollowing these findings, we next explored the possible mechanisms involved in the miR-34c-mediated neuro-protective events. Importantly, our study found that overexpression of miR-34c led to decreased phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3, namely, it inactivated the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. JAK2/STAT3 is not phosphorylated under normal physiological conditions, but it is phosphorylated immediately when the body is under stress.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> The JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway has been documented to mediate immune reactions and tumor pathogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> It has been reported that JAK-STAT is a main downstream pathway of interleukin (IL-6), which is implicated in the neurological injury and impaired neurological repair in several CNS disorders.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> Activation of JAK2/STAT3 has also been found in rats with SCI accompanied with increased cell apoptosis- and inflammation-related cytokines.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Then we inferred that miR-34c might exert the neuroprotective functions through JAK2/STAT3 inhibition. Next, we further intersected the target genes of miR-34c and the differentially expressed genes in SCI rats, with CXCL14 subsequently identified. The luciferase assay validated CXCL14 as a target gene of miR- 34c. CXCL14 has been identified as an emerging immune and inflammatory regulator.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> However, its role in neural regeneration has been poorly studied. Our study found that the silencing of CXCL14 stimulated neuronal recovery in SCI rats, presenting as increased grip strength of rat forepaws and TRH, PGI2, and GM concentrations. Importantly, artificial silencing of CXCL14 was found to decrease the phosphorylation of JAK2/STAT3 in rats. The direct links between CXCL14 and JAK2/STAT3 has not been investigated before, though, it has been found that the JAK2/STAT3 was activated in chicken IL 26-induced inflammation, during which CXCL14 was up-regulated as well.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Here, we proposed that CXCL14 could activate the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, that and inhibited CXCL14 expression and the following JAK2/STAT3 inactivation might be responsible for miR-34c-mediated neuroprotection in SCI rats.\nTo conclude, our current study provided evidence that could promote the neuronal repair and functions in SCI rats by down-regulating CXCL14 expression and activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>. However, the mechanisms involved in SCI is too complicated to be fully explored and explained. Here our study only focused on this miR-34c/CXCL14/JAK2/STAT3 axis with the grip strength and neuronal apoptosis as the major markers in nerve repair evaluation. Though there are limitations, the findings of the paper might provide novel insights into SCI treatment. We hope more studies in this field will be carried out in the near future to validate our findings, as well as explore other underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of SCI.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": " (all purchased from Vigene Bioscience Co.

The computer-based online prediction suggested C-X-C motif ligand 14 (CXCL14) as a target gene of miR-34c.

All experimental procedures were conducted in line with the ethical guidelines for the study of experimental pain in conscious animals.</u>\nA total of 120 Wistar rats (8-9 weeks old, 230-250 g) were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Xinjiang Medical University. A rat model with SCI was established by the modified Allen method. In brief, the rats were fixed on a stereotaxic apparatus in a prone position with the T10 spinal segment exposed. A round thin copper pad (diameter = 3 mm, size = 7 mm2, weight = 0.1 g) was put on the surface of the exposed T10 spinal segment, and then a 10-g load was dropped on the copper pad at a height of 5 cm to induce the SCI model. Rats in the sham group only had the T10 spinal segment exposed and then had the skin sewed back up. The rats were numbered by weight. The numbers were divided by ten, and the rats with the same number remainder were allocated into the same group. Then the rats were randomly allocated in this manner into the sham group, SCI group, NC-LV group (negative control [NC] for lentiviral vector [LV]), miR-34c-LV group, short hairpin (sh)-NC group, and sh-CXCL14 group, with 20 rats in each group. Rats in the sham group were injected with 100 μL sterile saline through the caudal vein. Rats in the SCI group were injected with 100 μL sterile saline outside the dura mater 1 day after surgery, while rats in the NC-LV, miR-34c-LV, sh-NC, and sh-CXCL14 groups were injected with the corresponding vectors (all purchased from Vigene Bioscience Co. Ltd. Shandong, China).\nThe target mRNAs of miR-34c were predicted using StarBase 删除6：<u></u>. The DNA segment containing the binding site between the 3′-UTR of CXCL14 and miR-34c was inserted into the luciferase reporter gene vector to construct the CXCL14-wild type (WT) vector, and the corresponding mutant type (MUT) vector CXCL14-MUT was constructed as well. Well-constructed CXCL14-WT and CXCL14-MUT vectors were co-transfected with either miR-34c mimic or the mimic NC into 293T cells. Then the luciferase activity of cells was measured.\nThe spinal cord tissues of each group of rats were extracted at different time points after model establishment. Total RNA from the tissues was extracted using an RNAiso Plus kit (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, Liaoning, China). RT was performed using a PrimeScript RT kit (Takara), and then the real-time qPCR was performed on a Stepone Plus PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc. Carlsbad, CA, USA). The 10 μL PCR reaction volume contained 1.6 μL complementary DNA, 5 μL 2 × SYBR Green Taq PCR mixture (Takara), 0.2 μL forward primer (10 mmol/L), 0.2 μL reverse primer (10 mmol/L), and 3 μL double distilled water. The PCR conditions were as follows: pre-denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 60 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing at 58°C for 10 s and extension for 10 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. U6 was set as an internal reference for miR-34c and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the relative expression of miR-34c and CXCL14 was determined by the 2-ΔΔCt method.

Then the tissue homogenate was prepared using Radio-Immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) cell lysis buffer (Gibco Company, Grand Island, NY, USA) and a protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company, St Louis, MO, USA). Then the tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min to collect the supernatant as protein samples. The concentration of the collected proteins was detected using a bicinchoninic acid kit 通用删除11(英):<u>(P0012, Beyotime Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Shanghai, China)</u>. Then the samples were preserved at -80°C and run on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were sealed in skimmed milk for 2 h and then incubated with the primary antibodies CXCL14 (ab36622), JAK2 (ab108598), p-JAK2 (ab32101), STAT3 (ab68153), p-STAT3 (ab76315), and GAPDH (ab181602) (All provided by Abcam Inc. Cambridge, MA, USA) at room temperature for 2 h. Then the membranes were washed in tris-buffered saline tween 3 times, 10 min each time, and then treated via dropper with a developer (A38555, ThermoFisher, St. Louis, USA), and photographed under a protein developer (Wes, ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The signal intensity of the protein bands was determined on an Image Quant 350 (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT, USA). GAPDH was set as an internal reference, and the relative protein expression was evaluated based on the gray value ratio of the target protein relative to GAPDH.\nThe grip strength of rats was measured using a grip strength meter (TSE Systems, Thuringia, Germany). The rats were set on the meter with a forepaw on one side grasping the medal bar on the meter. Then the tip of the rat’s tail was lifted quickly until the paws were released to evaluate the grip strength of the paws. The grip strength (g) of both right and left forepaws of each rat was calculated with four repeated experiments. The strength was 0 if the rat could not grasp the medal bar. Adequate intervals are provided between every two experiments to ensure the accuracy of the measurement outcomes. The grip strength of both left and right forepaws was measured at 1, 3, and 5 days before surgery and 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 days after model establishment, respectively.\nSpinal sections (3 μm) were prepared for TUNEL assay. An apoptosis detection kit (Roche Ltd. Basel, Switzerland) was utilized to measure apoptosis. The sections were baked at 60°C for 1 h, dewaxed, and reacted with 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a boiling water bath for 10 min and then cooled down at room temperature. Then the samples were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and labeled, and the remaining procedures were conducted as per the kit’s instructions to measure cell apoptosis. The nuclei and nuclear membrane of apoptotic cells were labeled in dark brown. The cross-section of the spinal cord of each rat was chosen at random and observed. The apoptotic cells were observed under an optical microscope (Olympus, CH30, Japan) at a 200× magnification with five fields randomly selected.\nThe spinal cord tissues of rats were collected, washed 3 times with PBS, and treated with RIPA and protease inhibitor to prepare the tissue homogenate. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min to collect the supernatant, and then the concentrations of the SCI recovery-related proteins thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), prostacyclin (PGI2), and ganglioside (GM) were measured using the corresponding ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).\nThe SPSS 21.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data analysis. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test checked whether the data were normally distributed. Measurement data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Differences between every two groups were evaluated using a t-test, while differences among multiple groups were compared using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Tukey multiple comparisons test was used for the pairwise comparisons after the ANOVA analysis. The P value was obtained from a two-tailed test, and a P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nDifferentially expressed miRNAs between rats in the sham group and SCI group were analyzed using the GeneChipTM miRNA 4.1 Array Strip (Thermo Fisher). The raw data was homogenized and then analyzed using a Limma Rstudio Package. A total of 189 differentially expressed miRNAs were screened out with |Log2Fold Change| > 2 and P < 0.05 as the criteria, among which 104 miRNAs were up-regulated and 85 were down-regulated. A heatmap for the top 30 differentially expressed miRNAs is presented in Figure 1A, suggesting that miR-34c presents the highest differential expression. In addition, it has been reported before that miR-34c expression may be decreased following SCI.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Then, a rat model with SCI was established, and the grip strength of rat forepaws was determined.

The RT-qPCR results suggested that miR-34c expression was decreased in SCI rats at different time points after model establishment compared to the sham-operated ones (1 day: 3.76 ± 0.41 vs. 1.21 ± 0.14, t= 10.14, P < 0.05; 3 days: 3.94 ± 0.43 vs. 1.16 ± 0.13, t= 11.05, P < 0.05; 5 days: 4.31 ± 0.39 vs. 1.08 ± 0.12, t= 12.84, P < 0.05; 7 days: 3.78 ± 0.44 vs. 0.95 ± 0.10, t= 11.25, P < 0.05) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1E]</u>.\nTo further investigate whether miR-34c expression affects the rats’ recovery from SCI, artificial up-regulation of miR-34c was introduced in rats by transfecting miR-34c-LV. To validate the transfection efficiency, RT-qPCR was performed, and the results suggested that miR-34c expression was up-regulated in SCI rats after miR-34c-LV transfection compared to NC-LV transfection (1 day: 0.89 ± 0.09 vs. 2.97 ± 0.32, t= 11.05, P < 0.01; 3 days: 0.76 ± 0.08 vs. 2.74 ± 0.36, t= 10.52, P < 0.01; 5 days: 0.72 ± 0.08 vs. 2.68 ± 0.28, t = 10.41, P < 0.01; 7 days: 0.68 ± 0.10 vs. 2.61 ± 0.29, t = 10.25, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2A]</u>.

Moreover, the TUNEL assay suggested that the apoptosis of neurons in rat spinal cord tissues was significantly reduced when miR-34c was up-regulated (53.61 ± 6.07 vs. 2.67 ± 3.08, t= 7.36, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2E and Figure 2F]</u>. To further identify the neuronal recovery, the levels of TRH, PGI2, and GM in rat spinal cord tissues were measured using ELISA, and the results showed that the levels of the above factors were increased (TRH, 6.94 ± 0.75 vs. 19.07 ± 1.86, t = 6.60, P < 0.01; PGI2, 12.34 ± 1.09 vs. 37.49 ± 3.52, t = 13.68, P < 0.01; GM, 8.69 ± 0.83 vs. 32.61 ± 3.48, t= 13.02, P < 0.01) following miR-34c-LV transfection 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2G]</u>. Moreover, the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway has been recognized to be closely linked with SCI.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Herein, we measured the expression and phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in rat spinal cord tissues using a western blot analysis. The results suggested that after miR-34c-LV transfection, the expression of JAK2 and STAT3 showed no significant changes (JAK2, 1.67 ± 0.18 vs. 1.74 ± 0.16, t = 0.63, P= 0.95; STAT3, 1.46 ± 0.16 vs. 1.49 ± 0.15, t = 7.75, P = 0.99), but the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 reduced significantly (p-JAK2, 1.32 ± 0.14 vs. 0.46 ± 0.06, t = 0.27, P < 0.01; p-STAT3, 1.19 ± 0.13 vs. 0.38 ± 0.04, t= 7.30, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2H and Figure 2I]</u>. These results identified that overexpression of miR-34c could promote rat recovery from SCI and inactivate the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.\nTo further identify the exact mechanism involved in miR-34c-mediated SCI recovery, we measured the aberrantly expressed mRNAs in the GSE102964 microarray using the Limma Rstudio package with |Log2Fold Change|> 1.5 and P < 0.05 as the screening criteria. A total of 96 mRNAs were identified with differential expression, among which six mRNAs were down-regulated while 90 mRNAs were up-regulated, and the heatmap for the representative differentially expressed mRNAs is shown in Figure 3A. Moreover, the target mRNAs of miR-34c were predicted on miRSearch, and the outcomes were compared with the differentially expressed genes acquired by GSE102964 microarray, with CXCL14 found intersected 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3B]</u>. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were applied to analyze the CXCL14 expression in rats. The results presented that the mRNA and protein expression was increased in rats with SCI compared to the sham-operated ones (mRNA: 1 day: 1.06 ± 0.12 vs. 3.24 ± 0.35, t= 10.68, P < 0.01; 3 days: 1.03 ± 0.11 vs. 3.41 ± 0.36, t= 11.66, P < 0.01; 5 days: 0.97 ± 0.08 vs. 3.18 ± 0.29, t = 10.83, P < 0.01; 7 days: 0.91 ± 0.09 vs. 3.27 ± 0.35, t= 11.57, P < 0.01; protein: 1 day: 0.65 ± 0.08 vs. 2.85 ± 0.34, t = 12.32, P < 0.01; 3 days: 0.59 ± 0.05 vs. 2.81 ± 0.29, t = 12.43, P < 0.01; 5 days: 0.54 ± 0.04 vs. 2.94 ± 0.31, t= 13.44, P < 0.01; 7 days: 0.61 ± 0.06 vs. 2.91 ± 0.27, t= 12.88, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3C-E]</u>. Then the binding site between miR-34c and CXCL14 was predicted on a bio-information system 删除6：<u></u> and validated through a dual luciferase reporter gene assay 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3F and Figure 3G]</u>, which showed that overexpression of miR-34c inhibited the luciferase activity of the CXCL14 reporter vector (1.36 ± 0.16 vs. 0.49 ± 0.06, t= 0.76, P < 0.01). To further confirm the target relationship between miR-34c and CXCL14, we measured the mRNA and protein expression of CXCL14 after miR-34c upregulation. The results suggested that over-expression of miR-34c led to decreased CXCL14 expression in the spinal cord tissues of rats with SCI (mRNA: 1 day: 3.37 ± 0.36 vs. 1.24 ± 0.13, t = 10.31, P < 0.01; 3 days: 3.29 ± 0.34 vs. 1.35 ± 0.11, t= 9.39, P < 0.01; 5 days: 3.36 ± 0.28 vs. 1.39 ± 0.12, t= 9.54, P < 0.01; 7 days: 3.42 ± 0.35 vs. 1.27 ± 0.15, t = 10.41, P < 0.01; protein: 1 day: 2.79 ± 0.29 vs. 1.26 ± 0.14, t= 7.96, P < 0.01; 3 days: 2.89 ± 0.26 vs. 1.19 ± 0.13, t= 8.85, P < 0.01; 5 days: 2.98 ± 0.32 vs. 1.17 ± 0.12, t= 9.42, P < 0.01; 7 days: 2.87 ± 0.34 vs. 1.29 ± 0.15, t= 8.22, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3H-J]</u>. The above findings indicated that miR-34c could directly bind to CXCL14.\nTo further identify the role of CXCL14 in SCI, artificial silencing of CXCL14 was introduced in SCI rats through transfection with a sh-CXCL14 vector. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis results suggested that the mRNA and protein expression of CXCL14 was significantly decreased after sh-CXCL14 vector transfection (mRNA, 1 day: 3.45 ± 0.37 vs. 1.18 ± 0.11, t= 10.72, P < 0.01; 3 days: 3.37 ± 0.34 vs. 1.09 ± 0.10, t= 10.77, P < 0.01; 5 days: 3.49 ± 0.38 vs. 1.16 ± 0.12, t= 11.01, P < 0.01; 7 days: 3.37 ± 0.31 vs. 1.14 ± 0.09, t= 10.54, P < 0.01; protein: 1 day: 2.89 ± 0.29 vs. 0.89 ± 0.09, t= 11.68, P < 0.01; 3 days: 2.81 ± 0.27 vs. 0.94 ± 0.09, t= 10.92, P < 0.01; 5 days: 2.79 ± 0.29 vs. 0.98 ± 0.08, t= 10.57, P < 0.01; 7 days: 2.86 ± 0.28 vs. 0.86 ± 0.10, t= 11.68, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4A-C]</u>.

TUNEL assay also found that silencing of CXCL14 resulted in decreased number of apoptotic neurons in the spinal cord tissues of SCI rats (55.74 ± 6.24 vs. 26.75 ± 2.84, t = 7.32, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4G and Figure 4H]</u>. Moreover, it was found that the concentrations of TRH, PGI2, and GM in rat spinal cord tissues were increased when CXCL14 was silenced (TRH, 7.34 ± 0.81 vs. 18.67 ± 1.98, t = 5.57, P < 0.01; PGI2, 11.89 ± 1.14 vs. 39.76 ± 3.88, t= 13.70, P < 0.01; GM, 9.08 ± 0.86 vs. 31.08 ± 3.95, t= 10.81, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4I]</u>. Western blot analysis also found that silencing of CXCL14 led to decreased phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in SCI rats (JAK2, 1.79 ± 0.17 vs. 1.63 ± 0.19, t= 1.43, P > 0.99; STAT3, 1.52 ± 0.16 vs. 1.58 ± 0.13, t= 0.54, P > 0.99, p-JAK2, 1.36 ± 0.16 vs. 0.49 ± 0.05, t = 7.80, P < 0.01; p-STAT3, 1.04 ± 0.12 vs. 0.34 ± 0.05, t= 7.30, P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4J and Figure 4K]</u>. These results suggested that the silencing of CXCL14 could promote the SCI recovery in rats and inhibit the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.\nSCI leads to cytolysis and necrosis of spinal cord tissues in the first phase and secondary complications in the later phase, seriously influencing the CNS and leading to poor quality of life for patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> miRNAs are important gene mediators that also play crucial roles in almost every aspect of SCI with neural growth, neurogenesis, glial differentiation, and other processes frequently involved.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> Here, our study identified miR-34c as a promoter of neural regeneration in SCI using a rat model, which might alleviate SCI through down-regulating CXCR14 expression and inactivating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.\nInitially, a microarray analysis was performed to screen out the mostly aberrantly expressed miRNAs in SCI with miR-34c identified. Decreased miR-34c expression in rats following SCI was further quantified via RT-qPCR. A large number of miRNAs have been identified to be abnormally expressed and exert key functions in SCI, such as miR-362-3p,通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> miR-133b,通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> and miR-486.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Likewise, miR-34c has been suggested to be down-regulated in rats with SCI通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> and in rats with spinal nerve ligation-induced lesions.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> However, the specific role of miR-34c in SCI progression, to the best of our knowledge, has not been elucidated before. Herein, based on the above finding, we further introduced over-expression of miR-34c in SCI rats. It was found that over-expression of miR-34c promoted the neural recovery and function in SCI rats, presenting as increased grip strength of rat forepaws and increased concentrations of SCI recovery-related proteins TRH, PGI2, and GM in rat spinal tissues. TRH is well known for its broad-spectrum neuropharmacological action and it is crucial in CNS recovery following brain and spinal injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>PGI2 was reported to reduce impaired mobility following SCI through inhibiting tumor necrosis factor production and the neutrophil accumulation that follows.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> Likewise, the involvement of GM on nerve function recovery has been identified previously.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> Taken together, these results suggested that miR-34c could promote SCI recovery in rats.\nFollowing these findings, we next explored the possible mechanisms involved in the miR-34c-mediated neuro-protective events. Importantly, our study found that overexpression of miR-34c led to decreased phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3, namely, it inactivated the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. JAK2/STAT3 is not phosphorylated under normal physiological conditions, but it is phosphorylated immediately when the body is under stress.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> The JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway has been documented to mediate immune reactions and tumor pathogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> It has been reported that JAK-STAT is a main downstream pathway of interleukin (IL-6), which is implicated in the neurological injury and impaired neurological repair in several CNS disorders.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> Activation of JAK2/STAT3 has also been found in rats with SCI accompanied with increased cell apoptosis- and inflammation-related cytokines.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Then we inferred that miR-34c might exert the neuroprotective functions through JAK2/STAT3 inhibition. Next, we further intersected the target genes of miR-34c and the differentially expressed genes in SCI rats, with CXCL14 subsequently identified. The luciferase assay validated CXCL14 as a target gene of miR- 34c. CXCL14 has been identified as an emerging immune and inflammatory regulator.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> However, its role in neural regeneration has been poorly studied. Our study found that the silencing of CXCL14 stimulated neuronal recovery in SCI rats, presenting as increased grip strength of rat forepaws and TRH, PGI2, and GM concentrations. Importantly, artificial silencing of CXCL14 was found to decrease the phosphorylation of JAK2/STAT3 in rats. The direct links between CXCL14 and JAK2/STAT3 has not been investigated before, though, it has been found that the JAK2/STAT3 was activated in chicken IL 26-induced inflammation, during which CXCL14 was up-regulated as well.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Here, we proposed that CXCL14 could activate the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, that and inhibited CXCL14 expression and the following JAK2/STAT3 inactivation might be responsible for miR-34c-mediated neuroprotection in SCI rats.\nTo conclude, our current study provided evidence that could promote the neuronal repair and functions in SCI rats by down-regulating CXCL14 expression and activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>. However, the mechanisms involved in SCI is too complicated to be fully explored and explained. Here our study only focused on this miR-34c/CXCL14/JAK2/STAT3 axis with the grip strength and neuronal apoptosis as the major markers in nerve repair evaluation. Though there are limitations, the findings of the paper might provide novel insights into SCI treatment. We hope more studies in this field will be carried out in the near future to validate our findings, as well as explore other underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of SCI.", "index": 4804, "show": true, "start": 4804, "end": 4869, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:38:41", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:39:50", "cost": 69.197}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:39:50", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:38:40"}

As a result of the numerous developments related to sinus surgery, we predicted an increase in endoscopic sinus procedures with a decline in open approaches to the paranasal sinuses.\n\"Main procedures and intervention\" data from HES was extracted for relevant sinus surgery between 2010 and 2019 using MS Excel version 16.31. The operative (OPCS-4) codes relevant to all sinus procedures between E12.1 and E17.9 were analysed. After examination of overall sinus related procedures, further subgroup analysis was performed with regards to open or endoscopic techniques. Procedures coded as \"other specified operation of\" or \"unspecified operation of\" were excluded due to uncertainty of the approach used and the inability to further scrutinise this within the HES database.\nStatistical analysis was conducted and graphs were produced using MS Excel version 16.31.\nThe total number of sinus procedures performed in the England between 2010 and 2019 was 89,495. There was an increase over the decade of 6.94% from 9205 cases in 2010-11 to 9844 in 2018-2019. The maximum number of cases during the study period were performed in 2016-2017 with 10,714 cases (an increase of 16.4% from 2010 to 2011). Following exclusion of procedures with unclear coding (OPCS-4 codes E13.8 'other specified other operations on maxillary antrum’, E14.6 'trephine of frontal sinus’, E17.8 'other specified operations on unspecified nasal sinus’ and E17.9 'unspecified operations on unspecified nasal sinus’), 4543 cases were excluded, leaving 84,952 procedures included in the analysis. This included 71,518 (84.2%) endoscopic and 8054 (9.5%) open procedures as well as 5380 (6.3%) procedures involving nasal sinus biopsy/excision.\nThe number of endoscopic cases increased from 6772 in 2010 to 8201 in 2019. For open cases, there was a decrease from 1026 in 2010 to 664 in 2019. This represented a percentage change of +21.1% and -35.3% respectively.

The number of maxillary sinus cases increased by 1393 cases (3569 in 2010 to 4962 in 2019). This represented a percentage change of+39.0% and an overall increase in the proportion of endoscopic procedures of 6.6%.\nWhile there was an overall decrease in ethmoid sinus procedures in the last decade, the proportion of endoscopic cases making up the total ethmoid cases increased from 88.9% in 2010 to 95.2% in 2019 (representing an absolute increase of 6.3%). The number, and proportion of endoscopic frontal sinus procedures showed an increase from 2010 to its peak in 2014, from 744 to 1358 cases respectively, representing an increase from 94.7% to 97.8% of total frontal sinus procedures performed. However, this rise was not sustained and in 2019 during which the proportion of endoscopic frontal sinus work dropped to 96.6%.\nThe number of open and endoscopic procedures, and the change of percentage of endoscopic cases of total performed cases between 2010 and 2019 for maxillary, ethmoid and frontal sinuses is summarised in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4.\nBetween 2010 and 2019, there was a 73.6% increase in endoscopic sphenoid sinus surgery 通用删除7(英):<u>(220-382)</u>, reaching a peak of 412 cases in 2017-18. This represented the largest increase of all sub-groups. During this time, there was a decrease in the number of \"lateral rhinotomy into nasal sinus\" procedures, from 42 to 17, representing a decrease of 59.5%. The trough was 13 cases in 2017-2018. The evolution of sphenoid surgery procedures is illustrated in Fig. 5.\nOur results show an overall increase in sinus procedures from 2010 to 2019 from 7798 to 8865 procedures per year . More interestingly, the proportion of endoscopic vs open procedures increased in this period from 86.8% to 92.5%. When looking at sinus specific procedures, there was an overall increase in maxillary, frontal and sphenoid sinus procedures, as well as procedures involving nasal sinus biopsy/excision. Although there was an absolute decrease in ethmoid sinus procedures, the proportion of endoscopic procedures in all sub-groups showed an increase over the last decade.\nThese findings expand upon previous studies that show similar results. In 2010, Venkatraman et al.7 showed an increase in the rates of endoscopic sinus surgery in Medicare patients between 1998 and 2006, with a decrease in open sinus surgeries during the same study period, despite a similar number of diagnoses of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). A study in 2014 by Pynnonen et al8 also demonstrated an increase in the total number of sinus procedures over 10 years in Florida, United States. They attributed this to an increased number of sinus procedures per patient and an overall increase in the number of patients undergoing sinus surgery. Similar results were also reported by Psaltis et al,9 who showed an increase in endoscopic sinus procedures, particularly in frontal sinusotomy and sphenoidotomy.\nOur findings substantially build upon these previous studies, as we have analysed data from a whole country with no sampling, and over a 9-year study period. This is in contrast to the Venkatraman7 and Pyonnen8 studies that looked at a specific population group, and area of the United States respectively. Furthermore, the long-term comparison of trends in our data set (9 years) allow more robust conclusions to be drawn when compared to the 3 and 8 year analysis reported by Psaltis9 and Venkatraman7 respectively.\nAlthough our data set is comprehensive, it does not allow us to extrapolate a clinical explanation for the observed changes. This is due to a lack of data regarding patient factors such as disease severity and impact on quality of life. It is likely that the prevalence of CRS remains largely unchanged during the study period and is around 10% in the UK.删除4：<u>10,11</u> However, estimating the true prevalence of CRS is known to be difficult due to the combination of subjective and objective criteria in its diagnostic pathway. Observational studies used to estimate prevalence are often based on subjective criteria via questionnaires.删除4：<u>12</u>\nThe changes therefore may be attributable to other factors such as increased patient acceptance of sinus surgery and improved surgeon training and confidence in endoscopic techniques. Indeed, this is a self-perpetuating cycle where an ever increasing proportion of endoscopic surgery over time lends itself to the notion that more trainee surgeons will learn these techniques rather than traditional open approaches.\nAnother potential explanation for the results seen is dependent on disease processes. Historically, procedures that were performed open can now be performed endoscopically due to an increased knowledge of sinonasal anatomy, largely driven by CT guided navigation systems. Access to intranasal and paranasal sinus pathology has been significantly enhanced by a number of different endoscopic corridors described, including transethmoidal, transphenoidal, transpterygoid, prelacrimal and modified Denkers approach for laterally based lesions. This may explain the reduced need for extensive open access as demonstrated. In addition to this, endoscopic approaches to the frontal sinuses have significantly increased. This was again reflected in the results by a reduction in open osteoplastic flap approaches to the frontal sinus.\nExternal approach ethmoidectomy and frontoethmoidectomy both saw a 62% and 68% fall respectively over the 9-year period. There was an increase in \"median drainage of frontal sinus\" procedures from 96 in 2010-2011 to 148 in 2018-2019 with a change of 54%. However, when other frontal sinus procedure codes where included the global evaluation of all frontal sinus procedure codes did not demonstrate a significantly large increase over the last 9 years. This was partly down to coding limitation where 78.5% of frontal sinus procedures were coded as \"other procedures on frontal sinus\" . This made it difficult to ascertain the approach taken and extent of surgery in the frontal sinus and is a limitation in using HES data. With regards to sphenoid sinus procedures, the expansion in endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches to sellar and clival lesions are likely to be a contributing factor to the increase in sphenoid sinus surgery seen over the years.\nA major limitation of this study was lack of clarity provided by the coding parameters leading to variability and data identification bias. A large number of procedures were coded as \"unspecified\" or \"other\" approach to sinuses, making it difficult to identify the approach used. To minimise the effect of this bias, these procedures were subsequently excluded in subgroup analysis.\nFurthermore, the operation codes do not include procedures that were converted to open from endoscopic approaches or similarly where combined approaches were used. Although, it is likely that these procedures will have been dual coded and therefore included correctly, this has not been explicitly stated in the HES database. The procedure codes themselves do not differentiate whether the approach was endoscopic and so there was a degree of bias interpreting the data. For example, biopsy/excision of sinus lesion may be open or endoscopically performed however we could not include this in the open vs endoscopic approach analysis.\nThe limitation with coding may also explain the overall decrease seen in ethmoid sinus procedures. One of the main purposes of coding is to generate income for hospitals in England. If an ethmoid sinus procedure has been conducted concurrently with a frontal or sphenoid procedure, then coders will generally only use the frontal or sphenoid code as this represents a higher tariff than an ethmoid code. Therefore, the use of coding may underrepresent the true number of ethmoid procedures. However, this would only likely affect the absolute numbers and not the trends or proportion of endoscopic surgery which are likely to still be accurate.\nIn addition, the same applied for procedures coded as \"other unspecified\" procedures for the frontal and sphenoid sinus. These were interpreted as being performed endoscopically. The data presented is very useful in presenting emerging trends in sinus surgery over the last decade, however the coding does not allow for analysis of underlying pathology being addressed or revision cases for example for inflammatory disease.\nOverall, we see an increase in sinus surgery over the last 9 years from 2010 to 2019. These findings are in keeping with our initial hypotheses. Although our data set is limited by coding, and lack of patient factors, it represents most, if not all, of the data in England over a large study period. It is therefore useful to add to previous studies when demonstrating the increasing popularity of endoscopic sinus surgery over open procedures. With increasing novel medical therapies for inflammatory sinus disease and potential funding challenges in many countries, it will be interesting to see whether the upward trend of sinus surgery will be affected.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:42:28", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:42:42", "cost": 14.077}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:42:42", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:42:28"}

Attempts with therapeutic options include radiotherapy, various chemotherapeutic regimens and individualized molecularly targeted drugs have highlighted the limitations of the evaluation of treatment response based on tumor size reduction only, which may not always typically occur until days or weeks after fractionated regimens. Another considerable problem is that the functional changes acted by any effective therapy in the tumor microenvironment are not directly evaluated on anatomic imaging.\nThe identification of factors that enable evaluation of treatment response is important with regard to the selection of the optimal following therapy. Tumors identified to be less responsive can be subjected to alternative treatment strategies or investigational therapies. Unfortunately, the histologic treatment response information acquired by morphologic imaging is limited. Therefore, there is a need for clinically significant noninvasive evaluation of treatment response.\nIn view of the diversity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences available, an ever-increasing body of research indicates that quantitative MRI parameters may play an important role on this respect of research.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]</u> In this review, we will focus on the recent development in this field, especially dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).\nDynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI is a promising imaging technique that can enable noninvasive quantitative assessment of tissue microvasculature, such as tissue perfusion, capillary permeability, and integrity.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u> The information acquired from data can be applied to a study of angiogenesis, hypoxia, and evaluation of various biomarkers. Regions of necrosis, muscle, vessel, and viable information inside the tumor display distinct signal enhancement in dynamic images. DCE-MRI in combination with tumor morphologic imaging could provide a possible prognostic response to antiangiogenic treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Quantitative measures generated from DCE-MRI data involve evaluation of some combination of principal kinetic parameters: The influx volume transfer constant (Ktrans), the efflux rate constant (kep), the relative extravascular extracellular space (EES) fractional volume (ve), and the relative vascular plasma space (vp) from a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model proposed by Tofts et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> and the corresponding differences (ΔKtrans, Δkep, Δve, and Δvp) between outer and inner tumor.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,8,12,13,14]</u> The Ktrans (min−1) is transendothelial transport of contrast medium from the vascular compartment to the tumor interstitium. The kep (min−1) reflects the reverse transport of contrast medium back into the vascular space. Ktrans and ve relate to the tissue’s basic physiology, whereas the rate constant (kep) is the ratio of the transfer constant to the EES:通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nkep can be derived from the shape of the gadolinium concentration versus time results, whereas Ktrans and ve require knowledge of the absolute values of gadolinium concentration. Ktrans has several physiologic interpretations, depending on the tissue’s vascular permeability and perfusion.\nCompared with the complex quantitative parameters, a qualitative assessment of perfusion based on the shape of the signal intensity versus time curve may also be useful clinically for assessing response to treatment. Tissues are described using a number of descriptors including onset of enhancement, maximum signal intensity, and the washout gradient and so on.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> These semi-quantitative parameters have the advantage of being relatively straightforward to calculate and can be used when quantitative techniques fail.\nDiffusion-weighted-MRI is a technique that is acquired to make the MR signal sensitive to the molecular motion of water by applying strong magnetic field gradients. Movement including directed perfusion and passive thermally-induced diffusion can be measured, which is constrained by the cell size, structure, membrane, and organelles form physical boundaries. The rate of diffusion of water molecules in cellular tissues is usually described by means of an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which is always lower than that of free water. Many treatments, such as radiation and/or chemotherapy, can result in the loss of the cell membrane integrity that may affect water diffusion and perfusion. Thus, DW-MRI can provide microstructural information on the cellular level in a detectable way long before tumor size reductions are seen. This ability aids in determining prognosis as well as planning treatment strategies.\nDiffusion-weighted images acquired at a minimum of two sensitivity levels defined by the sequence b-value provide an estimate of ADC, which represents the magnitude of random motion of water molecules. ADC value is impeded by cellular packing, cell membrane and macromolecules presented in the various tissues, and displays lower especially in tumors. On the other hand, ADC values are often increased in the necrotic regions and tissues with damaged or permeable cell membranes. Therefore, variation in ADC values reflects the alteration and redistribution of water molecules between intracellular and extracellular compartments of tissue.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>\nThe b-value determines the extent of DW in a scan. The proper selection of b-value is an important technical consideration, and dependent on the given body DWI application and objective. Observed signal attenuation differs in different tissues, which may follow the two types of decay models: Bi-exponential behavior and a single exponential behavior. In most clinical DWI studies, the bi-exponential behavior of signal attenuation is not observed due to the low b-values used. Therefore, it is common practice to fit the DWI data to a single exponential decay model.\nQuantitative DCE-MRI parameters can be used to differentiate malignant tumors from benign ones. This application of research is mainly documented in breast and prostate cancer, where malignant lesions usually have higher Ktrans than benign tumors and tumor-like growths.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7,13]</u> Malignant lesions have rapid and high amplitude contrast medium wash-in followed by a relatively rapid wash-out, whereas benign lesions are characterized by contrast medium wash-in followed by persistent enhancement, due to a lower degree of angiogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18]</u> These results are consistent with recently reported documents of malignant tumors in the head and neck including the sinonasal area.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u> Xian et al. demonstrated a significant difference in ve between epithelial and nonepithelial malignant tumors and a significant difference in kep and ve between malignant epithelial tumors and lymphomas in the sinonasal region.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>\nTumors differ in their cellularity, and this difference may reflect their histologic composition and biologic aggressiveness. In a study that included carcinomas, lymphomas, benign salivary gland adenomas and benign cysts,通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> the mean ADC value of benign solid lesions significantly higher than that of malignant tumors was found. In the same way, investigators have found that benign liver lesions, such as cysts and hemangiomas, have higher mean ADC values than malignant lesions, such as metastases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23]</u>\nMany DCE-MRI studies have suggested that quantitative parameters can be used as potential markers for prediction of treatment response and long-term survival.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,24]</u> Ktrans reflects a combination of tumor blood flow and microvascular permeability. On the other hand, Ktrans values are also used to monitor response to cancer therapies.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> In addition to Ktrans, the other kinetic analysis of DCE-MRI data, ve, vp and kep, are also used to describe the uptake of low molecular weight gadolinium-medium contrast agents. The parameter ve reflects the EES, which is composed of interstitial fluid and connective tissue arranged in a supportive frame structure and restricted by blood vessel walls and cell plasma membranes. Interestingly, controversy exists in the previous and current research, as other recently published papers exhibited the importance of ve, vp and kep as prognostic biomarkers of clinical outcome in patients with cancers of other regions.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27,28]</u> Given the inherently different physiologic information that these parameters offer, we believe these parameters may play a complementary role in the evaluation of all oncological treatment response when used in combination with other quantitative and qualitative parameters. If confirmed in a larger trial, the prognostic significance of the DCE-MRI parameters would be useful to stratify patients in future clinical trials and to identify therapeutic regimen individually.\nDiffusion-weighted imaging-MRI can be used to detect microstructural changes that precede changes in tumor size as an indication of tumor response to therapy. For many organs and tumor types, a tumor initially demonstrates decreased ADCs relative to the surrounding tissue due to diffusion restriction caused by high cell density in the tumor. Effective treatment on oncology results in tumor lysis, loss of cell membrane integrity, increased extracellular space. So, a positive response to treatment may tend to result in an increase in ADC.\nThese quantitative MRI parameters have been investigated extensively in the evaluation of treatment response in different malignant tumors. Recent research focusing on these aspects includes data on breast cancer, prostate cancer, colonic and rectal cancer, malignant liver lesions, and head and neck cancer.\nDiffusion-weighted imaging and DCE-MRI are under development for monitoring response to cancer therapies.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> Incremental ADC increase over chemotherapeutic treatment cycles is found in a number of breast cancer studies通用删除6(英):<u>[29,30,31,32]</u> while the morphological change did not detect until second cycle of chemotherapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> The increase in ADC values was due to both activation of apoptosis and presentation of cell death within the tumor,通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> which can be detected as early as 3 days after treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> Decrease in the transfer of gadolinium contrast from blood vessels to tumor tissue, measured by Ktrans, is observed with cytotoxic therapy通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> and antiangiogenic therapies in breast cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> This result supports the idea that successful treatment where killing of tumor cells causes vascular shutdown due to loss of the proangiogenic cytokine may result in apoptosis of proliferating endothelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>\nApparent diffusion coefficient increase was found in response to both radiotherapy and antihormonal therapy,通用删除6(英):<u>[38,39]</u> and patients with high Ktrans value before treatment were demonstrated response to chemoradiation therapy and prolonged survival.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> In the evaluation of local tumor progression of prostate cancer after high-intensity focused ultrasonic ablation, DCE-MRI was more sensitive than T2-weighted MRI with DWI, but T2-weighted MRI with DWI was more specific than DCE-MRI通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> or T2-weighted MRI alone.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> In another study, multiparametric MRI, including DW-MRI, can achieve accuracy levels of 80–90% in the detection of recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy, which may have implications for determining presence or absence of local recurrence and subsequent local salvage therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>\nChange of the ADC value in rectal cancer was unlike others. Pretreatment ADC values in rectal cancer patients were found to be negatively correlated with percentage size change of tumors after chemotherapy and chemoradiation: The presence of higher pretreatment ADC values reflected necrotic tumors that were resistant to therapy. Persistence of low ADC in responders after chemotherapy could represent a loss of a nonviable fraction of the treated tumor.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> Another explanation is that this manifestation was attributed to the possible increase in fibrosis and proctitis in response to treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>\nIn the study by DeVries et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> a significant difference in the intratumoral frequencies of perfusion index values before therapy was found between patients responding to chemoradiation and those not responding. This finding allows the formulation of the hypotheses for advanced primary rectal carcinoma: The response to chemoradiation is determined by tumor microcirculation before therapy.\nSeveral studies demonstrated that ADC increases correlated with response to systemic chemotherapy of liver metastases of breast and colorectal cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[46,47,48]</u> In a study of 24 patients with unresectable HCC undergoing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), mean tumor size was unchanged up to 4 weeks after TACE whereas reduction in tumor ADC was significant 1–2 weeks after therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> In this way, the use of DW-MRI seems to be an advantage over tumor morphology.\nMagnetic resonance perfusion derived HCC parameters, Ktrans and Kep, were sensitive imaging biomarkers. Higher baseline Ktrans value and more substantial drop in Ktrans and Kep at 2 weeks after therapy correlated with better clinical outcome.通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u> This manifestation reflected the underlying tumor permeability changes induced by antiangiogenic therapy.\nApparent diffusion coefficient value can be used as a biomarker for the prediction and early detection of response to concurrent chemoradiation therapy in head and neck cancer. Primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes with lower ADC values are more likely to have a better response to the treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[51,52]</u> Follow-up and early response to treatment have shown ADC increase in both primary tumor and nodal metastasis.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,52,53,54]</u> In complete responders significant increase in ADC was observed within 1-week of treatment that continued until the end of treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u>\nMalignant tumors responsive to chemoradiation therapy have significantly higher Ktrans values before treatment than those partial response or no response.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,20,24]</u> The responders show prolonged survival in the follow-up study. These results support the idea that relatively higher blood flow in tumors associated with increased oxygenation levels may result in better access to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiosensitivity.通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u> However, one study of squamous cell carcinoma in head and neck failed to show a significant difference in ve, vp and keP values between responders and nonresponders.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>\nDiffusion-weighted-MRI may be useful in assessing response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Tumors with no increase in ADC showed a poor response to chemotherapy on their histology results.通用删除6(英):<u>[56,57]</u> At mid-course of treatment, the ADC differential (ADCpost − ADCpre) had 100% sensitivity and 57% specificity for predicting poor responders.通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u> In another study, the patients with a good response had a significantly higher minimum ADC ratio ([ADCpost − ADCpre]/ADCpre) than those with a poor response.通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u> DCE-MRI was also a prognostic factor for indicative of histologic response to neoadjuvant therapy. In the analysis by Guo et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> response was found as a time-dependent covariate and Ktrans, vp, and Δkep at week 9 were significantly different between responders and nonresponders.\nAs more individualized, biomarker-driven therapies are developed, and with cost incentives for comparative effectiveness research to assess these individualized therapies, the multidisciplinary nature of oncology research must be accommodated. The multiparametric MRI approach including anatomical and functional imaging techniques proves to be the optimal approach in the diagnosis of tumors and prediction and evaluation of treatment response.通用删除6(英):<u>[30,58,59]</u> However, prospective and multi-center studies must be conducted to assess quantitative MRI parameters as the most appropriate imaging biomarkers.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:25:08", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:25:45", "cost": 37.205}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:25:45", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:25:07"}

It is not only an emergency measure for controlling aneurysmal bleeding, but also a helpful means for accurate and meticulous dissection and clipping of an intracranial aneurysm with the advantage of minimizing the chance of its premature rupture or causing damage to the vital neurovascular structures. This technique is especially useful for treating large or giant aneurysms, carotid-ophthalmic arterial aneurysms, or thin-walled and complicated aneurysms tightly adherent to their surrounding tissues. A series of 52 patients with temporary clipping of the involved arteries during intracranial aneurysm surgery were reviewed retrospectively, which represented 37.1% of all aneurysms operated on in Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical University during the same period (from 1980 to 1990). Of them, one died (1.9%), 10(19.2%) had immediate or early neurological deficits which were mostly resolved later. A follow-up study with an average time of 3.8 years showed that 98% of patients had an excellent and good recovery without significant deficits. Comparing these results with those in 88 patients with aneurysms operated on over the same period in which temporary clips were not used, there is clearly no significant difference. The use of brain protectors, barbiturates, hypothermia and some monitoring systems can increase the safe coefficient to the brain and reduce the occurrence of ischemic complications during the application of temporary arterial occlusion. However, there is so far neither an absolute reliable medication or monitor, nor a well accepted safe time-limits to vascular occlusion. Therefore, the use of temporary arterial occlusion and time-limits for its application during the operation should be individualized depending basically on the patient's age, the clinical grade of the patint, the estimated adequacy of the collateral circulation, the location of the aneurysm and its relation to the surrounding tissues, the site of the artery to be occluded, and the involvement of the important perforating arteries.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 09:58:24", "endTime": "2024/10/09 09:58:31", "cost": 6.798}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 17:58:30", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 17:58:23"}

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) secondary to perinatal asphyxia occurs in 1 to 2 per 1000 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Early and accurate diagnosis and prediction of outcome in neonates with encephalopathy is important for early clinical management and counseling of the parents. Moreover, early, accurate and quantitative assessment might serve as a decision point in determining if neuroprotection by using hypothermia is indicated. Therefore, it is critical to understand the evolution of early changes in the brain after the injury.\nMR has an increasing role thanks to its great sensitivity and specificity. Still, one issue with conventional T1 and T2-weighed MR imaging is subjectivity, meaning that the diagnostic accuracy relies on the ability of the reader to detect subtle abnormalities. Advanced MR techniques provide quantitative MR biomarkers such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), fractional anisotropy (FA) on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurochemical alterations on MR spectroscopy (MRS). Most of the centers perform neonatal clinical MR imaging at 0.5-1.5T. During the recent years, an increased utilization of 3.0T magnet in clinical settings has improved the image and diagnostic quality. Because the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved, the total data acquisition time is reduced. Furthermore, for MRS, higher magnetic field allows a larger separated spectroscopy of the metabolites. The radiofrequency power is also increased, whilst the specific absorption rates (SAR) at 3T are not prohibitive for neonatal scanning after adjusting for radiological safety guidelines通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\nThe aim of this review is to present in a systematic order MR findings at 3T in neonatal HIE using conventional imaging and advanced MR techniques, such as DWI, DTI and MRS. The time course of lesions for each technique is emphasized, and correlated with the neurological outcome.\nA successful acquisition relies on an immobile baby, so it requires a careful preparation. Neonates might be examined during natural sleep or under light sedation. Fast sequences such as DWI and DTI bring acoustic noise, and it is more intense at 3T, so that ear protection should be used. In our institution, MR acquisitions are performed early in the morning, when the neonates are spontaneously asleep, and they are positioned in a vacuum immobilization pillow to minimize body and head movements 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Ear-muffs are placed to minimize reactions to noise exposure. Oxygen saturation and electrocardiography are monitored throughout the acquisition. The sequences generating more noise are realized at the end of the exam and the total scanning time is reduced as short as possible in order to limit the motion artifact.\nNeonates with severe encephalopathy may be in coma or ventilator-dependent in the first few days, therefore MR-compatible ventilator equipment may be necessary during the MR acquisition. When not available, a hand-bag should be used during the short examination procedure.\nImaging at 3T provides more details of the developing brain. The increased SNR allows high-resolution images within acceptable acquisition times. At 3T, an increased conspicuity of vessels is noticeable on T1 weighted images, so that an inversion recovery (IR) sequence could be a good alternative for T1 weighted images to avoid vessel contamination 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>; moreover it offers an extremely high contrast between gray and white matter and between myelinated and unmyelinated white matter.\nDiffusion imaging at 3T benefits from a higher SNR and less geometric distortion artifacts, when these acquisitions are combined to high accelerative parallel imaging techniques such as SENSE. Due to the improving SNR, the examination time is shortened but also the partial volume effects are reduced, which is beneficial for fibre tracking.\nFor MRS, greater accuracy in quantitative measurements and minimized partial-volume effects are observed at 3T by reducing the voxel size. Increased chemical shift separation allows a clearer separation of peaks that are too close to each other at 1.5T, for example, glutamate, glutamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\nFor more than a decade, T1- and T2-weighted imaging has been considered an essential modality for imaging the neonatal brain 通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7,8]</u>. The basic information for the diagnosis is provided by T1- and T2-weighted images, depicting typical MRI features of hypoxic-ischemic damage. The imaging pattern of HIE has been classified into three types 通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8,9]</u>: parasagittal lesions involving vascular boundary zones, profound lesions located in the basal ganglia or thalamus and multicystic encephalomalacia. Parasagittal lesions are usually associated with milder HIE, and typically involve the parasagittal cortico-subcortical regions. In the acute phase, the affected cortex shows areas with high T2 signal intensity and low T1 signal intensity, due to the presence of edema. As the lesion evolves, cortical thinning becomes evident. Profound lesions in the basal ganglia and thalamus are often associated with moderate or severe HIE. Increased signal intensity on T1 can be detected 3-7 days after the insult, and decreased T2 signal intensity can be seen a little later after 6-10 days 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. A complete loss or change in the normal signal intensity of the posterior limb of internal capsules (PLIC) may be seen in case of perinatal asphyxia. The posterior part of PLIC have already myelinated in full-term neonates, therefore the signal from myelin may be diminished due to an anoxic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Multicystic encephalomalacia occurs, when the anoxic insult is particularly severe and a diffuse damage ensues in the whole brain. Diffuse T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity can be detected in the first 2-3 days due to the brain swelling, followed by marked T1 hyperintensity and T2 hypointensity in the basal ganglia and thalami. The cavitations are formed rapidly and calcification can be detected on CT in 3-4 weeks.\nThe changes seen on routine T1- and T2-weighted images are characteristic, but are often subtle and may not be obvious until several days after the injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13]</u>. At the acute stage, brain swelling on T1- or T2-weighted images may be associated with some loss of gray/white matter differentiation, and with the evolution of the diseases, abnormal signals could be apparent in the following weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Because of the unmyelinated white matter, potential signal abnormalities on T2-weighted images can be masked by the high T2 signal of white matter. During the first weeks of life, T1 shortening (hypersignal on T1-weighted images) lesions can be seen before becoming obvious on T2-weighted images. These signal changes might be due to lipid breakdown products of myelin or mineralization 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\nRecently a meta-analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> was reported on the prognostic utilities of various quantitative cerebral MR biomarkers in neonatal encephalopathy. Thirty-two studies were included between January 1990 and July 2008. For predicting adverse outcome, conventional MR during the first 30 days had a pooled sensitivity of 91% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 87%-94%) and specificity of 51% (95% CI: 45%-58%). The pattern of injury identified with conventional MRI may provide diagnostic and prognostic information for the neonatal encephalopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[9,15]</u>. The infants who show abnormal signal intensity in the basal ganglia/ thalami or the PLIC usually undergo a poor neurodevelopmental outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>[10, 15]</u>.\nDiffusion imaging is based on the random thermal movement of molecules (i.e. Brownian motion). The technique uses fast (echo-planar) imaging methods which make it less sensitive to patient motion, with an acquisition time limited to less than one minute通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Quantification of this motion can be measured by ADC, which presents the averaged magnitude of water diffusion. Hypoxia or ischemia may damage the brain by causing focal lesions or diffuse injury. One study indicated that a hypersignal in DWI with a decrease of ADC was detected in focal lesions; this might be due to the restriction of extracellular water motion by cell swelling resulting in cytotoxic edema 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\nDWI has proven to be very sensitive in early detection of acute cerebral ischemia, and may detect the lesions in HIE when for conventional MRI it is too early to show any tissue abnormalities. A number of studies have been performed to evaluate the ADC changes in different time course. Decreased ADC and visual abnormalities on DWI are most detected during 1-4 days after delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> at the moment when conventional imaging may not be that obviously abnormal . Over time, ADC values might return to normal \"pseudonormalization\" at approximately 7 days after injury. Following pseudonormalization, ADC values become higher than normal during week 2 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>.\nAs reported by the meta-analysis study 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>, ADC had a sensitivity of 66% (95% CI: 52%-79%) and a specificity of 64% (95%CI: 35%-87%) for predicting later neurological outcome. Meanwhile, the location of abnormal diffusion parameters is also an important factor; in term infants with HIE, low values of ADC in the PLIC predict relatively poor outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\nDTI is currently the best available non-invasive technique to explore white matter structure in newborns. DTI is a diffusion-weighted technique with at least 6 directions, however generally, 32 directions or more are necessary. The DTI indices, such as FA which expresses the fraction of diffusion anisotropic and mean diffusivity (MD) corresponding to the directionally averaged magnitude of water diffusion, allow us to assess and quantify water diffusion at a microstructural level. Diffusion tensor tractography consists in the reconstruction of the principal white matter tracts in preterm infants' brain, even before myelination becomes histologically evident 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> .\nLike ADC, MD is less sensitive to perinatal brain injury after 7 days as compared to the conventional MR because of transient pseudonormalization. Consequently, ADC or MD has been combined with other MR parameters to evaluate the entire temporal evolution of lesions. Diffusion anisotropy values (e.g. FA) decline and remain reduced during the sub-acute and chronic phases of cerebral ischemia, due to disruption of the cytoarchitecture 通用删除6(英):<u>[20, 21]</u>.\nFewer studies of diffusion anisotropy were reported concerning its predictive value of long term follow-up compared to the studies of ADC. Arzoumanian and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> evaluated DTI studies at term-equivalent age and follow-up at a corrected gestational age of 18-24 months on 137 preterm neonates, and found that FA values in the right PLIC were significantly lower for preterm infants with cerebral palsy compared with the control group. Neonatal diffusion tensor imaging may allow earlier detection of specific microstructural abnormalities in infants at risk of neonatal HIE. However, future studies are necessary to evaluate the predictive value of the diffusion anisotropy on long-term neurological outcomes.\nMRS is a noninvasive tool that allows analyzing the neurochemicals and metabolites in the human brain. Due to the rapid growth and turnover of the membranes in the neonatal brain, the N-acetylaspartate (NAA; 2.01 ppm) level is much smaller than the Choline (Cho; 3.02 ppm) 通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24,25,26]</u>. During the early brain development, NAA increases, reflecting the active myelination. Choline (Cho) is a marker for membrane synthesis and Creatine (Cr; 3.0 ppm) was chosen as the metabolite of reference because of its stability. With the brain development, there is a rapid increase of NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr ratios in the first 3 months after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> .\nLactate (Lac; 1.33 ppm) presents very small amounts in the term neonates and is hardly detectable by MRS 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>. However, in injured neonates with HIE, a large quantity of lactate is typically present 通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29,30]</u>, due to anaerobic respiration. MRS shows elevated Lactates, decreased NAA and Cr in an early stage, before anomalies are detected on conventional MR imaging. Abnormal metabolite ratios could be detected on MRS as soon as within the first 24 hours after brain injury 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>. Later on, Lac/NAA ratio in the basal ganglia and thalami increased during the first 4 days, and tended to worsen until about day 5 and then normalize; still, sometimes, abnormal metabolite ratios persisted 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> .\nSeveral studies found a reduced NAA and increased Lac in the basal ganglia, which were correlated with poor neurological outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29,30,31,32]</u>. The meta-analysis in neonatal encephalopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> concluded that in deep gray matter, Lac/NAA peak-area ratio had an 82% sensitivity (95% CI: 74%-89%) and a 95% specificity (95% CI: 88%-99%). Lac/NAA carried a better diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional MRI as well as brain ADC evaluation at any time during neonatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Thus, whenever performing a MRS, the region of interest of signal voxel or multiple voxel should include the basal ganglia/thalamus. Moreover, the use of a long TE corresponding to the inversed peak of lactate is preferable for a better evaluation of the metabolic changes.\nThe neonatal brain can be imaged safely at 3T; the increased SNR allows faster imaging with improved image quality. Conventional MR imaging and advanced techniques play an important role in the evaluation of neonatal HIE. Diffusion imaging and MRS allow early detection of the disease and improve the accuracy of prognosis. Conventional MR with DWI and MRS is now recommended to be performed between days 2 and 8 after birth in order to establish the pattern of injury and to predict the neurologic outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:38:42", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:39:30", "cost": 47.422}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:39:29", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:38:42"}

With the increasing longevity and declining fertility rates, the global pace of population ageing is getting faster in the new century 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>, and TB in the older adults is becoming clinically important in many countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. It is reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) that TB notification rates in older people (aged 65 years old and above) was higher than other 10-years interval groups in 2016 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>, and many countries witness that the proportion of older TB patients remains high and has even increased in some areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>, with an increase disproportionately greater than the rise in the number of older persons.\nChina, a country with the second large TB burden in the world, is challenged by the shifting of TB from younger to elderly due to the ageing population, longer life expectancy and reactivation disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6,7]</u>. WHO estimated that the percentage of people aged 60 years or over in China is expected to increase from 12.4% (168 million people) in 2010 to 28.0% (402 million) in 2040 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. In China, the fifth national TB prevalence survey conducted in 2010 showed the TB prevalence increased with age and peaked in the 75-79 age group, hitting 866/100 000 通用删除6(英):<u>[5, 8]</u>. According to estimation by Huynh et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>, China is unlikely to achieve the incidence target if the National Tuberculosis Program NTP failed to reduce TB incidence among elderlies. Significant impacts of elderly TB control on TB programs had already been observed in Japan, and also in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. If China aims to achieve the milestone of End TB Strategy, the country has to strategically prioritize TB control among the elderlies. There are several approaches recommended to address elderly TB control in China and the choice should be based on TB burden among the elderlies 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>. TB epidemic in this high risk population should be understood and is very helpful for policy making.\nAlthough there are already TB surveillance systems in China, including Infectious Disease Reporting System (IDRS) and TB Information Management System (TBIMS), the real TB incidence rate can not be obtained directly from them. IDRS, an extensive web-based and real-time surveillance system, enables all health facilities across the country to report information on the 37 notifiable diseases (including TB) within 24 h 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. And, the users of IDRS comprise all TB health facilities, including TB dispensaries and designated hospitals, at province, prefecture and county level 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. However, TBIMS do not cover non-designated TB facilities, and all information covered by this system are about diagnosed TB patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. A special module in TBIMS acts as an interface between TBIMS and IDRS, and information for one case can be simultaneously updated in these two systems. However, under-reporting of diagnosed TB has also existed in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. A recent retrospective inventory studies conducted in nine counties, by reviewing medical records at the participating health facilities and county-level social insurance system databases, reported that nearly 20% of TB patients were not reported to TBIMS, being higher percentage for children with TB, TB pleurisy, patients diagnosed in the eastern and central regions and patients with a TB diagnosis recorded in either health facilities or social insurance system 通用删除6(英):<u>[14, 15]</u>.\nReported TB incidence rate for each age group could be obtained from IDRS, and the reported TB incidence for elderly was two to three times of that for younger adults, being similar difference on TB prevalence rates between these two groups, obtained from the Fifth National Tuberculosis Prevalence Survey 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. However, this reported incidence underestimated the real status for elderly, because of both the missed cases by surveillance system itself and undiagnosed TB cases resulted from a high percent of asymptomatic TB patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. We established an elderly incidence cohort without TB by conducting a prevalence survey in selected sites in 2013, and utilized both active and passive case findings to capture all incident TB patients during two-year follow-up period, aiming to obtain the real TB incidence rate and identify risk factors for developing TB among elderly.\nWe conducted a prevalence survey in selected sites from July to September in 2013, to establish an elderly cohort without TB. The study sites selection and diagnostic algorithm in that prevalence survey has been described fully elsewhere 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. In brief, the study adopted a three-stage cluster and random sampling for selecting study sites , and finally 10 townships and 17 communities located in 10 counties covering 38 888 elderly were selected. For each elderly, door-to-door interview for data collection, physical examination for calculating body mass index (BMI), and chest X-ray (CXR) examination were provided for them. Those elderlies who had suspected TB symptom or abnormal chest radiography were required to provide three sputum specimens (one \"at spot\", one in early morning and one at night) for laboratory diagnosis. Finally, 4619 refused to participate this prevalence survey, leaving 34 269 elderlies finishing all required procedure, and 193 active TB cases were identified.\nThe information obtained from door-to-door interview, including demographic, most of disease history, lifestyle and suspected TB symptoms, were totally self-reported by participants, except for history of diabetes and treated TB previously. For diabetes information, we also checked their personal health document covered by the National Basic Public Health Service Project and updated by year. Participants self-reporting diabetes history or with a medical record for diabetes diagnosis were classified as known diabetes patients. For retreated TB patients, we checked TBIMS to identify whether participants were diagnosed with TB and finished treatment or cured, and either selfreporting or recorded as a treated TB patient previously was classified as retreated TB cases.\nThe sample size was calculated for a population cohort study. TB incidence rates for general population with TB history and without TB history were 2706.3 per 100 000 person-year (PY) and 39.6 per 100 000 PY, respectively, obtained from another cohort study in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. Assuming TB incidence rate among elderly being two times of that for general population, we used 5412.6/100 000 person-year and 79.2/100 000 person-year as the estimated TB incidence for elderly with TB history 通用删除11(英):<u>(P1)</u> and that for elderly without TB history 通用删除11(英):<u>(P2)</u>. The study was set at a power of 0.8 (one-side) and two-tailed significance of 0.05. Based on the formula, a total of 146 elderly with TB history should be recruited. Assuming the percentage of persons with TB history in elderly was 20% higher than that in general population (0.42% obtained from cohort study in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>), the number of elderly needed to registered into cohort should be 28 765. Considering a 15% non-response rate and lost to follow up, we increased the sample size to 33 080. In the 27 study sites, people who were born before September 31, 1948 (aged 65 years and older at the time of implementing baseline prevalence survey), continuously lived in the village or community for six-month and longer were eligible for our prospective study. Excluding 193 active TB identified in baseline prevalence survey, 34 076 elderlies without TB were enrolled into our incidence study.\nOur study population enrolled at baseline was set as a fixed cohort during this prospective study period, that is, only elderly enrolled into our incidence study at baseline will be followed up, and, those uncovered at baseline and met inclusion criteria during the two-year follow-up period were excluded from our analysis.\nThe informed consent was obtained from all participants before the door-to-door interview at baseline survey. For elderlies with difficulties in communication, his/her family members were interviewed as the respondent. During the two-year follow-up period, for those who were diagnosed as active TB cases, the information of TB occurrence and date were immediately recorded, and further identified in TBIMS. And, every year for the follow-up period, we conducted a door-to-door investigation to identify the follow-up status for each participant, and promote them to participate required chest radiography examination. Meanwhile, the information of other outcomes, including death, transfer out or move, and the date of outcome occurrence were asked and recorded accurately.\nFrom October 2013 to September 2015, we conducted both active and passive case finding annually to detect and diagnose incident TB patients among this study cohort. For active case finding, the same procedure and diagnostic algorithm as baseline prevalence survey were used, that is, TB symptom screening and chest radiography examination were provided for each sampled elderly, and sputum smear microscopy and culture were performed for those with TB symptoms or abnormal chest radiography. For passive case finding, we asked detailed TB symptoms information among elderlies who actively visited township hospitals and village clinics during the study period. CXR and collection of sputum specimen were administered to those with TB suspected symptoms. If there were any TB cases reported during the study period, we collected their diagnosis and date. For those being diagnosed as TB cases by active case finding or passive case finding, treatment was arranged by local hospitals.\nWe measured the study outcomes as incident active TB, death, transfer and moving out from study sites, and refusal to receive yearly chest radiography during the follow-up period. We observed and recorded whichever came first as an endpoint in the study according to the door-to-door interview, passive case finding and yearly screening.\nActive TB included bacteriologically positive TB and clinical diagnosed TB. A bacteriologically positive TB patient was defined as an individual with at least one sputum smear or culture positive. Smear positive was that the sputum specimen had at least one acid-fast bacillus identified within 100 fields under microscopy. Culture positive was that the specimen had at least one colony of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex being isolated by using Löwenstein-Jensen medium 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. The clinical diagnosed TB was defined by the presence of three negative smears and CXR abnormalities consistent with active pulmonary TB, and meeting at least one of the following criteria: clinical TB symptoms, or strong positive purified protein derivative reaction, or TB lesions confirmed by histopathological examination of extrapulmonary tissue, or excluding other pulmonary disease by diagnostic treatment or follow-up observations 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. The elderly who moved out and did not come back during the study period was recorded as transferred or moved out. Refusal was defined as an elderly who refused to provide information, or to finish all requested TB check procedure. Moved or transferred out and refusal were categorized as lost-to-follow-up in analysis of this study.\nStrict quality control was performed across the whole study process. The questionnaire interview was carried out among all eligible elderly face to face by trained staff at county level. Questionnaires collected were checked by data management specialist for completeness and logicality. After completing data entry, 2% of questionnaires were randomly selected for consistency check by the national expert group. If discrepancies identified, information was revised on the second day by asking the responsible interviewer. If the interviewer could not work out the discrepancy, enquires were made to local staff to check with the respondent. All chest radiography films and sputum specimens collected were transported to TB designated hospital at county level for diagnosis confirmation and strain identification. All chest radiography films for TB cases were reviewed by a national expert group within two months after yearly follow-up completion. The smear positive TB was assessed and classified strictly by trained laboratory technicians at county level according to the national standardized methods and procedure. The quality of culture conducted in county laboratory was supervised and monitored by prefectural or provincial TB laboratory. All the sputum smear and culture results were checked by the staff from the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory for quality control. In addition to the rigorous internal quality control for data collection, this study also had an independent site auditing team from WESTAT (Rockville, MD, USA). The field inspectors from WESTAT went to study sites regularly to check if the procedure performed followed the research legislation in terms of consent, progress, storage and maintenance of records by working with the research team in the field to ensure study procedure being in line with the study design and guarantee the data quality in terms of completion and authenticity.\nWe developed a web-based dataset for data entry and management. All data collected from baseline and followup surveys were double entered. Data clean and consistency check were performed by the national study team. Statistical inference followed standard procedure for data analysis. Pearson’s χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test was used to test for differences in proportions. Two-sided P-values of < 0.05 were considered significant. The TB incidence rates for bacteriologically positive and active TB were calculated and expressed as cases per 100 000 PY. The follow-up period, from the date of enrolment to the occurrence of incident TB, death, transfer or moving out, completion of follow-up or the end of the study, was computed as the time passed. PY for each participant in this cohort was calculated based on individual information, that is, the interval of finishing baseline survey date and the exact date of outcome occurrence was calculated one by one and considered as his/her PY.\nUnivariate cox proportional regression model was performed with time dependent covariate in relation to TB incidence using a forward inclusion approach. Demographic character, yearly household income per head, history of diseases, smoking and drinking status, and BMI at baseline were regarded as influence factor and included into our analysis. We classified those with less than RMB 2300 income per year as low-income group according to the national poor standard 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011)</u>, and for those with more income, we divided them into two groups by cutoff point being RMB 10 000. According to disease history, participants was classified into yes or no or unknown groups. We categorized BMI as underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (≥ 18.5 kg/m2 and < 24.0 kg/m2), overweight and obese (≥ 24.0 kg/m2) 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. Variables significantly correlated in the univariate model and of epidemiological interest were included in the multivariate model. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the risk of developing TB. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software .\nBased on the results from multivariate analysis, we calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of each risk factor contributing to incident TB among elderlies. We used the adjusted HR and baseline prevalence of each associated factor among elderlies to estimate its contribution to bacteriologically positive and active TB, respectively.\nThe study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Committee of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Approval number: 201322). The signed informed consent was obtained from all participants before investigation.\nAmong the 34 269 elderly people finishing baseline prevalence survey, 193 were detected as active TB cases, leaving 34 076 elderlies in the two-year follow-up. At the end of follow-up period, 22 119 elderly people remained in the cohort for data analysis (Including those transferred out or moved, or refused follow-up check in the first follow-up year, and finished the second year follow-up check) .\nThe mean age of the study cohort was 73.0 (± 6.36 years old, ranged from 65 to 108 years old) and about two third were aged from 65 to 74 years. We compared the demographic characteristics of the elderly cohort followed up with those lost to follow-up during the study period, given the high proportion of elderlies deceased, refused to follow-up examination and moved or transferred out . There were significant more elderlies aged 75 and above (40.3%, P < 0.001) lost to follow up. Of the lost to follow-up cohort, most elderly (86.7%) were Han nationality (P < 0.001). A higher proportion of lost to follow up presented in elderlies with higher education (6.1% vs 19.4%; P < 0.001). Elderlies without spouse had higher proportion of lost to follow-up (P < 0.01). A greater proportion of elderlies who were not local residents lost to follow up during the study period (17.8% versus 2.9%; P < 0.001). A substantial proportion (64.9%) of elderly people who reported higher annual average income lost to follow up (P < 0.001). About 10% of the cohort had a BMI less than 18.5, and a greater proportion with BMI ≥ 24 lost to follow up (P < 0.001).\nComparison of characteristics between the follow-up and lost-to-follow up cohorts, 2013-2015*\n删除重复语句：<u>Comparison of characteristics between the follow-up and lost-to-follow up cohorts, 2013-2015*</u>\n# Others included single, divorced and widowed.

A total of 62 bacteriologically positive incident TB cases were identified and the incidence rate was 138.9 per 100 000 PY (95% CI: 104.4-173.5 per 100 000 PY).

In the multivariate model, ex or current smoker (HR = 2.12, 95% CI 1.27-3.54; P < 0.01) and BMI < 18.5 (HR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.32-4.12; P < 0.01) were the strong predictors in developing bacteriologically positive TB disease. For those elderlies with BMI ≥ 24.0, their risks in developing bacteriologically positive TB were substantially reduced by 66%.\nDuring the study period, a total of 215 active TB cases were detected and the incidence rate was 481.8 per 100 000 PY (95% CI: 417.4-546.2 per 100 000 PY) .

The results indicated that male, non-Han nationality, previously treated with TB, ex/current smoker and BMI < 18.5 were risk factors for developing TB disease among elderly in China.\nTB incidence is a key indicator to evaluate TB epidemic and the effectiveness of control strategy at country level as set in the END TB strategy by WHO 通用删除6(英):<u>[21,22,23]</u>. Although cohort study, as a kind of prospective study, had advantages of identifying causality and yielding incidence, this direct measurement of TB incidence is prohibitively complicated both logistically and financially, therefore, indirect estimation of TB incidence is widely used 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. For countries with reliable surveillance system, directly notification rate is used as incidence rate, including reporting the epidemiological status for elderly TB. In the literature we reviewed, TB incidence rate among elderlies was various in countries with high and low TB burden. For the United States and Germany, the reported average yearly rate of TB disease among aged 65 years and above was 10.9 per 100 000 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> and 11.2 per 100 000 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>, respectively. In South Africa, the reported incidence rate was 518-684 per 100 000 for male and 193-314 per 100 000 for female among people aged 65 years and older 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. An eight-year follow-up study conducted among the elderlies in Taiwan Province reported similar incidence rate (175.5 per 100 000 person-year) 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> to our study. The TB incidence rate we reported was higher than the rate reported by using IDRS data (about 155/100000 for the elderlies) due to the implementing of yearly active casing finding.\nElderlies are generally at risk to develop TB due to compromised immune responses and reactivation of previous \"latent TB\" or new TB infection 通用删除6(英):<u>[25, 28, 29]</u>. Our study identified that age, male 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>, smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>, previously treated TB, BMI < 18.5 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> and low annual household income as main risk factors for elderly TB, being very similar to other studies globally 通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31,32]</u>. A cohort study conducted in Taiwan Province reported that age older than 70 years, male, living in rural areas, diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and cancer were independent risk factors for incident TB among elderlies. This also highlighted the impact of TB comorbidity among elderlies 通用删除6(英):<u>[33,34,35]</u>. However, we did not identify diabetes as a risk factor for developing TB disease among our study population, as reported by studies conducted in Mexico 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> and Korea 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>, and also in Taiwan Province of China 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. There were several reasons underlay it. Firstly, the percentage of diabetes reported among our elderly cohort was 7.0%, which was much lower than reported prevalence, that is, diabetes prevalence being 20.2% in Chinese people aged 60 years and above, and only 36.5% of diabetes patients being aware of their diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>, resulting in under-reporting of diabetes. Secondly, in our study, diabetes status was mainly self-reported by participants at baseline, we did not perform clinical measurement. Moreover, about half of known diabetes patients lost to follow up during follow-up period.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated the contribution of risk factors to incident TB among elderlies in China. We obtained PAF of each risk factor identified in our study to incident TB among elderly. A study conducted in 22 high TB burden countries mostly in Africa and Asia reported that the top three contribution risk factors were malnutrition (27.0%), smoking (21.0%) and HIV infection (16.0%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>. In our study, the biggest contributor for elderly developing bacteriologically positive TB was ex−/current smoker followed by low BMI. For developing active TB, the biggest contributors were non-Han nationality, male sex and smoking. This finding provide the basic data for evaluating the impact of different intervention strategy, and has an important public health implication. It will be very useful for policy maker, especially in resource limited regions.\nWe observed a high proportion of lost-to-follow-up over the two-year study period, inevitably producing effect on results. In our study, the main reason of high lost-to-follow-up was that participants were healthy elderlies without TB, resulting in a high proportion (about 30%) of them refused the follow-up check. High proportion of lost-to-follow-up was also reported by other cohort studies, even if participants were TB patients. A community-based cohort study conducted among people aged older than 14 years in Southern Ethiopia reported about 1.0% lost-to-follow-up during the first half year over the follow-up period 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>, and 6.9% of TB patients lost to follow-up during 2 years was reported by a study conducted in Colombian prisons 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. In older TB patients, the proportion of death and lost-to-follow-up hit 12.3% and transfer-out was 3.9%, indicated by a study conducted in India 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>. Another reason was that about 8.1% of participants was internal migrants who moved around after living in a place for some time, and 77% of them lost to follow up. In addition, another 5% of our study population was transferred out during the followup period.\nAs a well-designed study with a large number of participants in China, our study has the following strengths. Firstly, it was designed as a prospective cohort study that captured incident TB cases among our cohort and obtained the true TB incidence by performing regular CXR in the follow-up period. Secondly, our study was a random sampled population-based study. It avoided the selection bias existing such as in hospital-based studies, which possibly resulted in a high yield of incident cases as people with risk factors for TB are likely visiting hospitals. For example, in two pilot studies conducted in China to screen TB among diabetes patients, the clinic based study yielded higher TB notification than the community one 通用删除6(英):<u>[42, 43]</u>. Finally, our study had a very strict quality control including internal quality control measurements and external supervision for study procedure and data collection to ensure the study quality.\nOur study has several limitations. First, a high proportion of lost-to-follow-up presented among the elderlies with TB risk factors. This might result in an underestimation of TB incidence among elderlies. Second, due to the restriction of funding and resources, we could only conduct a two-year follow-up. However, TB is a chronic infectious disease and the onset of disease took time and only happened once immunity weakened. Two-year follow up was therefore not long enough to capture all TB incidences. We recommend longer follow up among the elderlies in future studies.\nAlthough with some limitations, in the context of ending TB, our population-based prospective cohort study reported a very important area in TB control in a country with high TB burden. By investigating the TB incidence among elderly in China, we provided scientific evidence for the urgent need in conducting active case finding among elderly, a group of TB patients who often do not present TB symptoms. The PAF for TB identified the key population to implement intervention strategies in order to rapidly decrease the TB incidence rate. Based on our study, we could further observe the long term impact of active case finding on local TB epidemic among elderlies and further provide the optimal screening strategy, to reach the first milestone and the targets set in the End TB Strategy.\nFrom our finding, we conclude that the elderly population in China had a high TB incidence rate and risk to develop TB disease. Given the nature of elderly TB, active case finding should be applied among elderlies to detect more TB cases. Our findings from China, a country with high TB burden also could be referred by other countries with aging population and high TB burdens in order to achieve the targets set in the End TB Strategy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:12:11", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:12:44", "cost": 33.319}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:31", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:12:44", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:12:10"}

Propofol boluses (yes/no) were recorded for the entire case. The severity of hypotension was classified based on prior studies as follows: mild—systolic arterial pressure (SAP) = 51-60 mmHg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) = 36-45 mmHg if 0-6 months, and SAP = 61-70 mmHg, MAP = 41-50 mmHg if > 6 months; moderate—SAP = 41-50 mmHg, MAP = 26-35 mmHg if 0-6 months, and SAP = 51-60 mmHg, MAP = 31-40 mmHg if > 6 months; and severe—SAP < 41 mmHg, MAP < 26 mmHg if 0-6 months, and SAP < 51 mmHg, MAP < 31 mmHg if > 6 months, lasting > 3 minutes.删除4：<u>14</u> Physiological (PHILIPS IntelliVue MP50, Germany) data represent average values during these phases.\nThe prevalence of burst suppression was reported for the entire anesthesia time as well as for each phase (i.e. induction, preincision, surgical, and postsurgery). Histograms and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were used to assess normality. Continuous variables are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile interval), as appropriate. To assess the differences between the two groups, the t test was used for normally distributed continuous variables, whereas the Mann-Whitney U test was used for nonnormally distributed continuous variables.

The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for multiple comparisons, and the Bonferroni correction was used to adjust the significance threshold for the post hoc comparisons. Statistics were performed using SPSS 19.0, and we selected a significance threshold of P < 0.05 for comparisons between groups.\nFifty-eight patients were identified. EEG recording files of 4 patients were incomplete or unavailable, resulting in 54 evaluable patients . The patient’s age and weight were 11.0 (5.0-19.5) months and 9.2 (6.5-11.0) kg, respectively. Fifty-six percent (30/54) of patients had burst suppression. There were no differences between patients with burst suppression and without burst suppression in age, sex, weight, or American Society of Anesthesiologists score. More burst suppression event occurrences (18/30) were observed in the patient under sevoflurane anesthesia (P = 0.024). Virtually all patients who received propofol boluses had burst suppression (P = 0.033). The occurrence of burst suppression changed over anesthesia phases and was the highest during the induction phase . Accordingly, exposure to propofol boluses or induction anesthetics was associated with burst suppression. The remaining demographics and anesthesia factors did not differ significantly between patients with and without burst suppression.\nDemographics and anesthesia factors in patients with burst suppression and without burst suppression during total anesthesia phases\n删除重复语句：<u>Demographics and anesthesia factors in patients with burst suppression and without burst suppression during total anesthesia phases</u>\nData are presented as n (%) or median (interquartile range) or mean ± SD.

More burst suppression occurred in patients with mild or moderate hypotension than in patients without hypotension (P < 0.001).\nDuring the surgical phase, 33% (18/54) of patients had burst suppression, which was less than the overall incidence . The patients with burst suppression were younger and had lower body weights than patients without burst suppression (P = 0.002, P = 0.042, respectively). More burst suppression occurrences (14/18) were observed in the patients aged 1-12 months old (P = 0.024). There was no significant difference in end-tidal sevoflurane concentration nor propofol infusion rate between patients with and without burst suppression during the maintenance phase .

P value was calculated using Student’s t test.\nIn this pilot study, burst suppression events occurred in 56% of children 1-36 months of age undergoing surgery using sevoflurane or propofol and remifentanil infusion maintenance anesthesia. The prevalence was similar to data reported by Koch et al,15 who observed that 52% of children had burst suppression during general anesthesia. We demonstrated a significant difference in the prevalence of burst suppression between sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia (72% vs. 41%). Some previous studies observed that sevoflurane and propofol had different mechanisms of action on the brain and effects on EEG; propofol predominantly produces slow delta and alpha oscillations, while sevoflurane produces evenly distributed effects from the slow oscillation range through the alpha range;16,17,18 thus we hypothesis that different mechanisms of action lead to different incidences of burst suppression in children. Furthermore, the propofol and sevoflurane could reduce cerebral blood flow (CBF),19 and a study showed that sevoflurane could reduce CBF in children younger than 6 months, meanwhile, a significant decrease in MAP was observed which was associated with a significant variation in CBF velocity, this population is more sensitive to MAP decrease than older children because of a lower limit of cerebral autoregulation, and this limit may be 38 mmHg with sevoflurane anesthesia.删除4：<u>20</u> Beyond the range of autoregulation, CBF becomes more pressure-dependent. The lower the blood pressure, the lower the CBF, and the brain becomes ischemic.删除4：<u>21</u> Cerebral hypoxic and ischemic are associated with burst suppression.删除4：<u>22,23</u> According to the classification criteria of hypotension in our study, the limit MAP of 38 mmHg can be considered mild hypotension. Similarly, we observed that patients with hypotension experienced more burst suppression events throughout the entire anesthesia time, possibly because when cerebral autoregulation was impaired, the lower blood pressure had a more profound effect on decreasing cerebral perfusion, leading to burst suppression. The patients who received propofol boluses had more possibilities to develop burst suppression, which may be attributed to the administration of high doses of propofol to achieve deeper anesthesia and adapt the level of nociceptive stimulation during surgery. Administration of an additional propofol bolus, either before or after intubation, can result in either enhancement of the slow oscillation or the conversion of the slow oscillation into burst suppression.删除4：<u>7,24</u> Overall, propofol boluses, use of sevoflurane, and lower arterial pressure during anesthesia were associated with burst suppression events.\nMost patients experienced burst suppression during the induction phase . There was no significant difference in age between the patients with burst suppression and those without burst suppression during the induction phase. Patients were more likely to develop burst suppression after rapid injections of intravenous induction anesthetics. Therefore, if we analyzed the overall factors of all four phases, it could obscure the difference in age between the patients with burst suppression and those without burst suppression during the surgical phase, which is a phase with relatively appropriate anesthesia. When the patients were stratified by the burst suppression occurrence of the surgical phase, the prevalence of burst suppression was 33% and less than the total incidence. In other words, some patients experienced burst suppression only during the induction phase. During the surgical phase, there were significant differences in age and weight between the patients with burst suppression and without burst suppression, and patients aged 1-12 months experienced more burst suppression events. These changes could be explained by several structural and functional neurobiological factors associated with age. Neurodevelopmental processes that occur throughout childhood, including thalamocortical development, may underlie age-dependent changes in electroencephalogram power and coherence during anesthesia.删除4：<u>25</u> We suggest that patients under 1 year old with an immature brain are more vulnerable to the effects of the anesthetic. The mechanisms underlying burst suppression are currently poorly understood. Recent modeling studies suggest that a decrease in cerebral metabolic rate, coupled with the stabilizing properties of ATP-gated potassium channels, leads to the characteristic epochs of suppression.删除4：<u>26</u> In summary, the rapid administration of a higher dose of anesthetics has a more profound effect on the brains of children, which should be avoided as much as possible. During anesthesia maintenance, younger patients have a greater chance of experiencing burst suppression events.\nOur pilot study was not designed to evaluate determinants of burst suppression on EEG or powered to adjust for confounding with secondary analyses. As a result, the relationship between burst suppression and perioperative factors must be explained very carefully, as they may suffer from type 1 errors and confounding. For example, burst suppression could be due to an increased depth of anesthesia from propofol boluses, thus causing hypotension. We need more samples for regression analysis in future studies.\nIn summary, in all anesthesia phases, burst suppression events are common in children, especially when hypotension and propofol boluses occur during general anesthesia using sevoflurane for maintenance anesthesia.

We performed positron emission tomography (PET) of mediastinal masses in order to evaluate the ability of PET to predict the malignancy of these tumors. We compared histologic findings, videomediastinoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and PET-CT in patients with mediastinal disease. Methods Thirty-two patients were evaluated with CT, PET-CT and videomediastionoscopy, and all studies were performed within four weeks in each patient. 11C-choline as a PET tracer was used to visualize masses. PET data were evaluated using the standardized uptake value (SUV) and were compared with pathologic data.Results There were 13 men and 19 women aged from 21 to 74 (mean 45.2) years. Among the patients with mediastinal diseases, sarcoidosis was diagnosed in 12 patients, tuberculosis in 5 patients, lymphoma in 5 patients, and noncaseating granulomata without classical \"sarcoid\" finding in 3 patients. N2 or N3 nodal metastasis was revealed in 6 of 7 patients who had non-small cell lung cancer or suspected lung cancer, and one was negative (the pathological diagnosis was reactive hyperplasia). The accuracies for correctly diagnosing mediastinal masses for CT, PET-CT and videomediastinoscopy were 38% (12/32), 63% (20/32), and 91% (29/32) respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of videomediastinoscopy was superior to that of PET-CT (χ2=11.130,P&lt;0.001). The SUVs were similar among these diseases. On the other hand, if the diagnostic classification was benign vs malignancy, the accuracies for CT, PET-CT and videomediastinoscopy were 53% (17/32), 75% (24/32), 100% (32/32) respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of videomediastinoscopy was superior to that of PET-CT (χ2=22.042, P&lt;0.001). The SUV of malignant lesions (6.9, 3.2-9.8; n=11) appeared to be higher than that of benign lesions (4.9, 2.9-8.3; n=21), however, this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.054).Conclusions To diagnose lesions located in the middle mediastinum, videomediastinoscopy possesses the highest diagnostic accuracy, and therefore remains the gold standard.

The mRNA and protein expression of galectin-3 in HRMCs were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Westem blotting. The culture medium of HRMCs was collected and concentrated, and the content of galectin-3 in the medium was detected by Western blotting.

The fluid category of resuscitation for hypotensive trauma patients is open to debate. This study was conducted to investigate the early effects of hypertonic and isotonic saline solutions on heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA expression and apoptosis in the intestinal mucosa of rats with hemorrhagic shock.Methods A model of severe hemorrhagic shock was established in 21 Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were randomly divided into sham, normal saline resuscitation (NS), and hypertonic saline resuscitation (HTS) groups, with 7 in each group. We assessed and compared the HO-1 mRNA expression and apoptosis in the small intestinal mucosa of rats after hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation using the SYBR Green I fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, fluorescein-iso-thiocyanate-annexin V/propidium iodide double staining, and flow cytometry.Results In the early stage of hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation, marked apoptosis occurred in the small intestinal mucosa from both the NS and HTS groups. The apoptotic rate in the NS group was higher than that in the HTS group (P &lt;0.01). Among the three groups, HO-1 mRNA mucosa from the HTS group had the highest level of expression; however, the differences were not significant. There was a significant negative correlation between HO-1 mRNA expression and apoptosis in the small intestinal mucosa from the NS and HTS groups after hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation.Conclusions In this rat model of severe hemorrhagic shock, HTS resuscitation with a small volume is more effective than NS resuscitation in reducing apoptosis of the intestinal mucosa.

We have obtained patients' consent forms. We found that PCSK9 inhibitors significantly reduced blood lipid levels, regardless of the presence of HTG mutations. These results provide new evidence for the use of PCSK9 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with severe HTG.\nPatient 1: A 38-year-old man with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.1 kg/m2 was admitted to the hospital on June 1, 2020, due to acute coronary syndrome, complicated with hypertension two and type 2 diabetes, and his highest TG level was 29.94 mmol/L. During hospitalization, he was administered fenofibrate and atorvastatin for lipid-lowering. Because of little effect, evolocumab 140 mg biweekly was administered since June 4, 2020. WES revealed two heterozygous mutation sites in the LPL gene (rs3735959 and rs316).\nPatient 2: A 61-year-old woman with a BMI of 20.7 kg/m2 was admitted to the hospital repeatedly for acute pancreatitis and HTG since 2003, and her highest TG level was 52.96 mmol/L. She started consuming fenofibrate in 2004 and added atorvastatin in 2017, with poor results. She was additionally treated with evolocumab 140 mg biweekly since May 20, 2019. WES found that its APOA5 gene has a homozygous mutation site (rs2075291), and the TG-related LMF1 gene contains multiple mutation sites.\nPatient 3: A 40-year-old man with a BMI of 23.9 kg/m2 was found to have HTG during physical examination in 2015. He was diagnosed with high triglyceride acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) in 2016 and 2018. He was treated with fenofibrate and simvastatin, to which we added evolocumab 140 mg biweekly administration on December 6, 2019. However, the patient TG levels fluctuated significantly in relation to diet. WES indicated the presence of LMF1 (rs181731943) and ANGPTL8 (rs192460764) heterozygous mutations.\nNone of the three patients had evolocumab-related side effects during treatment. The changes in blood lipid levels of the three patients are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Figure 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A851]</u>. In addition, both patients two and three showed the presence of GPIHBP1 (rs11538388) and APOA5 (rs2266788). All three samples revealed the rs2278426 mutation site of ANGPTL8.\nAccording to the new classification criteria for HTG and chylomicronemia,通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> all three cases were considered polygenic chylomicronemia (World Health Organization type 5). In patient one, TG increased mainly due to LPL (heterozygous large effector gene) and ANGPTL8 (small effector gene) mutations, and the addition of evolocumab significantly reduced TG, with a stable decrease of about 70%. Both patients two and three had elevated TG levels due to APOA5, GPIHBP1, and LMF1 (large effector genes) and ANGPTL8 (small effector genes), and the addition of evolocumab significantly reduced TG. In patient two, the therapeutic effect of evolocumab was relatively stable, with a decrease of 41.41% to 71.46%. In patient three, TG was controlled at a low level when the patient had a light diet, and the decrease was approximately 84%. From these three cases, it can be inferred that evolocumab can significantly reduce TG levels even with TG-related gene mutations.\nBased on the study of these three cases, we found that in patients with severe HTG, PCSK9 inhibitors had a significant TG-lowering effect, which was different from the data (8-17%) in the general population (TG <5.65 mmol/L), possibly because of the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on TG which was related to baseline.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>\nCurrently, the common TG-lowering drugs are of three types: statins, n-3 fatty acids, and fibrates.

No change in AMPKα1 mRNA levels was observed in the HF group.Conclusion High-fat diet in aged rats results in a lipid accumulation and subsequent insulin resistance, while rosiglitazone can alleviate the insulin resistance by reducing fatty acid uptake as well as enhancing lipometabolism。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:33:43", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:33:51", "cost": 7.271}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:30", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:33:50", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:33:39"}

The average age of the patients was 68 years (48-75 years). The period from fracture to operation was 5 days (2-10 days). The mean follow-up period lasted for 11 months (3 months-2 years). There was one patient with comminnted intertrochanteric fracture accompanied by femoral head necrosis and 2 patients with intertrochanteric fracture and stroke. Other 6 patients had severe osteoporosis. The Harris score before operation was 63 points (45-71 points). Results: At the last follow-up, the patients gained 86 points (70-100 points) according to the Harris score. The effects of the 8 cases were good. The Harris score of all patients improved after treatment. Only two hemiplegia patients needed sticks to walk. The others could walk without hip pain.

Pain, swelling, and fever are considered hallmark symptoms of AAs, with around 35% developing into an AF.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Research exploring hospital inpatient and outpatient databases, in a variety of countries, found the prevalence of AFs varied, ranging from 1.04 to 2.32 per 10,000.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Particularly, men aged 21–40 years old were found to be more likely to develop this disease.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Although these diseases are regarded as nonthreatening conditions, they can be impactful on a patient’s well-being and quality of life, as well as a costly condition for the society. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to find appropriate treatment interventions.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\nConsidering smoking is a risk factor for inflammation,通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u> and based on surgeons’ clinical impressions, we hypothesized smoking to be a risk factor forAA/F. In 2011, one case-control study, based on an United States veteran population, found smoking to be a risk factor for AA/F.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Furthermore, a retrospective case-control study for AF in China reported smoking to be a correlated factor of AF.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> However, contrary to this, another study reported no correlation between smoking and the transition from initial abscess to chronic fistula.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Therefore, the relationship between smoking habit and AA/F diseases remains unclear.\nThe aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that smoking influences the risk of developing AA/F. We performed this retrospective case-control study to evaluate the associations between smoking and AA/F in a Chinese male population.\nThis retrospective case-control study was approved by the Ethics Committee of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, and all male patients who were included provided informed consent.\nWe administered a one-page questionnaire to inpatients in the Proctology Department of China-Japan Friendship Hospital from July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2017.\nAll participants were asked whether they smoked or not, with current smokers asked to report how long they had smoked for and how much they smoked per day. Once the completed questionnaire was received, trained investigators recorded demographic and AA/F clinical data from each patient’s medical records. Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or diabetes mellitus (DM) were excluded from analysis.\n\"Cases\" were patients who had AA/F, and \"controls\" were patients with other anorectal complaints (internal hemorrhoids, external hemorrhoid, mixed hemorrhoid, anal fissures, perianal eczema, and anal papilloma). Cases and controls were further stratified into three subgroups: (a) current smokers, (b) former smokers, and (c) nonsmokers.\nSAS statistical software was used  for all analyses. Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were carried out to examine differences in baseline characteristics between groups. Differences with P < 0.05 (two sided) were considered to be statistically significant. Odds ratios (ORs) correlating prevalence of AA/F to smoking status were calculated using the conditional maximum likelihood estimate method, with associated confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore any related factors.\nFrom July 1 to September 30, 2017, a total of 977 patients aged from 18 to 80 years were included, excluding patients with IBD and DM diagnoses. Of these, 805 (82.4%) completed the entire questionnaire, and 172 (17.6%) either declined were uncontactable or missed 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.\nBasic characteristics between patients who had anal abscess and anal fistula diseases and patients with other anorectal complaints\n删除重复语句：<u>Basic characteristics between patients who had anal abscess and anal fistula diseases and patients with other anorectal complaints</u>\nMann-Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were used to examine differences in baseline characteristics between groups.\nTable 1 shows the basic characteristics of all patients. Of the 334 cases (41.5%), the mean age was 34 years with an age distribution as follows: 18-29 years (27.0%), 30–39 years (41.6%), 40-49 years (17.7%), 50–59 years (9.0%), and 60 years and over (4.8%). Whereas the 471 controls (58.5) had a mean age of 35 years old with an age distribution as follows: 18–29 years (24.6%), 30–39 years (41.6%), 40–49 years (16.4%), 50–59 years (9.8%), and 60 years and over (4.0%). In regards to race, Han accounted for the majority of cases, i.e. 769 (95.5%). None of the differences in age and race between cases and controls were statistically significant. Moreover, no differences were found in the baseline characteristics of the subgroups.\nTable 2 shows the results comparing smoking status in cases and controls. Overall, out of the 805 who completed the entire questionnaire, 261 (32.5%) were current smokers. Furthermore, of the 334 cases, 202 (60.5%) were current smokers, 7 (2.1%) were former smokers, and 125 (37.4%) were nonsmokers. Of the 471 controls, 59 (12.5%) were current smokers, 25 (5.3%) were former smokers, and 387 (82.2%) were nonsmokers. Results showed a significant difference between cases and controls (χ2 = 205.2, P < 0.001), indicating an association between smoking and the development of AA/F.\nSmoking status between patients who had anal abscess and anal fistula diseases and patients with other anorectal complaints\n删除重复语句：<u>Smoking status between patients who had anal abscess and anal fistula diseases and patients with other anorectal complaints</u>\nMann-Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were used to examine differences between groups.\nMoreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the smoking effect in cases and controls further 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>. Significant differences were observed for current smokers (OR: 12.331, 95% CI: 8.364–18.179, P < 0.001), suggesting smoking to be a potential risk factor. However, no significant differences were observed for age or race.\nMultivariate analysis of independent risk factors\n删除重复语句：<u>Multivariate analysis of independent risk factors</u>\nLogistic regression was used to explore the related factors. OR: Odds ratio; CI: Confidence interval.\nThis study showed an initial relationship between smoking and the development of AA/F in a Chinese population.\nSeveral strategies were implemented to minimize bias. First, all study investigators were trained to perform standardized and uniformed data collection procedures. Second, double blinding was conducted to prevent influence on results due to knowledge of group allocation. Investigators were oblivious to participant group allocation, and participants were given the questionnaire entitled \"Is smoking a risk factor for surgical diseases?\" to ensure they did not view themselves as either \"cases\" or \"controls\" . Regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients with IBD and DM were excluded due to previously reported associations between these conditions and smoking.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Interestingly, other common comorbidities associated with smoking, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease,通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> were not present in the current samples’ medical histories. This could indicate a negligible contribution to AA/F in the occurrence of anal infection, or simply due to the sample being young (mean age of \"controls\" was 35.0 years and \"cases\" was 34.0 years).\nOne reason for only recruiting male patients was due to the high popularity of smoking in men compared to women, in China. In 2015, an estimated 27.7% of people aged over 15 (316 million; 52.1% males and 2.7% females) were current smokers.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Interestingly, it was found those developing AA/F were predominately male, with the ratio of male-to-female being 2:1.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,13]</u> As the current data show, the smoking prevalence in this current male sample was 32.5%, which was lower than that of Beijing (55.5%) and nationwide (52.1%).通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> An explanation for this might be the sociodemographic characteristics of this sample. China-Japan Friendship Hospital is a tertiary hospital, possibly attracting patients that have a higher status job, a higher income, and a higher education. In addition, a report in the Surgeon General in 2014 has shown smoking to be linked to many organ diseases in the body; however, there is no mention of smoking and AA/F.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> The same was found in the China Report on the Health Hazards of Smoking.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> As a result, further exploration of the relationship between smoking and AA/F needs conducting, as well as emphasizing the importance of physicians taking the necessary actions to intervene.\nIn this case-control study, we identified an increase in the development of AA/F in patients who smoke cigarettes. The cause of AA/F disease is poorly understood, but the consensus is due to infection of the anal glands and ducts.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Cigarette smoke contains toxins and carcinogenic substances that contribute to infection, as well as the development of cancer and various diseases.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18,19]</u> One study suggested that the use of tobacco was associated with anal cytological abnormalities by CD4 levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Another study indicated that components of tobacco smoke inflict genotoxic damage in the anal epithelium of smokers. In addition, the level of DNA adducts in the anal epithelium of smokers might be associated with cotinine, a major metabolite of nicotine and benzo[a]pyrene metabolites, which provides a plausible mechanism for a causal association between smoking and anal cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> Further researches should be performed to explain why smoking could be increasing the number of incidences of AA/F, with application to epidemiological, clinical, and mechanism knowledge.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>\nCompared with a previous case-control study for AF in China,通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> our pilot study, to our knowledge, first showed an initial relationship between smoking and the development of AA/F. Although there was a limitation of 82% response rate, the sample size was adequate enough to analyze, producing data and results for a possible relationship. A further limitation could be recall bias, which may exist due to the questionnaire being administered through phone. Nevertheless, to minimize this bias, only patients who were discharged recently were contacted. As for the questionnaire, a long questionnaire was deemed unrealistic to be conducted by telephone, so it was adjusted to one page. Moreover, all smoking-related questions were referred to by the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), which is a validated and widely accepted measure.通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24]</u>\nIn conclusion, we have shown a significant association between smoking and the development of AA/F in a Chinese population, highlighting a new area of research to be explored in the future.

Pain, swelling, and fever are considered hallmark symptoms of AAs, with around 35% developing into an AF.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Research exploring hospital inpatient and outpatient databases, in a variety of countries, found the prevalence of AFs varied, ranging from 1.04 to 2.32 per 10,000.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Particularly, men aged 21–40 years old were found to be more likely to develop this disease.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Although these diseases are regarded as nonthreatening conditions, they can be impactful on a patient’s well-being and quality of life, as well as a costly condition for the society. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to find appropriate treatment interventions.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\nConsidering smoking is a risk factor for inflammation,通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u> and based on surgeons’ clinical impressions, we hypothesized smoking to be a risk factor forAA/F. In 2011, one case-control study, based on an United States veteran population, found smoking to be a risk factor for AA/F.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Furthermore, a retrospective case-control study for AF in China reported smoking to be a correlated factor of AF.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> However, contrary to this, another study reported no correlation between smoking and the transition from initial abscess to chronic fistula.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Therefore, the relationship between smoking habit and AA/F diseases remains unclear.\nThe aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that smoking influences the risk of developing AA/F. We performed this retrospective case-control study to evaluate the associations between smoking and AA/F in a Chinese male population.\nThis retrospective case-control study was approved by the Ethics Committee of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, and all male patients who were included provided informed consent.\nWe administered a one-page questionnaire to inpatients in the Proctology Department of China-Japan Friendship Hospital from July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2017.\nAll participants were asked whether they smoked or not, with current smokers asked to report how long they had smoked for and how much they smoked per day. Once the completed questionnaire was received, trained investigators recorded demographic and AA/F clinical data from each patient’s medical records. Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or diabetes mellitus (DM) were excluded from analysis.\n\"Cases\" were patients who had AA/F, and \"controls\" were patients with other anorectal complaints (internal hemorrhoids, external hemorrhoid, mixed hemorrhoid, anal fissures, perianal eczema, and anal papilloma). Cases and controls were further stratified into three subgroups: (a) current smokers, (b) former smokers, and (c) nonsmokers.\nSAS statistical software was used  for all analyses. Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were carried out to examine differences in baseline characteristics between groups. Differences with P < 0.05 (two sided) were considered to be statistically significant. Odds ratios (ORs) correlating prevalence of AA/F to smoking status were calculated using the conditional maximum likelihood estimate method, with associated confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore any related factors.\nFrom July 1 to September 30, 2017, a total of 977 patients aged from 18 to 80 years were included, excluding patients with IBD and DM diagnoses. Of these, 805 (82.4%) completed the entire questionnaire, and 172 (17.6%) either declined were uncontactable or missed 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.\nBasic characteristics between patients who had anal abscess and anal fistula diseases and patients with other anorectal complaints\n删除重复语句：<u>Basic characteristics between patients who had anal abscess and anal fistula diseases and patients with other anorectal complaints</u>\nMann-Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were used to examine differences in baseline characteristics between groups.\nTable 1 shows the basic characteristics of all patients. Of the 334 cases (41.5%), the mean age was 34 years with an age distribution as follows: 18-29 years (27.0%), 30–39 years (41.6%), 40-49 years (17.7%), 50–59 years (9.0%), and 60 years and over (4.8%). Whereas the 471 controls (58.5) had a mean age of 35 years old with an age distribution as follows: 18–29 years (24.6%), 30–39 years (41.6%), 40–49 years (16.4%), 50–59 years (9.8%), and 60 years and over (4.0%). In regards to race, Han accounted for the majority of cases, i.e. 769 (95.5%). None of the differences in age and race between cases and controls were statistically significant. Moreover, no differences were found in the baseline characteristics of the subgroups.\nTable 2 shows the results comparing smoking status in cases and controls. Overall, out of the 805 who completed the entire questionnaire, 261 (32.5%) were current smokers. Furthermore, of the 334 cases, 202 (60.5%) were current smokers, 7 (2.1%) were former smokers, and 125 (37.4%) were nonsmokers. Of the 471 controls, 59 (12.5%) were current smokers, 25 (5.3%) were former smokers, and 387 (82.2%) were nonsmokers. Results showed a significant difference between cases and controls (χ2 = 205.2, P < 0.001), indicating an association between smoking and the development of AA/F.\nSmoking status between patients who had anal abscess and anal fistula diseases and patients with other anorectal complaints\n删除重复语句：<u>Smoking status between patients who had anal abscess and anal fistula diseases and patients with other anorectal complaints</u>\nMann-Whitney U-test and Chi-square test were used to examine differences between groups.\nMoreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the smoking effect in cases and controls further 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>. Significant differences were observed for current smokers (OR: 12.331, 95% CI: 8.364–18.179, P < 0.001), suggesting smoking to be a potential risk factor. However, no significant differences were observed for age or race.\nMultivariate analysis of independent risk factors\n删除重复语句：<u>Multivariate analysis of independent risk factors</u>\nLogistic regression was used to explore the related factors. OR: Odds ratio; CI: Confidence interval.\nThis study showed an initial relationship between smoking and the development of AA/F in a Chinese population.\nSeveral strategies were implemented to minimize bias. First, all study investigators were trained to perform standardized and uniformed data collection procedures. Second, double blinding was conducted to prevent influence on results due to knowledge of group allocation. Investigators were oblivious to participant group allocation, and participants were given the questionnaire entitled \"Is smoking a risk factor for surgical diseases?\" to ensure they did not view themselves as either \"cases\" or \"controls\" . Regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients with IBD and DM were excluded due to previously reported associations between these conditions and smoking.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Interestingly, other common comorbidities associated with smoking, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease,通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> were not present in the current samples’ medical histories. This could indicate a negligible contribution to AA/F in the occurrence of anal infection, or simply due to the sample being young (mean age of \"controls\" was 35.0 years and \"cases\" was 34.0 years).\nOne reason for only recruiting male patients was due to the high popularity of smoking in men compared to women, in China. In 2015, an estimated 27.7% of people aged over 15 (316 million; 52.1% males and 2.7% females) were current smokers.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Interestingly, it was found those developing AA/F were predominately male, with the ratio of male-to-female being 2:1.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,13]</u> As the current data show, the smoking prevalence in this current male sample was 32.5%, which was lower than that of Beijing (55.5%) and nationwide (52.1%).通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> An explanation for this might be the sociodemographic characteristics of this sample. China-Japan Friendship Hospital is a tertiary hospital, possibly attracting patients that have a higher status job, a higher income, and a higher education. In addition, a report in the Surgeon General in 2014 has shown smoking to be linked to many organ diseases in the body; however, there is no mention of smoking and AA/F.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> The same was found in the China Report on the Health Hazards of Smoking.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> As a result, further exploration of the relationship between smoking and AA/F needs conducting, as well as emphasizing the importance of physicians taking the necessary actions to intervene.\nIn this case-control study, we identified an increase in the development of AA/F in patients who smoke cigarettes. The cause of AA/F disease is poorly understood, but the consensus is due to infection of the anal glands and ducts.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Cigarette smoke contains toxins and carcinogenic substances that contribute to infection, as well as the development of cancer and various diseases.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18,19]</u> One study suggested that the use of tobacco was associated with anal cytological abnormalities by CD4 levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Another study indicated that components of tobacco smoke inflict genotoxic damage in the anal epithelium of smokers. In addition, the level of DNA adducts in the anal epithelium of smokers might be associated with cotinine, a major metabolite of nicotine and benzo[a]pyrene metabolites, which provides a plausible mechanism for a causal association between smoking and anal cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> Further researches should be performed to explain why smoking could be increasing the number of incidences of AA/F, with application to epidemiological, clinical, and mechanism knowledge.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>\nCompared with a previous case-control study for AF in China,通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> our pilot study, to our knowledge, first showed an initial relationship between smoking and the development of AA/F. Although there was a limitation of 82% response rate, the sample size was adequate enough to analyze, producing data and results for a possible relationship. A further limitation could be recall bias, which may exist due to the questionnaire being administered through phone. Nevertheless, to minimize this bias, only patients who were discharged recently were contacted. As for the questionnaire, a long questionnaire was deemed unrealistic to be conducted by telephone, so it was adjusted to one page. Moreover, all smoking-related questions were referred to by the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), which is a validated and widely accepted measure.通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24]</u>\nIn conclusion, we have shown a significant association between smoking and the development of AA/F in a Chinese population, highlighting a new area of research to be explored in the future. This study emphasizes the importance of making appropriate prevention and management interventions for AA/F patients, such as smoking cessation, to improve their quality of life and reduce the burden on the society.\nWe are very grateful to Miss.

However, they are difficult to predict and can be fatal if not appropriately treated; careful monitoring is required. We present a case of pulmonary complication secondary to aggravation of bronchial spasm during intubation of a pediatric patient.\nA 9-year-old female child (height, 132.7 cm; weight, 29.3 kg; American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Score, 1) had undergone an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy due to acute appendicitis. There were no abnormal medical history, vital signs, and laboratory findings, except for slight raised white blood cell count. The patient had fasted for >10 h until operation.\nAnesthesia was induced with propofol (40 mg), rocuronium (15 mg), and fentanyl (15 mcg). When mask ventilation was done with O2 without high inspiratory flow rates and excessive tidal volume, we did not detect any stiffness or resistance of bag. When endotracheal (ET) tube with an internal diameter (I.D.) to 5.5 mm was inserted, there were no lung sounds and no signs of end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2). Considering wrong insertion, we retried I.D. to 5.0 mm immediately after extubation. After reintubation, the patient' s oral cavity was filled with a secretion of unknown type. On auscultation, severe wheezing and coarse rales were noted in whole lung fields. A Levin tube was inserted to drain gastric contents for preventing aspiration due to preoperative computed tomography images which showed gastric and intestinal distension and clotted brown fluid rained intermittently from this tube. We suctioned repeatedly whenever pinkish, frothy to watery secretions were appeared. Despite these measures, oxygen saturation (SpO2) increased under 92% in FiO2 1. However, with concerns about increasing peak airway pressure during laparoscopy, the operation proceeded without delay because it became apparent that the patient had a perforated appendix with small amounts of ascites and over 38°C body temperature. At the end of the 90-min operation, lung sounds improved.\nAs an emergent diagnosis of respiratory event, a portable chest X-ray was taken in the operating room and revealed that infiltrates were present in both lungs, particularly severe in the right middle and lower fields. She was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit in intubated state. She was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit due to intubated state. Intensive management such as albuterol by nebulizer, ipratropium by inhaler, and antibiotics (ampicillin/sulbactam and metronidazole) intravenously was done as considering pneumonia. Differential diagnoses among pulmonary edema, preexisting pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia were needed. However, there was no further evaluation including computed tomography because she could maintain spontaneous ventilation with SpO2 up to 96% in FiO2 1 by T-tube ventilation, and applied treatments had effect on recovery. A chest radiograph was taken immediately after the operation 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u> and through postoperative day 3 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1b and Figure 1c]</u>. She was extubated and transferred to the general ward without further complications after improving all condition.\nBronchospasm may be caused by airway irritation (35%), ET tube problems (23%), and aspiration of gastric contents (14%), among other problems.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Pediatric anesthesia involves many risk factors, the most common of which are airway problems.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Because our patient had no specific signs of respiratory infection, we had no doubt about unexpected respiratory complication.\nFrom this event, three expected causes were drawn. First, aspiration pneumonia may have occurred. The patient sufficiently fasted, so we did not perform the rapid-sequence intubation. However, preexisting abdominal distension and mask ventilation might contribute to an increase in stomach distension; this may have increased the risk of aspiration. Second, pulmonary edema may have occurred after bronchospasm caused by acute upper airway obstruction, which followed by incomplete airway muscle relaxation and increased abdominal pressure. The last, a preexisting upper respiratory infection may have resulted in sudden aggravation of respiratory symptoms. Although the likelihood of this seems low, we must consider the possibility that pneumonia occurred because an unknown history of respiratory infection can increase the risk of respiratory complications.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>\nRegardless of the result and differential management of them, treatment for this complication as pneumonia without discriminating its type was a successful outcome. If this was pulmonary edema, the treatment should include diuretics such as furosemide (Lasix®), and if aspiration pneumonia, antibiotics should be changed.\nFrom this result, our case should take into consideration some mistaken points. First, preoperative evaluation should be fully assessed including lung condition. We missed some aspects of patient history such as cold and examinations that showed the findings of slight infiltrates in the right lower lung field in the abdominal computed tomography. These factors might contribute to rapid aggravation of respiratory complications during anesthesia.\nSecond, the ET tube size should be carefully considered. Our patient’s height and weight were within the reference ranges, so our first ET tube should have been the appropriate size for the patient. However, we felt resistance upon insertion without resistance during passage and no sound of leakage; therefore, we did not inflate the cuff. In this case, the usual procedure with pediatric patients is to use a smaller ET tube if resistance is felt and changed to one-half smaller size. We could not predict the possibility of upper airway spasm immediately before changing ET tube, and it resulted in the absence of breath sounds, ventilation, and EtCO2 in spite of correct intubation.\nThe last, fasting duration may not indicate an empty stomach in patients with abdominal distension. Mask ventilation during general anesthesia can lead to the reflux of gastric contents regardless of fasting time. Because of the risk of adverse events such as aspiration, rapid-sequence intubation must always be considered.\nRespiratory risk including airway problems must be taken into account in children regardless of preexisting respiratory disease. Even in minor surgical procedures, careful observation is necessary for preventing adverse events at any time. Medical personnel who manage pediatric patients must consider all adverse events and should apply timely appropriate management.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:18:20", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:18:51", "cost": 30.886}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:30", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:18:50", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:18:19"}

The requirement for informed patient consent was waived for this study, and patients’ identities were coded to ensure the confidentiality of data.\nThe following patient inclusion criteria were set: (i) ICU patients from the four participating hospitals who were newly diagnosed with AbVAP between January 2014 and October 2015, as confirmed by the hospital database and (ii) an age older than 18 years. A. baumannii was identified using a PhoenixTM-100 automated microbiology system (Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The following patient data were recorded: age, gender, length of ICU stay, disease severity at the time of diagnosis, surgery within 1 month before diagnosis, underlying systemic diseases, invasive procedures, antimicrobial susceptibility of A. baumannii to tigecycline, blood culture findings, medical imaging features, and antimicrobial treatment after obtaining culture results. Subsequent bacteremia was defined as at least one A. baumannii-positive blood culture in the absence of a different infection source and at least one A. baumannii-positive tracheal aspirate culture after the development of newly diagnosed AbVAP. Other bacterial co-pathogens were also investigated. The study outcome was overall 30-day mortality in the ICU. All patients were included in a survival follow-up until death or 30 days after the onset of VAP.\nAll study data were processed using SPSS software version 22.0 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Student’s t-test or the Mann–Whitney U-test was used to analyze continuous variables, whereas the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables. The risk factors for 30-day mortality were identified through a logistic regression analysis. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\nThis study included 158 patients with a 30-day mortality rate of 31.0% (49/158). The mean age was 59.8 years among nonsurvivors and 56.7 years among survivors. Moreover, 125 (79.1%) patients had recently undergone surgery, and 46 (29.1%) had developed early-onset VAP. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score at the time of VAP diagnosis was significantly higher among nonsurvivors (16.4 vs. 13.0 for survivors and nonsurvivors respectively, P < 0.001). Cardiovascular disease was the most common underlying systemic disease, occurring in 69.0% of the patients. Tracheostomy was the most common invasive procedure performed during the hospital stay (111, 70.3%).\nForty-eight patients (30.4%) in our study were infected with co-pathogens, of which the most common were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36, 22.8%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (15, 9.5%). Notably, the frequency of tigecycline-resistant A. baumannii increased to 16.5% in our study population. Thirteen patients were found to develop subsequent A. baumannii bacteremia, and all cases involved multidrug resistance. However, only 54.4% of the patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy, as shown in Table 1.\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with VAP caused by A. baumannii\n删除重复语句：<u>Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with VAP caused by A. baumannii</u>\n*Chi-square test, †Fisher’s exact test, ‡Mann- Whitney rank sum test. VAP was classified as either early onset (<5 days within mechanical ventilation) or late onset (≥5 days). Prior surgery is defined as surgery within 30 days before diagnosis; APACHE II: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II; Cardiovascular disease includes coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease; Malignancy includes hematologic malignancies and solid tumor; COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; cerebrovascular accident includes cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage. Other pathogens including E. coli, S. maltophilia, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. Appropriate antibiotic therapy was defined as the receipt of one or more antimicrobial agents to which A. baumannii was susceptible at a therapeutic dosage within 72 h of diagnosis, if not, the treatment was thought to be inappropriate. VAP: Ventilator-associated pneumonia; A. baumannii: Acinetobacter baumannii; SD: Standard deviation; P. aeruginosa: Pseudomonas aeruginosa; K. pneumonia: Klebsiella pneumoniae; E. coli: Escherichia coli; S. maltophilia: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; H. influenza: Haemophilus influenza.\nThe logistic regression analysis included all factors that received P < 0.20, as shown in Table 1. Our multivariate analysis identified a higher APACHE II score at onset (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03–1.23; P = 0.010), subsequent A. baumannii bacteremia (OR: 5.34; 95% CI: 1.26–22.68; P = 0.023), central venous catheter placement (OR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.12–6.18; P = 0.027), and inappropriate antibiotic treatment (OR: 4.90; 95% CI: 1.96–12.28; P = 0.001) as risk factors for 30-day ICU mortality in patients with AbVAP. By contrast, a history of surgery was identified as a protective factor against 30-day ICU mortality (OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.06–0.49; P < 0.001).\nOur research demonstrated that subsequent multidrug-resistant bacteremia is a risk factor for short-term mortality among patients with AbVAP in the ICU. This finding may be attributed to the increased usage of a central venous catheter before bacteremia onset (76.9% [10/13] vs. 40.0% [58/145], P = 0.010).通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Therefore, physicians should emphasize the importance of barrier precautions, as well as appropriate antibiotic treatment. However, our study failed to find a higher ICU mortality rate among patients with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii bacteremia, compared to the nonbacteremic patients (53.8% [7/13] vs. 31.7% [46/145], P = 0.190). In addition, the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of the APACHE II score (14.8 ± 4.3 vs. 14.0 ± 4.9, P = 0.552) or frequency of tigecycline resistance (16.6% [2/13] vs. 15.4% [24/145], P = 0.913).\nThis study had some inherent limitations of note. Particularly, all clinical information related to the risk factors was collected retrospectively, which restricts the generalization of our findings to additional patients. Further prospective studies should be conducted.\nIn conclusion, AbVAP often develops as a nosocomial infection and is associated with a high mortality rate. Limitations on central venous catheter use, the avoidance of subsequent A. baumannii bacteremia, and the judicious use of antibiotics may reduce the mortality associated with AbVAP in the ICU.\n删除3：<u>This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81770055, No. 81630001, No. 81490533)</u>, and Shanghai Science and Technology Committee Grant 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 删除4：<u>15</u>DZ1930600, No. 删除4：<u>15</u>DZ1930602)</u>.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:30:07", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:30:57", "cost": 49.975}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:30", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:30:56", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:30:05"}

In 2016, trauma-induced mortality ranked the third in city and the fourth in the countryside in China. It means that no matter in developed or developing countries, the process and technique of trauma rescue/care should be improved unceasingly. In June 2018, National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China promulgated a policy focusing on the establishment/construction of trauma care centers at secondary hospital and tertiary hospital. Trauma care faces three challenges: pre-hospital urgent medical rescue or aid, in-hospital emergency care, and traumatic complication prevention & treatment as well as intensive care of trauma victims. Chinese Journal of Traumatology (CJTEE) presented a series of in-depth reports concerning these three aspects in the year 2018.\nThe introduction and establishment of trauma care system is one of CJTEE watching topics. The similarities and differences of trauma care systems among countries and regions have been reported in the past year. Pre-hospital treatment greatly reduces the mortality of severe trauma patients while in-hospital treatment is equally nonnegligible. More importantly, it needs to pay more attention to restore organ function and improve quality of life of trauma patient in future. Sepsis is one of the objective complications after severe trauma, which can easy induce multiple organs dysfunction, and result to death of patient. Unfortunately, what we can know about sepsis is still limitation. Another serious complication of in-hospital trauma care is secondary brain injury. About 40% of patients will continue to deteriorate after hospitalization and even die. Secondary injury following brain trauma is a worldwide challenge, which may be due to the fact that we know few about the mechanism of secondary inflammatory injury after brain trauma. Open extremity fractures are the common presented injury in trauma care, however some professional consensus is needing to be re-discussed. Therefore, CJTEE invited experience experts to summarize the update currents on trauma emergency system, intensive critical care on sepsis. It is worth noting that, two innovative researchers from America were invited to summarize the recent achievements in basic medicine. Prof. Zheng-Guo Wang, an academician of the Chinese academy of engineering and prof. Li-Jun Hou, the director of neurosurgery department in Shanghai Changzheng Hospital provide some enlightenment and understanding of the brain injury. Professor Raymond Malcolm Smith from Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital also delivered his study on open fracture care.\nTrauma involves multiple systems and anatomic sites, and trauma care requires multi-disciplinary cooperation for injury assessment, emergency surgery and further staging operation. Some misunderstandings and disputes about the establishment of trauma care system include: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> which one – multidisciplinary team or trauma center team – is able to provide more efficient trauma care; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> what qualification should the leader of trauma care team hold; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> what kind of trauma center model is optimal. However, due to the varied geography, resources, population and economic development in different countries and regions, a trauma system should adapt to local conditions. CJTEE has made a detailed introduction of trauma care models in Germany, United States, Chongqing (China), Wuhan (China), Zhejiang (China) aiming to continuously improve Chinese trauma care system, and provide guidance and reference for its future development.\nThe pre-hospital emergency care system in Germany consists of emergency and disaster management, which is different from China. Prof. Norman Hecker introduced three-level trauma centers of emergency management system, which is nation-wide to provide the appropriate treatment for the trauma patients of different levels. Germany has a decentralized disaster management system, meaning that the state delegates emergency management system authority to its provinces and the provinces delegate emergency management system authority to their regions, cities and communes －the system not only gives full play to disaster relief, but also provides powerful assistance to emergency rescue. Prof. Dong-Xia Feng gave an overview of the American trauma care system. In American system, the trauma centers are divided into four levels in accordance with the personnel composition, facilities equipment, and service coverage. Each trauma center gives the patients trauma care at different levels. The trauma patients can accept comprehensive treatment and a total care in Level-I trauma center, and initiate definitive care in level-II trauma centers. In level-III trauma center, after a prompt assessment of the patient, resuscitation, surgery, intensive care, postoperative stabilization and emergency surgery could be performed if needed. Meanwhile, the center frequently treats patient who may require transfer to a higher level of care. Level-IV trauma center, often located in remote areas, can provide the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) prior to transfer of patients to a higher level trauma center.\nIn the past three years, China has attached such great importance to building trauma care system. Trauma centers have been established gradually in large, medium and small cities, and systematic trauma care training have been produced regularly. CJTEE invited Prof. Lian-Yang Zhang and Prof. Xiang-Jun Bai to make the systems in Chongqing and Wuhan as examples to take a brief introduction of the current trauma care system in China. In the articles, two advices of building trauma center, three models of trauma care systems, existing problems, and the train courses are reported. With a vast territory of geographic features and sophisticated county-level administration, China is believed to be difficult to establish a regional trauma care system. In issue 5, a series of articles report how to conduct trauma care in county-level hospitals; how to establish three-level trauma centers under local conditions; how to build a rescue chain through self-rescue and team rescue; how to make a guideline of trauma care in county-level medical units.\nBecause of the high mortality of traumat injury, it is urgent to establish and improve the trauma care system in China. In the southwest and northwest China, many towns and counties are in mountainous and plateaus areas. Thus the establishment of trauma center system needs to adapt to the domestic conditions and get the indispensable support from the government, which could increase the cure rate of trauma, set scientific guideline and train professional surgeons and paramedics.\nWe believe that trauma care system can provide more efficient trauma care than a multidisciplinary team. The candidate for clinic lead of trauma center should be trauma surgeons with special training in ICU or ICU doctors who served as surgeons before. The standardized trauma care system could not be used anywhere, because the system needs to be built in the local conditions, such as geographic features, personnel configuration, especially the current economic and social development. The gold standard of a good trauma care system is to transfer trauma patients to the right place in the shortest time.\nAt present, both pre- and in-hospital first aid agree that pre-hospital care is a provisional emergent measure and after simple management, the patient will be transferred to hospital for further treatment. Taking the most common open fracture of the extremities as example, Prof. Raymond Malcolm Smith, a well-known expert in Harvard Medical School, pointed out the key points for its handling. Moreover the example of external fixation is shown.\nThe open fractures have the characteristics of easy contamination, frequent high-energy injury, heavy tissue damage, and hard to manage. Prof. Smith proposed three principles of surgery for open fracture: debridement and lavage, fracture stabilization and soft tissue closure. He believed that early treatment is important to greatly reduce the risk of infection. Comprehensive evaluation of the wound, accurate and thorough debridement and lavage, and prevention of postoperative complications such as infection are indispensable for the treatment. Although someone believes that postoperative fixation should be avoided for better healing, clinical and experimental evidences have shown that postoperative fixation plays a positive role in wound healing. In this review, Prof. Smith and this team also introduced different fixation methods for different wound patterns to speed up the healing process.\nWhether to treat combined triangular ligament injury in ankle fractures is controversial. Professor Lei Liu from West China Hospital reported that besides open reduction and internal fixation, transarticular external fixation is more effective than triangular ligament repair for rotation type IV equivalent ankle fractures. Meanwhile, wound management is more convenient.\nThe treatment of open fractures has been always controversial. We believe the review by Professor Smith, which summarizes the recent advanced clinical techniques, suggests appropriate surgical methods based on author's years of clinical experience, and moreover proposed three principles of open fracture care, will provide valuable clinical advice for the majority of clinicians.\nSepsis is a common complication of severe trauma, burn injury, shock and major operation, which may cause septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. With the high morbidity and mortality, sepsis strikes more than 18 million people every year in the world. And about 14,000 people die of sepsis and its complications. Based on the foreign epidemiological investigations, sepsis is the main cause of death of non-cardiac patients in ICU, and its mortality has exceeded that of myocardial infarction. In recent years, anti-infective therapy and organ support technology have made great progress, but the mortality rate of sepsis is still as high as 30%-70%. The economic burden, the medical resource consumption, and the high fatality rate make sepsis a significant threat of human health.\nProf Peng-Lin Ma discussed a positive effect of early fluid loading for septic patients. They believed that the plasma volume depletion is fundamental for aggressive fluid loading, and the hemodynamic stability is prior to the organ function stability for sepsis patients. It is known that fluid resuscitation is fundamental in the management of critically ill patients. However, there is no standard procedure of fluid resuscitation. Prof Peng-Lin Ma proposed five protocols: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Evaluate the fluid and electrolyte status of critically ill patients; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Make a \"normal saline\" (NS) infusion management plan; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Measure the rate and volume of NS and mark the 4 Rs; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Record other sources of fluid and electrolyte intake; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Write the information for patients and their family members.\nThe mechanism of sepsis is still unknown. Although updating Surviving Sepsis Campaign, formulating the guidelines, adopting the Goal-directed therapy, the mortality rate of sepsis has been still high. The mechanism of sepsis is quite complicated, which is closely related to the pathological and physiological changes in multiple systems and organs, including systemic Inflammation, gene polymorphism, immune dysfunction, coagulopathy, tissue injury and responses to infection, pathogenic microorganism and toxin, etc. To decrease the mortality rate and find an effective therapy, the mechanism of sepsis should be further studied.\nBrain injury is the leading cause of death worldwide, and spinal cord injury causes a large number of deaths. Both of them highly result in the secondary injury, which reduce the survival rate, increase the complication rate, affect the quality of life, and cause heavy social burdens. Many prospective studies have reported brain injury and traumatic spinal cord injury in recent years. To prevent secondary injury, improve the quality of life, and reduce the economic burden for society, CJTEE reports a series special reports.\nWen-Hui, Hu a famous professor in Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, introduced the paradigm shifts of CNS immunity. Through the good efficacy of innate immune, inflammatory corpuscles, microglia/macrophages and astrocytes combined with drug therapy, secondary injuries, caused by craniocerebral injury and spinal injury could be treated effectively. Several immunomodulatory strategies are likely to see translation to patients within the next few decades, and several challenging questions need be addressed or investigated for future studies. By reviewing and summarizing the understanding of neuroinflammation after traumatic brain injury and cell-based therapeutic opportunities in recent years, Prof Ye Xiong aims to treat neuroinflammation and promote functional recovery. Neuroinflammatory responses after TBI have dual roles: chronically, they mainly contribute to worsening outcomes of the progressive TBI pathology, and acutely, they may promote functional recovery. It is significant to strengthen the neuroimage on gender and age. The neurorestorative approaches, like cell therapy, exosomes as mediating cell-based therapy, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for treatment are all effective treatments. Brain science is an interdisciplinary subject. Military Brain Science is a cutting-edge innovative science that uses potential military application as the guidance. Prof. Zheng-Guo Wang and Prof. Li-Jun Hou preliminarily provide nine aspects, including understanding the brain, protecting the brain, monitoring the brain, injuring the brain, interfering with the brain, repairing the brain, enhancing the brain, simulating the brain and arming the brain.\nAt present, the limited research and the vague conclusion of secondary injury lead to the high disability and mortality. The in-depth mechanism studies will be helpful to develop novel therapies, reduce the fatality rate, and improve the long-term prognosis of patients.\nWe are all in a fusion and communion modern world. The booming city and transportation establishment brings about a high traumatic morbidity, thus trauma is called a disease in a developed society. Trauma is the leading cause of death in children and young adults, and the fourth leading cause of death in whole population. Trauma emergency care is a major branch of clinical medicine. In fact, the establishment of the trauma treatment system should include pre-hospital emergency care, in-hospital treatment, traumatic intensive care, prevention of traumatic complications, post-traumatic rehabilitation, especially post-traumatic psychological rehabilitation. CJTEE always aims to report traumatic contents to popularize the prevention knowledge, enhance the therapy cognition, optimize the treatment regulations, improve the treatment levels, decrease the trauma incidence, and reduce the trauma mortality and disability. In 2019, CJTEE will publish more articles on the establishment of trauma care system and the prevention of traumatic complications. The topics such as vascular surgery in trauma treatment and innovation on wound repair will be covered in the following issues.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2019.01.001</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Peer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.", "content": "【0】Frequent natural disasters, constant regional conflicts, and widespread use of vehicles have made trauma the fourth leading cause of death for human beings, which is the first killer among the youth aged 1-45 years.

Prof Peng-Lin Ma proposed five protocols: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Evaluate the fluid and electrolyte status of critically ill patients; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Make a \"normal saline\" (NS) infusion management plan; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Measure the rate and volume of NS and mark the 4 Rs; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Record other sources of fluid and electrolyte intake; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Write the information for patients and their family members.\nThe mechanism of sepsis is still unknown. Although updating Surviving Sepsis Campaign, formulating the guidelines, adopting the Goal-directed therapy, the mortality rate of sepsis has been still high. The mechanism of sepsis is quite complicated, which is closely related to the pathological and physiological changes in multiple systems and organs, including systemic Inflammation, gene polymorphism, immune dysfunction, coagulopathy, tissue injury and responses to infection, pathogenic microorganism and toxin, etc. To decrease the mortality rate and find an effective therapy, the mechanism of sepsis should be further studied.\nBrain injury is the leading cause of death worldwide, and spinal cord injury causes a large number of deaths. Both of them highly result in the secondary injury, which reduce the survival rate, increase the complication rate, affect the quality of life, and cause heavy social burdens. Many prospective studies have reported brain injury and traumatic spinal cord injury in recent years. To prevent secondary injury, improve the quality of life, and reduce the economic burden for society, CJTEE reports a series special reports.\nWen-Hui, Hu a famous professor in Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, introduced the paradigm shifts of CNS immunity. Through the good efficacy of innate immune, inflammatory corpuscles, microglia/macrophages and astrocytes combined with drug therapy, secondary injuries, caused by craniocerebral injury and spinal injury could be treated effectively. Several immunomodulatory strategies are likely to see translation to patients within the next few decades, and several challenging questions need be addressed or investigated for future studies. By reviewing and summarizing the understanding of neuroinflammation after traumatic brain injury and cell-based therapeutic opportunities in recent years, Prof Ye Xiong aims to treat neuroinflammation and promote functional recovery. Neuroinflammatory responses after TBI have dual roles: chronically, they mainly contribute to worsening outcomes of the progressive TBI pathology, and acutely, they may promote functional recovery. It is significant to strengthen the neuroimage on gender and age. The neurorestorative approaches, like cell therapy, exosomes as mediating cell-based therapy, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for treatment are all effective treatments. Brain science is an interdisciplinary subject. Military Brain Science is a cutting-edge innovative science that uses potential military application as the guidance. Prof. Zheng-Guo Wang and Prof. Li-Jun Hou preliminarily provide nine aspects, including understanding the brain, protecting the brain, monitoring the brain, injuring the brain, interfering with the brain, repairing the brain, enhancing the brain, simulating the brain and arming the brain.\nAt present, the limited research and the vague conclusion of secondary injury lead to the high disability and mortality. The in-depth mechanism studies will be helpful to develop novel therapies, reduce the fatality rate, and improve the long-term prognosis of patients.\nWe are all in a fusion and communion modern world. The booming city and transportation establishment brings about a high traumatic morbidity, thus trauma is called a disease in a developed society. Trauma is the leading cause of death in children and young adults, and the fourth leading cause of death in whole population. Trauma emergency care is a major branch of clinical medicine. In fact, the establishment of the trauma treatment system should include pre-hospital emergency care, in-hospital treatment, traumatic intensive care, prevention of traumatic complications, post-traumatic rehabilitation, especially post-traumatic psychological rehabilitation. CJTEE always aims to report traumatic contents to popularize the prevention knowledge, enhance the therapy cognition, optimize the treatment regulations, improve the treatment levels, decrease the trauma incidence, and reduce the trauma mortality and disability. In 2019, CJTEE will publish more articles on the establishment of trauma care system and the prevention of traumatic complications. The topics such as vascular surgery in trauma treatment and innovation on wound repair will be covered in the following issues.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2019.01.001</u>", "index": 15644, "show": true, "start": 15644, "end": 15708, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:36:43", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:37:05", "cost": 21.913}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:30", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:37:05", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:36:42"}

These patients had high levels of ferritin but low levels of TSAT, while another group in the study had high levels of both ferritin and TSAT did not exhibit ID. FID has been shown to be associated with advanced disease and poor ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status in patients with solid tumors.删除4：<u>18</u> In the NB patients in the present study, FID reflected insufficient availability of iron despite adequate iron reserves.

The preliminary working space was established in lower abdomen without posterior sheath, accessed by cutting linea alba above pubis, and expanded by blunt dissection with camera. Two 5-mm trocars are placed 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>; the separation then continues towards cephalad side. Around Douglas line, the posterior sheath and the correct layer need to be identified carefully 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1G]</u>. Next, separation is conducted close to posterior sheath 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1H]</u>; peritoneum and extraperitoneal tissue are gradually detached from the sheath towards cephalad side 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1I]</u>. Hernia sac is reduced 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1J]</u> or transected 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1K]</u>; the open peritoneum is sutured after separation. Frequently, sac reduction is easy for linea alba hernia 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1J]</u>. At umbilicus, skin damage should be avoided to prevent subsequent skin necrosis; ligamentum teres hepatic, atretic urachus, and umbilical arteries that assemble at the base of umbilicus are severed at the attachment point 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1L]</u>. If necessary, separation continues forward to the space behind xiphoid process 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1M]</u>, and the diaphragmatic peritoneum should be separated from diaphragm carefully. The instruments are often interfered by the legs during separation. Placing patients in a jackknife position and lowering the abdominal wall by pushing from outside will alleviate this problem. The separation range is usually 5 cm from defect margin. For small defects, lateral separation ends at the outer margin of sheath.\nDefect of M4–M5 and L3. The access and separation are similar as inguinal hernia totally extra-peritoneal. For M4–M5 defects, unilateral and bilateral trocar arrangement are both OK 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1C–D]</u>. For L3 defect, midline trocar arrangement is recommended, and should be moved cephalad 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1E]</u>.\nLateral defect of upper abdomen (L4). The patient is placed with lateral decubitus position. The camera is placed at 1-cm above iliac crest. After accessing the space, separation continues in cephalad and dorsal direction, the peritoneum and extraperitoneal fat are detached from the transversus abdominis 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1N]</u>. The dorsal separation will reach perinephric fat capsule, here the peritoneum reflection and Gerota fascia can be observed clearly 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1O]</u>. The retroperitoneum separation should be conducted between muscle fascia and extraperitoneal fat, avoiding injuries to diaphragm and iliohypogastric ilioinguinal nerve at the surface of muscle 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1P]</u>. Hernia sac is reduced or transected 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1Q]</u> during separation.\nCrossing multiple regions. It should be required when separation is required if the defect is big or near the border of the regions 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1R, across medial and lateral regions]</u>. The most used route is presented in Figure 1F.\n3. Defect closure and mesh placement. Defect is closed with either continuous barbed suture or transfascial suture 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1S]</u>. An appropriate mesh is then placed. The mesh size is related to not only the size of the defect, but also the range of separation, covering as much separated space as possible 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1T]</u>.\n4. Drainage. A closed drainage is recommended to eliminate the preperitoneal space, which helps to position the mesh, avoid mesh displacement, facilitate mesh–tissue incorporation, and avoid seroma. If separated area is small and wound is clean, the drainage can be spared.\nThe follow-up points were 2 and 8 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year post-operatively. Then, telephone interviews were conducted every 6 months, and patients with concerns visited the clinic to check for possible complications. The follow-up was halted in April 2020 and ranged from 3 to 45 months, with a median of 8 (interquartile range [IQR] 5–21) months. One patient was lost to follow-up after 1 year.\nAll results are shown in the 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Materials, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A842]</u>. Briefly, 56/62 cases scheduled to undergo preperitoneal repair with TES procedure completed repair. All failures occurred in patients with M1–M3 defect due to severe peritoneum damage during space separation. Two cases were converted to Lap-IPOM repair, and 4 to routine TES. Two wound events occurred and healed with debridement. All seroma was absorbed after 2 to 4 months. No patient required readmission. Short-term discomfort was observed in 11 patients in the first 3 months post-operatively and was relieved in the next 1 to 3 months.\nAs we described above, the space behind rectus sheath directly connects Retzuis space, same opposite space, and lateral retromuscular space, and further connects the retroperitoneum. Anatomically, the surface of whole peritoneum surrounded by the preperitoneal layer forms a whole visceral sac. Therefore, it is potential to separate the visceral sac as large as possible. We named this conception as  \"total visceral sac separation (TVS)\".通用删除6(英):<u>[3,5,6]</u> However, the implementation of TVS is difficult because the separation is like peeling an eggshell along its shell membrane. Certainly, no case needs a complete TVS, but the concept is important because it provides us a new perspective on ESR repair.\nPeritoneum tears during separation is common, it shrink operating space and mak following steps difficult. Instead of closing the open peritoneum immediately, the strategy is first to enlarge the space by further separation of surrounding area. With space expansion, the peritoneum will drop down, the damaged peritoneum will be isolated, and then easy to close.\nIn this series, although the operative time is relatively long, successful preperitoneal space separation was achieved in most cases. No severe peri-operative and post-operative complications occurred except seroma and delayed wound healing. No chronic pain or recurrence was observed. Given the above, for small incisional and primary ventral hernias, preperitoneal repair with TES procedure is safe, feasible, and effective.\nThis procedure also suits lumbar hernia. Currently, the major repairs include open sublay and laparoscopic transabdominal repair. The approach of open sublay repair is straightforward but brings the risk of wound occurrences. The laparoscopic transabdominal repair is not straightforward because the left/right colon needs to be dissected for exposing the defect behind.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Instead, TES repair combines the advantage of direct approach and low wound occurrence. The surgery is performed without dissecting the colon and disturbing the abdominal cavity. Additionally, the peritoneum here is thick, making space separation and sac reduction relatively easy.\nHowever, this technique is still challenging; so, currently, the indications should be limited to primary ventral hernias and small incisional hernias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/08 17:03:23", "endTime": "2024/10/08 17:03:44", "cost": 20.373}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:30", "update_time": "2024-10-08 01:03:44", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 01:03:23"}

However, this has led to increasing concerns regarding radiation protection for people close to brachytherapy patients.\nCurrently, patients must wear a lead vest with a thickness of at least 0.25 mm when in contact with others, visitors must stay 1 m away from the patient at all times, and the patient cannot go into public places for 240 d after implantation. These radiation protection methods are strict and difficult to follow, especially when the patient is at home. As a result, the development of more convenient and effective post-operative radioprotection has become an active research topic.删除4：<u>4,5,6</u>\nFor instance, Kono et al.7 studied the effects of radiation exposure to the general public after prostate cancer seed implantation and found it was almost completely safe for members of the public to come into contact with such patients. However, seed implantation in other locations of the body, especially on or near to the surface, leads to more gamma rays being emitted from the patient. In China, 125I seeds are used to treat many kinds of tumors.删除4：<u>8,9,10</u> Thus, total activity and implant depth vary significantly from patient to patient, necessitating the development of patient-specific radiation protection methods.\nPrecaution time is the time taken for the dose to decay to 50% of the effective dose limit, which is different for different groups of people that come into contact with the implanted patient (general adult family members, spouses, coworkers, and children or pregnant women). Thus, it is an ideal parameter to consider in radioprotection research. In this study, specific dose rates and precaution times for different groups of people and the relationship between the initial dose rate and precaution time were explored. The results may be used to scientifically inform patient-specific radioprotection after brachytherapy.\nEighty patients (36 females and 44 males aged 37-79 with a median age of 56) who underwent 125I brachytherapy in our department from Apr 2012 to Dec 2014 were studied. They had definite pathological results, including 1 retroperitoneal stromal tumor, 1 right-hand buccal squamous cancer, 1 left-hand thenar malignant melanoma, 1 stomach cancer, 4 primary pancreatic cancers, 4 lung cancers, 10 esophagus cancers, 8 retroperitoneal lymph node metastases, 8 colorectal cancers, 6 primary cervical cancers, 6 liver cancers, and 30 superficial lymph node metastatic carcinomas. The implantation was guided by both ultrasound and CT, with the matched peripheral dose (MPD) of 80-120 Gy. The number of seeds implanted was 13-100 with a median value of 30, and the activities of the implanted seeds were (1.11-2.96) × 107 Bq, with a median value of 2.22 × 107 Bq. The distances from the implanted seed to the skin surface were 1.11-5.17 cm with a median value of 2.12 cm.\nAfter the operation, the smallest distance from the implanted seed in the tumor center to the skin surface (the depth of the implantation) was obtained through CT imaging, marked on the skin surface, and recorded. Within 24 h of the operation, a pocket radiometer (FD-3007K-A, China National Nuclear Corporation) with the dose rate measurement range 0.1-399.9 μSv/h was used to detect the dose rates at distances of 30 and 100 cm perpendicularly from the skin surface. Ḋ0 is the dose rate obtained within 24 h after the operation (0 d), which is termed the initial dose rate. According to the measured Ḋ0 values, the average Ḋ0 values at different distances were calculated and compared.\nThe dose rate after the decay of 125I seeds at t d (Ḋt) was calculated as Ḋ0 e -λt, where λ is the decay constant of the radioactive source and is related to half-life by λ = ln 2/T1/2 ≈ 0. 693/T1/2.11\nDose rate can be converted into effective dose E using the relationship,12\nwhere, 34.56 is a conversion factor obtained through integration, 1.44 × 24 (h/d); Tp is the half-life of the seed 125I which is 59.6 d; Tr is the occupancy factor, which reflects the time of close contact between a member of a particular group and the patient.

Then using the appropriate values of Et, Tr, and Ḋ0 for each group, Tp, and λ, we derived precaution time values for each case.\nThe data are presented as ±s. The SPSS13.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Paired-samples t-test was used to compare the initial dose rate at distances of 30 and 100 cm. The values of precaution time for different groups were plotted against initial dose rate, and the corresponding curve equations were obtained with linear and nonlinear regression. P < 0.05 indicated the difference was statistically significant.\nThe mean Ḋ0 values of 80 patients at distances of 30 and 100 cm were (15.24 ± 11.25) μSv/h and (1.96 ± 2.63) μSv/h, respectively (P < 0.05). The mean precaution time and the range of precaution time for general adult family members, spouses, coworkers, and children or pregnant women were (4.17 ± 16.55), (102.93 ± 49.22), (51.00 ± 61.29), and (34.27 ± 56.90) d; (0-90.61), (0-234.01), (0-247.81), and (0-224.69), respectively. Thus, for patients with minimum initial dose rates, the precaution time for all groups was 0 d, while for the patients with maximum initial dose rates, the longest precaution time was 247.81 d. From the data above, we found that the precaution time varied greatly with Ḋ0.\nThe correlations between initial dose rate and precaution time (Y) were illustrated in Fig. 1. There was logarithmic relationship between initial dose rate and precaution time for each group. The equations are Y = -131.569 + 83.256 lnḊ0 for general adult family members, Y = -108.532 + 83.318 lnḊ0 for spouses, Y = 25.470 + 83.318 lnḊ0 for coworkers, and Y = 2.585 + 83.229 lnḊ0 for children and pregnant women.\nPrecaution time, which refers to the time taken for the dose to decay to 50% of the effective dose limit and is specific to a particular group of people that come into contact with an implanted patient, is generally used to guide radiation protection.删除4：<u>15,16,17,18</u> Dauer et al.13 reported that precaution times for a child in close contact with an implanted prostate patient and a pregnant woman that sleeps with the implanted patient are 42 and 84 d, respectively, while no radiation safety precaution times are required for spouses, general adult family members, and coworkers.\nLicciardello et al.19 retrospectively studied 180 patients with prostate cancer receiving 125I-seed brachytherapy and established a model to estimate the effective dose in terms of total implant activity. This model was then used to calculate the effective doses for relatives and other people then estimate the time to reach radioprotection dose constrains. However, the values obtained by the theoretical model were higher than those measured, and there were many uncertainties in the measurements. Thus, the theoretical model can only provide estimates and not effective protection advice for individuals.\nThe above two studies were both based on prostate cancer, which has a high reference value for the study of radiation safety and precaution time. Unfortunately, their results cannot be applied to other parts of tumors after seed implantation, even for prostate cancer, due to differences in seed number, activity, and dose, as well as uncertainties in the measurements. Thus, the precaution times derived from these studies differ significantly.\nSui et al.20 studied 20 implanted patients after brachytherapy and determined their initial dose rates, effective doses, and precaution times. They drew the conclusion that the precaution time for general adult family members, spouses, coworkers, and children or pregnant women who live with the patient are 0, 109, 78, and 54 d, respectively. Although different kinds of tumors in different body parts were studied in this research, the precaution time obtained with the average initial dose rates of the 20 patients are similar to the corresponding values obtained in the present study, as shown in Table 1. The differences in implantation depth, activity, dose, and number are responsible for the different initial dose rates, so there are large differences between the maximum initial dose rates, minimum initial dose rates, and average dose rates in each group of people. Consequently, there are also large differences in precaution time.\nThe precaution time values obtained based solely on the average initial dose rate are not exactly correct for every person that has close contact with an implanted patient. There is no need for concern when the initial dose rate is lower than the minimum dose rate, as this would lead to over-protection, while protection deficiency will occur if the initial dose rate is higher than a certain value, potentially causing radiation injury to contacts.\nThe present study challenges the ideas from the three cited above. Here, precaution time was calculated based on initial dose rate for different kinds of patients, and curve fitting was used to derive correlation equations for dose rate vs. precaution time. This means that specific close contacts can use the appropriate equation to determine their specific precaution time, and patient families can be accurately informed about the necessity of protection and how long it should last.\nSuch protection can be implemented by lessening contact time, lengthening contact distance, and using shielding materials. There is no need for protection measures when the time after implantation exceeds the precaution time. For example, subjects A and B are both cancer patients who have received 125I-seed implantation and the initial dose rate for patient A at 30 cm (Ḋ0, a) is 5 μSv/h, while the initial dose rate for patient B at the same distance (Ḋ0,b) is 10 μSv/h. So, based on the equation for a patient's spouse, the precaution time is Y = -108.532 + 83.318 lnḊ0, which is 26 d for patient A and 83 d for patient B. Thus, we are clearly informed patient A's spouse needs 26 d of the necessary protective measures, while patient B's spouse needs 83 d.\nWith this protection strategy, there is no need to consider implant location, depth, seed number, and activity. Instead, knowledge of the initial post-operative dose rate is enough to inform the type and duration of radioprotection, where person-specific precaution times can be obtained from the equation or the curve. Thus, this strategy takes into account the facts that seed number and activity will differ from case to case in clinical application of 125I-seed brachytherapy. Ultimately, this reduces the risks of over-protection and protection deficiency.\nExposing the public to radiation that exceeds the safe dose is both immoral and dangerous.删除4：<u>21</u> Thus, it is the goal of this study to guide radioprotection strategies for those close to patients receiving 125I-seed implantation and to inform how we implement radioprotection for different groups of people. Individualized and exact precaution times will also improve patient compliance and the public perception of such treatments.\nNevertheless, the number of subjects involved in this study was low, so studies with more subjects are needed to make the results more comprehensive and the curve fitting more accurate if we are to develop post-brachytherapy radioprotection strategies that are more scientific and patient-specific.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Dose rate can be converted into effective dose E using the relationship,12\n\nwhere, 34.56 is a conversion factor obtained through integration, 1.44 × 24 (h/d); Tp is the half-life of the seed 125I which is 59.6 d; Tr is the occupancy factor, which reflects the time of close contact between a member of a particular group and the patient.

The mean precaution time and the range of precaution time for general adult family members, spouses, coworkers, and children or pregnant women were (4.17 ± 16.55), (102.93 ± 49.22), (51.00 ± 61.29), and (34.27 ± 56.90) d; (0-90.61), (0-234.01), (0-247.81), and (0-224.69), respectively. Thus, for patients with minimum initial dose rates, the precaution time for all groups was 0 d, while for the patients with maximum initial dose rates, the longest precaution time was 247.81 d. From the data above, we found that the precaution time varied greatly with Ḋ0.\nThe correlations between initial dose rate and precaution time (Y) were illustrated in Fig. 1. There was logarithmic relationship between initial dose rate and precaution time for each group. The equations are Y = -131.569 + 83.256 lnḊ0 for general adult family members, Y = -108.532 + 83.318 lnḊ0 for spouses, Y = 25.470 + 83.318 lnḊ0 for coworkers, and Y = 2.585 + 83.229 lnḊ0 for children and pregnant women.\nPrecaution time, which refers to the time taken for the dose to decay to 50% of the effective dose limit and is specific to a particular group of people that come into contact with an implanted patient, is generally used to guide radiation protection.删除4：<u>15,16,17,18</u> Dauer et al.13 reported that precaution times for a child in close contact with an implanted prostate patient and a pregnant woman that sleeps with the implanted patient are 42 and 84 d, respectively, while no radiation safety precaution times are required for spouses, general adult family members, and coworkers.\nLicciardello et al.19 retrospectively studied 180 patients with prostate cancer receiving 125I-seed brachytherapy and established a model to estimate the effective dose in terms of total implant activity. This model was then used to calculate the effective doses for relatives and other people then estimate the time to reach radioprotection dose constrains. However, the values obtained by the theoretical model were higher than those measured, and there were many uncertainties in the measurements. Thus, the theoretical model can only provide estimates and not effective protection advice for individuals.\nThe above two studies were both based on prostate cancer, which has a high reference value for the study of radiation safety and precaution time. Unfortunately, their results cannot be applied to other parts of tumors after seed implantation, even for prostate cancer, due to differences in seed number, activity, and dose, as well as uncertainties in the measurements. Thus, the precaution times derived from these studies differ significantly.\nSui et al.20 studied 20 implanted patients after brachytherapy and determined their initial dose rates, effective doses, and precaution times. They drew the conclusion that the precaution time for general adult family members, spouses, coworkers, and children or pregnant women who live with the patient are 0, 109, 78, and 54 d, respectively. Although different kinds of tumors in different body parts were studied in this research, the precaution time obtained with the average initial dose rates of the 20 patients are similar to the corresponding values obtained in the present study, as shown in Table 1. The differences in implantation depth, activity, dose, and number are responsible for the different initial dose rates, so there are large differences between the maximum initial dose rates, minimum initial dose rates, and average dose rates in each group of people. Consequently, there are also large differences in precaution time.\nThe precaution time values obtained based solely on the average initial dose rate are not exactly correct for every person that has close contact with an implanted patient. There is no need for concern when the initial dose rate is lower than the minimum dose rate, as this would lead to over-protection, while protection deficiency will occur if the initial dose rate is higher than a certain value, potentially causing radiation injury to contacts.\nThe present study challenges the ideas from the three cited above. Here, precaution time was calculated based on initial dose rate for different kinds of patients, and curve fitting was used to derive correlation equations for dose rate vs. precaution time. This means that specific close contacts can use the appropriate equation to determine their specific precaution time, and patient families can be accurately informed about the necessity of protection and how long it should last.\nSuch protection can be implemented by lessening contact time, lengthening contact distance, and using shielding materials. There is no need for protection measures when the time after implantation exceeds the precaution time. For example, subjects A and B are both cancer patients who have received 125I-seed implantation and the initial dose rate for patient A at 30 cm (Ḋ0, a) is 5 μSv/h, while the initial dose rate for patient B at the same distance (Ḋ0,b) is 10 μSv/h. So, based on the equation for a patient's spouse, the precaution time is Y = -108.532 + 83.318 lnḊ0, which is 26 d for patient A and 83 d for patient B. Thus, we are clearly informed patient A's spouse needs 26 d of the necessary protective measures, while patient B's spouse needs 83 d.\nWith this protection strategy, there is no need to consider implant location, depth, seed number, and activity. Instead, knowledge of the initial post-operative dose rate is enough to inform the type and duration of radioprotection, where person-specific precaution times can be obtained from the equation or the curve. Thus, this strategy takes into account the facts that seed number and activity will differ from case to case in clinical application of 125I-seed brachytherapy. Ultimately, this reduces the risks of over-protection and protection deficiency.\nExposing the public to radiation that exceeds the safe dose is both immoral and dangerous.删除4：<u>21</u> Thus, it is the goal of this study to guide radioprotection strategies for those close to patients receiving 125I-seed implantation and to inform how we implement radioprotection for different groups of people. Individualized and exact precaution times will also improve patient compliance and the public perception of such treatments.\nNevertheless, the number of subjects involved in this study was low, so studies with more subjects are needed to make the results more comprehensive and the curve fitting more accurate if we are to develop post-brachytherapy radioprotection strategies that are more scientific and patient-specific.", "index": 4075, "show": true, "start": 4075, "end": 4562, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余换行"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:14:53", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:16:31", "cost": 97.681}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:30", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:16:30", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:14:52"}

Among them, 18 had delayed fluid resuscitation (DR) and the others had early fluid resuscitation (ER) within 6 hours postburn. Sixty-six gnotobiotic rats were used in a collaborating experiment as burn models. They were divided into 4 groups: sham injury (n=6), early resuscitation (n=24), late resuscitation (n=24) and vitamins E and C treatment group (n=12). All the rats, except those in the sham injury group, were inflicted with 40% total body surface area (TBSA) third-degree burns. OFR was determined in the blood of patients with electron spin resonance (ESR). S/W ratio and tau c values of patients' erythrocytes were measured with ESR spectrometer. Blood superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) activities, malondialdehyde contents and plasma endotoxin levels were assayed. Rats were sacrificed at the 12th, 24th, 48th and 72nd hour after injury.

To date, MIS does not change the treatment mode used in traditional open surgery, namely, \"resect not only lesions but also partial or complete selected organ,\" leading to loss of some organs and anatomical reconstruction of remaining organs. Every organ in the human body has its own function and plays an important role in the normal metabolism of our body; thus, no organ is redundant. Moreover, we know much less about the interaction between organs than the function of special organs. If one organ was partially or completely resected, the remaining organ might not function as well as it did before the resection. The functions of other organs might be affected by the loss or partial removal of this organ. Patients often suffer from complications related to the loss of organs. For example, patients who underwent proximal gastrectomy often suffered from reflux post-operation, resulting in a decline in their sleep quality. Patients often lived with dyspepsia, innutrition, diarrhea, and anemia after total gastrectomy.\nHuman organ reconstruction that accomplishes the creation of organs that are the same as those we are born with remains far from possible. The highest expectation of the disease treatment method is to remove lesions and retain organs without inducing additional discomfort. It is better not to break the normal structure or affect survival. With the development of endoscopy, it has become possible to treat more lesions by endoscopy without changing the anatomical structure of our body.

The treatment modes of traditional open surgery, MIS, and SMIS are shown in Supplementary Figure 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A585. Surgical treatments, such as endoscopic mucosal resection, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), and endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection, could be regarded as SMIS because they can be applied to resect early gastrointestinal cancer without injuring the integrity of the gastrointestinal duct.\nNot all endoscopic operations are classified as SMIS, whereas laparoscopy and thoracoscopy are classified as MIS.

This cooperative application of endoscopy and laparoscopy should be regarded as SMIS. Although MIS is well developed and regarded as the main surgical operation, it cannot completely replace traditional open surgery. Similarly, SMIS is the main surgical method; however, it might not completely replace MIS in the near future. It provides us with a new treatment method and a development direction for medicine in the future.\nTaking gastrointestinal diseases as an example, SMIS can be mainly applied to obstruction relief and lesion resection. Obstruction relief treatments mainly include foreign body removal, stenosis relief, pus drainage, necrosis drainage, and bile duct obstruction removal. Lesion resection treatments mainly include the resection of early gastrointestinal cancer, submucosal tumors, polyps, and neuroendocrine tumors. The digestive endoscopic tunnel technique (DETT), which was first proposed by Linghu in 2009,通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> played a landmark role in the development of SMIS. DETT divided the gastrointestinal tract wall into two layers by establishing a tunnel between the mucosal and muscularis propria, making endoscopic treatment of diseases that used to be treated by surgery possible. DETT broke the boundary between gastrointestinal internal medicine and surgery, promoting the development of SMIS.\nFor most benign lesions, SMIS is believed to achieve a therapeutic effect similar to that of surgical treatment. For malignant lesions, SMIS is mainly applied to those in the early stage. For lesions in the advanced stage, traditional open surgery and MIS are still regarded as the optimum resection methods. The applications of SMIS are affected not only by the development of techniques and equipment but also by the characteristics and the stage of the disease. However, diseases are increasingly diagnosed in their early stage with the development of medicine. More and more diseases are indicated for SMIS.\nWhen SMIS is performed to treat a disease, the type, location and stage of the lesion, and the treatment method should be demonstrated. The SMIS should be described as \"location + disease + SMIS (type).\" Taking ESD for early esophageal cancer as an example, the standard demonstration should be \"esophageal early cancer (T1aN0M0) SMIS (ESD).\"\nSMIS does not affect the QoL and expectancy of patients because it can not only cure the disease but also make no changes to the anatomical structure of organs.\nSMIS also has the advantages of less invasion, shorter operation time, shorter hospital stay, and less expense than MIS and traditional open surgery. For example, when SMIS was applied to resect early rectal cancer close to the anus, the anatomical structures of the rectum and anus were maintained.

Nuclear ophthalmoplegia resulted from brainstem infarction is often accompanied by other symptoms of brainstem dysfunction. It is fairly rare that midbrain infarction only manifests as isolated medial rectus nuclear palsy.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Here, we provided such an uncommon case and discussed the possible etiology.\nA 57-year-old right-handed male patient was admitted to our hospital because of diplopia. Three days ago, he got up with horizontal diplopia which resolved by closing either eye, and he denied other symptoms. On admission, ocular examination only showed left medial rectus palsy, and movement of other extraocular muscles was normal, and pupils were not involved 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a and Figure 1b]</u>. Other neurological examinations had no positive sign. His past medical history included hypertension for 37 years, and diabetes mellitus for 15 years. He had been a smoker for 30 years with twenty cigarettes per day, and alcoholic for 30 years with 100 ml per day. There were some sporadic old lacunar infarcts affecting both hemispheres on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a fresh ischemic lesion in the right paramedian midbrain on diffusion weighted image 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1c]</u>. To clarify the etiology, head–neck computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), high-resolution MRI (HRMRI), ultrasonic cardiogram (UCG), electrocardiogram (ECG) and 12-lead ECG Holter were completed. The CTA and MRA showed severe stenosis of the proximal segment of the right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and distal vascular branches reduced 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1d and Figure 1e]</u>. The HRMRI found the atherosclerotic plaque formation in the proximal segment of the right PCA 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1f]</u>. There was no evidence of cardiac construction change on UCG or arrhythmia on ECG. The patient received antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and hypoglycemic treatments. His symptom improved 11 days later at discharge.\nIsolated unilateral extraocular muscle palsy is usually resulted from lesion in orbit or muscular disease and rarely from cranial nerve or nucleus.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> In our report, the patient was characterized by right, pure medial rectus nuclear palsy due to acute mesencephalon infarction. To our knowledge, the oculomotor nuclear is situated at the superior colliculus level of the midbrain, which is composed of two parts: the main motor nucleus and the accessory parasympathetic nucleus. The former consists of the lateral somatic cell column, caudal central nucleus, and medial cell column. They innervate superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus and inferior oblique muscle, and levator palpebrae muscle. The latter is located at the dorsomedial region of the oculomotor nerve nucleus which controls ciliary muscle and sphincter of the pupil. These subnuclei spaced very closely in the gray matter of the midbrain. Hence, isolated medial rectus nuclear palsy without other extraocular muscles, pupil, and convergence reflex involved is extremely rare. As far as we know, there are only a few similar cases reported,通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3,4,5]</u> and the comparison of six cases is shown in Supplementary Table 1.\nThe etiology and angiographic findings were not mentioned detailedly in previous cases. In our case, we excluded cardiac embolism by necessary cardiac tests. In addition to multiple risk factors of atherosclerosis in patients, sufficient angiographic examinations including CTA, MRA, and high-resolution MRA revealed severe stenosis of the proximal segment of the right PCA. Anatomically, the proximal segment of PCA gives off some small perforating arteries to supply ipsilateral midbrain structure, so we speculated that ipsilateral PCA was the responsible vessel of midbrain infarction in our case, and the possible pathophysiology was large artery atherosclerosis according to the China Ischemic Stroke Subclassification. In general, PCA mainly supplies for the medial temporal lobe, occipital lobe, hippocampus, thalamus, corpus callosum, and midbrain. Because its blood supply regions are large, pure midbrain infarction owing to stenosis of PCA is clinically infrequent. Furthermore, medial rectus muscle nuclear paralysis without other nervous system involved is fairly rare in the symptomatic spectrum of midbrain infarction.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Therefore, our case is unique because it not only enriches the symptomatology of PCA stenosis but also provides a thorough radiological evaluation and reveals the possible pathophysiology.\nSupplementary information is linked to the online version of the paper on the Chinese Medical Journal website.\n删除3：<u>This study was supported by grants from the Research Fund of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2015-2-QN-39)</u>, China-Japan Friendship Hospital Youth Science and Technology Excellence Project 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2014-QNYC-A-04)</u>, and National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81173595)</u>.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:14:51", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:14:59", "cost": 8.115}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:30", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:14:58", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:14:50"}

The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of RTPI in assessment of ped-infarct ischemia during dobutamine and adenosine stress. Methods We employed the RTPI modality (Agilent and ATL Philips) in a canine model (18 dogs) of distal coronary occlusion and proximal coronary stenosis. Using coronary flow probe recordings, the physiologic significance of proximal coronary stenosis was established by confirming abolition of the coronary reserve. The contrast agent Optison was given as a slow bolus injection at baseline, during prolonged distal coronary occlusion, dudng adenosine bolus stress and dudng dobutamine stress. Tdphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was used to verify a distal infarction. RTPI recordings at baseline, the distal coronary occlusion and stress protocols were randomly mixed and reviewed blindly. Results In all but one dog, RTPI detected a distal infarct as small as 9% of the left ventricle. The sensitivity, specificity and overall diagnostic accuracy of RTPI in the detection of distal infarcts were: 94%, 89% and 92%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic accuracy of RTPI in the assessment of peri-infarction ischemia were 83%, 92% and 88% for adenosine stress and 95%, 86% and 91% for dobutamine stress, respectively.

It is one of the most common neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) but considered as the fourth most transmitted disease after malaria, tuberculosis, and schistosomiasis by the World Bank and World Health Organization (WHO) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. About 120 million people are at risk, and 6-8 million infected with T. cruzi in the Latin American and Caribbean region 通用删除6(英):<u>[2, 3]</u>. Chagas disease once called as \"the new HIV/AIDS of the Americas\", since its salient similarities existed between people living with Chagas disease and people living with HIV/AIDS 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\nWith the globalization and increasing mobility during last decade, Chagas disease is spreading to non-endemic areas, including the United States of America, Canada, and many European and some Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific countries  通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3]</u>. Most of cases found in non-endemic areas are infected through blood or blood product transfusion, organ transplants, mother and infant congenital transmission, consumption of contaminated food, laboratory accidents, etc. The general approach to prevent Chagas disease in non-endemic countries is performed by (i) preventing T. cruzi transmission by systematically screening blood used for transfusions and organs intended for transplantation; (ii) clinic diagnosis, case management, and treating patients, including infected new-borns through congenital transmission; and (iii) sharing information about Chagas disease, and training health personnel to facilitate diagnosis and medical care 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\nIn order to raise public awareness of this NTD that affects mainly poor people, the 72nd World Health Assembly approved the designation of a World Chagas Disease Day in 2019. The day set on 14 April is to memorize the discovery of the disease, that the first patient, a Brazilian girl was discovered by Dr. Carlos Ribeiro Justiniano Chagas on 14 April, 1909. It is certain that setting up the World Chagas Disease Day will provide a unique opportunity to add a global voice in favour of this and other neglected diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\nAs an international journal addressing essential public health questions relating to infectious diseases of poverty, this journal has published several articles on epidemiology, biology, treatment and control of Chagas disease and its vectors, with its transmission as a hot topic. All results from those publications showed that transmission of Chagas disease can be effectively interrupted by controlling the main vectors and other initiatives, which have been implemented with some success. But it is still a serious problem for public health due to the threat of high disease burden in endemic regions 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>, spreading to non-endemic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[7, 8]</u>, and lack of more appropriate strategy and innovative research in resources limited settings 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. This Editorial is to raise awareness and propose global preparedness for the world-wide spreading of Chagas disease.\nTwo phases of Chagas disease, the acute phase and the chronic phase, can be observed in the human infections. Trypanosoma cruzi infection is curable if treatment is initiated soon after infection. In chronic patients, antiparasitic treatment can potentially prevent or curb disease progression and prevent transmission, for instance, mother-to-child infection. The parasites, T. cruzi, multiply within cells in the body of the human after infection which mainly transmitted by contact with faeces/urine of infected blood-sucking triatomine bugs  通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. The bugs usually bite an exposed area of skin such as the face, hence its common name 'kissing bug’. These bugs, especially the domestic habitated triatomine, typically live in the wall or roof cracks of homes and peridomiciliary structures, such as chicken coops, pens and warehouses, in rural or suburban areas. Vector control is the most useful method to prevent Chagas disease in Latin America.\nIn addition to information dissemination, public health education and communication to raise the awareness of the disease at community level, more efforts on intervention involved by communities are also important through current health systems. In the intervention areas, chemotherapy and vector control have been proved to be effective attempts to minimize the disease burden 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>. Community-based interventions, including insecticide treated bed nets, insecticide spraying, preventive chemotherapy, and treatment, will be more effective when combining with vertical vector control programmes. This also requires high level governmental commitment along with strong partnerships among major stakeholders 通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13]</u>. In wider context, the equitable system on social determinants of health and public health policies shall be built to ensure better health and living conditions for all individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>.\nCommunity-based vector surveillance system is also workable within the health systems. Integrated with primary health intervention, an active vector surveillance system is vital to improve intervention performance and monitor the risk of imported pathogens. Continued efforts are necessary to keep adapting the surveillance system to the dynamic health systems 通用删除6(英):<u>[1, 14]</u>. For example, application of geographical information systems and remote sensing data in the surveillance system can not only widen the knowledge of climatic, environmental, anthropogenic and biodiversity factors that influence the reduction or the re-emergence of Chagas disease, but also integrate into research and decision-making processes for mapping risks, and creating early warning systems, which will give an assistance for decision makers to better allocate limited resources 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\nWith the acceleration of the globalization process, the Chagas disease is also likely to occur in non-endemic countries through imported cases. It is strongly suggested that those non-endemic countries or regions with high risk of imported cases need to establish the surveillance-response systems and preparedness mechanism to monitor and control imported Chagas disease, particularly those areas where blood-sucking triatomine bugs existed, with following recommendations.\nThe early warning system is importance to predict the potential risk areas where transmission might be emergence when imported cases occurred. The local resources to establish this kind of early warning system is needed, and allocation of these resources are based on the levels of transmission risks, so that early warning efforts are able to predominantly target to the high-risk areas. For Chagas disease, its coverage of epidemic is closely related to the transmission vector-triatomine, so the predicted risks are possible to be projected based on the survey results of vector-triatomine distribution. For instance, some researchers have extracted the climatic and environmental factors in the areas where triatomine bugs exist, created spatial and temporal stratification of the disease and population at risk 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\nIn order to respond effectively to uncertain future scenarios of vector-borne disease, more attention needs to be given to build a resilient and equitable system at present. It is recommended to adopt the community-based adaptation to foster effective organization of local people to participate in decision-making. And it can also promotes the integration of different disciplines together, and the forging of partnerships with communities, valuing local knowledge, which is an effective and integrated problem-solving approach. Under the \"One Health\" and \"EcoHealth\" concept, our Editorial highlighted the importance of building strong community-level outreach systems which can address vulnerability and build resilience of control Chagas disease and other vector-borne diseases.\nThe strategy to control the local transmission introduced by the imported case of Chagas disease is to interrupt vector-borne transmission, thus, it is of importance to set up a vector surveillance-response system which could minimize infection risks of Chagas disease. The monitoring and evaluation scheme for the control of native species are urgently revised internationally, so that all reports on vectors’ distribution and responses are able to be registered in a digital database worldwide. Then it can be used to describe and analyse the system performance in terms of amount of vector reports as well as rates and timeliness of responses at global level. Thus, we suggest that improvement and integration of current vector surveillance-response systems through WHO channel is an importance of creating sound opportunities to strengthen the broader and more resilient health system in resources limited settings.\nCurrent treatment methods and vector control measures are highly challenged by drug and insecticide resistance, which affects virtually all interventions currently used. More attention and investments are needed to improve appropriate strategy and technology 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Updated strategies in understanding epidemiological patterns and therapeutic outcome of the disease, as well as innovative research on development of more sensitive diagnostic tools and more efficient drugs, are also encouraged to sustain and scale up control successes in all endemic regions 通用删除6(英):<u>[10, 16]</u>.\nThe improved surveillance-response systems and preparedness mechanism are of great significance to control the world-wide spread of Chagas disease, a neglected but harmful disease. The urgent needs to strengthen the health systems in both endemic and non-endemic areas are to pay more efforts on early warning of the transmission risks, addressing vulnerability and building resilience systems including a vector surveillance-response system. Innovative researches on technology development on therapeutic outcome, more sensitive diagnostic tools, and more efficient drugs, are also encouraged.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:49:18", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:49:36", "cost": 18.052}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:30", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:49:36", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:49:17"}

In order to contribute to this effort in this study we analyzed a dataset ranging from 2001 to 2017 to investigate for the first time the spatial and temporal dynamics of CL at the municipality level in Brazil. Using exploratory maps, built with Geographic Information System (GIS), and spatial and temporal statistical methods, we determined in which areas in Brazil CL incidence is higher and whether it increased, stabilized or decreased over time. In addition to an up-to-date discussion on spatiotemporal aspects of CL, we also suggest which areas in Brazil might be important for future research, monitoring and control measures.\nBrazil has 5570 municipalities distributed in 26 states which are grouped in five macroregions: north, northeast, midwest, southeast and south. These macroregions were established in the 1970s by IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) to facilitate the survey and dissemination of statistical data in Brazil to add a perspective to the understanding of national territory organization and to help the federal government, as well as states and municipalities, in the implementation and management of public policies and investments. In addition, Brazil has also an area called Legal Amazon, which was created by the government in the 1950s to prompt the development of socio-economic policies in this region. Currently, Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) area covers all states from North region (Amazonas, Acre, Rondônia, Roraima, Amapá, Tocantins and Pará), the state of Mato Grosso (Midwest) and part of Maranhão (Northeast). It covers 720 municipalities, with an approximate area of 5 217 423 km2, corresponding to 61% of the Brazilian territory 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\nA data set on individual-level, anonymized, cases of CL comprising a period ranging from 2001 to 2017 was provided by the Information System of Notifiable Disease (SINAN—Sistema de Informação e Notificação de Agravos) of the Ministry of Health of Brazil. Confirmed CL cases were grouped by year and municipality, and CL annual incidence was calculated with the estimated annual population data extracted from Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE—Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística).\nCreated in 1990, SINAN is the official nationwide platform for epidemiological surveillance of all compulsory notifiable diseases, which are defined by the National Compulsory Notification List of diseases. It is responsible for notification, investigation and, in the case of communicable diseases, follow-up and the outcome of patient’s treatment. Notification is usually made by health professionals in the most peripheral administrative level (i.e. health care units) through standardized individual notification record by disease or condition type. All compulsory notifiable disease should be notified by the public, private and philanthropic health services.

The dataset of confirmed CL cases is publicly available and can be accessed on the SINAN webpage .\nFirst, we explored temporal trends of incidence for all country and for all municipalities affected by the disease. We used the LOESS curve fitting (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> to assess the tendency line of annual CL incidence in Brazil. To adjust the curve we used a combination of parameters to minimized an excessive weight in the smoothing and avoid over-adjustment. We found a better curve adjustment with an alpha value of 0.6. Since Brazil has thousands of municipalities, it is not feasible to visualize the time trend curves for each municipality individually. Therefore, we used the Mann Kendall Trend Test 通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23]</u> to evaluate if there was a significant temporal trend on the time series of each municipality, we categorized the municipalities according to their time trend and we plotted the obtained results on a map. The Mann-Kendall trend test is a non-parametric test for identifying trends in time series data and it works comparing the relative magnitudes of sample data rather than the data values themselves 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. We used the statistical software R 3.6.3 (Lucent Technologies, Jasmine Mountain, USA) to perform the LOESS curve fitting and ARCGIS 10.4 (ESRI, Red-lands, CA, USA) to perform Mann Kendall Trend test.\nThe spatial-temporal scanning method proposed by Kulldorffs 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> was used to find spatiotemporal clusters of CL by detecting an excess of cases in a given region and period of time. This method makes the assumption that the disease cases are generated by a non-homogenous Poisson process and, under the null hypothesis, the expected cases for each municipality are proportional to their population size. This method was implemented through a two-dimensional cylindrical window: an ellipse base, representing the potential cluster’s geographic areas and the height representing the period of study (number of years). The radius of the cylinder window varied in both spatial size and temporal length until it reached a previously defined maximum area of 15% of the population size and 90% of the study period.\nWithin each cylinder, the actual and expected number of disease cases, along with a Poisson generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) is calculated. The P-value for detected cluster was assessed using Monte Carlos simulation, where the maximum likelihood from the actual data was compared to the maximum likelihood from each 999 random simulated data sets generated under the null hypothesis. The cylinder with the maximum likelihood and with more than its expected number of cases was designated the most likely cluster. The other cylinders for which the likelihood value was statistically significant were defined as secondary clusters, and were ranked according to their likelihood ratio test statistics 通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u>. Scan statistics analysis were performed using SatScan software v9.6 (Boston, MA, USA) and the results were visualized using ArcGIS 10.4 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA).\nBefore running the temporal hotspot analysis we transformed our data into a 3D cube format with bins fixed in space (x, y) and time (z). The space value (x, y) was assigned as the coordinates of each municipality and the time value (z) was the incidence of CL in each municipality per year of study. Thereafter, to evaluate spatiotemporal hotspots of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis incidence in each municipality we applied the Emerging Hot Spot Analysis tool (ArcGIS 10.4) using a combination of Getis ord Gi* statistic and Mann Kendall Trend test.\nThe Getis ord Gi* statistic 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> was used to identify areas of aggregation of higher incidence of CL in Brazil. This method works by summing the incidence value of one municipality and its neighbors comparing proportionally to the sum of incidence of all municipalities. When the local sum is much different than the expected, and that difference is too large to be the result of random chance, a statistically significant Z score is the result. The Getis-Ord Gi* statistic generates Z scores (standard deviations) and P values (statistical probabilities) for each bin. A Z score above 1.96 means that there is a statically significant hot spot at a significant level of P < 0.05 and the larger a bin’s Z-score the more intense the hotspot is. Due to the cube structure of the data, neighboring bins exist both in time and in space. The emerging hotspot package used an adapted formula of kernel density search radius to define the neighborhood size in space 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> and temporal neighbors were defined using one prior timestep interval.\nThe Mann-Kendall statistic 通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23]</u> was used to evaluate a statistically significant temporal trend across the time series of Z-scores resulting from Getis-Ord Gi statistic. In this test, the bin value of the first time period is compared to the bin value for the second. If the first is smaller than the second, the result is a +1, if it is larger the result is -1, and if the two values are tied, the result is zero, indicating no trend in the values over time. Each pair of time steps was compared over the 17-year series, generating the Mann-Kendall statistics with associated trend Z-score and P-value for each bin. Based on the variance for the values in the bin time series, the number of ties, and the number of time periods, the observed sum is compared to the expected sum (zero) to determine if the difference is statistically significant or not. A small P-value indicates the trend is statistically significant, and the sign associated with the Z-score determines if the series has a monotonic increase (positive Z-score) or decrease trend (negative Z-score). The hotspot and trend results from the Getis Ord Gi* and Mann-Kendall statistic were used to categorize each municipality 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> .\nCategory name and definition of statistically significant hotspots representing different temporal states (ESRI ArcGIS Pro 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>)\n删除重复语句：<u>Category name and definition of statistically significant hotspots representing different temporal states (ESRI ArcGIS Pro 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>)</u>\nDuring 2001-2017 period, a total of 379 571 cases of CL were registered in 73.8% of municipalities in Brazil  with an average incidence of 11.86 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. The number of municipalities with confirmed CL cases was highest in 2002 (n = 2156) and lowest in 2016 (n = 1635). The CL incidence reported per year in Brazil showed that there is a tendency for reduction in number of cases. This curve also followed the fluctuation of the number of municipalities with CL-positive cases, with maximum value in the year 2003 and the minimum value in 2016 .\nDespite the wide distribution of cases approximately 80% of them occurred in only 10% of municipalities which were located mainly in Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA), especially in the states namely Maranhão (MA), Mato Grosso (MT), Pará (PA) and Rondônia (RO), and outside of BLA in the state of Bahia (BA) . The temporal trend analysis for each municipality showed that 24.2% of them had a decrease in CL incidence, 3.2% had an increase, whereas 72.5% showed no tendency at all .\nThe most likely cluster detected has a relative risk of 12 (P < 0.001) for 2001-2015 period and covers the whole BLA . In the secondary clusters the first cluster in the rank was located in the central coast of Bahia (BA) and has a relative risk of 39.2 (P < 0.001) for 2003-2017 period. The scan statistics also identified 20 more secondary clusters located in 90 municipalities scattered throughout mainly in the states of Minas Gerais (MG), São Paulo (SP), and Paraná (PR), with a relative risk ranging from 1.7 (from 2001 to 2004 and P < 0.05) to 22.7 (2001 to 2009 and P < 0.001)  .\nCutaneous leishmaniasis secondary clusters detected in Brazil between 2001 and 2017 using the space-time scan statistic\n删除重复语句：<u>Cutaneous leishmaniasis secondary clusters detected in Brazil between 2001 and 2017 using the space-time scan statistic</u>\nBA Bahia, CE MG Minas Gerais, PR Paraná, RJ Rio de Janeiro, SC Santa Catarina, SP São Paulo\nThe emerging hotspot analysis identified significant areas of agglomeration of high incidence of CL in space and time . These hotspots were located inside the most likely cluster area, excluding the central part of the Amazonas State (AM), east of Pará (PA), and most of Maranhão (MA) . Another hotspot detected in the analysis was located in the central coast of Bahia, overlapping the area covered by the first in the rank of secondary clusters, as showed in Fig. 4.\nA general decreasing trend in CL incidence was also found in the hotspot temporal analysis, whereas most of the hotspots identified were classified as historical or reducing hotspot. Most of the reducing hotspots were located in western BLA, although the temporal hotspot analysis also showed an intensifying hotspot placed in the coast of Bahia, in addition to persistent and recent hotspots located mainly in Amapá (AP), most of Roraima (RO), east of Acre (AC), west of Pará and south of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) .\nTo our knowledge, the present study describes for the first time spatial and temporal patterns of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases at municipality level for entirely Brazil. Despite Brazil being one of the countries with the highest incidence of CL in the world, most of the cases recorded from 2001 to 2017 were concentrated to specific regions. In addition, although we have found a general reduction of cases in Brazil, our results also showed that some municipalities had a stationary or an increasing tendency of CL incidence.\nThe spatiotemporal statistical scan showed that all municipalities in Brazilian Legal Amazon are included in the CL primary cluster. This is in agreement with a previous study that found that the states of Amapá, Roraima, Amazonas, Pará and Acre had the highest incidence of CL between 2001 and 2011 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. However, differently from this study, 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> evaluated the distribution of CL cases aggregated by Brazilian states and could not detect high incidence of CL in relatively small geographic areas in south, southeast and northeast of Brazil. Previous studies that accessed CL distribution in municipalities of Paraná 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> and Minas Gerais 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> also detected similar cluster areas as detected in this study, even using different methodologies. The only exception was the Jequitinhonha region and northern Minas Gerais, which were not included in any cluster in the present study, probably due to differences in the data sets composition. Therefore, the detection of similar regions with high incidence of CL in previous studies corroborates our results and highlights the relevance of the detected cluster areas to the surveillance and control of CL Leishmaniasis in Brazil.\nBased on the emerging hotspot analysis, we found a high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of hotspots inside the primary cluster. This method did not find a large agglomeration of CL cases in the central part of Amazonas and eastern Pará, but it did find a predominance of reducing hotspot in western BLA and permanent and emerging hotspots in northern and eastern BLA. These results corroborate previous studies that showed a high spatial and temporal variability of CL cases in some states in northern Brazil. In accordance to our study, Teles et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> found a smaller incidence of the disease in the interior of Amazonas and a high number of cases neighboring the State capital (Manaus), where we found a reducing hotspot. Additionally, similarly to this study Teles et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> also found a higher number of CL cases in municipalities located in the southern border of Amazonas with Acre. Analyzing a period of time ranging from 2007 to 2013, Melchior et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> found only one high-risk cluster of CL in southern part of Acre, but similarly to our study they also found that this region had a diminishing temporal trend of CL incidence.\nAlthough a high incidence of CL has been historically found in the central coast of Bahia 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>, this is the first time that this region has been identified as a cluster and an intensifying hotspot. It worth emphasizing that due to the risk of an increased trend of CL incidence and the risk of expansion of CL to neighboring regions, as previously reported for Rio de Janeiro state 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>, the central cost of Bahia should be targeted as a high priority region for future surveillance and control measures of cutaneous leishmaniasis.\nThe clusters and hotspots found in this study may suggest that CL tend to be spatially and temporally distributed in Brazil and that environmental factors might play a role in modulating this distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of American cutaneous leishmaniasis is positively associated with the amount of forest cover, high diversity of possible reservoir mammal species and favorable climatic conditions for the development of sand-flies vectors, such as warm and hot weather and low annual seasonality of temperature and precipitation 通用删除6(英):<u>[34,35,36]</u>. These environmental variables are typical of the Legal Amazon region in which we detected the most likely cluster of CL. Other studies have also shown positive association of CL cases and human environmental changes such as deforestation 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>, settlements near forested areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[32,38]</u> and development of agriculture crops 通用删除6(英):<u>[39,40]</u>. These activities are predominant at the border of the Legal Amazon in a location called \"Arc of Deforestation\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>, where we found most of the CL hotspots. Future studies should focus on understanding how these anthropogenic variables are affecting spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease in this area.\nThe presence of permanent and intensifying areas included in hotspots suggests that the strategies adopted for the control of CL in these regions might have not been efficient in reducing the number of cases. In Brazil, prevention strategies have mainly focused on diagnosis and treatment of the human disease, reducing morbidity, deformities and deaths, rather than on the control of vectors 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>. According to World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> an effective strategy for reducing human leishmaniasis is to control sand fly vectors and implementing health education in local communities, giving them important knowledge about individual protection measures and environmental modifications that can reduce the presence and frequency of vectors and hosts in the peridomicile and intradomicile areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>. Such an approach requires the proper knowledge of local epidemiology, which vector and host species are involved, their habitats, vector flight range, and seasonality 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>. However, the transmission patterns of CL are highly variable in Brazil, and little is known about the ecology of vector and mammalian reservoir species involved in the transmission cycle in many regions of the country 通用删除6(英):<u>[45,46]</u>. Therefore, the CL hotspot areas identified in this study should be considered as priorities in public health campaigns and should be used to guide future baseline studies about eco-epidemiology of CL transmission.\nThis study has two key limitations: First, is the use of secondary data, that can have different sources of errors including typing errors and the occurrence of under-reporting cases due to the low coverage of public health agencies in remote areas of the country. However, the SINAN have seen considerable improvements in the last decades, including the mandatory notification of CL on both public and private service since 2001. Furthermore, CL diagnoses and treatment is free for all Brazilian citizens in the unified public health system (SUS), and thus the records of most of the CL cases in Brazil must have been included in SINAM 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. Second, the analysis at the municipality level could not have revealed the actual site of disease focus. For more accurate analysis, future studies should examine the spatial distribution of CL at a finer scale (eg. zip code), however this data are poorly available in SINAN.\nThe use of two complementary approaches employed in this study allowed us to describe more precisely the spatial and temporal patterns of CL in Brazil. However, similar to all spatial clustering approaches, the statistical methods used in this study have limitations in accuracy and sensitivity. The scan is one of the most frequently employed methods of spatial and temporal cluster analysis and has the advantage of being adjusted for heterogeneous population and to look for clusters without specifying their specific localities overcoming the preselection bias 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>. However, this method has the disadvantage of not identify accurately the right format of very irregular clusters, and thus often report large clusters that contain several low-risk areas inside it 通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49]</u>. Therefore, we believe that this happened in our primary cluster due to the presence of some municipalities with low incidence rates. According to Han et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>, this issue could be improved by choosing ellipse radius values lower than 50%. However, due to the low population in northern Brazil (approximately 12.13% of Brazilian population) the analysis continued detecting a big and a few informative clusters, even when we reduce the radius length. In this sense, the gets Ord Gi analysis improved our study describing greater spatial and temporal heterogeneity in this area.\nIn this study the spatial-temporal dynamics of CL in Brazil has been analyzed for at the municipality level and with a wider temporal range than previous works. The scan method showed that the main cluster is located in the Brazilian Legal Amazon and that most of the secondary clusters are located in the southern and southeastern regions of Brazil. The emerging hotspot analysis identified a higher spatiotemporal variability of hotspot inside the BLA. Using this method, it was also possible to detect diminishing hotspots in the east and persistent, emergent, and new hotspots, mainly in municipalities of the states of Pará, Rondônia, and Roraima, Acre and south of Mato Grosso. Furthermore, we showed that the central coast of Bahia was one of the most critical regions for CL due to the presence of a cluster with the highest rank in a secondary cluster and an intensifying hotspot. Despite a general decrease trend of CL cases in Brazil found in this study, the identification of areas of persistent, emergent, new, and intensifying hotspots suggest that the control measures in these regions are not effective in controlling the disease. The results reported herein may assist and guide future research about CL eco-epidemiology and the implementation of disease control measures in Brazil.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-021-00872-x.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: S1.

This method works by summing the incidence value of one municipality and its neighbors comparing proportionally to the sum of incidence of all municipalities. When the local sum is much different than the expected, and that difference is too large to be the result of random chance, a statistically significant Z score is the result. The Getis-Ord Gi* statistic generates Z scores (standard deviations) and P values (statistical probabilities) for each bin. A Z score above 1.96 means that there is a statically significant hot spot at a significant level of P < 0.05 and the larger a bin’s Z-score the more intense the hotspot is. Due to the cube structure of the data, neighboring bins exist both in time and in space.

In this test, the bin value of the first time period is compared to the bin value for the second. If the first is smaller than the second, the result is a +1, if it is larger the result is -1, and if the two values are tied, the result is zero, indicating no trend in the values over time. Each pair of time steps was compared over the 17-year series, generating the Mann-Kendall statistics with associated trend Z-score and P-value for each bin. Based on the variance for the values in the bin time series, the number of ties, and the number of time periods, the observed sum is compared to the expected sum (zero) to determine if the difference is statistically significant or not. A small P-value indicates the trend is statistically significant, and the sign associated with the Z-score determines if the series has a monotonic increase (positive Z-score) or decrease trend (negative Z-score).

Most of the reducing hotspots were located in western BLA, although the temporal hotspot analysis also showed an intensifying hotspot placed in the coast of Bahia, in addition to persistent and recent hotspots located mainly in Amapá (AP), most of Roraima (RO), east of Acre (AC), west of Pará and south of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) .\nTo our knowledge, the present study describes for the first time spatial and temporal patterns of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases at municipality level for entirely Brazil. Despite Brazil being one of the countries with the highest incidence of CL in the world, most of the cases recorded from 2001 to 2017 were concentrated to specific regions. In addition, although we have found a general reduction of cases in Brazil, our results also showed that some municipalities had a stationary or an increasing tendency of CL incidence.\nThe spatiotemporal statistical scan showed that all municipalities in Brazilian Legal Amazon are included in the CL primary cluster. This is in agreement with a previous study that found that the states of Amapá, Roraima, Amazonas, Pará and Acre had the highest incidence of CL between 2001 and 2011 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. However, differently from this study, 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> evaluated the distribution of CL cases aggregated by Brazilian states and could not detect high incidence of CL in relatively small geographic areas in south, southeast and northeast of Brazil. Previous studies that accessed CL distribution in municipalities of Paraná 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> and Minas Gerais 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> also detected similar cluster areas as detected in this study, even using different methodologies. The only exception was the Jequitinhonha region and northern Minas Gerais, which were not included in any cluster in the present study, probably due to differences in the data sets composition. Therefore, the detection of similar regions with high incidence of CL in previous studies corroborates our results and highlights the relevance of the detected cluster areas to the surveillance and control of CL Leishmaniasis in Brazil.\nBased on the emerging hotspot analysis, we found a high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of hotspots inside the primary cluster. This method did not find a large agglomeration of CL cases in the central part of Amazonas and eastern Pará, but it did find a predominance of reducing hotspot in western BLA and permanent and emerging hotspots in northern and eastern BLA. These results corroborate previous studies that showed a high spatial and temporal variability of CL cases in some states in northern Brazil. In accordance to our study, Teles et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> found a smaller incidence of the disease in the interior of Amazonas and a high number of cases neighboring the State capital (Manaus), where we found a reducing hotspot. Additionally, similarly to this study Teles et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> also found a higher number of CL cases in municipalities located in the southern border of Amazonas with Acre. Analyzing a period of time ranging from 2007 to 2013, Melchior et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> found only one high-risk cluster of CL in southern part of Acre, but similarly to our study they also found that this region had a diminishing temporal trend of CL incidence.\nAlthough a high incidence of CL has been historically found in the central coast of Bahia 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>, this is the first time that this region has been identified as a cluster and an intensifying hotspot. It worth emphasizing that due to the risk of an increased trend of CL incidence and the risk of expansion of CL to neighboring regions, as previously reported for Rio de Janeiro state 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>, the central cost of Bahia should be targeted as a high priority region for future surveillance and control measures of cutaneous leishmaniasis.\nThe clusters and hotspots found in this study may suggest that CL tend to be spatially and temporally distributed in Brazil and that environmental factors might play a role in modulating this distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of American cutaneous leishmaniasis is positively associated with the amount of forest cover, high diversity of possible reservoir mammal species and favorable climatic conditions for the development of sand-flies vectors, such as warm and hot weather and low annual seasonality of temperature and precipitation 通用删除6(英):<u>[34,35,36]</u>. These environmental variables are typical of the Legal Amazon region in which we detected the most likely cluster of CL. Other studies have also shown positive association of CL cases and human environmental changes such as deforestation 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>, settlements near forested areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[32,38]</u> and development of agriculture crops 通用删除6(英):<u>[39,40]</u>. These activities are predominant at the border of the Legal Amazon in a location called \"Arc of Deforestation\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>, where we found most of the CL hotspots. Future studies should focus on understanding how these anthropogenic variables are affecting spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease in this area.\nThe presence of permanent and intensifying areas included in hotspots suggests that the strategies adopted for the control of CL in these regions might have not been efficient in reducing the number of cases. In Brazil, prevention strategies have mainly focused on diagnosis and treatment of the human disease, reducing morbidity, deformities and deaths, rather than on the control of vectors 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>. According to World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> an effective strategy for reducing human leishmaniasis is to control sand fly vectors and implementing health education in local communities, giving them important knowledge about individual protection measures and environmental modifications that can reduce the presence and frequency of vectors and hosts in the peridomicile and intradomicile areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>. Such an approach requires the proper knowledge of local epidemiology, which vector and host species are involved, their habitats, vector flight range, and seasonality 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>. However, the transmission patterns of CL are highly variable in Brazil, and little is known about the ecology of vector and mammalian reservoir species involved in the transmission cycle in many regions of the country 通用删除6(英):<u>[45,46]</u>. Therefore, the CL hotspot areas identified in this study should be considered as priorities in public health campaigns and should be used to guide future baseline studies about eco-epidemiology of CL transmission.\nThis study has two key limitations: First, is the use of secondary data, that can have different sources of errors including typing errors and the occurrence of under-reporting cases due to the low coverage of public health agencies in remote areas of the country. However, the SINAN have seen considerable improvements in the last decades, including the mandatory notification of CL on both public and private service since 2001. Furthermore, CL diagnoses and treatment is free for all Brazilian citizens in the unified public health system (SUS), and thus the records of most of the CL cases in Brazil must have been included in SINAM 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. Second, the analysis at the municipality level could not have revealed the actual site of disease focus. For more accurate analysis, future studies should examine the spatial distribution of CL at a finer scale (eg. zip code), however this data are poorly available in SINAN.\nThe use of two complementary approaches employed in this study allowed us to describe more precisely the spatial and temporal patterns of CL in Brazil. However, similar to all spatial clustering approaches, the statistical methods used in this study have limitations in accuracy and sensitivity. The scan is one of the most frequently employed methods of spatial and temporal cluster analysis and has the advantage of being adjusted for heterogeneous population and to look for clusters without specifying their specific localities overcoming the preselection bias 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>. However, this method has the disadvantage of not identify accurately the right format of very irregular clusters, and thus often report large clusters that contain several low-risk areas inside it 通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49]</u>. Therefore, we believe that this happened in our primary cluster due to the presence of some municipalities with low incidence rates. According to Han et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>, this issue could be improved by choosing ellipse radius values lower than 50%. However, due to the low population in northern Brazil (approximately 12.13% of Brazilian population) the analysis continued detecting a big and a few informative clusters, even when we reduce the radius length. In this sense, the gets Ord Gi analysis improved our study describing greater spatial and temporal heterogeneity in this area.\nIn this study the spatial-temporal dynamics of CL in Brazil has been analyzed for at the municipality level and with a wider temporal range than previous works. The scan method showed that the main cluster is located in the Brazilian Legal Amazon and that most of the secondary clusters are located in the southern and southeastern regions of Brazil. The emerging hotspot analysis identified a higher spatiotemporal variability of hotspot inside the BLA. Using this method, it was also possible to detect diminishing hotspots in the east and persistent, emergent, and new hotspots, mainly in municipalities of the states of Pará, Rondônia, and Roraima, Acre and south of Mato Grosso. Furthermore, we showed that the central coast of Bahia was one of the most critical regions for CL due to the presence of a cluster with the highest rank in a secondary cluster and an intensifying hotspot. Despite a general decrease trend of CL cases in Brazil found in this study, the identification of areas of persistent, emergent, new, and intensifying hotspots suggest that the control measures in these regions are not effective in controlling the disease. The results reported herein may assist and guide future research about CL eco-epidemiology and the implementation of disease control measures in Brazil.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-021-00872-x.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: S1.

CL is caused by an obligate parasite of the genus Leishmania and is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected female sandflies 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. It has three primary clinical forms: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> localized cutaneous, which is characterized by one or multiple ulcerated skin lesions; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> diffuse, in which the patients present nodular lesions disseminated all over the body; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> mucocutaneous, which is characterized by necrosis of the nasopharyngeal mucous tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. CL is treatable and has a low mortality rate, but it can generate social stigma and depressive disorder due to permanent scars and facial disfigurement 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\nCL occurs in at least 83 countries, mainly in the tropical, arid, and Mediterranean regions 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Recently, the World Health Organization classified this disease as a public health problem in the Americas and estimated that between 187 200 and 307 800 cases occur every year 通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u>. Most of CL cases in the Americas occur in Brazil, with an annual mean of newly infected people of 28 166 from 2001 to 2005 and 21 632 from 2006 to 2011 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. Brazil is also one of the countries with the highest number of cases of CL in the world, and alongside Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia, Iran, Syria, Ethiopia, Northern Sudan, Costa Rica, and Peru account together for 70-75% of the global incidence of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.\nA number of epidemiologic studies report that spatio-temporal distribution of CL is an important factor to be considered when planning mitigation measures to control this disease in seriously affected countries. For example, it has been shown that despite the higher incidence of CL in Costa Rica, Colombia and Syria the majority of the cases are aggregated in spatio-temporal clusters restricted to a few regions scattered throughout these countries 通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,11]</u>. The only long-term study assessing spatial and temporal distribution of CL cases in Brazil analyzed temporal variation for the entire country and spatial distribution of cases aggregated by Brazilian states 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. A few studies in Brazil assessed spatial and temporal variability of CL incidence in a higher resolution (i.e. for each municipality), and all of them were restricted to individual Brazilian states, namely: Paraná 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>, Minas Gerais 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>, Acre 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> and Amazonas 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>.\nAccording to the American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Surveillance Program in Brazil 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>, identifying territorial units of major epidemiological significance is essential to provide guidelines for public health policies as prevention, surveillance, and control measures. In order to contribute to this effort in this study we analyzed a dataset ranging from 2001 to 2017 to investigate for the first time the spatial and temporal dynamics of CL at the municipality level in Brazil. Using exploratory maps, built with Geographic Information System (GIS), and spatial and temporal statistical methods, we determined in which areas in Brazil CL incidence is higher and whether it increased, stabilized or decreased over time. In addition to an up-to-date discussion on spatiotemporal aspects of CL, we also suggest which areas in Brazil might be important for future research, monitoring and control measures.\nBrazil has 5570 municipalities distributed in 26 states which are grouped in five macroregions: north, northeast, midwest, southeast and south. These macroregions were established in the 1970s by IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) to facilitate the survey and dissemination of statistical data in Brazil to add a perspective to the understanding of national territory organization and to help the federal government, as well as states and municipalities, in the implementation and management of public policies and investments. In addition, Brazil has also an area called Legal Amazon, which was created by the government in the 1950s to prompt the development of socio-economic policies in this region. Currently, Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) area covers all states from North region (Amazonas, Acre, Rondônia, Roraima, Amapá, Tocantins and Pará), the state of Mato Grosso (Midwest) and part of Maranhão (Northeast). It covers 720 municipalities, with an approximate area of 5 217 423 km2, corresponding to 61% of the Brazilian territory 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\nA data set on individual-level, anonymized, cases of CL comprising a period ranging from 2001 to 2017 was provided by the Information System of Notifiable Disease (SINAN—Sistema de Informação e Notificação de Agravos) of the Ministry of Health of Brazil. Confirmed CL cases were grouped by year and municipality, and CL annual incidence was calculated with the estimated annual population data extracted from Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE—Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística).\nCreated in 1990, SINAN is the official nationwide platform for epidemiological surveillance of all compulsory notifiable diseases, which are defined by the National Compulsory Notification List of diseases. It is responsible for notification, investigation and, in the case of communicable diseases, follow-up and the outcome of patient’s treatment. Notification is usually made by health professionals in the most peripheral administrative level (i.e. health care units) through standardized individual notification record by disease or condition type. All compulsory notifiable disease should be notified by the public, private and philanthropic health services. If the notifying health facility does not have computerized system, the physical records should be sent periodically to the municipal, regional or state office to be further digitalized and submitted to the national database 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.\nCutaneous leishmaniasis has been included by a specific federal statement on the national list of compulsory notifiable diseases since 2001 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Only confirmed CL cases are notified, and they are diagnosed through clinical-epidemiological or laboratory criteria, mainly through direct parasitological examination, Montenegro Intradermal Test (MIT) or histopathological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>. The dataset of confirmed CL cases is publicly available and can be accessed on the SINAN webpage .\nFirst, we explored temporal trends of incidence for all country and for all municipalities affected by the disease. We used the LOESS curve fitting (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> to assess the tendency line of annual CL incidence in Brazil. To adjust the curve we used a combination of parameters to minimized an excessive weight in the smoothing and avoid over-adjustment. We found a better curve adjustment with an alpha value of 0.6. Since Brazil has thousands of municipalities, it is not feasible to visualize the time trend curves for each municipality individually. Therefore, we used the Mann Kendall Trend Test 通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23]</u> to evaluate if there was a significant temporal trend on the time series of each municipality, we categorized the municipalities according to their time trend and we plotted the obtained results on a map. The Mann-Kendall trend test is a non-parametric test for identifying trends in time series data and it works comparing the relative magnitudes of sample data rather than the data values themselves 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. We used the statistical software R 3.6.3 (Lucent Technologies, Jasmine Mountain, USA) to perform the LOESS curve fitting and ARCGIS 10.4 (ESRI, Red-lands, CA, USA) to perform Mann Kendall Trend test.\nThe spatial-temporal scanning method proposed by Kulldorffs 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> was used to find spatiotemporal clusters of CL by detecting an excess of cases in a given region and period of time. This method makes the assumption that the disease cases are generated by a non-homogenous Poisson process and, under the null hypothesis, the expected cases for each municipality are proportional to their population size. This method was implemented through a two-dimensional cylindrical window: an ellipse base, representing the potential cluster’s geographic areas and the height representing the period of study (number of years). The radius of the cylinder window varied in both spatial size and temporal length until it reached a previously defined maximum area of 15% of the population size and 90% of the study period.\nWithin each cylinder, the actual and expected number of disease cases, along with a Poisson generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) is calculated. The P-value for detected cluster was assessed using Monte Carlos simulation, where the maximum likelihood from the actual data was compared to the maximum likelihood from each 999 random simulated data sets generated under the null hypothesis. The cylinder with the maximum likelihood and with more than its expected number of cases was designated the most likely cluster. The other cylinders for which the likelihood value was statistically significant were defined as secondary clusters, and were ranked according to their likelihood ratio test statistics 通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u>. Scan statistics analysis were performed using SatScan software v9.6 (Boston, MA, USA) and the results were visualized using ArcGIS 10.4 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA).\nBefore running the temporal hotspot analysis we transformed our data into a 3D cube format with bins fixed in space (x, y) and time (z). The space value (x, y) was assigned as the coordinates of each municipality and the time value (z) was the incidence of CL in each municipality per year of study. Thereafter, to evaluate spatiotemporal hotspots of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis incidence in each municipality we applied the Emerging Hot Spot Analysis tool (ArcGIS 10.4) using a combination of Getis ord Gi* statistic and Mann Kendall Trend test.\nThe Getis ord Gi* statistic 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> was used to identify areas of aggregation of higher incidence of CL in Brazil. This method works by summing the incidence value of one municipality and its neighbors comparing proportionally to the sum of incidence of all municipalities.

The Getis-Ord Gi* statistic generates Z scores (standard deviations) and P values (statistical probabilities) for each bin. A Z score above 1.96 means that there is a statically significant hot spot at a significant level of P < 0.05 and the larger a bin’s Z-score the more intense the hotspot is.

Analyzing a period of time ranging from 2007 to 2013, Melchior et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> found only one high-risk cluster of CL in southern part of Acre, but similarly to our study they also found that this region had a diminishing temporal trend of CL incidence.\nAlthough a high incidence of CL has been historically found in the central coast of Bahia 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>, this is the first time that this region has been identified as a cluster and an intensifying hotspot. It worth emphasizing that due to the risk of an increased trend of CL incidence and the risk of expansion of CL to neighboring regions, as previously reported for Rio de Janeiro state 通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>, the central cost of Bahia should be targeted as a high priority region for future surveillance and control measures of cutaneous leishmaniasis.\nThe clusters and hotspots found in this study may suggest that CL tend to be spatially and temporally distributed in Brazil and that environmental factors might play a role in modulating this distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of American cutaneous leishmaniasis is positively associated with the amount of forest cover, high diversity of possible reservoir mammal species and favorable climatic conditions for the development of sand-flies vectors, such as warm and hot weather and low annual seasonality of temperature and precipitation 通用删除6(英):<u>[34,35,36]</u>. These environmental variables are typical of the Legal Amazon region in which we detected the most likely cluster of CL. Other studies have also shown positive association of CL cases and human environmental changes such as deforestation 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>, settlements near forested areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[32,38]</u> and development of agriculture crops 通用删除6(英):<u>[39,40]</u>. These activities are predominant at the border of the Legal Amazon in a location called \"Arc of Deforestation\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>, where we found most of the CL hotspots. Future studies should focus on understanding how these anthropogenic variables are affecting spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease in this area.\nThe presence of permanent and intensifying areas included in hotspots suggests that the strategies adopted for the control of CL in these regions might have not been efficient in reducing the number of cases. In Brazil, prevention strategies have mainly focused on diagnosis and treatment of the human disease, reducing morbidity, deformities and deaths, rather than on the control of vectors 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>. According to World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> an effective strategy for reducing human leishmaniasis is to control sand fly vectors and implementing health education in local communities, giving them important knowledge about individual protection measures and environmental modifications that can reduce the presence and frequency of vectors and hosts in the peridomicile and intradomicile areas 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>. Such an approach requires the proper knowledge of local epidemiology, which vector and host species are involved, their habitats, vector flight range, and seasonality 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>. However, the transmission patterns of CL are highly variable in Brazil, and little is known about the ecology of vector and mammalian reservoir species involved in the transmission cycle in many regions of the country 通用删除6(英):<u>[45,46]</u>. Therefore, the CL hotspot areas identified in this study should be considered as priorities in public health campaigns and should be used to guide future baseline studies about eco-epidemiology of CL transmission.\nThis study has two key limitations: First, is the use of secondary data, that can have different sources of errors including typing errors and the occurrence of under-reporting cases due to the low coverage of public health agencies in remote areas of the country. However, the SINAN have seen considerable improvements in the last decades, including the mandatory notification of CL on both public and private service since 2001. Furthermore, CL diagnoses and treatment is free for all Brazilian citizens in the unified public health system (SUS), and thus the records of most of the CL cases in Brazil must have been included in SINAM 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>. Second, the analysis at the municipality level could not have revealed the actual site of disease focus. For more accurate analysis, future studies should examine the spatial distribution of CL at a finer scale (eg. zip code), however this data are poorly available in SINAN.\nThe use of two complementary approaches employed in this study allowed us to describe more precisely the spatial and temporal patterns of CL in Brazil. However, similar to all spatial clustering approaches, the statistical methods used in this study have limitations in accuracy and sensitivity. The scan is one of the most frequently employed methods of spatial and temporal cluster analysis and has the advantage of being adjusted for heterogeneous population and to look for clusters without specifying their specific localities overcoming the preselection bias 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>. However, this method has the disadvantage of not identify accurately the right format of very irregular clusters, and thus often report large clusters that contain several low-risk areas inside it 通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49]</u>. Therefore, we believe that this happened in our primary cluster due to the presence of some municipalities with low incidence rates. According to Han et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>, this issue could be improved by choosing ellipse radius values lower than 50%. However, due to the low population in northern Brazil (approximately 12.13% of Brazilian population) the analysis continued detecting a big and a few informative clusters, even when we reduce the radius length. In this sense, the gets Ord Gi analysis improved our study describing greater spatial and temporal heterogeneity in this area.\nIn this study the spatial-temporal dynamics of CL in Brazil has been analyzed for at the municipality level and with a wider temporal range than previous works. The scan method showed that the main cluster is located in the Brazilian Legal Amazon and that most of the secondary clusters are located in the southern and southeastern regions of Brazil. The emerging hotspot analysis identified a higher spatiotemporal variability of hotspot inside the BLA. Using this method, it was also possible to detect diminishing hotspots in the east and persistent, emergent, and new hotspots, mainly in municipalities of the states of Pará, Rondônia, and Roraima, Acre and south of Mato Grosso. Furthermore, we showed that the central coast of Bahia was one of the most critical regions for CL due to the presence of a cluster with the highest rank in a secondary cluster and an intensifying hotspot. Despite a general decrease trend of CL cases in Brazil found in this study, the identification of areas of persistent, emergent, new, and intensifying hotspots suggest that the control measures in these regions are not effective in controlling the disease. The results reported herein may assist and guide future research about CL eco-epidemiology and the implementation of disease control measures in Brazil.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-021-00872-x.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: S1.

Exclusion criteria included: multiple pregnancies, a history of thyroid disease or any other chronic diseases, taking oral contraceptive regimens or any medical regimen that may affect thyroid function, such as dopamine, or anti-epileptic drugs, as previously described by Li et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nA total of 9964 pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy and 2272 non-pregnant women of childbearing age participated in the study. All participants were asked to complete the questionnaires concerning personal information, such as the personal and family history of thyroid diseases, parity, smoking and drinking, chronic diseases, and multiple-micronutrient supplementation. Their fasting serum and urine samples were collected at the first visit. Serum thyrophin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs), thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs), and serum ferritin (SF) were measured.\nBased on the questionnaires, two non-pregnant women and 60 pregnant women were excluded from the study due to having a history of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. In addition, 29 non-pregnant women and 2435 pregnant women were excluded from the study due to taking supplementation containing iron at screening. Six pregnant women were excluded from the study due to having multiple pregnancies. Fifty-six non-pregnant women were excluded for privacy reasons. Finally, a total of 7463 pregnant women and 2185 non-pregnant women of childbearing age were included in the study 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nSamples of spot urine and fasting blood were obtained from each participant in the morning. All specimens were frozen at –20℃ until shipment and assay in 1 week. Serum TSH, FT4, TPOAbs, TgAbs, and SF were measured by the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay with Cobas Elesys 601 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) of serum TSH, FT4, TPOAbs, TgAbs, and SF were 1.57% to 4.12%, 2.24% to 6.33%, 2.42% to 5.63%, 1.30% to 4.90%, and 1.43% to 4.52%, respectively. The inter-assay CVs were 1.26% to 5.76%, 4.53% to 8.23%, 5.23% to 8.16%, 2.10% to 6.90%, and 3.52% to 7.91%, respectively. Urinary iodine (UI) was determined by the ammonium persulfate method based on the Sandell-Kolthoff reaction. The intra- and inter-assay CVs of UI were 3.00% to 4.00% and 4.00% to 6.00% at 66 g/L, respectively; and 2.00% to 5.00% and 3.00% to 6.00% at 230 g/L, respectively. In the present study, the reference intervals of TSH were 0.14 to 4.87 mU/L and 0.69 to 5.64 mU/L for pregnant and non-pregnant women, respectively as previously described by Li et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> The manufacturer-specified population reference stages were 0 to 34 U/mL for TPOAbs and 0 to 115 U/mL for TgAbs. Women were divided into ID, IO, and control group. ID was defined as SF <15 μg/L, and IO was defined as SF >150 μg/L, and everyone in between served as control group.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Women with ID were further divided into two groups. We defined mild ID as 5 μg/L <SF<15 μg/L, severe ID as SF ≤5 μg/L.\nStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA) and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov method was used to test normality of the data distribution. Kolmogorov-Smirnov method was used to test normality of the data distribution. The data with normal distribution were presented as mean ± standard deviation, and an independent sample t-test was used to assess the difference between two groups. Other continuous data with abnormal distribution were shown as median (Q1, Q3). Categorical data were presented as percentages (cases/absolute numbers). Correlations between continuous variables were quantified using Spearman ρ correlation coefficient. The differences between groups were analyzed by Fisher exact tests for the categorical data and by the Mann-Whitney U test for the continuous data. The impact of independent variables (ID, age, body mass index [BMI], gestational weeks and UI) on the dependent outcome measures (TAI) were explored by fitting multivariable logistic regression models. Given the potential cluster effect of care organizations across regions, we additionally developed multilevel logistic regression models to assess the association between TAI and ID on the basis of the above multiple regression models. In these multilevel logistic regression models, the effects of different hospitals were deemed random. We reported the adjusted odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and the responding P value for all models. All statistical tests were considered to be statistically significant at P < 0.05.\nThe non-pregnant women of childbearing age were of similar age and BMI as the pregnant women in the first trimester. Pregnant women had lower TSH (1.82 [1.12, 2.74] mU/L vs. 2.19 [1.54, 3.06] mU/L, Z= –13.721, P < 0.001) and TPOAb levels (7.28 [5.00, 11.43] U/mL vs. 9.29 [6.18, 14.12] U/mL, Z = –14.648, P < 0.001) and higher SF (63.38 [39.16, 98.82] μg/L vs. 49.00 [26.70, 78.78] μg/L, Z = 14.751, P < 0.001) and FT4 levels (16.34 ± 3.32 pmol/L vs. 15.74 ± 3.26 pmol/L, t = 2.511, P = 0.012), compared to non-pregnant women.

The prevalences of isolated TPOAbs-positive were higher in ID group than control groups in both pregnant (6.28% vs. 3.23%, χ2 = 10.264, P = 0.002) and non-pregnant women (6.25% vs. 3.70%, χ2 = 3.791, P = 0.044) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>. Furthermore, we divided ID group into mild ID group and severe ID group. We found that with the decrease of iron content, the prevalence of isolated TPOAb-positive showed an increase trend in the pregnant women 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. The prevalence of isolated TPOAb-positive was 11.76% and 5.75% in severe and mild ID groups, respectively in the pregnant women. Both of these results were significantly higher than the control group (severe: 11.76% vs. 3.23%, χ2 = 7.793, P = 0.024; mild: 5.75% vs. 3.23%, χ2 = 6.470, P = 0.013). The prevalence of isolated TPOAb-positive was 7.48% in mild ID group and was significantly higher than the control group (7.48% vs. 3.70%, χ2 = 6.954, P = 0.016) in non-pregnant women 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.\nBoth the median level of TgAbs and the prevalence of isolated TgAb-positive were similar between the ID group and the control group, in both pregnant and non-pregnant women 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.

However, we did not observe a dose-dependent relationship between the prevalence of isolated TgAb-positive and ID 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.\nIn the present study, neither the prevalence of TPOAb-positive nor TgAb-positive had statistically difference between the IO group and the control group in pregnant and non-pregnant women.\nAfter adjusting for confounding parameters in multivariable logistic regression, ID remained associated with isolated TPOAb-positive in both pregnant (OR: 1.950, 95% CI: 1.266–3.003, P = 0.002) and non-pregnant women (OR: 1.878, 95% CI: 1.042–3.382, P = 0.036).

Studies in animals and human have shown that ID impairs thyroid metabolism by decreasing the activity of TPO and interfering with the synthesis of thyroid hormones, thereby leading to decreased plasma thyroxine (T4) and T3 concentration, as well as reduced peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,12,13]</u> TAI is a multifactorial disease that has been associated in both spontaneous and assisted pregnancies with impaired outcomes, including miscarriage, preterm delivery, and lower birth weight.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,14]</u> Previous studies showed that low selenium levels might increase the risk of developing TAI.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> However, the association between iron and TAI has not been clarified yet.\nID was previously reported to be associated with a higher prevalence of TPOAb-positive in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18]</u> However, TgAbs were not measured and only pregnant women were analyzed in their studies. In the present study, we measured both TPOAbs and TgAbs in the pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy and non-pregnant women of childbearing age. We found an increased prevalence of isolated TPOAb-positive in both pregnant and non-pregnant women with ID, which was consistent with the studies of Veltri et al通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> and Li et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Moreover, we found that the more severe of ID, the higher of the prevalence of isolated TPOAb-positive in the pregnant women. However, we did not find ID was related to isolated TgAb-positive in both pregnant and non-pregnant women.\nThe mechanism behind ID was associated with isolated TPOAb-positive, but not TgAb-positive remains unclear. Iodine excess has been confirmed to be associated with the TgAb-positive, but not TPOAb-positive.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20,21]</u> Previous animal studies reported that high dosage and prolonged iodine intake might lead to a rise in serum TgAbs and the lymphocytes infiltration.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> The mechanism behind this phenomenon is explained by the fact that iodine plays a major role in the biological process of thyroglobulin (Tg). Tg combined with high iodine can enhance its immunogenicity by generating novel epitopes or unmasking of a ctyptic epitopes on Tg.通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24,25]</u>\nTPO, that has iron at its active center, is required for thyroid hormone synthesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,26]</u> Previous animal studies found that ID could impair the iron-dependent TPO activity, resulting in the decrease of serum thyroxine levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Unfortunately, the level of TPOAbs was not measured. Enlightened by the association between iodine excess and TgAb-positive, we speculated that TPO undergoes post-translational modification as a consequence of ID, with the exposure of previously hidden epitopes or generating novel epitopes, which enhances the immunogenicity of TPO. However, this speculation could not be proven by the current study. Another explanation for the association between ID and TPOAb-positive provided by Veltri et al通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> was that the lower TPO activity caused the increased prevalence of TAI in order to preserve its function.\nPrevious studies indicated IO could modulate and exaggerate the autoimmune process.通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u> IO could induce the production of reactive oxygen species, the development of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, which would lead to demyelination in some autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,30]</u> IO was also reported to be associated with the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes.通用删除6(英):<u>[31,32,33,34,35,36,37]</u> However, the association between IO and TAI has not yet been studied. In the present study, we found that neither isolated TPOAb-positive nor isolated TgAb-positive was associated with IO in both pregnant women and non-pregnant women of childbearing age.\nThere were several advantages in the current study. First, because iodine malnutrition can influence TAI, we performed the study in an iodine-adequate area. Furthermore, we excluded the factors that might interfere with the status of iron, such as anemia and chronic inflammation. In this way, we better focused our analysis on the relationship between iron and TAI. We additionally used multilevel regression model to control for the cluster effect among different hospitals. Second, our study measured two antibodies representing TAI, TPOAbs, and TgAbs. We eliminated the confounding effect of these two antibodies on each other, thus clarifying the relationship between ID and isolated TPOAbs or isolated TgAbs. Third, our study analyzed the relationship between IO and TAI. To our knowledge, this was the large-scale epidemiological study to investigate the relationship between IO and TAI.\nThere were several limitations in the present study. First, this study did not measure soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), so we could not calculate total body iron using SF and sTfR, which could correct the potential dilution effects secondary to the expansion of blood volume. Second, this study was confined to iodine-adequate areas, and might not be generalized for the women in iodine-deficient or iodine-excessive areas. Third, the present study was a cross-sectional investigation, and we could not distinguish the causation between ID and isolated TPOAb-positive. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify this causation.\nIn conclusion, this study showed that ID was associated with a higher prevalence of isolated TPOAb-positive, but not with isolated TgAb-positive, in both pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy and non-pregnant women of childbearing age, while IO was not associated with either TPOAb-positive or TgAs-positive. We speculated that ID may be a pathogenic factor for isolated TPOAb-positive in pregnant women and non-pregnant women of childbearing age.

In this study, we attempted to investigate the effects of LPS on the SP-A expression in human renal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells and its potential mechanisms.\nRenal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells, a proximal tubular cell line derived from normal kidney; CRL-2190) were purchased from ATCC and cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (HyClone Pierce, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen, USA) and 1% ampicillin. The culture medium was refreshed every 2 days until the cell confluence reached 70–80%. Cells were harvested after digestion with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression were detected after LPS exposure for different durations. LPS extracted from serotype Escherichia coli 0111:B4 was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). To prepare LPS suspension, LPS was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Concentration of DMSO was <0.1% to reduce its toxicity to HK-2 cells. CLI-095 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) is a cyclohexene derivative and an inhibitor of TLR4. CLI-095 was dissolved in DMOS at 10 μmol/l. Cells in control group were cultured in the medium only with DMSO at the same concentration.\nCell viability was determined using a colorimetric 3-(4,5 -dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as previously described.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> HK-2 cells were digested with 0.25% trypsin and then suspended in the medium containing 10% FBS at 5–8 × 104 cells/ml. Cells were cultured into 96-well plates (200 μl/well), followed by incubation for 4–5 h. After cells attached, 100 ng/ml of LPS was added to each well (100 μl/well) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 0, 1, 6, and 12 h. Before the detection, 5 mg/ml MTT solution was added to each well (20 μl/well), and then incubated in dark for 4 h. The supernatant was removed, and 150 μl of DMSO was added to each well and incubated for 10 min to resolve the deposit. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm by MTT enzyme-linked immunometric meter (Bio Rad, USA). The cell viability was calculated according to the standard curve.\nCultured HK-2 cells were used for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of SP-A and TLR4 mRNA. Total RNA was extracted from each sample using Trizol (Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) extracted from the tissue was used for the RT reaction (Takara, China), and then 2.5 μl of cDNA was used for amplification at a final volume of 25 µl according to the supplier’s protocol (Fermentas, Germany). Then, the amplified PCR product was used for melting curve analysis, especially SP-A primer: 5’-TGA AAGGGAGTTCTAGCATCTCA CAGA-3’ and 5’-ACATATGCC TATGTA GGCCTGACT GAG-3’, TLR4 primer: 5’- TATCCAGAGCCGTTGGTGTATCT-3’, and 5’-AATGAAGATG ATGCCA GAGCG -3’, and β-actin primer: 5’-GTCTACATGTCTC GATCCCACTTA A -3’ and 5’-GGTCTTTCTCTCTCAT CGCGCTC-3’. The PCR was performed with 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 60°C for 45 s (SP-A) or 55°C for 50 s (TLR4), and 72°C for 2 min. Each PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. DNA bands in the agarose gel were photographed and quantified.\nNuclear components were extracted on ice following the method of Chiu et al. with a little bit improvement.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> HK-2 cells were centrifuged, the deposit was collected and prepared in the 25 μl buffer A (10 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.9; 10 mmol/L KCl; 1. 5 mmol/L MgCl2; 1 mmol/L DTT; 5% glycerin; 0.2 mmol/L EDTA; 1 mmol/L PMSF; 3 mg/L aprotinin; 3 mg/L leupeptin; 2 mg/L pepstainA; 1% NP-40) for 10 min, and then centrifuged on ice (14,000 r/min) for 1 min; the deposit was prepared in 15 μl buffer B on ice (20 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.9; 420 mmol/L NaCl; 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2; 0.2 mmol/L EDTA; 0.5 mmol/L DTT; 25% glycerin; 0.5 mmol/L PMSF; 5 mg/L aprotinin; 5 mg/L leupeptin; 3 mg/L pepstainA) for 30 min, and then centrifuged on ice for 15 min (14,000 r/min). Protein concentrations were quantified with a bicinchonic acid protein assay kit (Logan, Utah, Hyclone Pierce).\nProteins from HK-2 cells were extracted using RIPA lysate (150 mmol/L sodium chloride, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate [SDS], and 50 mM Tris at pH 8.0). The total protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Logan, Utah, Hyclone Pierce). Total protein (50 µg) was resolved by reducing 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred electrophoretically at 60 mA onto nitrocellulose membranes at 4°C overnight (Bio-Rad, USA). After the samples were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, immunoblotting was conducted using a primary antibody against SP-A at a dilution of 1:150 or TLR4 at a dilution of 1:500 (Abcam, Britain, ab22048) or NF-kB (Abcam, Britain, ab32536) at a dilution of 1:5000 or IkB-α (Abcam, Britain, ab133462) or MEK1 (Abcam, Britain, ab32091) at a dilution of 1:1000 and phosphorylated MEK1 (p-MEK1) (Abcam, Britain, ab96379) at a dilution of 1:800 or ERK2 (Abcam, Britain, ab32081) at a dilution of 1:1000 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Abcam, Britain, ab201015) at a dilution of 1:800 or P38MAPK at a dilution of 1:3000 (Abcam, Britain, ab170099) and phosphorylated P38MAPK (Abcam, Britain, ab47363) at a dilution of 1:500, and then secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Cellular β-actin protein was immunodetected using a human monoclonal antibody against human β-actin (St. Louis, MO, USA) as the internal standard. Immunoproducts were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence peroxidase detection reagents (Amersham, Sweden).\nData are expressed as mean ± standard error of mean. Results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA using the SPSS version 15.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA). P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\nTo evaluate the cytotoxic effect of LPS on cells, the cell viability of HK-2 cells was detected after LPS exposure. HK-2 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of LPS for 0, 1, 6, and 12 h, and absorbance was measured at 490 nm. The absorbance did not show significant difference at different durations after LPS treatment 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1, P > 0.05]</u>, suggesting that 100 ng/ml of LPS is not cytotoxic to HK-2 cells.\nProtein and mRNA expression of SP-A in HK-2 cells after LPS treatment were detected by Western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively. Cells were stimulated with LPS for 0, 1, 2, and 6 h, and then SP-A mRNA expression was detected; cells were treated with LPS for 0, 2, 6, and 12 h, and SP-A protein expression was assayed; and β-actin expression was detected as an internal standard. Expression of SP-A mRNA expression at 1, 2, and 6 h after LPS exposure was significantly increased by 1.5, 2.7, and 4.5 folds, respectively, as compared to that at 0 h 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2, P < 0.05]</u>. Moreover, the SP-A protein expression at 6 h after LPS treatment increased dramatically when compared with that at 0 h and 2 h 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3, P < 0.05]</u>. After LPS exposure for 12 h, the SP-A protein expression was markedly higher than that at 6 h. SP-A protein expression after LPS exposure for 6 h and 12 h was increased by 1.6 and 2.8 folds, respectively, as compared to that at 0 h. These findings suggested that LPS may upregulate SP-A expression at transcriptional level.\nTo investigate the mechanism underlying LPS-induced SP-A expression in HK-2 cells, the expression of cytoplasmic and nuclear NF-κB as well as phosphorylated IκB-α was measured in HK-2 cells, and total NF-κB served as an internal standard. After LPS exposure for 0, 1, 2, and 6 h, the cytoplasmic NF-κB expression was decreased 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4, P < 0.05]</u>, however the nuclear NF-κB expression and intracellular phosphorylated IκB-α expression were increased 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5, P < 0.05]</u>. The protein expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) at different time points was quantified, and results showed that the cytoplasmic NF-κB expression at 1, 2, and 6 h after LPS exposure was reduced by 32%, 48%, and 47%, respectively, but expressions of the nuclear NF-κB and phosphorylated IκB-α at 1, 2, and 6 h after LPS exposure were augmented by 117%, 155%, and 203% and by 167%, 320%, and 413%, respectively, as compared to those at 0 h. Moreover, the expression of the nuclear NF-κB and phosphorylated IκB-α was depressed by CLI-095 when compared with by LPS stimulation alone 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4 and Figure 5, P < 0.05]</u>.\nTo elucidate the signaling pathway involved in LPS-induced NF-κB activation in HK-2 cells, the mRNA and protein expression of upstream transmembrane receptor TLR4 and protein expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2, phosphorylated p38MAPK, and p-MEK1 were assayed in HK-2 cells. With β-actin expression served as an internal standard, quantitative analysis showed that the levels of TLR4 mRNA after LPS exposure for 1, 2, and 6 h were increased by 111%, 221%, and 489%, respectively, as compared to that at 0 h 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2, P < 0.05]</u>. Meanwhile, the expression of TLR4 protein after LPS treatment for 1, 2, and 6 h was also increased 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6, P < 0.05]</u>. Expression of TLR4 protein at 2, 6, and 12 h was increased by 74%, 91%, and 154%, respectively, when compared with that at 0 h (P < 0.05). Phosphorylation of p38MAPK 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7, P < 0.05]</u> and MEK1 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 8, P < 0.05]</u> in HK-2 cells at 2, 6, and 12 h was increased by 75%, 130%, 215%, and 74%, 183%, 262%, respectively, as compared to that at 0 h. Levels of phosphorylated ERK1 in HK-2 cells were obviously raised after exposure to LPS for 2, 6, and 12 h by 62%, 162%, and 254%, respectively. Exposure of HK-2 cells to LPS for 2, 6, and 12 h significantly increased ERK2 phosphorylation by 77%, 239%, and 392%, respectively 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 9, P < 0.05]</u>.\nWe further explored the role of TLR4-dependent MEK1/2-ERK1/2-NF-κB signaling pathway in LPS-induced SP-A expression. HK-2 cells were pretreated with CLI-095 before LPS exposure. Induction of TLR4 and SP-A mRNA expression by LPS were analyzed by real-time PCR. After LPS administration, the mRNA expression of TLR4 and SP-A was significantly increased 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 9, P < 0.05]</u>. Pretreatment of HK-2 cells with CLI-095, an inhibitor of TLR4, before LPS administration could markedly inhibit the mRNA and protein expression of TLR4 and SP-A 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 9, P < 0.05]</u>. Expression of TLR4 and SP-A mRNA in HK-2 cells after LPS exposure for 6 h was augmented by 458% and 542%, respectively, when compared with that at 0 h. With CLI-095 pretreatment, mRNA expression of TLR4 and SP-A in HK-2 cells was decreased by 66% and 60%, respectively, when compared with that by LPS administration for 6 h alone 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 10, P < 0.05]</u>.\nThe present study revealed that LPS can cause inflammatory responses in renal tubular epithelial HK-2 cells by means of enhancing SP-A mRNA and protein syntheses. Moreover, the signal-transducing mechanisms of LPS-induced regulation of SP-A expression arise through TLR4-dependent cascade phosphorylations of MEK1, ERK1/2, and p38MAPK, leading to the nuclear translocation and activation of NF-κB. Moreover, pretreatment with TLR4 inhibitor, CLI-095, may significantly decrease mRNA and protein expression of SP-A, depress IκB-α phosphorylation, and suppress NF-κB nuclear translocation. These findings indicate that LPS may induce SP-A synthesis through TLR4-mediated activation of MEK1-ERK1/2-NF-κB signaling pathway.\nLPS is a major pathogenic factor in septic shock and multiple organ dysfuction syndrome (MODS) caused by Gram-negative bacteria.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>In vitro study indicated that the elevated SP-A expression in A549 cells could be induced by LPS in a time-dependent manner.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> Our previous study showed that SP-A protein could be expressed and secreted by renal tubular epithelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> SP-A may play important roles in anti-inflammatory and protective effects in both lung and kidney.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> In the present study, 100 ng/ml of LPS was used to stimulate HK-2 cells (a human renal tubular epithelial cell line), however cytotoxic effects of LPS on HK-2 cells were not observed. In addition, expression of SP-A protein and mRNA in HK-2 cells was found to be increased in a time-dependent manner by LPS administration, moreover elevated mRNA expression of SP-A occurred earlier than the elevated protein expression. This indicated that LPS may influence the SP-A expression at transcriptional level.\nTLR4 is an transmembrane receptor involved in the innate immunity, which can recognize pathogen-associated molecular pattern (including LPS, a component of Gram-negative bacterial cell wall and part of Gram-positive bacteria) to modulate cytokine secretion in the immune response. Thus, the regulation of TLR4 expression may be involved in the innate immunity to pathogens.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Studies have showed that LPS may induce the aggregation of TLR4 on the THP1 cells to promote the transmission of extracellular signals into cells, leading to release of a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> Differential TLR subtypes would be activated by LPS in different types of cells. LPS can significantly stimulate the TLR2 expression on A549 cells to activate downstream signaling pathway.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> In the present study, HK-2 cells were stimulated by 100 ng/ml of LPS, significantly increased expression of TLR4 mRNA and protein in a time-dependent manner was observed, which indicated that TLR4 activation stimulated by LPS may be involved in the process of SP-A induction of HK-2 cells.\nNF-κB is a well-known transcription factor that regulates the expression of many inflammation-related genes in response to various infections.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> When cells are stimulated, the NF-κB inhibitor-alpha (IκB) of NF-kB/IκB complex in the cytoplasm is phosphorylated and dissociated from this complex, and then NF-κB 通用删除11(英):<u>(p50 and p65)</u> translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, leading to NF-κB activation, which is related to MAPK pathway. Bacterial cell wall is able to activate NF-κB in the kidney in vivo, and the inhibition of NF-κB activity may ameliorate sepsis-induced AKI.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> It has been confirmed in the present study that the expression of phosphorylated IkB-α and the nuclear NF-κB protein was significantly increased, but the expression of cytoplasmic NF-κB was decreased dramatically in HK-2 cells by LPS exposure, suggesting the translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and the subsequent activation of NF-κB in HK-2 cells would be regulated by LPS. There is growing evidence showing that LPS-induced NF-κB activation is related to TLR4-mediated MyD88-dependent signaling pathway.\nMAPK family consists of three protein kinases: ERK, p38MAPK, and c-JNK, which are the upstream kinases of NF-κB.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> ERK1/2 activation may further activate NF-κB. The ERK1/2-induced activation of IκB-α kinase through phosphorylating two serine residuals at the N-terminal of IκB-α would lead to the degradation of IκB-α. Then, NF-κB translocates into the nucleus, which contributes to its activation.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> NF-κB activation induced by LPS may be due to the phosphorylation of MAPKs. It has been validated in in vitro studies that the phosphorylation of MAPKs (including ERK1/2 and p38MAPK) in LPS-treated A549 cells was determined.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> In addition, p38MAPK also plays an important role in the NF-κB activation signaling pathway.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> In the present study, LPS time dependently increased the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38MAPK in HK-2 cells. Thus, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, two important members of MAPK family, may participate in NF-κB activation in HK-2 cells stimulated by LPS.\nIncreasing evidences indicate that ERK signaling pathway is related to the regulation of inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> ERK activation is modulated by three different signaling pathways: Raf/MEK-dependent signaling pathway, non-PI3K/Raf-dependent signaling pathway, and unknown signaling pathway that can directly activate ERK protein kinase. MEK1 is an upstream protein kinase of ERK1/2, and the activation of MEK1 is associated with ERK1/2 phosphorylation.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Roles of MEK1 and ERK1/2 in SP-A expression induced by LPS were also determined in the previous study using alveolar epithelial A549 cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> Our results exhibited that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by LPS was due to the MEK1 phosphorylation. Thus, LPS-induced phosphorylation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 may be related to the subsequent NF-κB activation in HK-2 cells. Moreover, suppressing TLR4 expression with CLI-095 simultaneously inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation and subsequent SP-A mRNA expression. Thus, our study indicated that the signal-transducing mechanisms of LPS- caused regulation of SP-A expression arise in renal tubular epithelial HK-2 cells through TLR4 activation and cascade phosphorylations of downstream kinase MEK1 and MAPK (ERK1/2 and p38MAPK). In succession, LPS induced NF-κB expression and translocation.\nHowever, there are certain limitations of the present study. HK-2 cells are not primary culture cells, and results in this study might be a little bit different from those in vivo. Thus, more translational studies are needed to explore the effect of LPS on the secretion of SP-A in human renal tubular epithelial cells in case of AKI.\n删除3：<u>This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81201457, No. 81173402, and No. 81571943)</u> and Advanced Suitable Project of Shanghai Health System 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 删除4：<u>2013</u>SY070)</u>.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:42:10", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:42:26", "cost": 15.862}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:29", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:42:26", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:42:10"}

We designed this study to develop three strains derived from a wild-type Drosophila melanogaster with different sensitivities to volatile anesthetics, which may ultimately facilitate molecular and genetic studies of the mechanism involved.Methods Median effective doses (ED50) of sevoflurane in seven-day-old virgin female and male wild-type Drosophila melanogaster were determined. The sensitive males and females of percentile 6-10 were cultured for breeding sensitive offspring (S1). So did median ones of percentile 48-52 for breeding median offspring (M1), resistant ones of percentile 91-95 for breeding resistant offspring (R1). Process was repeated through 31 generations, in the 37th generation, S37,M37 and R37 were used to determine ED50 for enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, halothane, methoxyflurane,chloroform and trichloroethylene, then ED50 values were correlated with minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) values in human.Results From a wild-type Drosophila melanogaster we were able to breed three strains with high, median and low sevoflurane requirements. The ratio of sevoflurane requirements of three strains were 1.20:1.00:0.53 for females and 1.22:1.00:0.72 for males. Strains sensitive, median and resistant to sevoflurane were also sensitive, median and resistant to other volatile anesthetics. For eight anesthetics, ED50 values in three strains correlated directly with MAC values in human.Conclusions Three Drosophila me/anogaster strains with high, median and low sensitivity to volatile anesthetics, but with same hereditary background were developed. The ED50 are directly correlated with MAC in human for eight volatile anesthetics。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:14:30", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:14:38", "cost": 7.554}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:29", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:14:36", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:14:29"}

This study determined the long-term effect of moderate renal insufficiency on death and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after stent based PCI and examined whether drug-eluting stent implantation could favourably influence clinical outcome.Methods Major adverse cardiac events and causes of mortality were determined for 1012 patients undergoing percutaneous intervention from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2004 at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. Based on estimated creatinine clearance levels, long term outcomes were compared between patients with estimated creatinine clearance ＜60 ml/min (renal insufficiency group; n=410) and those with estimated creatinine clearance ≥60 ml/min (control group; n=602). Subgroup analysis was also made for patients with renal insufficiency between drug eluting stent (n=264) and bare metal stent implantation (n=146) during PCI.Results During follow-up (average 17 months) after successful PCI, all causes of death (7.1% vs 2.3%, P＜0.01)and cardiac death (3.4% vs 1.0%, all P＜0.01) were significantly higher in renal insufficiency group than in control group. For patients with moderate renal insufficiency, drug-eluting stent implantation reduced significantly all causes of death (5.3% vs 10.9%, P＜0.05) and occurrence of major cardiac adverse events (15.1%vs 24.6%, P＜0.05) compared with bare metal stents.Conclusions Moderate renal insufficiency is an important clinical factor influencing the mortality after PCI in patients with coronary artery disease and the use of drug-eluting stents should be the preferred therapy for the improvement of long-term outcomes in such patients。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:19:39", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:19:46", "cost": 6.875}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:29", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:19:45", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:19:38"}

Population-based studies suggest that the incidence of seizures in term neonates is 1-3 per 1000 live births.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Some of the seizures are intractable and will terminally evolve into EOEE. Amplitude-integrated encephalogram (aEEG) is a simplified method newly applied in bedside real-time cerebral function monitoring for neonates. Our study focused on the clinical manifestations and aEEG characteristics of infants with EOEE with onset within the neonatal period, to make a contribution to early diagnosis and prognosis prediction for these patients.\nThe study design was approved by the Peking University First Hospital Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all the infants’ parents.\nThe newborns with seizure admitted to the neonatal ward of the Peking University First Hospital from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2015, were retrospectively enrolled in this study and assigned into two groups: research group and control group.\nResearch group (neonatal seizures evolved into EOEEs, EOEE group). The inclusion criteria were as follows: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the patients with refractory seizures of neonatal onset were treated with at least two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to control the seizure;通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> severely abnormal background and at least one electrographic seizure detected by multichannel video-EEG (vEEG); 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the patients were followed till at least 1 year old and survived with developmental delay.\nControl group (neonatal seizures did not evolve into EOEEs, non-EOEE [nEOEE] group). Other newborns with seizure were also followed till at least 1 year old. All the patients in this group were not diagnosed with EOEE since they were easily controlled with single AED or the follow-up outcome was normal.\nThe causes of seizures in preterm infants are complicated, so only full-term infants were enrolled in our study.\nClinical and EEG data of the patients were collected, including gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), onset, type, and frequency of seizure, whether the neonates with status convulsion (SC), administration of AEDs, etiology, and results of aEEG and vEEG. Trained nurses in the neonatal ward were responsible for aEEG recording within 24 h of the newborns’ admission and observing clinical seizures. vEEG was obtained within 3 days of admission in the EEG department and interpreted by a pediatric electroencephalographers.\nPatients enrolled in this study were followed up to at least 1 year old.\nIn our study, seizure monitoring with single-channel aEEG was initiated within 24 h of admission. A total of three Ag-AgCl-disk electrodes were attached to the scalp for monitoring according to the International 10-20 System, including two detecting electrodes fixed in P3 and P4 and a ground electrode placed in Fz. Every aEEG examination continued for at least 2 h and included a complete sleep-wake cycling (SWC). If the SWC was not clearly distinguishable, the recording time would continue for at least 1 h. The aEEG tracings and the lower and upper margins of AS and QS period were calculated according to the algorithm previously described by Zhang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>\nThe background of aEEG was classified into five types according to the method previously described by Hellström-Westas et al.:通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> continuous normal voltage (CNV): continuous tracing with a voltage of upper margin between 10 and 50 μV and a voltage of lower margin between 5 and 10 μV; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> discontinuous normal voltage (DNV): discontinuous tracing with voltage predominantly >5 μV; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> burst suppression (BS): the background pattern with periods of very low voltage (lower margin was between 0 and 2 μV) without variability (<5 μV) intermixed with bursts of higher amplitude (>25 μV); 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> continuous low voltage (CLV): continuous background and maximum voltage around or below 5 μV; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> flat trace (FT): with inactive background and very low voltage below 5 μV. Infants who exhibit CNV or DNV recordings are likely to survive without sequelae, while infants who have BS, CLV, or FT tracings have a high risk for death or handicap.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>\nThe SWC pattern is recognized as periodic changes in the bandwidth of the aEEG tracing, with narrower and lower periods for AS and broader and higher periods for QS. Moreover, the SWC was divided into three patterns: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> mature SWC: clearly identifiable variations by >2 μV and with a cyclic duration of ≥20 min; （2) immature SWC: imminent cyclicity displayed less clear variations between sleep stages as compared with the fully developed mature tracing; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> none SWC: absence of cyclicity.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,7]</u>\nThe voltage of aEEG amplitude is usually measured semisubjectively with the naked eye from the voltage scale on the screen of the aEEG monitoring equipment which was available in the market. In our study, instead of interpretation by visual inspection, the aEEG margin was properly defined and automatically calculated according to the algorithm previously described by Zhang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> to analyze the brain function quantitatively and accurately. Two 10-min segments were selected from each aEEG tracing, one from the middle section of AS and the other from the middle of QS. Then, the upper and lower margins of the two segments were calculated and recorded. If the SWC of the patient was difficult to distinguish, a 10-min segment from interictal pattern was chosen and calculated.\nThe seizure activity was verified by both aEEG tracing and simultaneously presented raw EEG. Seizures in aEEG were defined as a characteristic pattern with sudden increases of both the lower and upper margins.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Seizures in EEG were defined as a sudden, repetitive, evolving, and stereotyped ictal pattern with a clear beginning, peak and ending, an amplitude of ≥2 μV, and a minimum duration of 10 s.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>\nEach aEEG was interpreted by two neonatologists who had at least 5-year experience to analyze the aEEG data. Every neonatologist was blinded to the patient identity and clinical data for the objectivity of the results.\nStatistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 通用删除1(英):<u>(IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0, New York, USA)</u> to compare the characteristics of clinical manifestations and aEEG between the research group and control group. Statistical significance was assumed for P < 0.05 (two-sided).\nCategorical variables were expressed as n (%) and compared using Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, including onset, type, frequency, and administration of AEDs of seizure, background, SWC, and frequency detection of the aEEG. Continuous data were presented as a mean ± standard deviation (SD) and compared by independent sample’s t-test between two groups, including the voltage of upper and lower margins in the AS and QS.\nCharacteristics of the aEEG index, including background, SWC, and frequency detection of seizures detected by aEEG, were analyzed by logistic multivariate regression analysis to find the independent risk factors for the newborns with seizure to evolving into EOEE.\nIf there is significant difference of the voltage of upper and lower margins in the AS and QS between the research and control groups, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to analyze the sensitivity and specificity among the four parameters and to calculate the best diagnostic cutoff value for predicting whether the neonatal seizure evolve into EOEE.\nA total of 128 full-term neonates with seizures were enrolled in the study, GA from 37 weeks to 41 weeks, BW from 2410 to 4200 g, 66 of them evolved into EOEE and were assigned to the EOEE group. Among these 66 infants, only six of them were diagnosed with EOEE within the neonatal period. Fifty-seven of them manifested neonatal refractory seizures, while the developmental retardation emerged later during follow-up and terminally diagnosed with EOEE after neonatal period. The other two patients with neonatal seizures were initially controlled by phenobarbital satisfactorily, but manifested refractory seizure till 3 months old with severely abnormal vEEG and developmental delay, were finally diagnosed with EOEE.\nThe onset within 7 days after birth between the EOEE and nEOEE groups had no statistically difference (52 cases vs. 44 cases, P < 0.05). As for the seizure frequency, 64 infants (97%) in EOEE group had daily seizure attacks, obviously higher than 34 infants (55%) in the nEOEE group (P < 0.05). High seizure frequency was one of the manifestations in the newborns evolved into EOEEs. Cases of SC were five in the EOEE group and two in the nEOEE group. The incidence of SC was relatively low in our study. In respect to types of seizures, partial seizure was the main type in the two groups. In the early stage, 20 infants in EOEE group manifested as more than two types of epilepsy, while only nine in the nEOEE group (P < 0.05). Thus, more frequent attacks (daily seizure) and manifold seizure types can be seen as the characteristics of EOEE occurred within the neonatal period 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.\nComparison of the characteristics of seizure between the EOEE and nEOEE groups\n删除重复语句：<u>Comparison of the characteristics of seizure between the EOEE and nEOEE groups</u>\nThe primary etiology of the enrolled cases was listed below. As for the infants in the EOEE group, 10 of them had perinatal cerebral injury, including severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), hypoglycemic brain damage with occipital lobe encephalomalacia, bacterial meningitis complicated with hydrocephalus, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) of degree IV, bilirubin encephalopathy, cerebral infarction. Seven of them had congenital encephalodysplasia, including macrogyria, focal cortical dysplasia, and agenesis of corpus callosum. Five of them were diagnosed with congenital metabolic diseases, which were glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome, maple syrup urine disease, methylmalonic aciduria, and mitochondrial disease. There were one case of tuberous sclerosis and another case of incontinentia pigmenti in our study. The etiology of other 42 cases (63.6%) in the EOEE group remained unclear in spite of various laboratory and imaging examinations had been performed. Preliminary studies indicate that agnogenic EOEE might be related to gene mutation,通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> and the results of genetic tests of part of our enrolled cases showed gene mutation in gene STXBP1, SCN1A, and KCNQ2 in our patient, which also have been reported in the previous studies.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u> 33 (53.2%) infants in the nEOEE group had certain etiology, and most of them were mild to moderate HIE, IVH of degree II, benign familial neonatal convulsion, transient hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.\nIn terms of therapeutic effect, only two infants in EOEE group got well controlled by single AED during the neonatal period; however, the number of that was 46 cases (74.2%) in the nEOEE group, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (χ2 = 71.664, P < 0.01). Although treated by multiple AEDs, there were still three infants in the EOEE group died of refractory seizures, the others all suffered from neurodevelopmental delay, and four of them were diagnosed with cerebral palsy. EOEEs include some syndromes such as Ohtahara syndrome (OS), West syndrome (WS), early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME), malignant migrating focal seizures of infancy, and Dravet syndrome.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> In our study, there were 12 cases of WS, 16 of OS, and 1 of EME in the research group.\nVEEG is considered as the \"golden standard\" for the diagnosis of seizures. All the infants in our study were confirmed with seizures by vEEG and the vEEG background patterns were severely abnormal.\nThe number of normal aEEG background pattern CNV and DNV in the research group was 34 and 4, respectively, while 26 of them presented severely abnormal background pattern known as BS in the neonatal period. In the control group, the number of cases of CNV, DNV, and BS was 54, 6, and 2, respectively. As for the SWC, 38 infants in the research group demonstrated absence of cyclicity, while only six cases in the control group were in lack of SWC. The differences of both background pattern and cyclicity were statistically significant between the two groups (P < 0.05). Therefore, severely abnormal aEEG background pattern and absence of SWC can be identified as the characteristics of aEEG of EOEE occurred within the neonatal period 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1 and Table 2]</u>.\nCharacteristics of aEEG compared between EOEE group and nEOEE group\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics of aEEG compared between EOEE group and nEOEE group</u>\nMoreover, the aEEG tracings in the study were calculated according to the algorithm described by Zhang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Four parameters gained from the algorithm including the upper and lower margins of AS and QS were compared between the two groups. All of the four parameters of the research group were significantly higher than those of the control group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>. ROC curves were performed to evaluate the value of these four parameters in diagnosing EOEE 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. According to the ROC curves, the area under the curve of AS upper margin (0.827) was larger than other three parameters, which demonstrated a higher diagnostic specificity and sensitivity for EOEE 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>. Meanwhile, a cutoff value of 23.6 µV (chosen by Youden’s index) of AS upper margin provided a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 71.7%.\nComparison of aEEG voltage (μV) between EOEE group and nEOEE group\n删除重复语句：<u>Comparison of aEEG voltage (μV) between EOEE group and nEOEE group</u>\nForty-one cases in the EOEE group got detected of seizure attacks by aEEG monitoring, the diagnostic sensitivity was 62.1%, while the results in nEOEE group were 21 cases and 33.9%, the difference was statistically significant 通用删除8(英):<u>[P < 0.05, Table 2]</u>. If recording by aEEG with raw trace, a total of 47 infants in the EOEE group were detected of seizures, with diagnostic sensitivity rising to 71.2%, while the corresponding outcome in the nEOEE group raised to 27 cases and 43.5%. Hence, aEEG with raw trace could improve the diagnostic sensitivity for identifying neonatal seizures and those who evolved into EOEE could be detected by aEEG more easily than those who did not.\nMonitoring by aEEG with raw trace, a total of 108 times of seizure attacks were supervised in the 47 infants from EOEE group, 37 of them manifested seizures more than two times during the recording. Despite the occurrence of SC, the duration of single seizure ranged from 10 to 300 s (mean duration 60 s). While only 31 times of attacks in 27 infants from nEOEE group were recorded, two of them presented with more than two times of seizures, the duration of single seizure varied from 10 to 180 s (mean duration 51 s). Cases with seizure episodes more than two times in EOEE group were apparently more than that in nEOEE group (χ2 = 19.8, P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference of single seizure duration between the two groups (t = 0.939, P = 0.349). Two main forms of seizures were showed on the aEEG of refractory seizure in EOEE group which were characterized by sudden increases of both the lower and upper margins and a sudden burst of higher amplitude followed by a very low voltage, known as the burst-suppression pattern 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>.\nAmong the aEEG data and parameters analyzed in our study, the difference of aEEG background pattern, cyclicity, detection of seizures, and whether more than two times of seizure attacks being recorded between the two groups had statistically significance. Severely abnormal aEEG background pattern, absence of cyclicity, detection of seizures, and more than two times of seizure attacks being detected could be considered as the characteristics of aEEG of EOEE originated within the neonatal period. Logistic multivariate regression analysis was performed and the result indicated that severely abnormal background pattern (odds ratio [OR] = 0.081, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.009-0.729, P = 0.025) and more than two times of seizures being detected (OR = 0.158, 95% CI: 0.043-0.576, P = 0.005) were the independent risk factors for the evolvement from neonatal seizure into EOEE.\nEOEEs are characterized by intractable epilepsy and developmental delay during the infantile period. Due to poor prognosis, EOEE is also intractable issues for clinicians. A few of EOEE patients originate with seizures in the neonatal period. However, it is difficult to be diagnosed as EOEE within the neonatal period since the developmental status or delay of newborns is not easy to evaluate. According to the findings of our study, only seven of all the 66 EOEE patients (10.6%) with onset within neonatal period got confirmed diagnosis in the neonatal period. By summarizing and analyzing the characteristics of clinical manifestations and aEEG of EOEE infants, we tried to present a useful approach to the early diagnosis of EOEE for pediatric clinicians, to make a contribution to the early treatment and prognosis prediction.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that the causes, onset, seizure type, EEG background pattern, and AED types were associated with adverse outcomes including evolving to epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and/or neurodevelopmental retardation.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u> Our study finds that neonatal refractory seizures may terminally evolve to EOEE if they need more than two AEDs to control the convulsions and present as more than two seizure types together with high frequency of daily repetitive seizures. However, the onset time of seizure is not related with the adverse outcome of EOEE.\nThe main causes of EOEE infants started with neonatal seizures in our study are severe perinatal cerebral injury, congenital encephalodysplasia, and congenital metabolic diseases. As we know, severe perinatal cerebral injury includes severe HIE, IVH of degree IV, hypoglycemic brain damage with occipital lobe encephalomalacia, and bacterial meningitis complicated with hydrocephalus. Severe HIE, severe intracranial hemorrhage, encephalodysplasia, and congenital metabolic disorders are the main etiology of neonatal seizures with unfavorable prognosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15]</u> 74.2% of the infants’ etiology enrolled in our study still remained unclear. Gene mutation is considered to be responsible for agnogenic EOEEs.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> With the extensive application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and whole exome sequencing, EOEE-related gene panels make for early and efficient diagnosis of EOEE patients and also help detecting more EOEE susceptibility genes.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> STXBP1, ARX, SLC25A22, and KCNQ2 are some of the susceptibility genes for OS, while CDKL5, ALG13, and SCN1A are considered to be responsible for WS. The first infant enrolled in the study was in 2007; at that time, genetic mutation test was not widespreadly used in our clinical practice; thus, most of the agnogenic patients did not undergo gene testing. In recent years, we have tried to carry out more genetic tests with the consent of the patients’ parents and successfully reported the first case of OS with STXBP1 gene mutation in China.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> After detecting genetic mutation, we informed the parents with the etiology and prognosis and provided them with genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis if they would like to conceive again.\naEEG is a method newly applied in bedside cerebral function monitoring for neonates. Compared to the conventional EEG (cEEG), fewer number of electrodes (only 3 electrodes) used and compressed complicated EEG graph make aEEG much more simply to handle and the results become more easily to interpret.

In our study, severely abnormal background pattern and absence of SWC were considered to be the characteristics of aEEG in the infants in EOEE group; thus, the results were consistent with the previous research. Instead of only applying qualitative data, quantitative parameters and analysis were also brought into our research. The upper and lower margins of AS and QS were calculated. Significantly increased voltage was identified as one of the aEEG characteristics in EOEE group. It may associate with frequent high amplitude electric activities during the ictal and interictal period in the research group. Among the four parameters (upper and lower margins of AS, upper and lower margins of QS), upper margin of AS owned the best diagnostic specificity and sensitivity for the prediction of evolving into EOEE. In the normal state, the QS margin was higher than AS margin, while in respect of seizure, the amplitude increased obviously in the AS because of the relatively lower baseline.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that aEEG can be used for neonatal seizure screening. In respect of detecting individual seizures, using aEEG with raw trace, median sensitivity was 76% (range: 71-85%) and specificity 85% (range: 39-96%).

If the aEEG background manifests persistent high voltage of electric activities with the absence of SWC, a vEEG examination should be suggested to avoid missing the diagnosis of neonatal seizures.\nThe clinical characteristics of the neonatal seizure which terminally evolved into EOEE include the administration of more than two AEDs, high seizure frequency (daily attack), and presentation of more than two types of the seizures. Significant high voltage, severely abnormal background, and more than twice seizure attacks detected on aEEG are meaningful indicators for predicting EOEE. Severe perinatal brain damage, congenital encephalodysplasia, and congenital metabolic disorders are common causes of EOEE.

Our study focused on the clinical manifestations and aEEG characteristics of infants with EOEE with onset within the neonatal period, to make a contribution to early diagnosis and prognosis prediction for these patients.\nThe study design was approved by the Peking University First Hospital Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all the infants’ parents.\nThe newborns with seizure admitted to the neonatal ward of the Peking University First Hospital from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2015, were retrospectively enrolled in this study and assigned into two groups: research group and control group.\nResearch group (neonatal seizures evolved into EOEEs, EOEE group).

Other newborns with seizure were also followed till at least 1 year old. All the patients in this group were not diagnosed with EOEE since they were easily controlled with single AED or the follow-up outcome was normal.\nThe causes of seizures in preterm infants are complicated, so only full-term infants were enrolled in our study.\nClinical and EEG data of the patients were collected, including gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), onset, type, and frequency of seizure, whether the neonates with status convulsion (SC), administration of AEDs, etiology, and results of aEEG and vEEG. Trained nurses in the neonatal ward were responsible for aEEG recording within 24 h of the newborns’ admission and observing clinical seizures. vEEG was obtained within 3 days of admission in the EEG department and interpreted by a pediatric electroencephalographers.\nPatients enrolled in this study were followed up to at least 1 year old.\nIn our study, seizure monitoring with single-channel aEEG was initiated within 24 h of admission. A total of three Ag-AgCl-disk electrodes were attached to the scalp for monitoring according to the International 10-20 System, including two detecting electrodes fixed in P3 and P4 and a ground electrode placed in Fz. Every aEEG examination continued for at least 2 h and included a complete sleep-wake cycling (SWC). If the SWC was not clearly distinguishable, the recording time would continue for at least 1 h. The aEEG tracings and the lower and upper margins of AS and QS period were calculated according to the algorithm previously described by Zhang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>\nThe background of aEEG was classified into five types according to the method previously described by Hellström-Westas et al.:通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> continuous normal voltage (CNV): continuous tracing with a voltage of upper margin between 10 and 50 μV and a voltage of lower margin between 5 and 10 μV; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> discontinuous normal voltage (DNV): discontinuous tracing with voltage predominantly >5 μV; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> burst suppression (BS): the background pattern with periods of very low voltage (lower margin was between 0 and 2 μV) without variability (<5 μV) intermixed with bursts of higher amplitude (>25 μV); 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> continuous low voltage (CLV): continuous background and maximum voltage around or below 5 μV; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> flat trace (FT): with inactive background and very low voltage below 5 μV. Infants who exhibit CNV or DNV recordings are likely to survive without sequelae, while infants who have BS, CLV, or FT tracings have a high risk for death or handicap.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>\nThe SWC pattern is recognized as periodic changes in the bandwidth of the aEEG tracing, with narrower and lower periods for AS and broader and higher periods for QS. Moreover, the SWC was divided into three patterns: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> mature SWC: clearly identifiable variations by >2 μV and with a cyclic duration of ≥20 min; （2) immature SWC: imminent cyclicity displayed less clear variations between sleep stages as compared with the fully developed mature tracing; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> none SWC: absence of cyclicity.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,7]</u>\nThe voltage of aEEG amplitude is usually measured semisubjectively with the naked eye from the voltage scale on the screen of the aEEG monitoring equipment which was available in the market. In our study, instead of interpretation by visual inspection, the aEEG margin was properly defined and automatically calculated according to the algorithm previously described by Zhang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> to analyze the brain function quantitatively and accurately. Two 10-min segments were selected from each aEEG tracing, one from the middle section of AS and the other from the middle of QS. Then, the upper and lower margins of the two segments were calculated and recorded. If the SWC of the patient was difficult to distinguish, a 10-min segment from interictal pattern was chosen and calculated.\nThe seizure activity was verified by both aEEG tracing and simultaneously presented raw EEG. Seizures in aEEG were defined as a characteristic pattern with sudden increases of both the lower and upper margins.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Seizures in EEG were defined as a sudden, repetitive, evolving, and stereotyped ictal pattern with a clear beginning, peak and ending, an amplitude of ≥2 μV, and a minimum duration of 10 s.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>\nEach aEEG was interpreted by two neonatologists who had at least 5-year experience to analyze the aEEG data. Every neonatologist was blinded to the patient identity and clinical data for the objectivity of the results.\nStatistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 通用删除1(英):<u>(IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0, New York, USA)</u> to compare the characteristics of clinical manifestations and aEEG between the research group and control group. Statistical significance was assumed for P < 0.05 (two-sided).\nCategorical variables were expressed as n (%) and compared using Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, including onset, type, frequency, and administration of AEDs of seizure, background, SWC, and frequency detection of the aEEG. Continuous data were presented as a mean ± standard deviation (SD) and compared by independent sample’s t-test between two groups, including the voltage of upper and lower margins in the AS and QS.\nCharacteristics of the aEEG index, including background, SWC, and frequency detection of seizures detected by aEEG, were analyzed by logistic multivariate regression analysis to find the independent risk factors for the newborns with seizure to evolving into EOEE.\nIf there is significant difference of the voltage of upper and lower margins in the AS and QS between the research and control groups, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to analyze the sensitivity and specificity among the four parameters and to calculate the best diagnostic cutoff value for predicting whether the neonatal seizure evolve into EOEE.\nA total of 128 full-term neonates with seizures were enrolled in the study, GA from 37 weeks to 41 weeks, BW from 2410 to 4200 g, 66 of them evolved into EOEE and were assigned to the EOEE group. Among these 66 infants, only six of them were diagnosed with EOEE within the neonatal period. Fifty-seven of them manifested neonatal refractory seizures, while the developmental retardation emerged later during follow-up and terminally diagnosed with EOEE after neonatal period. The other two patients with neonatal seizures were initially controlled by phenobarbital satisfactorily, but manifested refractory seizure till 3 months old with severely abnormal vEEG and developmental delay, were finally diagnosed with EOEE.\nThe onset within 7 days after birth between the EOEE and nEOEE groups had no statistically difference (52 cases vs. 44 cases, P < 0.05). As for the seizure frequency, 64 infants (97%) in EOEE group had daily seizure attacks, obviously higher than 34 infants (55%) in the nEOEE group (P < 0.05). High seizure frequency was one of the manifestations in the newborns evolved into EOEEs. Cases of SC were five in the EOEE group and two in the nEOEE group. The incidence of SC was relatively low in our study. In respect to types of seizures, partial seizure was the main type in the two groups. In the early stage, 20 infants in EOEE group manifested as more than two types of epilepsy, while only nine in the nEOEE group (P < 0.05). Thus, more frequent attacks (daily seizure) and manifold seizure types can be seen as the characteristics of EOEE occurred within the neonatal period 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.\nComparison of the characteristics of seizure between the EOEE and nEOEE groups\n删除重复语句：<u>Comparison of the characteristics of seizure between the EOEE and nEOEE groups</u>\nThe primary etiology of the enrolled cases was listed below. As for the infants in the EOEE group, 10 of them had perinatal cerebral injury, including severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), hypoglycemic brain damage with occipital lobe encephalomalacia, bacterial meningitis complicated with hydrocephalus, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) of degree IV, bilirubin encephalopathy, cerebral infarction. Seven of them had congenital encephalodysplasia, including macrogyria, focal cortical dysplasia, and agenesis of corpus callosum. Five of them were diagnosed with congenital metabolic diseases, which were glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome, maple syrup urine disease, methylmalonic aciduria, and mitochondrial disease. There were one case of tuberous sclerosis and another case of incontinentia pigmenti in our study. The etiology of other 42 cases (63.6%) in the EOEE group remained unclear in spite of various laboratory and imaging examinations had been performed. Preliminary studies indicate that agnogenic EOEE might be related to gene mutation,通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> and the results of genetic tests of part of our enrolled cases showed gene mutation in gene STXBP1, SCN1A, and KCNQ2 in our patient, which also have been reported in the previous studies.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u> 33 (53.2%) infants in the nEOEE group had certain etiology, and most of them were mild to moderate HIE, IVH of degree II, benign familial neonatal convulsion, transient hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.\nIn terms of therapeutic effect, only two infants in EOEE group got well controlled by single AED during the neonatal period; however, the number of that was 46 cases (74.2%) in the nEOEE group, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (χ2 = 71.664, P < 0.01). Although treated by multiple AEDs, there were still three infants in the EOEE group died of refractory seizures, the others all suffered from neurodevelopmental delay, and four of them were diagnosed with cerebral palsy. EOEEs include some syndromes such as Ohtahara syndrome (OS), West syndrome (WS), early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME), malignant migrating focal seizures of infancy, and Dravet syndrome.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> In our study, there were 12 cases of WS, 16 of OS, and 1 of EME in the research group.\nVEEG is considered as the \"golden standard\" for the diagnosis of seizures. All the infants in our study were confirmed with seizures by vEEG and the vEEG background patterns were severely abnormal.\nThe number of normal aEEG background pattern CNV and DNV in the research group was 34 and 4, respectively, while 26 of them presented severely abnormal background pattern known as BS in the neonatal period. In the control group, the number of cases of CNV, DNV, and BS was 54, 6, and 2, respectively. As for the SWC, 38 infants in the research group demonstrated absence of cyclicity, while only six cases in the control group were in lack of SWC. The differences of both background pattern and cyclicity were statistically significant between the two groups (P < 0.05). Therefore, severely abnormal aEEG background pattern and absence of SWC can be identified as the characteristics of aEEG of EOEE occurred within the neonatal period 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1 and Table 2]</u>.\nCharacteristics of aEEG compared between EOEE group and nEOEE group\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics of aEEG compared between EOEE group and nEOEE group</u>\nMoreover, the aEEG tracings in the study were calculated according to the algorithm described by Zhang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Four parameters gained from the algorithm including the upper and lower margins of AS and QS were compared between the two groups. All of the four parameters of the research group were significantly higher than those of the control group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>. ROC curves were performed to evaluate the value of these four parameters in diagnosing EOEE 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. According to the ROC curves, the area under the curve of AS upper margin (0.827) was larger than other three parameters, which demonstrated a higher diagnostic specificity and sensitivity for EOEE 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>. Meanwhile, a cutoff value of 23.6 µV (chosen by Youden’s index) of AS upper margin provided a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 71.7%.\nComparison of aEEG voltage (μV) between EOEE group and nEOEE group\n删除重复语句：<u>Comparison of aEEG voltage (μV) between EOEE group and nEOEE group</u>\nForty-one cases in the EOEE group got detected of seizure attacks by aEEG monitoring, the diagnostic sensitivity was 62.1%, while the results in nEOEE group were 21 cases and 33.9%, the difference was statistically significant 通用删除8(英):<u>[P < 0.05, Table 2]</u>. If recording by aEEG with raw trace, a total of 47 infants in the EOEE group were detected of seizures, with diagnostic sensitivity rising to 71.2%, while the corresponding outcome in the nEOEE group raised to 27 cases and 43.5%. Hence, aEEG with raw trace could improve the diagnostic sensitivity for identifying neonatal seizures and those who evolved into EOEE could be detected by aEEG more easily than those who did not.\nMonitoring by aEEG with raw trace, a total of 108 times of seizure attacks were supervised in the 47 infants from EOEE group, 37 of them manifested seizures more than two times during the recording. Despite the occurrence of SC, the duration of single seizure ranged from 10 to 300 s (mean duration 60 s). While only 31 times of attacks in 27 infants from nEOEE group were recorded, two of them presented with more than two times of seizures, the duration of single seizure varied from 10 to 180 s (mean duration 51 s). Cases with seizure episodes more than two times in EOEE group were apparently more than that in nEOEE group (χ2 = 19.8, P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference of single seizure duration between the two groups (t = 0.939, P = 0.349). Two main forms of seizures were showed on the aEEG of refractory seizure in EOEE group which were characterized by sudden increases of both the lower and upper margins and a sudden burst of higher amplitude followed by a very low voltage, known as the burst-suppression pattern 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>.\nAmong the aEEG data and parameters analyzed in our study, the difference of aEEG background pattern, cyclicity, detection of seizures, and whether more than two times of seizure attacks being recorded between the two groups had statistically significance. Severely abnormal aEEG background pattern, absence of cyclicity, detection of seizures, and more than two times of seizure attacks being detected could be considered as the characteristics of aEEG of EOEE originated within the neonatal period. Logistic multivariate regression analysis was performed and the result indicated that severely abnormal background pattern (odds ratio [OR] = 0.081, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.009-0.729, P = 0.025) and more than two times of seizures being detected (OR = 0.158, 95% CI: 0.043-0.576, P = 0.005) were the independent risk factors for the evolvement from neonatal seizure into EOEE.\nEOEEs are characterized by intractable epilepsy and developmental delay during the infantile period. Due to poor prognosis, EOEE is also intractable issues for clinicians. A few of EOEE patients originate with seizures in the neonatal period. However, it is difficult to be diagnosed as EOEE within the neonatal period since the developmental status or delay of newborns is not easy to evaluate. According to the findings of our study, only seven of all the 66 EOEE patients (10.6%) with onset within neonatal period got confirmed diagnosis in the neonatal period. By summarizing and analyzing the characteristics of clinical manifestations and aEEG of EOEE infants, we tried to present a useful approach to the early diagnosis of EOEE for pediatric clinicians, to make a contribution to the early treatment and prognosis prediction.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that the causes, onset, seizure type, EEG background pattern, and AED types were associated with adverse outcomes including evolving to epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and/or neurodevelopmental retardation.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u> Our study finds that neonatal refractory seizures may terminally evolve to EOEE if they need more than two AEDs to control the convulsions and present as more than two seizure types together with high frequency of daily repetitive seizures. However, the onset time of seizure is not related with the adverse outcome of EOEE.\nThe main causes of EOEE infants started with neonatal seizures in our study are severe perinatal cerebral injury, congenital encephalodysplasia, and congenital metabolic diseases. As we know, severe perinatal cerebral injury includes severe HIE, IVH of degree IV, hypoglycemic brain damage with occipital lobe encephalomalacia, and bacterial meningitis complicated with hydrocephalus. Severe HIE, severe intracranial hemorrhage, encephalodysplasia, and congenital metabolic disorders are the main etiology of neonatal seizures with unfavorable prognosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15]</u> 74.2% of the infants’ etiology enrolled in our study still remained unclear. Gene mutation is considered to be responsible for agnogenic EOEEs.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> With the extensive application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and whole exome sequencing, EOEE-related gene panels make for early and efficient diagnosis of EOEE patients and also help detecting more EOEE susceptibility genes.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> STXBP1, ARX, SLC25A22, and KCNQ2 are some of the susceptibility genes for OS, while CDKL5, ALG13, and SCN1A are considered to be responsible for WS. The first infant enrolled in the study was in 2007; at that time, genetic mutation test was not widespreadly used in our clinical practice; thus, most of the agnogenic patients did not undergo gene testing. In recent years, we have tried to carry out more genetic tests with the consent of the patients’ parents and successfully reported the first case of OS with STXBP1 gene mutation in China.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> After detecting genetic mutation, we informed the parents with the etiology and prognosis and provided them with genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis if they would like to conceive again.\naEEG is a method newly applied in bedside cerebral function monitoring for neonates. Compared to the conventional EEG (cEEG), fewer number of electrodes (only 3 electrodes) used and compressed complicated EEG graph make aEEG much more simply to handle and the results become more easily to interpret. It can be operated conveniently in the neonatal ward, and the neonatologists can give prompt interpretations by bedside, so the aEEG is applicable for real-time monitoring and flexible to all kinds of hospitals.

Group I: histological lesions in glomeruli are mild (n=23); Group II: glomerular cells proliferation is prominent (n=91); Group III: glomerular sclerosis is severe (n=19). The Kruskal-Wallis test, Chisquare test and Spearman's correlation were used in our study.RESULTSIn normal controls, renal P-selectin expression was negative (n=10). In glomerulonephritis, the up-regulated P-selectin expression on tubular epithelium was significantly higher than that on glomeruli and interstitium (P&lt;0.01). P-selectin was expressed predominantly on platelets in glomeruli, and glomerular P-selectin expression was more significantly up-regulated in Group II than in Group I or Group III (P&lt;0.05; and P&lt;0.01, respectively).

However, with the rapid advances in anti-viral therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and hepatitis C (CHC), effective and long-term viral suppression has led to fibrosis regression in many patients. Current clinical and histological evidence has revealed that liver fibrosis is reversible after the removal of underlying liver injuries.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> In addition, fibrosis regression has been regarded as one of the critical endpoints to evaluate treatment response in clinical trials, particularly in the realm of new drugs against fibrosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>\nLiver biopsy has been considered as the gold standard for assessing liver fibrosis. Staging and grading systems were proposed based on histological features in treatment-naive patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> The stage of fibrosis was thought to be sufficient to evaluate disease severity; however, the widely adopted definition of fibrosis regression is insufficient to describe the healing features of fibrosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> In addition, non-invasive methods, including liver stiffness and serum biomarkers, which were developed by considering histological staging systems as the reference standard, have been gradually used to assess the reversal of liver fibrosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the evidence of fibrosis regression from liver biopsy and non-invasive methods, and to discuss several clinically relevant challenges.\nLiver biopsy has been regarded as the gold standard for the assessment of fibrosis regression.

After examining a series of cirrhotic explants, the regression parameters were proposed and well elucidated by Wanless et al in 2000.通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> Collectively, the signs were referred to as the \"hepatic repair complex\" (HRC), including eight parameters in terms of septa/fibers, vascular changes, and hepatocyte regenerations.通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> The HRC has been gradually accepted by pathologists and hepatologists, particularly in the era of anti-viral therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\nRecently, in an attempt to evaluate fibrosis regression in a cohort of patients with CHB after anti-HBV therapy, we proposed a new classification, namely the \"Beijing Classification.\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> This new classification not only simplified the traditional semi-quantitative staging and grading systems, but also comprised a novel and independent P-I-R score (predominantly regressive, indeterminate, and predominantly progressive). The P-I-R score was proposed according to the balance of progressing versus regressing septa. The regressing septa were one of the regressive parameters of HRC and were defined as thin/delicate stroma with few inflammatory cells. Therefore, if most (more than 50%) of the septa show the features of HRC, the fibrosis is considered \"predominantly regressive.\"\nIn the original study on P-I-R score, 71 paired liver biopsy tissues were performed before and after anti-HBV therapy. Among the patients with stable Ishak score, 25 (72%) could be further defined as \"predominantly regressive,\" based on the P-I-R score.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> The novelty of the P-I-R score is that it extends the conventional criteria of fibrosis regression, that is, decreasing of Ishak score, and dynamically reflects the fibrosis changes in one cross-sectional specimen.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Therefore, the P-I-R score extends beyond the traditional staging systems and provides additional histological evidence that fibrosis could be reversed.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Recently, results from a study involving a Korean CHB-related cohort with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have revealed that the P-I-R score has been approved to predict the recurrence of HCC, indicating its predictive value for long-term clinical outcomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>\nWith the application of morphometry in pathology, subtle changes of collagen and improvements in fibrosis could be quantitatively and sensitively detected.通用删除6(英):<u>[41,42]</u> The collagen proportionate area (CPA), measured using a partly automated technique, decreased in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis after sustained viral response (SVR).通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> In addition, qFibrosis, a quantitative assessment of liver fibrosis by using second harmonic generation/two photon excitation fluorescence (SHG/TPEF) revealed decreased HBV-related fibrosis in patients after viral suppression.通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u> It has been demonstrated that the width of the fibrous septum detected by SHG/TPEF was the most predictive feature indicative of regression.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Therefore, computer-aided morphometric measurement confirmed the decrease in collagen with the improvement of fibrosis.\nAlthough liver biopsy has been considered the gold standard for the evaluation of fibrosis regression, it remains an expensive and invasive method that is associated with sampling error and risk of rare but potential complications.通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> These limitations have led to the development of non-invasive methods, including liver stiffness measurements and serum biomarkers. These methods have been widely used to determine or to exclude significant fibrosis and cirrhosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> However, in the assessment of fibrosis improvement, the decrease in liver stiffness and serum biomarker levels may result from not only the regression of fibrosis but also the remission of liver edema and inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Detailed information regarding studies in which liver stiffness and serum markers were used to evaluate fibrosis regression is provided in Table 2 and Table 3.\nStudies of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis regression by liver stiffness.\n删除重复语句：<u>Studies of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis regression by liver stiffness.</u>\nHBV: Hepatitis B virus; HCV: Hepatitis C virus; NASH: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; ETV: Entecavir; PegIFN-α: Pegylated interferon-α; RBV: Ribavirin; LDT: Telbivudine; ADV: Adefovir dipivoxil; NA: Not applicable; LBx: Liver biopsy.\nStudies of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis regression by serum markers.\n删除重复语句：<u>Studies of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis regression by serum markers.</u>\nHBV: Hepatitis B virus; HCV: Hepatitis C virus; TDF: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; ETV: Entecavir; IFN: Interferon; LBx: Liver biopsy; NA: Not applicable; APRI: Aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index; FIB-4: Fibrosis index based on four factors; WFA+-M2BP: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein; CHI3L1: Chitinase 3-like 1; RBV: Ribavirin.\nLiver stiffness measured by transient elastography (TE) is a feasible and repeatable method to monitor the improvements in fibrosis in patients on anti-viral therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> Longitudinal studies have demonstrated significant improvements in liver stiffness of patients with CHB and CHC after anti-viral therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[46,47,48,49,50,51,52]</u> Interestingly, liver stiffness reduced rapidly in parallel with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels after treatment for 6 months; thereafter, it decreased slowly but continually after remission of necroinflammation, with normalization of ALT levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[53,19]</u>\nBased on this dynamic pattern of liver stiffness, Kong et al通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> proposed a two-phase reduction in liver stiffness by the piecewise linear mixed-effects model: the fast-declining phase (from baseline to 6 months) and the slow-declining phase (after 6 months). They found that the rate of reduction in liver stiffness during the first 6 months (the fast-declining phase) was significantly higher in patients with histological fibrosis regression.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> Therefore, the early steep reduction in liver stiffness may predict the histological reversibility of liver fibrosis in patients with CHB who are undergoing treatment.\nHowever, there are studies showing that the decrease of absolute liver stiffness after treatment could be related to the remission of liver inflammation rather than fibrosis regression.通用删除6(英):<u>[54,55]</u> Wong et al通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> recruited 71 patients with CHB and paired liver biopsy samples before and after 48 weeks of anti-viral therapy. They found that the proportion of patients who showed a >30% reduction in liver stiffness was not consistent with the proportion of patients who showed decreased histological fibrosis stages. A similar conclusion was reached in another study that enrolled patients with CHB whose paired liver biopsy samples before and after 78 weeks of anti-viral therapy were available.通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u> Therefore, the reduction in liver stiffness should be interpreted with caution owing to the impact of normalization of ALT levels by anti-viral therapy.\nIn addition to TE, liver stiffness measured by acoustic radiation force impulse imaging gradually decreased during anti-HBV therapy. It decreased more significantly in regressive patients than in those with stable histological fibrosis stages.通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u> Whether the decrease in liver stiffness, as observed using magnetic resonance elastography and other imaging-based methods, is correlated with histological improvement in fibrosis is yet to be determined.通用删除6(英):<u>[57,58]</u>\nAspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis index based on four factors (FIB-4) are the two commonly used serum biomarkers for CHC.通用删除6(英):<u>[59,60]</u> These markers could successfully identify significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients infected with HCV. However, APRI and FIB-4 are unsuitable for monitoring fibrosis improvement in patients with CHB who are on anti-viral therapy. Kim et al通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u> analyzed APRI and FIB-4 in 575 patients with CHB who received paired liver biopsy samples before and after 240 weeks of therapy. They found that reduction in APRI and FIB-4 was not associated with the histological regression of fibrosis, and presumed that this reduction, which was accompanied by a reduction in aminotransferase, was a result of inflammation remission rather than fibrosis regression.\nIn addition to platelet-based algorithms, platelet count alone was used to monitor improvements in fibrosis. Studies have revealed that the increase in platelet count after viral suppression in patients with HCV or HBV infection was associated with decrease of fibrosis stage or the reduction of CPA.通用删除6(英):<u>[62,63]</u>\nAs a novel fibrosis glycobiomarker, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) could not only identify early stages of liver fibrosis but also monitor the changes of fibrosis in patients with CHB. It has been demonstrated that the decrease of WFA+-M2BP at 96 weeks was consistent with that of liver stiffness.通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u> Besides, the percent change of WFA+-M2BP from week 26 to week 52 could predict the histological regression of fibrosis at week 78 in patients with CHB who were undergoing treatment with interferon+α add-on therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> Similar to M2BP, other serum markers such as chitinase 3-like 1 were sensitive but not specific to accurately evaluate fibrosis reversal.通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u>\nAdvanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are characterized by the loss of normal lobular metabolic zonation, with numerous shunting neovessels along the fibrous septa.通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u> D’Ambrosio et al assessed the changes of metabolic zonation in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis after achieving SVR.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> They found that the metabolic zonation was lost before treatment and was restored in most patients after SVR. In this study, the severity of abnormal metabolic zonation was scored semi-quantitatively as 0 to 2 according to the expression of glutamine synthetase (GS) and CYP2E1. As GS is expressed in the hepatocytes surrounding hepatic veins in the normal liver, in one study, GS positivity adjacent to portal tracts has been used to quantitatively evaluate the metabolic zonation.通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u> However, data from paired liver biopsy samples before and after treatment are still limited.\nThe restoration of altered blood flow is also a clinical issue. It has been shown that the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased in 18 out of 19 patients with CHB-related cirrhosis with significant portal hypertension after 12 months of lamivudine therapy,通用删除6(英):<u>[70]</u> suggesting that vascular remodeling may be reversible after viral suppression.\nViral suppression in HCV and HBV infection was associated with the reversal of fibrosis and cirrhosis. It has been proved that viral suppression was also associated with better clinical outcomes, including reducing the incidence of HCC, preventing decompensations, and improving survival.通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u> However, the long-term prognosis results of fibrosis regression are still unclear. In addition, whether the better clinical outcome is the result of effective causal treatment or fibrosis regression needs to be confirmed. Wu et al通用删除6(英):<u>[72]</u> studied patients with HBV-related compensated cirrhosis and found that dynamic changes of liver stiffness in the first 26 weeks could predict decompensations and HCC during anti-viral therapy. This might suggest that fibrosis regression could translate into clinical benefits. Moreover, a retrospective study on HCV has revealed that cirrhosis regression was related to decreased morbidity and improved survival.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> However, there is still a lack of direct and solid evidence to demonstrate that biopsyproven fibrosis regression could contribute to improved clinical outcomes.\nThe clinical outcomes of some patients with decompensated cirrhosis could be improved after the suppression of etiological factors and by targeting the key factors of pathogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[73]</u> Those patients may become \"recompensated,\" which means that decompensated complications may not occur in these patients a long period, particularly in patients with alcoholic and viral-related decompensations.通用删除6(英):<u>[73]</u> However, the definition and stability of \"re-compensation\" are still unclear.\nIn conclusion, compelling clinical and histological evidence states that liver fibrosis and even cirrhosis could be reversed after eradication of liver injuries. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard and the most robust evidence to assess fibrosis regression. With regard to non-invasive assessment, ALT normalization, and liver inflammation remission confound the results. Further clinical research is warranted to elucidate the long-term benefits of fibrosis regression.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:16:38", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:17:49", "cost": 70.778}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:29", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:17:48", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:16:37"}

Before admission, he had had intermittent fever for the past 3 months with a body temperature high of 38.5°C. He had no accompanying discomfort and his temperature sometimes dropped to normal without drugs. One month before admission, he found several palpable enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Upon admission, a lymph node biopsy was conducted and the pathological diagnosis showed a nodular sclerosis, a subtype of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed (i) enlarged lymph nodes that were widely distributed within the body with high fructose diphosphate (FDG) uptake, (ii) high FDG uptake in the L2 vertebra, right sacrum, sciatica, and femoral neck with local partial bone destruction, and (iii) low-density foci in the right lobe of the liver with increased glucose metabolism. Unilateral bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed no signs of lymphoma infiltration. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed as having classical Hodgkin lymphoma nodular sclerosis subtype, stage IV, group B. He was treated with the doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy regimen. PET/CT showed complete remission after two cycles of ABVD therapy. Therefore, the primary chemotherapy regimen was continued. However, the patient started to develop hyperthermia with abdominal pain and diarrhea 1 week after day 1 of the third cycle of ABVD therapy. The patient’s white blood cell count was 1.31 × 109/L (reference range: 3.5-9.5 × 109/L), hemoglobin count was 66 g/L (reference range: 130-175 g/L), platelet count was 17 × 109/L (reference range: 125-350 × 109/L), and neutrophil granulocyte count was 0.72 × 109/L (reference range: 1.8-6.3 × 109/L). Further, the patient’s C-reactive protein was 105 mg/L (reference range: <8 mg/L) and procalcitonin was 1.04 ng/mL (reference range: <0.5 ng/mL). A routine stool test showed 15 to 20 white blood cells per high power field, and an occult blood test showed positive. He was then diagnosed with a gastrointestinal tract infection; he was prescribed meropenem and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and was given a platelet infusion. Diarrhea symptoms were gradually alleviated and his body temperature dropped to normal. However, he began to develop a mild to moderate fever and dyspnea 2 weeks later. Arterial blood gas analysis indicated a pH of 7.461 (reference range: 7.35-7.45), a partial pressure of oxygen of 36.6 mmHg (reference range: 80-100 mmHg), a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 41.3 mmHg (reference range: 35-45 mmHg), a bicarbonate level of 28.2 mmol/L (reference range: 22-27 mmol/L), and an oxygen saturation of 62.2% (reference range: 92.0%-98.5%). Thoracic CT revealed a diffuse ground-glass density grid 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. A presumptive diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) was considered because alveolar lavage was not available because the patient refused to undergo a bronchoscopy. Given that his estimated glomerular filtration rate was normal (70.97 mL·min-1·1.73 m-2), 1920 mg oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMPSMX) was prescribed four times a day. Because his brain natriuretic peptide had increased, oral torsemide 10 mg/day was given. Two days later, his pulse oxygen saturation increased to 95% in room air and his body temperature remained normal. However, on day 5, the patient’s estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased to 49.67 mL·min-1·1.73 m-2. He suddenly became delirious and spoke nonsense words and displayed dancing arms. Neurological examination showed no abnormalities. The blood glucose concentration was 1.7 mmol/L (reference range: 3.9-6.0 mmol/L). After receiving an immediate intravenous bolus of 40 mL 50% dextrose and continuous intravenous infusion of 5% glucose in normal saline, the patient recovered mentally. He reported no history of diabetes and did not receive any insulin or anti-diabetic drugs. All orals drugs except TMP-SMX were discontinued to avoid triggering another episode of hypoglycemia. Unexpectedly, the patient, despite continuous infusion of 10% dextrose, suffered a recurrent hypoglycemic attack characterized with deliration. As a result, an intravenous bolus of 50% dextrose was administered repeatedly every hour to maintain the appropriate plasma glucose level. Laboratory data during the hypoglycemia attack were as follows: plasma insulin was 115.3 μU/mL (reference range: 2.6-24.9 μU/mL), C-peptide was 19.55 ng/mL (reference range: 1.1-4.4 ng/mL), and morning cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels and thyroid function were normal. These results indicated that an excessive secretion of endogenous insulin caused the recurrent hypoglycemia. Therefore, TMP-SMX was suspected of causing the hypoglycemia. Over the following 2 days, TMP-SMX and torsemide were temporarily discontinued. Consequently, plasma insulin and C-peptide levels decreased to within the normal range. TMP-SMX therapy was restarted because of the lack of alternative drugs available to treat severe PCP in the mainland of China. To avoid the occurrence of hypoglycemia, the dosage of TMP-SMX was decreased to 1920 mg/d and blood glucose was closely monitored 5 times/d. Thereafter, hypoglycemia did not reoccur during clinical treatment. One month later, the chest CT showed that most of the pulmonary lesions had been absorbed 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>.\nPCP is a life-threatening infection that commonly occurs in immunocompromised individuals.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> In the updated guidelines, TMP-SMX is recommended as first-line therapy for mild, moderate, and severe disease in all patients with PCP (grade B recommendation), and the treatment duration is 21 days (grade C recommendation).通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> If first-line treatment is not available, then atovaquone, pentamidine, or clindamycin plus primaquine could be considered as alternative therapy. However, evidence concerning the effectiveness of the latter medications is inadequate.\nTMP-SMX is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic. The common adverse reactions to TMP-SMX, such as rash, allergic reaction, gastrointestinal tract discomfort, nephrotoxicity, and pancytopenia, are well known and should be closely monitored. However, in rare cases, TMP-SMX can also cause severe hypoglycemia that is often overlooked, and this can lead to fatal consequences. The mechanism of TMP-SMX-induced hypoglycemia is associated with the sulfa-methoxazole component because TMP-SMX shares a similar molecular structure with sulfonylureas, an anti-diabetic medication that binds to receptors on pancreatic beta cells and stimulates insulin oversecretion, resulting in decreased blood glucose levels, which can lead to severe hypoglycemia.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u> Because TMP-SMX is mostly excreted by the kidneys, the drug can accumulate in patients with renal impairment. The half-life of plasma TMP-SMX is 2 to 5 times longer in renal impaired patients compared to those who have normal renal function.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Therefore, regularly monitoring blood glucose in patients with renal dysfunction might also be adopted in the clinical treatment setting. Clinically, there is no agreement on the continuous use of TMP-SMX after hypoglycemia. Drug discontinuance would be safe and eliminate the risk of recurrent hypoglycemia. However, in some regions, other alternative effective drugs for severe PCP, such as pentamidine and primaquine, are unavailable, making TMP-SMX the only choice. It can be concluded that if closely monitored, dose-adjusted TMP-SMX therapy after hypoglycemia could still be considered if no alternative is available.\nIn summary, we reported a case of TMP-SMX-induced hypoglycemia in a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma and PCP. Although hypoglycemia rarely occurs, it can be life-threatening if ignored. Clinicians should be aware of this rare adverse event associated with TMP-SMX therapy, especially in patients with renal dysfunction.\nThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

This study considered 14 males and 4 females, with a mean age of 50.9 years (range: 45–68 years), who had all undergone deceased donor liver transplantation from 2008 to 2014. This group of patients presented with BCS, had also undergone OLT at least 3 months later, and not beyond 12 months after diagnosis of BCS.\nOf the 18 patients, 12 cases of cirrhosis, 4 cases of hepatitis B-induced cirrhosis, and 2 cases of primary liver cancer were identified during the decompensated period. Patients with T-tube fistula were diagnosed by the insertion of a choledochoscope directly into the common bile duct, and patients without evidence of a T-tube fistula were evaluated preferentially by ERCP. In addition, biliary casts were taken out using a basket and a balloon catheter in 6 cases by choledochoscope, and 12 cases by duodenoscope.\nHARI is measured by ultrasonography Doppler, including 18 cases of BCS after OLT, and 36 cases of non-BCS. In the corresponding period, postoperative HARI was detected on weeks 1, 2, and 3 by color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) using the Aloka Prosound F75 (Hitachi Ltd.

HARI 1, HARI 2, HARI 3 was represented as HARI of the first week, the second week and the third week after operation, respectively. SD: Standard deviation; HARI: Hepatic artery resistance index; BCS: Biliary cast syndrome.\nResults of logistic regression analysis of HARI, and OR of HARI 1, HARI 2, HARI 3 at the postoperative stage were >1 (OR = 1.300; 1.223; 1.889, respectively), which suggested that HARI might be an independent risk factor.

According to the statistical analyses, we confirmed that when HARI = 0.64, this represents a critical value, at which point biliary cast complications occurred, and the value was within the normal range too (0.55–0.80). When HARI >0.64, it is marked as 1, as compared with HARI ≤0.64 when it is marked as 0. This meant that when HARI scores were smaller, the comparative risks were greater.

The vascular epithelial cells were identified by pathological examination in biliary casts 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>. Morphology of biliary casts and bile duct stones was determined by scanning electron microscopy. Biliary casts in the shape of filamentous structures were observed, and the structures were relatively loose. Bile duct stones in the shape of a spherical structure with additional dense structures were also seen 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>.\nLiver transplantation is one of the most important surgical interventions in the treatment of end-stage liver disease. Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of bile duct complications following OLT gradually becomes an important and hotly debated topic. Due to the influence of the complex diversity of liver transplant procedures by many factors, and the unique arterial blood supply of the anatomy of the biliary system, the capacity for tissue regeneration is low, and the risk factors accounting for postoperative bile duct complications and its mechanism remains poorly understood. It thus becomes a highly restrictive factor when attempting to improve the success rate of liver transplantation. Moreover, there is an urgent need for newer technology to better manage the key problems that are associated with liver transplantation, which represent a specific need for further development.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nBiliary casts are composed of necrotic material of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct after OLT, which forms a biliary tree. Simultaneously, biliary casts might be accompanied by multiple biliary strictures, which are predominantly caused by ITBL.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Hepatic arterial anastomotic stricture, hepatic artery thrombosis, or abnormal hepatic artery blood supply deficiency, can all cause ITBL, eventually leading to biliary stricture or bile leakage. Biliary reconstruction that is elected following damage to the bile duct peripheral vascular network can also cause ITBL, bile duct stricture after OLT including anastomotic stenosis, and nonanastomotic strictures (NAS). Accurately, NAS is an ischemic necrosis of the diffuse biliary tree following hepatic arterial thrombosis. In addition, some bile duct strictures might occur in cases where the hepatic artery is unobstructed. Thus, due to this kind of bile duct stricture, the imaging findings are similar to NAS, and consequently, this stricture type is also referred to as ITBL.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> At present, the pathological mechanism of ITBL remains unclear. However, it is quite well-known that outcomes in ITBL are influenced by the combined action of many kinds of risk factors, which include the following major associating factors including ischemia injury, induced immune damage and bile salt-induced cytotoxic damage.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> According to our clinical observations, biliary casts generally form at least 1 month after transplantation. The choices of treatment methods of biliary casts are quite varied and includes choledochoscope, ERCP and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography drainage.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16]</u>\nCold ischemic insult induces direct injury to the bile duct cells and damages the arterioles of the peribiliary vascular plexus, which consequently leads to apoptosis and necrosis of bile duct cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> A retrospective review of 355 OLT cases identified that 2.5% of the cases were diagnosed by cholangiography and that the warm ischemic time was significantly longer in BCS patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Damage to the peribiliary vascular plexus of the bile duct can also result in ITBL under conditions of biliary reconstruction. Blood supply to the biliary tract is predominantly from the arterial system rather than the portal vein system. In addition, hepatic arterial reconstruction is restricted to the biliary tract side in OLT recipients. Thus, the condition of reconstruction of the blood supply from the hepatic artery is an important factor to consider in the case of bile duct complications occurring.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>\nDetermination of HARI can be achieved by CDFI, and because of changes in the resistance of the hepatic arterial vascular bed, CDFI is an effective means to determine whether the hepatic artery will stricture. HARI reflects hepatic arterial systolic and diastolic blood flow velocity changes and is not affected by vascular morphology and sampling point. It is thus important to determine the parameters of hepatic arterial blood flow, where the normal value ranges from 0.55 to 0.80. A depressed HARI value indicates that the arterial wall elasticity has declined, and informs proximal blood flow obstruction.\nAt postoperative weeks 2 and 3, this study found that there were significant differences in the HARI score between patients with BCS and patients without BCS. Logistical regression analysis showed that the OR of HARI was >1, which suggested that HARI represented a possible independent risk factor for biliary complications after OLT. According to the results of statistical analysis, we confirmed that an HARI score of 0.64 was the critical value when biliary complications occurred, and the value was within the normal range (0.55–0.80), which suggested that biliary complications were highly sensitive to hepatic arterial ischemia. There have been no characterizations of obstructed hepatic arterial blood supply of the lower is likely to lead to biliary complications.\nIn liver transplantation, we should closely monitor dynamic changes in the hepatic arterial blood flow, and pay close attention to the HARI value. Maintaining an unobstructed hepatic artery depends on the improvement of anastomosis technology, organ preservation technology and microthrombosis anti-coagulation therapy. It is possible that HARI is an independent risk factor and an early predictive factor for BCS. However, the specific mechanisms underlying bile duct injury require further investigation.\nFormation of biliary casts and bile duct stones are similar but not completely the same in terms of their development. Their composition, morphology and microstructure exhibit certain unique differences. Biliary casts and bile duct stones have a similar microstructure, but their forming mechanism is quite different. With morphology, biliary casts appear as columnar and dendritic shapes within the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary duct but differ from bile duct stones, and the material quality of biliary casts is often palpably softer. Scanning electron microscopy showed that biliary casts appear in a variety of forms, and biliary casts often appear in the shape of relatively loose filamentous structures, including irregular sheets composed of imbricated accumulations, a porous honeycombs structure and adherent crystalline substances,通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> while bile duct stones take on the appearance of dense spherical structures.\nCholedochoscopy procedure showed a large number of flocs in the bile duct system of BCS patients. The pathological changes in biliary casts include the appearance of bilirubin crystals that surround the sample structure, with cellulose, and hyperplastic fibrous tissue, presence of micrangium, and presence of bile duct epithelial cells, and infiltrating inflammatory cells in biliary cast surfaces. The presence of micro blood vessels and collagen fibers in the biliary casts was related to injury of the bile duct mucosa. The composition of bilirubin and calcium in bile duct stones was evident, and yet fibrous tissue, blood vessels, and bile duct epithelial cells were not found.\nWe believe that biliary casts represent pathological changes that are caused by multi-factorial events after bile duct injury. BCS was correlated with ITBL following OLT. The occurrence of BCS was associated with bile duct tissue damage, but BCS in itself is not caused by a single pathological factor, and might instead be associated with functional recovery, biliary strictures and obstruction, acute and chronic rejection, recurrent cholangitis, cold and warm ischemia episodes, hepatic ischemia, and reperfusion injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,21,22,23]</u> BCS is one of the clinical manifestations of bile duct complications that can provoke ITBL following OLT.\nDuring the formation of bile stones, and related to the biliary core factor mucoprotein,通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> both mucoprotein secretion and expression of bile and bile duct tissues, showed a pathological and increasing trend in cholelith disease patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> In the process of liver transplantation, the presence of many strongly induced protein expression species and active substances in the human body are present, and their presence is mostly as a consequence of ischemic factors.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u> Biliary stricture can cause rheological changes to the bile, cholestasis, further formation of bile duct deposition, biliary sludge, and crystallization of bile stones.\nIt is formally possible that HARI might represent independent risk factors and might be an early predictive factor of BCS. In addition, BCS was correlated with ITBL following OLT. Furthermore, biliary casts and bile duct stones with different morphology and components were identified. Cholangiography should be considered as the main approach for diagnosing BCS, and in the treatment of BCS by choledochoscope or duodenoscope.\nWe thank Prof. Cong Cheng for all statistical analyses, who is director of the teaching and research section of statistics of Taishan Medical University.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "通用删除1(英):(OR = 1.889; 95% confidence interval = 1.166–7.490; P = 0.024;", "content": "【0】Biliary complications from liver transplantation present in 5.8–30.0% of cases, and the incidence is related to the characteristics and type of donor, cold ischemia time, and the type of bile duct anastomosis, among other factors.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3,4,5]</u> Biliary cast syndrome (BCS) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is often caused by biliary obstruction and cholangitis, and the incidence of which currently ranges from 3% to 18% and between 5% and 25% of OLT recipients,通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u> which is less frequent than the incidence of biliary sludge and occurrence of bile duct stones.

In the corresponding period, postoperative HARI was detected on weeks 1, 2, and 3 by color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) using the Aloka Prosound F75 (Hitachi Ltd. Japan).\nDifferences of HARI mean values between BCS group and non-BCS group on postoperative different stages were analyzed by the nonparametric Mann–Whitney statistical analysis, and odds ratio (OR) of HARI on postoperative different stages was analyzed by logistic regression analysis. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All computations were performed with SPSS Complex SamplesTM 17. 0 software (SPSS Inc. USA).\nHistological sections of biliary casts were H and E stained with standard procedures and compared to intrahepatic bile duct mixed type stones obtained from non-OLT-patients.\nMorphological observations of the biliary casts and intrahepatic bile duct mixed type stones from non-OLT-patients were examined using a Model S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi Ltd. Japan) by standard procedures at 2 kV.\nCholangiography with T-tube fistula or ERCP showed intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary strictures or alternate dilatation, columnar and dendritic shapes of biliary casts within the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct system 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nResults of the nonparametric Mann–Whitney statistical analysis of HARI, and HARI on postoperative weeks 2 and 3, showed there were statistically significant differences between the non-BCS and BCS patients (P < 0.05).

Postoperative HARI was lower, but there was higher incidence of biliary casts complications (P<0.05). HARI 1, HARI 2, HARI 3 was represented as HARI of the first week, the second week and the third week after operation, respectively. SD: Standard deviation; HARI: Hepatic artery resistance index; BCS: Biliary cast syndrome.\nResults of logistic regression analysis of HARI, and OR of HARI 1, HARI 2, HARI 3 at the postoperative stage were >1 (OR = 1.300; 1.223; 1.889, respectively), which suggested that HARI might be an independent risk factor. The OR of HARI 3 showed a statistically significant difference 通用删除1(英):<u>(OR = 1.889; 95% confidence interval = 1.166–7.490; P = 0.024; Table 2)</u>. According to the statistical analyses, we confirmed that when HARI = 0.64, this represents a critical value, at which point biliary cast complications occurred, and the value was within the normal range too (0.55–0.80). When HARI >0.64, it is marked as 1, as compared with HARI ≤0.64 when it is marked as 0. This meant that when HARI scores were smaller, the comparative risks were greater. The risk degree of HARI ≤0.64 was 1.889 times than HARI >0.64.\nResults of logistic regression analysis of HARI\n删除重复语句：<u>Results of logistic regression analysis of HARI</u>\nResults of logistic regression analyses of HARI, OR of HARI 1, HARI 2, HARI 3 after operation were >1, suggested HARI was possible to an independent risk factor.

HARI: Hepatic artery resistance index; BCS: Biliary cast syndrome; SE: Standard error; OR: Odds ratio, CI: Confidence interval.\nThe compositions of biliary casts were comparatively different in the context of bile duct stones. The vascular epithelial cells were identified by pathological examination in biliary casts 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>. Morphology of biliary casts and bile duct stones was determined by scanning electron microscopy. Biliary casts in the shape of filamentous structures were observed, and the structures were relatively loose. Bile duct stones in the shape of a spherical structure with additional dense structures were also seen 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>.\nLiver transplantation is one of the most important surgical interventions in the treatment of end-stage liver disease. Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of bile duct complications following OLT gradually becomes an important and hotly debated topic. Due to the influence of the complex diversity of liver transplant procedures by many factors, and the unique arterial blood supply of the anatomy of the biliary system, the capacity for tissue regeneration is low, and the risk factors accounting for postoperative bile duct complications and its mechanism remains poorly understood. It thus becomes a highly restrictive factor when attempting to improve the success rate of liver transplantation. Moreover, there is an urgent need for newer technology to better manage the key problems that are associated with liver transplantation, which represent a specific need for further development.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nBiliary casts are composed of necrotic material of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct after OLT, which forms a biliary tree. Simultaneously, biliary casts might be accompanied by multiple biliary strictures, which are predominantly caused by ITBL.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Hepatic arterial anastomotic stricture, hepatic artery thrombosis, or abnormal hepatic artery blood supply deficiency, can all cause ITBL, eventually leading to biliary stricture or bile leakage. Biliary reconstruction that is elected following damage to the bile duct peripheral vascular network can also cause ITBL, bile duct stricture after OLT including anastomotic stenosis, and nonanastomotic strictures (NAS). Accurately, NAS is an ischemic necrosis of the diffuse biliary tree following hepatic arterial thrombosis. In addition, some bile duct strictures might occur in cases where the hepatic artery is unobstructed. Thus, due to this kind of bile duct stricture, the imaging findings are similar to NAS, and consequently, this stricture type is also referred to as ITBL.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> At present, the pathological mechanism of ITBL remains unclear. However, it is quite well-known that outcomes in ITBL are influenced by the combined action of many kinds of risk factors, which include the following major associating factors including ischemia injury, induced immune damage and bile salt-induced cytotoxic damage.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> According to our clinical observations, biliary casts generally form at least 1 month after transplantation. The choices of treatment methods of biliary casts are quite varied and includes choledochoscope, ERCP and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography drainage.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16]</u>\nCold ischemic insult induces direct injury to the bile duct cells and damages the arterioles of the peribiliary vascular plexus, which consequently leads to apoptosis and necrosis of bile duct cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> A retrospective review of 355 OLT cases identified that 2.5% of the cases were diagnosed by cholangiography and that the warm ischemic time was significantly longer in BCS patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Damage to the peribiliary vascular plexus of the bile duct can also result in ITBL under conditions of biliary reconstruction. Blood supply to the biliary tract is predominantly from the arterial system rather than the portal vein system. In addition, hepatic arterial reconstruction is restricted to the biliary tract side in OLT recipients. Thus, the condition of reconstruction of the blood supply from the hepatic artery is an important factor to consider in the case of bile duct complications occurring.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>\nDetermination of HARI can be achieved by CDFI, and because of changes in the resistance of the hepatic arterial vascular bed, CDFI is an effective means to determine whether the hepatic artery will stricture. HARI reflects hepatic arterial systolic and diastolic blood flow velocity changes and is not affected by vascular morphology and sampling point. It is thus important to determine the parameters of hepatic arterial blood flow, where the normal value ranges from 0.55 to 0.80. A depressed HARI value indicates that the arterial wall elasticity has declined, and informs proximal blood flow obstruction.\nAt postoperative weeks 2 and 3, this study found that there were significant differences in the HARI score between patients with BCS and patients without BCS. Logistical regression analysis showed that the OR of HARI was >1, which suggested that HARI represented a possible independent risk factor for biliary complications after OLT. According to the results of statistical analysis, we confirmed that an HARI score of 0.64 was the critical value when biliary complications occurred, and the value was within the normal range (0.55–0.80), which suggested that biliary complications were highly sensitive to hepatic arterial ischemia. There have been no characterizations of obstructed hepatic arterial blood supply of the lower is likely to lead to biliary complications.\nIn liver transplantation, we should closely monitor dynamic changes in the hepatic arterial blood flow, and pay close attention to the HARI value. Maintaining an unobstructed hepatic artery depends on the improvement of anastomosis technology, organ preservation technology and microthrombosis anti-coagulation therapy. It is possible that HARI is an independent risk factor and an early predictive factor for BCS. However, the specific mechanisms underlying bile duct injury require further investigation.\nFormation of biliary casts and bile duct stones are similar but not completely the same in terms of their development. Their composition, morphology and microstructure exhibit certain unique differences. Biliary casts and bile duct stones have a similar microstructure, but their forming mechanism is quite different. With morphology, biliary casts appear as columnar and dendritic shapes within the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary duct but differ from bile duct stones, and the material quality of biliary casts is often palpably softer. Scanning electron microscopy showed that biliary casts appear in a variety of forms, and biliary casts often appear in the shape of relatively loose filamentous structures, including irregular sheets composed of imbricated accumulations, a porous honeycombs structure and adherent crystalline substances,通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> while bile duct stones take on the appearance of dense spherical structures.\nCholedochoscopy procedure showed a large number of flocs in the bile duct system of BCS patients. The pathological changes in biliary casts include the appearance of bilirubin crystals that surround the sample structure, with cellulose, and hyperplastic fibrous tissue, presence of micrangium, and presence of bile duct epithelial cells, and infiltrating inflammatory cells in biliary cast surfaces. The presence of micro blood vessels and collagen fibers in the biliary casts was related to injury of the bile duct mucosa. The composition of bilirubin and calcium in bile duct stones was evident, and yet fibrous tissue, blood vessels, and bile duct epithelial cells were not found.\nWe believe that biliary casts represent pathological changes that are caused by multi-factorial events after bile duct injury. BCS was correlated with ITBL following OLT. The occurrence of BCS was associated with bile duct tissue damage, but BCS in itself is not caused by a single pathological factor, and might instead be associated with functional recovery, biliary strictures and obstruction, acute and chronic rejection, recurrent cholangitis, cold and warm ischemia episodes, hepatic ischemia, and reperfusion injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,21,22,23]</u> BCS is one of the clinical manifestations of bile duct complications that can provoke ITBL following OLT.\nDuring the formation of bile stones, and related to the biliary core factor mucoprotein,通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> both mucoprotein secretion and expression of bile and bile duct tissues, showed a pathological and increasing trend in cholelith disease patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> In the process of liver transplantation, the presence of many strongly induced protein expression species and active substances in the human body are present, and their presence is mostly as a consequence of ischemic factors.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u> Biliary stricture can cause rheological changes to the bile, cholestasis, further formation of bile duct deposition, biliary sludge, and crystallization of bile stones.\nIt is formally possible that HARI might represent independent risk factors and might be an early predictive factor of BCS. In addition, BCS was correlated with ITBL following OLT. Furthermore, biliary casts and bile duct stones with different morphology and components were identified. Cholangiography should be considered as the main approach for diagnosing BCS, and in the treatment of BCS by choledochoscope or duodenoscope.\nWe thank Prof. Cong Cheng for all statistical analyses, who is director of the teaching and research section of statistics of Taishan Medical University.", "index": 5753, "show": true, "start": 5753, "end": 5824, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 09:50:50", "endTime": "2024/10/09 09:58:12", "cost": 441.713}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:29", "update_time": "2024-10-08 17:58:11", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 17:50:49"}

She complained of a predominantly left-sided nasal obstruction accompanied by malodorous, thick, mucopurulent rhinorrhea, mild swelling and pain in the left cheek for 3 months. There was no bloody rhinorrea, fever, headache, or toothache. Patient denied past medical and surgical histories were unremarkable without preexisting asthma or other allergic diseases. Cigarette smoking and illicit drug using were negative. No potential risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency, or previous facial trauma were determined. She was given an antibiotic and antihistamine for one month with minimal improvement.\nPhysical examination revealed mild non-tender swelling of the left cheek. Eye movement was normal and there was no exophthalmos. Anterior rhinoscopy showed mucopur- ulent discharge in the left nasal cavity. Endoscopic examination found thick, greasy secretions at the left middle meatus and swelling of left middle and inferior turbinates. There were no polyps and other neoplasm in the nasal cavity and meatus. The dental examination showed no infectious sites.\nLaboratory investigations showed an increased peripheral blood eosinophil count (1 × 109/ml, 0.154). Total serum IgE (sIgE) was 565 IU/ml, which was significantly elevated (reference range: 0-100 IU/ml). sIgE to Penicillium, Cladosporium, Aspergillus was grade 1 (reference range: ≤grade 1). IgA, IgM, IgG, C4 and C3 levels were within normal limits.\nA CT scan of sinuses revealed opacification of the left maxillary sinus without bony erosion or calcification .\nThe 1st operation: An endonasal endoscopic surgery was undertaken. The mucosa of left middle meatus was found edematous. After cutting the uncinate process, the ostium of left maxillary sinus was expanded. The sinus was completely filled with thick, viscous, yellow secretions. The mucosa was noted to be with apparent polypoid edema. The secretion was removed and the polypoid mucosa was kept. The maxillary cavity was irrigated with normal saline and then filled with budesonide inhalation suspension (Pulmicort Respules). Merocel was placed into left middle meatus and removed 24 h later.\nThe secretion and maxillary mucosa samples were sent to pathology and microbiology. Microscopic examination of the tissue showed eosinophil accumulation in specimen without fungal organisms. Fungal culture failed to detect colonizations.\nPost-operative management and follow-up: Within the 1st week after surgery, the patient was prescribed with systemic antibiotics (intravenous cefamandole 2 g every 12 h for 3 days followed by oral cefuroxime 250 mg every 12 h for 4 days). Topical corticosteroid (Budesonide aqueous nasal spray 64 μg/nostril twice daily) and saline irrigation at 500 ml/time once daily were started after nasal packing removal.\nWeekly endocopic monitoring was used to assess the patient postoperatively. In the first month, the left maxillary sinus was filled with thick, viscous, yellow secretions and mucosa was edematous as seen intraoperatively. Pathological examination showed inflammatory tissue with eosinophilic mucin and fungal hyphae. The hyphae were septated microscopically. Mucus culture was positive for fungal colonization but unable to identify the microorgamnism. Samples were sent for molecular analysis that detected Schizophyllum commune. In the 2nd month, the maxillary sinus was irrigated using Amphotericin B once daily (5 mg of Amphotericin B dissolved in 250 ml of sterile water). A course of systemic corticosteroid, prednisolone, was commenced at a dose of 30 mg/day for 2 weeks, then tapered to 5 mg/day, at which patient was maintained up to 6 month postoperatively. By then, the maxillary secretion was decreased and became thin. But the polypoid edema continued to be observed at the maxillary mucosa.\nThe 2nd operation and post-operative management: The patient refused conservative, topical treatment and opted for radical surgery. Therefore, 8 months after the first surgery, the patient underwent radical maxillary sinusotomy using the canine fossa trephine (CFT) technique. All the diseased mucosa and mucus were cleared but the mucosa lining the ostium was preserved. Pathology report showed chronic inflammation with granuloma formation and eosinophilic infiltration. The patient was continued on nasal spray of topical corticosteroid and saline irrigation for 3 months. Again, monthly endoscopy was performed. Two months after radical surgery, the maxillary cavity became epithelialized and patient reported resolu- tion of symptoms. Topical corticosteroid was continued and the patient was followed for 60 months without recurrence.\nMycological studies: The contents of the paranasal sinuses were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) at 27 °C. After 7 days, the fungal colony grew fast and its aerial mycelium is white and cotton-like . The back of the fungal colony was light-yellow after turning over the culture plate . Microscopic detection of the fungus (staining with lactophenol-cotton blue solution) showed transparent and septate hypha with short projection at the septum . Since the isolate was difficult to identify, the culture was sent for molecular biology exam.\nMolecular biology: The fungus was isolated and saved at the Centre of Clinical Fungus Research, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University (Num: SUMS0427). The fungus was cultured on SDA for 7 days at 27 °C. Some hyphae were put into a mortar box and grinded with liquid nitrogen, then transferred to Homogenizer Tubes (Omega). Genomic DNA was then extracted by using the Omega Fungal DNA Kit (D3390-00). PCR was performed with uni- versal fungus-specific primers for ITS rDNA-ITS4 and ITS5 (ITS: 5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′, ITS:5′-GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG-3′). The total volume for PCR was 50 μl, which included 25 μl for Premix Taq Version2.0 (TaKaRa Code:D331A), 2 μl for template, 21 μl for sterile bidistilled water and 1 μl for each primer. Reaction condition included: pre-denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min; denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s; extension at 72 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles totally; final extension at 72 °C for 10 min.

The 581bp-nucleotide sequence showed 99% homology with the reference sequence.\nAFS constitutes 5%-7% of all cases of chronic rhinosinusitis that require surgery.删除4：<u>5</u> Most series were from medical centers in the southern United States.删除4：<u>6</u> Allergic fungal sinusitis is not a common disease in China. The patient in this report had nearly all of the typical characteristics of AFS raised by Bent and Kuhn. It is believed that AFS is a type I-mediated allergic reaction. The majority are associated with the members of the ascomycota or the basidiomycota, and Calvatia, Coprinus, Ganoderma, Pleurotus and Psilocybe are the most prominent genera of the basidiomycota.删除4：<u>7</u> Schizophyllum commune also belongs to the basidiomycota and is worldwidely growing on various trees, decaying wood and mushrooms that was reported in more than 10 series of AFS over the last 25 years according to pubmed.删除4：<u>8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22</u>\nSince the fungi for AFS are in the highly viscous mucin, it is often difficult to isolate them by simply inoculating a portion of the paranasal sinus contents on agar and incu- bating. Maybe it was the failure reason for the first-time fungal culture for our case. Ponikau et al23 reported that it became easy to detect fungi if an enzyme, dithiothreitol, was employed to degrade the mucin at first.\nClark et al12 described the first case of AFS associated with Schizophyllum commune. The fungus was identified on the basis of its morphology and minute peg-like outgrowths from vegetative hyphye and clamp connections. Sigler et al24 thought that the mycological diagnosis of Schizophyllum commune is easy to make when hyphye bearing spicules or clamp connections are present. Identification of Schizophyllum commune is difficult in case of monokaryotic isolate because it is devoid of clamp connections. It was the first time to find this fungus in our mycology lab and we did molecular biology exam to identify it.\nAFS is considered as a special type of chronic rhinosinusitis and the primary treatment for AFS is surgery. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is the gold standard surgical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis. Although this case was localized in maxillary sinus, it had severely polypoid edema and was rich in eosinophilic mucus. According to the \"Grading and management of the diseased maxillary sinus\" proposed by Seiberling et al,25 our case was Grade 3 belonging to severely diseased maxillary sinusitis. We had cleared the mucus and kept the polypoid mucosa according to the role of FESS during the first operation and used antifungal irrigation after surgery, and it had no effect. We thought that maybe there was mucus left among the polyps which cannot be seen and cleared by FESS. In patients with severe nasal polypsis with complete opacification of the sinus and eosinophilic mucosa, it is proposed that complete removal of all gross disease will decrease the risk recurrence for the residual eosinophilic mucus will continue to stimulate the immune system leading to recurrence.删除4：<u>26</u> The best approach to the severely diseased sinus is still controversial. Jankowski et al support the use of \"nasalization\" for patients with severe nasal polypsis.删除4：<u>27</u> Seiberling et al25 performed canine fossa trephine for severely diseased maxillary sinus (clearing entirely all polyps and disease and leaving only a thin layer of mucosa). We also adopted canine fossa trephine to clear all the diseased mucosa in maxillary sinus totally during the second operation and it kept in remission for one-year follow-up.\nThe optimal medical therapy for AFS has not been determined. Systemic steroids are the mainstay of therapy in ABPA. However, steroids have multiple side effects and their use is controversial. It has been suggested that patients with recurrent AFS should have receive systemic corticosteroids after extensive debridement of all affected sinuses. After 2 weeks this is gradually reduced to alternate day therapy at lower doses.删除4：<u>28</u> The eventual aim is for maintenance inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Topical intranasal steroid sprays have minimal side effects and are used routinely in the postoperative management of AFS. However, the duration and effectiveness of steroid sprays in AFS has not been proven scientifically. The role of antifungal therapy in treatment of AFS is unclear. Since AFS is thought to be an allergic disease caused by an extrinsic fungal antigen rather than a true infection, systemic antifungals should be ineffective. Topic antifungal agent irrigation may reduce the fungal load and hence decrease antigenic stimuli.\nFrom our case, we found that the complete surgery was the most important and topic steroids after surgery was necessary and effective.\nWe have shown a case of AFS due to Schizophyllum commune which was rare case in China according to the publishing reports. It was a different fungus which may be identified by molecular biology. Complete surgery is primary for it and topic steroids were also necessary.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wjorl.2017.02.009</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Peer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.", "content": "【0】Allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) was first reported by Millar et al1 in 1981 and named by Katzenstein et al2 in 1983 who proposed the diagnostic criteria of eosinophilia, the presence of Charcot-Leyden crystals and Aspergillus hyphae.

The fungus was cultured on SDA for 7 days at 27 °C. Some hyphae were put into a mortar box and grinded with liquid nitrogen, then transferred to Homogenizer Tubes (Omega). Genomic DNA was then extracted by using the Omega Fungal DNA Kit (D3390-00). PCR was performed with uni- versal fungus-specific primers for ITS rDNA-ITS4 and ITS5 (ITS: 5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′, ITS:5′-GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG-3′). The total volume for PCR was 50 μl, which included 25 μl for Premix Taq Version2.0 (TaKaRa Code:D331A), 2 μl for template, 21 μl for sterile bidistilled water and 1 μl for each primer. Reaction condition included: pre-denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min; denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s; extension at 72 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles totally; final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. And the amplicon was purified and sequenced by Invitrogen Life Technologies Corporation, Shanghai.

The patient in this report had nearly all of the typical characteristics of AFS raised by Bent and Kuhn. It is believed that AFS is a type I-mediated allergic reaction. The majority are associated with the members of the ascomycota or the basidiomycota, and Calvatia, Coprinus, Ganoderma, Pleurotus and Psilocybe are the most prominent genera of the basidiomycota.删除4：<u>7</u> Schizophyllum commune also belongs to the basidiomycota and is worldwidely growing on various trees, decaying wood and mushrooms that was reported in more than 10 series of AFS over the last 25 years according to pubmed.删除4：<u>8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22</u>\nSince the fungi for AFS are in the highly viscous mucin, it is often difficult to isolate them by simply inoculating a portion of the paranasal sinus contents on agar and incu- bating. Maybe it was the failure reason for the first-time fungal culture for our case. Ponikau et al23 reported that it became easy to detect fungi if an enzyme, dithiothreitol, was employed to degrade the mucin at first.\nClark et al12 described the first case of AFS associated with Schizophyllum commune. The fungus was identified on the basis of its morphology and minute peg-like outgrowths from vegetative hyphye and clamp connections. Sigler et al24 thought that the mycological diagnosis of Schizophyllum commune is easy to make when hyphye bearing spicules or clamp connections are present. Identification of Schizophyllum commune is difficult in case of monokaryotic isolate because it is devoid of clamp connections. It was the first time to find this fungus in our mycology lab and we did molecular biology exam to identify it.\nAFS is considered as a special type of chronic rhinosinusitis and the primary treatment for AFS is surgery. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is the gold standard surgical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis. Although this case was localized in maxillary sinus, it had severely polypoid edema and was rich in eosinophilic mucus. According to the \"Grading and management of the diseased maxillary sinus\" proposed by Seiberling et al,25 our case was Grade 3 belonging to severely diseased maxillary sinusitis. We had cleared the mucus and kept the polypoid mucosa according to the role of FESS during the first operation and used antifungal irrigation after surgery, and it had no effect. We thought that maybe there was mucus left among the polyps which cannot be seen and cleared by FESS. In patients with severe nasal polypsis with complete opacification of the sinus and eosinophilic mucosa, it is proposed that complete removal of all gross disease will decrease the risk recurrence for the residual eosinophilic mucus will continue to stimulate the immune system leading to recurrence.删除4：<u>26</u> The best approach to the severely diseased sinus is still controversial. Jankowski et al support the use of \"nasalization\" for patients with severe nasal polypsis.删除4：<u>27</u> Seiberling et al25 performed canine fossa trephine for severely diseased maxillary sinus (clearing entirely all polyps and disease and leaving only a thin layer of mucosa). We also adopted canine fossa trephine to clear all the diseased mucosa in maxillary sinus totally during the second operation and it kept in remission for one-year follow-up.\nThe optimal medical therapy for AFS has not been determined. Systemic steroids are the mainstay of therapy in ABPA. However, steroids have multiple side effects and their use is controversial. It has been suggested that patients with recurrent AFS should have receive systemic corticosteroids after extensive debridement of all affected sinuses. After 2 weeks this is gradually reduced to alternate day therapy at lower doses.删除4：<u>28</u> The eventual aim is for maintenance inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Topical intranasal steroid sprays have minimal side effects and are used routinely in the postoperative management of AFS. However, the duration and effectiveness of steroid sprays in AFS has not been proven scientifically. The role of antifungal therapy in treatment of AFS is unclear. Since AFS is thought to be an allergic disease caused by an extrinsic fungal antigen rather than a true infection, systemic antifungals should be ineffective. Topic antifungal agent irrigation may reduce the fungal load and hence decrease antigenic stimuli.\nFrom our case, we found that the complete surgery was the most important and topic steroids after surgery was necessary and effective.\nWe have shown a case of AFS due to Schizophyllum commune which was rare case in China according to the publishing reports. It was a different fungus which may be identified by molecular biology. Complete surgery is primary for it and topic steroids were also necessary.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wjorl.2017.02.009</u>", "index": 13558, "show": true, "start": 13558, "end": 13622, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:45:06", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:45:40", "cost": 33.552}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:29", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:45:40", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:45:06"}

Moreover, it entails significant financial burden due to costly medical management and prolonged hospital stay.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The number of THAs continues to increase globally in proportion to the estimated burden of VTE. Therefore, safe and effective VTE prophylaxis is warranted as a prerequisite for surgical success. Compelling evidence has shown that prophylactic antithrombotic therapy following THA effectively reduces post-operative VTE risk.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> However, the ideal drug regimen that optimally balances insufficient antithrombotic effect with excess bleeding risk remains controversial.\nThe mainstay of VTE chemoprophylaxis currently includes low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and new oral anticoagulants (NOACs). NOACs, such as rivaroxaban have demonstrated superior safety, thromboprophylaxis efficacy, and convenience of use than LMWH, and are now commonly prescribed following joint arthroplasty.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Although rivaroxaban has proven to be an effective anticoagulant, it could potentially display exaggerated clinical effects with a greater risk of bleeding and incisional complications.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5,6]</u>\nAspirin is a widely administered antiplatelet and alternative antithrombotic for VTE prophylaxis, and has been given a grade 1B recommendation for use in orthopedic surgery by the American College of Chest Physicians 2012 Guidelines (ACCP-9).通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Aspirin, like other anticoagulants, is safe and effective in symptomatic VTE prophylaxis, with a potentially lower bleeding risk.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9,10]</u> Given that aspirin is inexpensive, orally administered, and requires minimal blood monitoring, it has been used as a part of VTE prophylaxis in 45% of total joint arthroplasties in the United States.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>\nHowever, despite the evidence of utility and efficacy, the administration regimens of aspirin in VTE prophylaxis following THA still lacks consensus. ACCP guidelines recommend 325 mg aspirin administered twice daily; however, other publications have suggested comparable efficacy using lower formulations of 81 mg.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,12]</u> Unfortunately, only formulations of 100 and 25 mg are available in the Chinese market, and clinical evaluations using these dosages are presently scarce. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of 100 mg aspirin administered twice daily and rivaroxaban in VTE prophylaxis following elective primary unilateral THA. We hypothesized that the efficacy of 100 mg aspirin twice daily in VTE prophylaxis would be comparable to that of 10 mg rivaroxaban once daily, with comparative perioperative blood loss and bleeding risk.\nThis randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Guidelines and conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from the local Institutional Review Board and the China Clinical Trial Registry 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. ChiCTR1800020289)</u>. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before the start of the study.\nAll patients were enrolled between January 2019 and January 2020 in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (China) and were allocated into two groups following a 1:1 ratio. This enrollment process was conducted by two investigators with reference to the inclusion and exclusion criteria . Computer randomization was used to generate the allocation sequence. The code for each patient was concealed in an envelope by an independent investigator who did not participate in patient enrollment. After surgery, the envelope was opened to assign the patient to one of the two groups and the corresponding prescription.\nFor sample size calculation, we used a non-inferiority clinical trial design. According to the previous research and follow-up results of our department, the predicted response rate of aspirin was set to 80%, rivaroxaban was set to 90%, and the non-inferiority limit was set to 0.15. A sum of the calculated sample size with an anticipated loss to follow-up required at least 30 patients in each treatment group to achieve statistical power.\nWe included patients with primary unilateral THA, aged between 20 and 80 years, and with at least 1 week of aspirin cessation before surgery. We excluded patients considered to have a high risk for VTE by their attending surgeon according to the established protocol for individualized VTE risk stratification.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> High-risk patients included those with a history of VTE, active malignancy, known prothrombotic conditions, or requiring extended antithrombotic therapy for pre-existing conditions. Additionally, we excluded patients with contraindications to aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs due to intolerance, peptic ulcer disease, or other reasons.\nAll patients included in this study underwent cementless THA using the posterior-lateral approach under general anesthesia. Two experienced orthopedic surgeons performed the surgical procedures. Surgical techniques and prosthetics were used at the clinical discretion of the attending surgeons. Tranexamic acid was used routinely during each surgical procedure, with an adjusted dose of 15 mg/kg intravenously before incision, and another topical dose before wound closure. No drainage was used in this study.\nAfter surgery, patients received 5 weeks of thromboprophylaxis with either an experimental aspirin regimen or rivaroxaban control. At least 6 h post-operatively, patients in the experimental group started on 100 mg of entericcoated aspirin (Bayer S.p.A. Italia) twice daily, whereas patients in the control group were administered 10 mg rivaroxaban (Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany). All patients received post-operative pneumatic compression during their hospital stay.\nCrutch-assisted partial weight-bearing ambulation was started on post-operative day 1 (POD 1). All patients were monitored after surgery and regularly discharged to rehabilitation centers between PODs 3 and 5. Outpatient follow-up was scheduled for PODs 30 and 90. All complications and VTE identified at follow-up were appropriately managed until complete resolution.\nPatient demographic data including age, gender, body mass index, and medical history were all recorded on admission.\nProphylactic efficacy was assessed using VTE incidence in the treatment groups. Patients were educated on how to recognize and report symptoms of VTE. DVT was diagnosed and verified using Doppler ultrasonography performed pre-operatively and at follow-up between PODs 14 and 30, looking for emboli in the deep ascending (popliteal, femoral, common femoral, and iliac) veins. The pre- and post-operative lower limb (thigh and calf) circumferences were also recorded.\nProphylactic safety was evaluated based on the incidence of bleeding events as defined by established criteria. This included major bleeding (fatal or symptomatic), clinically significant non-major bleeding, and minor bleeding events (ecchymosis, epistaxis, hematuria, etc).通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Peri-operative blood loss and the need for transfusion were also monitored. Particularly, the total blood loss (TBL), calculated according to the \"hemoglobin balance\" theory, was also used to assess medication bleeding risk.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>\nFurthermore, blood tests (hemoglobin [Hb], platelets, C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], and D-dimer) were performed before surgery and at PODs 1, 3, 5, and 30 to assess hemodynamic stability, along with measures of systemic wellness (partial prothrombin time [PTT], liver function [LFT], renal function tests [RFT], and vital parameters [heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation]).\nSecondary outcomes were measured and documented to further understand the medication effect. Harris hip score (HHS) was assessed pre-operatively and at PODs 30 and 90 to evaluate joint pain, range of motion, and function. Patient recovery and rehabilitation following THA were evaluated through the duration of hospital stay and at the time of post-operative walking function recovery.\nAll post-operative complications were recorded and categorized as surgery-related (surgical site infection, periprosthetic joint infection, hip dislocation, etc), systemic adverse events (cardiac infarction, stroke, death, etc), or gastrointestinal (GI) side effects.\nAll statistical tests were performed using SPSS Statistics 通用删除1(英):<u>(software version 25, IBM Corporation, Armonk, USA)</u>. The rate difference and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as the non-inferiority test for post-operative VTE rate. Quantitative data were reported as median and interquartile range using the Mann-Whitney U-test and Friedman test for inter-group and intra-group analyses, respectively. Chi-squared test are used to compare qualitative data. Univariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to identify and eliminate confounding factors in terms of DVT incidence. A P value below 0.05 was considered as statistically significant for all tests.\nAfter screening for eligibility, 78 patients who underwent THA between January 2019 and January 2020 met the inclusion criteria, of whom eight were excluded due to non-compliance with their antithrombotic regimen after discharge. Of the remaining 70 patients, 34 were allocated to the aspirin group (13 men and 21 women), and 36 into the rivaroxaban group (11 men and 25 women).

The evaluation of DVT using lower limb ultrasonography at PODs 14 to 30 identified three patients with distal DVT in both treatment groups. After statistical analysis, the 95% CI upper limit was found to be 0.119, which was lower than the previously established non-inferiority limit 0.15 (P for non-inferiority test = 0.01), indicating that aspirin was non-inferior to rivaroxaban DVT prophylaxis.

Subsequently, these two risk factors (nonidiopathic and D-Dimer on POD 1) were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression, which showed that the effect of aspirin on DVT prophylaxis was comparable to that of rivaroxaban after eliminating confounding factors (OR = 0.73, P = 0.74) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>.\nUnivariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis for VTE.\n删除重复语句：<u>Univariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis for VTE.</u>\nVTE: Venous thromboembolism; OR: Odds ratio; CI: Confidence interval; Ref: Reference variable; BMI: Body mass index; CRP: C-reaction protein; ESR: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\nOur study evaluated medication safety using its association with bleeding. No cases of major or clinically significant bleeding were observed in this study. One minor bleeding event was reported in the aspirin group (epistaxis) and three in the rivaroxaban group (one epistaxis and two ecchymoses; P = 0.33). There was no inter-group difference in peri-operative TBL or intra-operative blood loss (P = 0.12 and 0.57, respectively); moreover, no patient in either group required transfusions post-operatively 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>. The pre-operative results of laboratory blood tests of patients in both groups were statistically comparable. However, patients who received rivaroxaban demonstrated a significantly lower Hb and hematocrit (HCT) than those who received aspirin on PODs 1, 3, and 5 (Hb: P = 0.04, 0.04, and 0.02; HCT: P = 0.001, 0.001, and 0.007, respectively); however, this difference then disappeared by POD 30 (Hb: P = 0.79; HCT: P = 0.95).

However, no inter-group difference in HHS was noted pre- or post-operatively (P = 0.26, 0.67, and 0.44, respectively). Similar joint function and recovery between groups were supported by data measuring the duration of hospital stay and time it took for post-operative walking function recovery (P = 0.83 and 0.32, respectively) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.\nThere was no post-operative death or PE in this study. A total of 15 adverse events were recorded during the 90-day post-operative period investigated in the study 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>. Except for the bleeding events stated previously, three cases of GI adverse events were reported: one in the aspirin group (nausea) and two in the rivaroxaban group (nausea and peptic ulcer).

No significant inter-group difference was observed in the frequency of GI complications (P = 0.29) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>. A wound effusion was reported in one patient in the aspirin group (managed with local care), and one patient in the rivaroxaban group experienced systematic complications of acute coronary syndrome at POD 2 that was treated with antiplatelets with an uneventful recovery.\nComplications within POD 90 following total hip arthroplasty in the two study groups.\n删除重复语句：<u>Complications within POD 90 following total hip arthroplasty in the two study groups.</u>\n* One case of post-operative nausea during hospital stay. † One case of post-operative nausea during hospital stay, and one case of stomachache diagnosed with peptic ulcer. ‡ One case of epistaxis. § One case of epistaxis and two cases of ecchymosis. GI: Gastrointestinal; DVT: Deep venous thrombosis.\nThe VTE is an unexpected and health-threatening complication of THA. The peri-operative administration of anticoagulant prophylaxis has proven to reduce death rates and post-procedural VTE-associated complications. Rivaroxaban, an oral anticoagulant, can provide effective thromboprophylaxis after elective hip arthroplasty,通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> and was used for extending prophylaxis beyond hospital discharge because of its efficacy, safety, and convenience of use.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> In the literature, the RECORD trial series have demonstrated that the symptomatic and total VTE risk reduction by NOACs was relatively lower than that of LMWH, with an absolute risk reduction of 2.6% to 9.3%.通用删除6(英):<u>[16,18,19,20]</u> Rivaroxaban was recommended for about 10 to 14 days after total joint arthroplasty in the ACCP-9 guideline.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>\nRecent studies have reported the efficacy of aspirin, which was formally used to treat arterial diseases, in preventing post-operative lower extremity venous thrombosis and PE.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9,10,14]</u> In previous studies, the administered dose of aspirin in VTE prophylaxis has been widely variable, with a maximum of 650 mg twice daily.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> In the primary American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons guidelines, panelists recommended a dosage of 325 mg twice a day.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Moreover, several previous pieces of literature have suggested that aspirin showed similar antithrombotic efficacy and lower bleeding risk at this dose when compared with anticoagulants.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,23]</u> However, the administration of the aforementioned dose was considered high and became controversial over relevant disadvantages, which were associated with the internal antithrombotic process through the vascular-derived prostacyclin mechanism通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> and a dose-related GI side effect.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> In the field of carotid endarterectomy, the use of a lower dose (81 mg) might even be more effective than that of a high dose.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>\nTherefore, the study to explore new modalities for the appropriate dosage of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis in total joint replacement has emerged. The Pulmonary Embolism Prevention trial was among the first clinical trials to examine the effect of low-dose aspirin (160 mg daily) for either hip fracture surgeries or elective hip or knee arthroplasty compared with placebo,通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> and suggested that aspirin reduced the incidence of both symptomatic DVT and non-fatal or fatal PE. Colwell et al通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> adopted a compression device with a lower dose, 81 mg per day, to compare its safety and efficacy with LMWH after total hip replacement, suggesting that a lower incidence of major bleeding but equal VTE risk under aspirin-combined therapy. More recently, investigators reported that comparative experiments using two different doses of aspirin to study the efficacy of low-dose use.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,29]</u> In two single-center studies, patients were assigned to two groups receiving high-dose (325 mg twice a day) or low-dose (81 mg twice a day) aspirin. They found similar VTE occurrence and bleeding risk in the high- and low-dose groups; however, a significant reduction in GI side effects was noted in the low-dose group. These studies cast new light on antithrombotic treatment for orthopedic surgeons and showed compelling support for low-dose aspirin use in VTE prophylaxis following total joint replacement.\nRecently, some RCTs have attempted the use of low-dose aspirin for joint replacement surgeries in China. The most commonly used dosage of aspirin in these RCTs was 100 mg once daily. In two studies, the authors concluded a similar post-operative incidence of VTE and bleeding risk between aspirin and other anticoagulants.通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31]</u> However, another study comparing aspirin with rivaroxaban and subcutaneous LMWH, found a higher DVT rate in patients receiving aspirin than that in rivaroxaban.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Few studies have investigated that the role of aspirin in VTE chemoprophylaxis in patients post-THA in China.\nOur study is one of the first prospective RCT comparing the efficacy of aspirin and rivaroxaban following THA with a dose of 100 mg twice daily, which was different from previous RCTs in China. No symptomatic DVT or PE was detected in our study, and the patients in the two groups had low and very similar rates of asymptomatic DVT during follow-up. Our results indicated that the inexpensive and widely available generic agent aspirin was not significantly different from the more expensive, direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban in VTE prophylaxis after THA. Through multivariable logistic analysis, we excluded the influence of other confounding factors, and the comparable prophylactic effect of these two drugs was further confirmed (P = 0.74). The incidence of VTE in this study was relatively lower than that reported in the literature.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> Multiple aspects of the post-operative regimen may play a role in addition to chemoprophylaxis, including early mobilization and supplemental use of sequential compression devices. Despite this, there were no significant inter-group differences in terms of perioperative treatment.\nSurgeons have been concerned about the increased risk of post-operative bleeding associated with the use of aspirin, especially after orthopedic surgery. Previous literature has compared the clinical outcomes of NOACs with those of LMWH通用删除6(英):<u>[16,18,19,20]</u>; however, there are relatively limited data comparing aspirin with NOACs in THA. Lindquist et al通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> compared rivaroxaban, LMWH, and aspirin for chemoprophylaxis of VTE following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and THA. Other studies compared rivaroxaban with aspirin for VTE chemoprophylaxis following TKA,通用删除6(英):<u>[30,32]</u> showing a significantly lower bleeding risk of aspirin compared to that of rivaroxaban. In this study, there was no significant inter-group difference in peri-operative TBL and average post-operative Hb, suggesting the safety of aspirin use. Surgeons still need to be attentive to post-operative hidden blood loss because of the high proportion of TBL. The hidden blood loss may be related to hemolysis, bleeding in the interstitial space, and other factors, which could be exacerbated following anticoagulant treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> Furthermore, two patients in the rivaroxaban group developed obvious subcutaneous ecchymosis in our study, which implies more bleeding after anticoagulant prophylaxis with rivaroxaban. The results in this study corroborated with those in the literature通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,16,18,19,20,31,32,33]</u> and extended to different doses of aspirin for chemoprophylaxis.\nThe GI adverse effects are a major concern for NOACs通用删除6(英):<u>[16,35,36]</u> as well as aspirin. By affecting the platelet activity and inhibiting prostacyclin production, aspirin might cause mucosal ulceration and bleeding.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> The risk of aspirin-related GI adverse effects is dose-dependent,通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> even with a low-dose (75 mg) of aspirin exposure.通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> In this study, there was one case of post-operative nausea in the aspirin group, and one case of nausea with one case of peptic ulcer symptom in the rivaroxaban group (P = 0.29). All three patients did not withdraw from the study. No GI bleeding occurred in our study. It is recommended that gastro-protective strategies could be utilized to minimize the GI risk associated with aspirin treatment for highrisk patients, such as the adoption of enteric-coated formulations and the co-administration of proton pump inhibitors.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>\nThis prospective clinical trial has several limitations. First, this was a single-center study, and the current research involved a relatively small number of cases. Since the incidence of symptomatic DVT is relatively low, from 0.1% to 4.6%,通用删除6(英):<u>[8,14,30]</u> we chose to observe the asymptomatic DVT event, which was less clinically important than symptomatic DVT. First, future multicenter studies with more cases and different doses of aspirin are needed to analyze the effect of aspirin on the chemoprophylaxis of symptomatic VTE following THA in China. Second, this study was not powered to detect the superiority of 100 mg aspirin twice daily over rivaroxaban for chemoprophylaxis. The main objective of this study was to determine the non-inferiority of 100 mg aspirin in the prevention of asymptomatic VTE following THA. Third, post-operative Doppler ultrasonography was performed between PODs 14 and 30, which indicated that we might have missed some thrombotic events thereafter. Fourth, this study was underpowered to detect the inter-group difference in the secondary outcomes. Finally, given that the risk factors overlap, patients with VTE are at increased risks for arterial thrombotic events.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> In addition to VTE prophylaxis, aspirin might be superior to NOACs in the prevention of arterial thrombotic events following THA. However, this study excluded patients with cardiovascular risk, and the limited number rendered it underpowered to analyze the co-effect of aspirin.\nIn conclusion, this prospective study demonstrated that 100 mg aspirin twice daily extended to POD 35 was not inferior to the NOAC rivaroxaban for VTE prophylaxis following primary selective THA. Using aspirin for chemoprophylaxis could lead to similar TBL as that in rivaroxaban use following THA. Aspirin use might be a safe and effective modality for VTE prophylaxis following THA in the future; thus, future studies are warranted to determine its eligibility in our country.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:46:44", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:47:17", "cost": 32.676}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:29", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:47:17", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:46:44"}

According to the classification of RCTs, massive RCT is defined as a tear of >5 cm or a tear involving two or more rotator cuff tendons.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> When a massive RCT cannot be repaired surgically, i.e. a tear in which direct tendon-to-bone repair in the remaining rotator cuff is not possible, it was termed as irreparable massive RCT.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Unsurprisingly, patients with irreparable massive RCT have extremely poor functional outcomes.\nConventional surgical interventions for irreparable massive RCT include debridement and biceps tenotomy, partial rotator cuff repair, bridging patch grafts, tendon transfers, and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Superior capsule reconstruction (SCR) was originally described in 2012 by Mihata et al通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> and designed as an alternative to conventional surgery for irreparable massive RCT to restore the superior stability of the shoulder joint. The technique is now increasingly being performed clinically by orthopedic surgeons and is gaining popularity. However, several studies addressing the discrepancy in graft healing and variable clinic outcomes have emerged. Considering that studies over the past 10 years have uncovered some important mechanisms intrinsic to SCR and that there is an evolving recognition of this technique, we present here an overview of the recent advances in SCR.\nIn this perspective, we have addressed three questions: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> What is the biomechanical basis of SCR? 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> What are the appropriate indications for SCR? 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> How should one deal with a graft for best clinical outcomes? We believe that the answers to these three fundamental and profound questions will help us understand the underlying rationale of SCR, enabling successful implementation of SCR clinically, and may even aid in its evolution in the future.\nAnatomy of the superior capsule: The superior capsule is a relatively thin fibrous structure attached to the undersurface of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle-tendon units. The thickness of the shoulder capsule varies between 0.40 mm and 4.47 mm in different parts. The superior capsule was considerably thicker than the posterior and inferior parts of the shoulder capsule and also significantly thicker in the medial aspect than the lateral.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> The superior capsule and the coracohumeral ligament intermingle and together envelop the anterior edge of the supraspinatus and then attach to the greater tuberosity. Crosslinking of fibers of the superior capsule, superior glenohumeral ligament, and rotator cuff works as a functional unit and for which the term \"superior capsular complex\" might be appropriate. The notion of a superior capsular complex enhances our understanding of the pathology associated with internal impingement as well as articular-sided RCTs.\nBiomechanics of SCR: The superior capsule plays the role as one of the static stabilizers and stabilizes the glenohumeral joint superiorly at extremes of range of motion. On the abduction of the shoulder, the superior capsule becomes lax; however, contraction of the rotator cuff muscles causes a tensile stiffening of the capsule. In maximum shoulder abduction, the superior capsule was relaxed, whereas the inferior capsule was taut.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> In a cadaveric biomechanical test, Itoi found that the posterior capsule showed the greatest strength and modulus of elasticity, whereas the superior capsule showed the least strength. The most common mode of failure of the cadaveric shoulder capsules was tear at the mid-substance, followed by tear at the detachment from the humerus.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Therefore, the shoulder joint loses superior stability once both the supraspinatus tendon and superior capsule are destroyed in irreparable massive RCT. This loss of superior stability is the theoretical premise for the high failure rates of conventional surgical techniques seen in irreparable massive RCT. Superior stability is disrupted not only in irreparable massive RCT but also in medium to large (full-thickness rotator cuff tears). The use of a graft reinforces the superior capsule of the shoulder, providing leverage and support to the proximal humerus that was normally afforded by the supraspinatus tendon and the native superior capsule. Partial articular supraspinatus tendon avulsion (PASTA) is a type of partial-thickness RCT in the joint side. It is logical to presume that the PASTA lesion starts from a superior capsular tear.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>\nThe superior capsule establishes a stable fulcrum of glenohumeral joint motion, allowing the remaining intrinsic and extrinsic force couples to exert their effects around that stable fulcrum. In rotator cuff dysfunction, this static stabilization provided by the superior capsule is thrown into disarray. The primary goal of SCR is to preserve the centered position of the humeral head and restore the superior stability of the shoulder joint.\nIndications for SCR: SCR improves range of motion and clinical outcomes in irreparable massive RCTs. SCR restores superior stability and theoretically can improve force coupling in the sagittal and coronal planes.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Recognition of these factors and advancement in knowledge has, therefore, led to a gradual broadening of indications for SCR. Here, we reviewed four such indications.\nIrreparable massive RCTs: Irreparable RCTs show corresponding progressive radiographic changes, such as bone loss, narrow joint space, and so on.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> By restoring superior stability, SCR can potentially delay or halt these devastating processes. Most orthopedic surgeons agree that irreparable massive RCT without severe glenohumeral arthritis is the prime indication for SCR. First, irreparable massive RCTs have detrimental effects on patients’ functional mobility and quality of life. Second, there is insufficient rotator cuff remnant left for repair.\nVarious surgical techniques to treat irreparable massive RCT and correct joint kinematics, decrease pain, and restore shoulder function have been performed. As compared with partial rotator cuff repair or conservative treatment, the overall outcome after SCR is far more predictable. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is an alternative surgical treatment that achieves satisfactory clinical outcomes in Grade 4 or 5 (Hamada classification) massive RCTs. There is an ongoing debate as to which technique is better for irreparable massive RCT with severe arthropathy: SCR combined with anatomy totals shoulder arthroplasty or RSA. More high-quality studies are needed to settle this debate.\nSeverely degenerated medium to large RCTs: Some chronic medium to large RCTs, especially in geriatric patients, showed structural degeneration of the rotator cuff, such as fatty infiltration, loss of muscle volume, subtraction of sarcomeres, and sometimes profound muscle weakness.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> In such cases, the limited healing potential of injured rotator cuff tendons may lead to retear or non-healing of the tendon-bone interface. To obviate retear of rotator cuff tendons, the concept of SCR reinforcement has been proposed. This leads to the question of which are evidently appropriate candidates for SCR reinforcement owing to their inherent degeneration. Mihata classified muscle degeneration, tendon degeneration, and tendon retraction into mild, moderate, and severe types according to the findings on pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>\nDelaminated RCTs: Delamination is described as a horizontal tear between the layers of the rotator cuff. Delamination in RCTs has some peculiar characteristics: common in large-sized tears, limited to the posterior part of the rotator cuff, and affects the thicker deep layers rather than the superficial layers of the cuff.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Delaminated RCTs are associated with diminished healing and worse clinical outcomes after repair.\nDual-layer rotator cuff repair based on the retraction pattern of the delamination has been recommended for improvement in repair integrity and better clinical outcomes. Anatomic restoration of the superior capsular and tendon insertion in delaminated RCTs in cadaveric shoulders demonstrated superior footprint restoration with increasing abduction.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Anatomical balancing of each layer of the delamination could achieve appropriate tensioning after the repair of the RCT. However, it is almost impossible to simultaneously restore appropriate tensioning of dual layers without causing cleavage of the tendon fibers. In these situations, SCR-reinforcement might be the right choice to resolve this conundrum and circumvent the tendon-tension mismatch.\nPseudoparalysis caused by massive RCTs: Pseudoparalysis from irreparable massive RCTs is one of the toughest challenges faced by shoulder surgeons, also in a sense attributed to superior instability of the shoulder. Mihata reported that SCR caused a reversal of pseudoparalysis in 96% (27/28) and 93% (14/15) of patients who presented with moderate and severe pre-operative pseudoparalysis, respectively.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> If the deltoid muscle is functional, pseudoparalysis from irreparable massive RCT is a valid indication for SCR.\nGraft treatment for SCR: We addressed two important principles for the best possible long-term clinical outcome based on the biomechanical rationale: to enhance graft-bone healing in the short term and to prevent retear of the graft in the long run.\nEnhanced graft-bone healing: Originally, Mihata group used fascia lata autograft for SCR通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>; now, however, a varied selection of grafts are used clinically, including human dermal allograft, long head of biceps, autologous hamstring graft, and others. Irrespective of the type of graft used in SCR, the main concern is attaining positive and advantageous biomechanical outcomes, including restoration of the position of the humeral head from its superiorly migrated location, decrease in the acromial-humeral distance, and so on. Therefore, the chief concern is to attain graft-bone healing in both the glenoid and rotator cuff footprint.\nDecreased possibility of graft retear, first, it is imperative to use a graft of appropriate thickness. Superior capsule reconstruction was originally tested using a 5-mm folded fascia lata autograft in cadaveric shoulders.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Mihata used 6 to 8-mm-thick grafts by folding the fascia lata twice or thrice on itself clinically.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> Sutter has reported excellent biomechanical properties of a 3.5-mm-thick dermal allograft.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> However, grafts thicker than 8 mm likely fail to strike the right balance, that is achieving optimal mechanical advantage while obviating the risk of subacromial impingement.\nSecond, it is crucial to maintain an appropriate graft tension. Graft tension depends on several factors, including accurate measurement of the distances between the anchors to punch holes in the graft, arm position to set the relationship between the anchor distances. Sutter reported that the ideal arm position is 30° of abduction, 20° of forward flexion, and 10° of external rotation.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Passive external rotation could lead to graft strains that may cause graft failure; it is preferable to fix the graft in passive internal rotation biomechanically. In addition, different abduction angles would change the distance between the glenoid and the greater tuberosity asymmetrically in a medial to the lateral direction.\nThird, it is vital to ensure better continuity of the graft and infraspinatus tendon. The humeral head might subluxate from the postero-superior space during internal rotation if this space exists. Side-to-side suturing between the graft and infraspinatus tendon remnants resulted in increased superior stability of the glenohumeral joint. However, placing anterior side-to-side sutures did not change any measurements compared with SCR with posterior side-to-side suturing.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>\nIn conclusion, SCR can restore superior stability of the shoulder joint. SCR is a valid and well-established joint-preserving surgical option for irreparable massive RCT and/or pseudoparalysis associated with massive RCT without evidence of arthritis of the glenohumeral joint. SCR reinforcement might also be indicated for severely degenerated rotator cuff and/or delaminated medium to large RCT. Improving the quality of degenerated rotator cuff and decreasing retear rates in the long run have broadened the scope of SCR. Graft treatment is a key step for achieving a successful outcome after SCR. Furthermore, to attain graft healing and diminish retear rates in the graft after surgery, it is essential to select a graft of appropriate thickness, fix the graft with the correct tension, and ensure improved capsular continuity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/08 17:06:13", "endTime": "2024/10/08 17:06:30", "cost": 16.893}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:29", "update_time": "2024-10-08 01:06:30", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 01:06:13"}

Among the bacteria species isolated from bone infections, Staphylococcus aureus is the most prevalent bacterial subtype, especially for bone infections due to trauma. Although our understanding towards the pathophysiology and treatment of bone infections has progressed significantly, it remains a clinical conundrum for orthopedic surgeons, especially cases caused by open fracture trauma.删除4：<u>1</u> The skeletal system relies on osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and other functional cells in the microenvironment to maintain a dynamic balance. With age and decreased hormone levels, bone absorption gradually dominates, eventually leading to systemic bone destruction. Both severe traumatic stress and post-infectious inflammatory state accelerate the process of bone destruction. Effective anti-osteoporosis treatment promotes systemic bone deposition and reduces the incidence of age-related and postmenopausal-related fractures. At the same time, conditions involving inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, and traumatic osteomyelitis, also affect the normal functioning of the skeletal system, most of which are accompanied by varying degrees of bone destruction.删除4：<u>2</u> When infections are around the bone, the local tissue destruction caused by the reaction poses a massive challenge to clinical treatment. At present, the treatment of such diseases is gradually standardized, but further understanding of the pathological processes of different types of bone destruction is equally crucial for the introduction of effective prevention and treatment.删除4：<u>3</u>\nThe immune system and the skeletal system are in a skeletal microenvironment, and the two systems are closely related and cooperate with each other. Immune cells and their metabolites are involved in the regulation of bone deposition and bone strength by affecting the activity of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and bone cells . Studies of the association between the two systems began with the discovery of the bone resorption promoting factor IL-1β 40 years ago.删除4：<u>4</u> The development of the subsequent osteoclast important differentiation factor, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), further unveiled the mystery of osteoimmunology.删除4：<u>5</u> Many studies revealed the effects of numerous cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-17 on inflammatory bone diseases. At the same time, specific antagonists of these cytokines have also been developed. Osteoimmunology studies also provide evidence for the interaction between estrogen deficiency and immune response activation in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis.删除4：<u>6</u> All of the above evidence may offer new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of traumatic bone infections.\nPart of immune cells involved in bone metabolism.\n删除重复语句：<u>Part of immune cells involved in bone metabolism.</u>\nTRAF6: TNF receptor-associated factor 6, PTH: parathyroid hormone, RANKL: receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand, CTLA- 4: CD80/cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, NKT: natural killer T.\nThe main factors causing pathological changes in traumatic bone infections include stress response, activated immune response, pathogenic factor, and disturbed bone metabolism. The staphylococcal microbiota that accumulates in the wound is also involved in the process of bone metabolism. Pathogens are agonists of immune response and have a direct effect on bone metabolism. On one side, an immune response caused by traumatic bone infections leads to severe bone destruction. On the other, bacteria cause bone destruction by directly killing osteoblasts, and the immune response elicited by bacteria is also crucial for osteoclast differentiation and bone degradation. The most representative of these pathogens is Staphylococcus aureus.删除4：<u>7</u> During infection, these bacteria can survive in the bone microenvironment by forming biofilms and triggering a severe immune response. At the same time, host cells secrete many cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL-3), (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2).删除4：<u>8</u> The hemolytic toxins produced by S. aureus, bacterial lipoproteins, and Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) can stimulate immune cells to secrete IL-1β. In this process, even though the individual products of specific immune responses result in a negative regulation of bone resorption, the overall effect is still severe bone destruction.9 S. aureus protein A can promote the secretion of NF-κB by the binding of TNF R1 on the surface of osteoblasts, resulting in the secretion of IL-6. The peptidoglycan component of bacteria promotes the secretion of RANKL and reduces the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG) by activating the Toll-Like receptor-2 pathway.删除4：<u>10</u> Trouillet-Assant et al.11 reported that bone marrow-derived osteoclast precursors were infected by living S. aureus to induce differentiation into active macrophages accompanied by secretion of many pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the one hand, these cytokines enhance the bone resorption function of uninfected mature osteoclasts. On the other hand, these cytokines promote the differentiation of uninfected osteoclasts. In addition to mediating bone destruction by immune cells, S. aureus also directly affects osteoblasts. Josse et al.12 reported that S. aureus could reduce the osteogenic activity and proliferative activity of osteoblasts by inducing apoptosis-dependent manner.\nDentin destruction is another frequently encountered condition of infection-related bone destruction, which presents with many features similar to osteomyelitis. Rhodobacter sphaeroides is one of its major pathogens.删除4：<u>13</u> IL-17 is a type of cytokine that is locally and highly expressed in periodontitis and plays an essential role in inflammatory response and bone destruction. Rhodobacter sphaeroides also secretes a cysteine proteolytic enzyme called gingival protease, which does not directly reduce osteoclast formation but reduces the production of osteoclast regulatory factors, such as OPG.删除4：<u>14</u> Almost all types of Streptococcus pyogenes produce streptolysin O (SLO). Our previous study found that SLO reduced phosphorylation of p65 and IκBα in the signaling pathway of osteoclast differentiation, thereby inhibiting the expression of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) and downregulating the expression of osteoclast marker genes. SLO also induces apoptosis in mature osteoclasts, suggesting that SLO blocks osteoclast activation during S. pyogenes infection.删除4：<u>15</u>\nAs the function of RANKL is gradually revealed, the role of osteoclasts in bone metabolism becomes clearer. This functional cell is involved in the process of infection-related bone destruction. Mature osteoclasts degrade bone matrix proteins by secreting proteolytic enzymes and release the inorganic components of decalcified bone by releasing hydrochloric acid. Under physiological conditions, the binding of RANK superfamily member RANKL to its ligand RANK regulates the formation of osteoclasts.删除4：<u>5</u> High doses of RANKL promote osteoclast differentiation, while low doses of RANKL reduce osteoclast differentiation.删除4：<u>16</u> RANKL and RANK signaling requires the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which in turn activates the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-κB pathways, ultimately leading to the expression of the critical transcription factor NFATc1 in osteoclast formation.删除4：<u>17,18</u> High expression of RANKL promotes osteoclast differentiation, a process that can be inhibited by OPG, which is a high-affinity bait ligand for RANK that competes with RANKL for binding to RANK for negative regulation of osteoclastogenesis. Deletion of OPG can lead to systemic osteolytic lesions.删除4：<u>19</u> The binding of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) to its ligand colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor also plays an essential role in the differentiation of osteoclasts.删除4：<u>20</u>\nThe extent of bone resorption depends on the number of osteoclasts and bone resorption activity. The formation of osteoclasts under physiological conditions is controlled by the expression levels of RANKL, M-CSF, and OPG, which are also regulated by many inflammatory factors in infection-related bone diseases. RANKL promotes the differentiation of osteoclast precursor cells into osteoclasts, and M-CSF promotes the proliferation of precursor cells and inhibits apoptosis. In addition to the stage of cell differentiation, bone absorption is also a complicated process. First, the osteoclasts are oriented to bone migration by integrin-like proteins on the cell surface, such as αVβ3, thereby forming a closed cavity.删除4：<u>21</u> High concentrations of RANKL and M-CSF in infection-related bone destruction can both increase the number of osteoclasts and promote the phagocytosis of mature osteoclasts. The relationship between numerous cytokines and the interaction of these two osteoclast key factors is essential for a better understanding of bone destruction.删除4：<u>22</u>\nImmunomodulation is essential for the development of traumatic bone infections. The process of post-traumatic tissue repair begins with the activation of coagulation, stimulating the release of various growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factors, platelet derived growth factors, and fibroblast growth factors. Meanwhile, inflammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils, and T-lymphocytes) accomplish phagocytosis and the removal of bacteria, cellular debris, and damaged tissue.删除4：<u>23</u> Macrophages are both secretory cells of many inflammatory factors and precursor cells for osteoclast differentiation.删除4：<u>24</u> The process by which macrophages differentiate into osteoclasts is influenced by many factors, such as the relative proportions of M1 and M2 cells.25 M1 and M2 macrophages play an essential role in the immune response. IL-4 and IL-13 secreted by Th2 lymphocytes and eosinophils are both critical to the differentiation of M2 macrophages, and they also inhibit osteoclast formation.删除4：<u>16</u> TNF-α is a factor that promotes the formation of osteoclasts, and it also promotes the accumulation of IL-13-producing eosinophils to the focal joints. Although researchers have suggested that osteoclasts are not derived from activated M2 macrophages, osteoclasts isolated from mouse arthritis specimens possess the characteristics of M1 and M2 macrophages.删除4：<u>26</u> Thus, the differentiation of osteoclasts is highly dependent on the microenvironment in which the cells are located.\nThe regulation of the immune system on bone metabolism can be manifested as a dual role in reducing osteoclast formation and anti-bone resorption. For example, CD4+ FoxP3+ T cells are both effective suppressor cells for osteoclast differentiation, and they also exhibit certain anti-inflammatory effects. These cells directly inhibit the binding between CD80/cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4) required for osteoclast formation.删除4：<u>27</u> Another type of CD8-positive T cells reduces osteoclast formation by direct contact. These cells not only inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro but also inhibit bone destruction in RANKL-injected and ovariectomized mice.删除4：<u>28</u> Th1 cells are thought to play a role in promoting osteoclast formation because they also secrete RANKL.删除4：<u>29</u> At the same time, Th1 cells can also secrete IFN-γ, which inhibits this process.删除4：<u>30</u> CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells promote osteoclast differentiation by secreting RANKL, which is detected in large numbers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.删除4：<u>31</u> Therefore, IFN-γ produced by Th1 cells results in a direct and indirect inhibition of osteoclast formation.\nAs important immune cells, B cells play a role in not only inducing antigen-dependent T cells but also producing antibodies under healthy and infected conditions. Various effects mediated by B cells also include the secretion of cytokines and chemokines that mediate cell differentiation and inflammation, and are involved in the regulation of the RANK/RANKL/OPG system. Therefore, B lymphocytes play a key role in bone homeostasis, osteoclast formation, and osteogenesis.删除4：<u>32</u> Although research in 1998 demonstrated that B cells secrete anti-osteoclast factor OPG, historically, scholars believe that the main source of OPG is osteoblasts. Subsequent research has challenged this view. Researchers have found that B cells are the main source of OPG in mouse bone marrow (BM) under physiological conditions, accounting for 64% of total BM OPG production.删除4：<u>33</u> Under infection, B cells serve as an important source of the osteoclastogenesis factor RANKL.删除4：<u>34</u> In contrast, some scholars believe that B cells can inhibit the formation of osteoclasts by producing TGF-β and IFN-γ.删除4：<u>35</u> Overall, further research is needed to determine how B-cell-mediated immune responses are involved in the activation of osteoclasts in infection-related bone destruction.\nAntibiotic is a component of the treatment of traumatic bone infections, and it also has an important impact on bone metabolism. Antibiotic-loaded bone cement is widely used in the repair of traumatic bone defects. Gentamicin is an early antibiotic used in bone cement mixed preparations. As bone cement is used more frequently, researchers have used mouse skulls to find that the use of gentamicin may result in inhibitory effect on bone tissue similar to its nephrotoxicity.删除4：<u>46</u> In another study using the C2C12 cell line as an osteoblast lineage, the researchers reduced the cell viability and alkaline phosphatase activity of cultured cells by topical application of high concentrations of gentamicin. Researchers also confirmed that gentamicin might be harmful to bone healing and repair in vivo.删除4：<u>47</u> Researchers applied different high-concentration antibiotics in the culture of primary human osteoblasts, and they measured the concentration of lactic acid in the cell culture supernatant as an indicator of glycolysis. The researchers observed that clindamycin, fluoroquinolone, linezolid, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, and tetracycline might produce cytotoxicity and a cytostatic effect on primary human osteoblasts by mitochondrial energy supply.删除4：<u>48</u> Vancomycin is a glycopeptide drug used in severe infections caused by drug-resistant strains. Researchers selected eight concentrations of 21 different types of antibiotics to stimulate osteoblasts, and they measured osteoblast deoxyribonucleic acid content and alkaline phosphatase activity to assess cell number and osteogenic activity. The results confirmed that amikacin, tobramycin, and vancomycin resulted in the least cytotoxicity, and high concentrations of drugs significantly affected cell proliferation and ALP activity. The data provide effective theoretical support for the local application of vancomycin in bone infections.删除4：<u>49</u>\nThe post-puberty phase of skeletal development is a critical period of plasticity, supporting approximately 40% of the peak bone mass. Hathaway-Schrader et al.50 reported that gut microbiota contribute to bone health. The team treated mice with a mixture of three antibiotics and found that antibiotic treatment led to changes in the intestinal microbiota of mice, which ultimately led to specific changes in the bacteria. As antibiotics destroy the intestinal microbiota, the researchers examined the integrity of the skeletal system and found that antibiotic-induced microflora changes exhibited little effect on cortical bone but caused high metabolic changes in trabecular bone. The results showed that after antibiotic treatment, osteoblast proliferation and differentiation did not change, while the number, size, and activity of osteoclasts increased. Further research deepened into the specific immune mechanisms of the bone marrow environment, demonstrating the effects of antibiotic treatment on bone marrow cells. By detecting immune cell populations in the bone marrow, the researchers found a significant increase in animal bone marrow-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the antibiotic-treated group. MDSCs can regulate innate and adaptive immune responses in a variety of diseases.\nDespite the direct effect of antibiotic toxicity on the bone cell line in bone infections, antibiotics should be absorbed mostly by the reduction of bacteria. Optimizing the route of administration and selecting sensitive antibiotics as soon as possible are critical in reducing the effects of its toxicity on cells.\nIn the past, many patients with traumatic bone infections eventually lost mobility due to severe bone destruction. Surgery is the only option for them. As the pathogenesis of traumatic-related inflammatory bone destruction is further revealed, especially in understanding the interrelationship between the immune system and the skeletal system, important advances have been made in the treatment of such diseases. For example, the use of the RANKL inhibitor Denosumab is based on the inhibition of excessive differentiation of osteoclasts in inflammatory bone destruction.删除4：<u>51</u> However, this treatment exhibits no anti-inflammatory effect, so it is also necessary to combine anti-inflammatory therapy. Several inhibitors of inflammatory factors are currently used to treat inflammatory diseases, including targeted inhibition of IL-1, IL-6R, IL-17, IL-12/23, and TNF-α. The TNF-α inhibitor exhibits both antiinflammatory and inhibitory functions of osteoclast formation. The IL-6R inhibitor, IL-12/23, and IL-17 inhibitor used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis all exhibit the above dual effects. IL-1 antagonists directly inhibit the differentiation and functional activation of osteoclasts while reducing the inflammatory response.删除4：<u>52</u> IL-1 inhibitors are mainly used in diseases where IL-1β is the main causative factor, such as gout.删除4：<u>53</u> Another small molecule inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammatory corpuscle has also been used in many mouse disease models, demonstrating that inflammatory corpuscles are also an effective target for such diseases, but there are no clinical reports of such drugs.删除4：<u>54</u> Drugs that regulate the acquired immune response, especially those that regulate T cell activity, also exhibit a function of effectively regulating bone resorption. For example, CTLA4 expressed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis inhibits osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting T cell activation and binding to osteoclast precursor cells.删除4：<u>55</u>\nIn general, the immune system is closely involved in the disease process of the skeletal system, and complex communication between the two systems needs to be further elucidated. The study of immune pathways regulating bone metabolism has been conducted to help us better understand these diseases. The development of basic research promoted the advancement of therapeutics, such as targeted therapy of cytokines in pathogenic factors, which can selectively resolve the cause, reduce the inflammation, delay the bone resorption, and thus treat the infection-related bone destruction.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2020.05.009</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "9 ", "content": "【0】Bone infection leads to progressive bone destruction, aberrant bone formation and systemic inflammatory response.

Effective anti-osteoporosis treatment promotes systemic bone deposition and reduces the incidence of age-related and postmenopausal-related fractures.

At the same time, specific antagonists of these cytokines have also been developed.

The staphylococcal microbiota that accumulates in the wound is also involved in the process of bone metabolism. Pathogens are agonists of immune response and have a direct effect on bone metabolism. On one side, an immune response caused by traumatic bone infections leads to severe bone destruction. On the other, bacteria cause bone destruction by directly killing osteoblasts, and the immune response elicited by bacteria is also crucial for osteoclast differentiation and bone degradation. The most representative of these pathogens is Staphylococcus aureus.删除4：<u>7</u> During infection, these bacteria can survive in the bone microenvironment by forming biofilms and triggering a severe immune response. At the same time, host cells secrete many cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL-3), (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2).删除4：<u>8</u> The hemolytic toxins produced by S. aureus, bacterial lipoproteins, and Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) can stimulate immune cells to secrete IL-1β. In this process, even though the individual products of specific immune responses result in a negative regulation of bone resorption, the overall effect is still severe bone destruction.9 S. aureus protein A can promote the secretion of NF-κB by the binding of TNF R1 on the surface of osteoblasts, resulting in the secretion of IL-6. The peptidoglycan component of bacteria promotes the secretion of RANKL and reduces the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG) by activating the Toll-Like receptor-2 pathway.删除4：<u>10</u> Trouillet-Assant et al.11 reported that bone marrow-derived osteoclast precursors were infected by living S. aureus to induce differentiation into active macrophages accompanied by secretion of many pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the one hand, these cytokines enhance the bone resorption function of uninfected mature osteoclasts. On the other hand, these cytokines promote the differentiation of uninfected osteoclasts. In addition to mediating bone destruction by immune cells, S. aureus also directly affects osteoblasts. Josse et al.12 reported that S. aureus could reduce the osteogenic activity and proliferative activity of osteoblasts by inducing apoptosis-dependent manner.\nDentin destruction is another frequently encountered condition of infection-related bone destruction, which presents with many features similar to osteomyelitis. Rhodobacter sphaeroides is one of its major pathogens.删除4：<u>13</u> IL-17 is a type of cytokine that is locally and highly expressed in periodontitis and plays an essential role in inflammatory response and bone destruction. Rhodobacter sphaeroides also secretes a cysteine proteolytic enzyme called gingival protease, which does not directly reduce osteoclast formation but reduces the production of osteoclast regulatory factors, such as OPG.删除4：<u>14</u> Almost all types of Streptococcus pyogenes produce streptolysin O (SLO). Our previous study found that SLO reduced phosphorylation of p65 and IκBα in the signaling pathway of osteoclast differentiation, thereby inhibiting the expression of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) and downregulating the expression of osteoclast marker genes. SLO also induces apoptosis in mature osteoclasts, suggesting that SLO blocks osteoclast activation during S. pyogenes infection.删除4：<u>15</u>\nAs the function of RANKL is gradually revealed, the role of osteoclasts in bone metabolism becomes clearer. This functional cell is involved in the process of infection-related bone destruction. Mature osteoclasts degrade bone matrix proteins by secreting proteolytic enzymes and release the inorganic components of decalcified bone by releasing hydrochloric acid. Under physiological conditions, the binding of RANK superfamily member RANKL to its ligand RANK regulates the formation of osteoclasts.删除4：<u>5</u> High doses of RANKL promote osteoclast differentiation, while low doses of RANKL reduce osteoclast differentiation.删除4：<u>16</u> RANKL and RANK signaling requires the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which in turn activates the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-κB pathways, ultimately leading to the expression of the critical transcription factor NFATc1 in osteoclast formation.删除4：<u>17,18</u> High expression of RANKL promotes osteoclast differentiation, a process that can be inhibited by OPG, which is a high-affinity bait ligand for RANK that competes with RANKL for binding to RANK for negative regulation of osteoclastogenesis. Deletion of OPG can lead to systemic osteolytic lesions.删除4：<u>19</u> The binding of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) to its ligand colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor also plays an essential role in the differentiation of osteoclasts.删除4：<u>20</u>\nThe extent of bone resorption depends on the number of osteoclasts and bone resorption activity. The formation of osteoclasts under physiological conditions is controlled by the expression levels of RANKL, M-CSF, and OPG, which are also regulated by many inflammatory factors in infection-related bone diseases. RANKL promotes the differentiation of osteoclast precursor cells into osteoclasts, and M-CSF promotes the proliferation of precursor cells and inhibits apoptosis. In addition to the stage of cell differentiation, bone absorption is also a complicated process. First, the osteoclasts are oriented to bone migration by integrin-like proteins on the cell surface, such as αVβ3, thereby forming a closed cavity.删除4：<u>21</u> High concentrations of RANKL and M-CSF in infection-related bone destruction can both increase the number of osteoclasts and promote the phagocytosis of mature osteoclasts. The relationship between numerous cytokines and the interaction of these two osteoclast key factors is essential for a better understanding of bone destruction.删除4：<u>22</u>\nImmunomodulation is essential for the development of traumatic bone infections. The process of post-traumatic tissue repair begins with the activation of coagulation, stimulating the release of various growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factors, platelet derived growth factors, and fibroblast growth factors. Meanwhile, inflammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils, and T-lymphocytes) accomplish phagocytosis and the removal of bacteria, cellular debris, and damaged tissue.删除4：<u>23</u> Macrophages are both secretory cells of many inflammatory factors and precursor cells for osteoclast differentiation.删除4：<u>24</u> The process by which macrophages differentiate into osteoclasts is influenced by many factors, such as the relative proportions of M1 and M2 cells.25 M1 and M2 macrophages play an essential role in the immune response. IL-4 and IL-13 secreted by Th2 lymphocytes and eosinophils are both critical to the differentiation of M2 macrophages, and they also inhibit osteoclast formation.删除4：<u>16</u> TNF-α is a factor that promotes the formation of osteoclasts, and it also promotes the accumulation of IL-13-producing eosinophils to the focal joints. Although researchers have suggested that osteoclasts are not derived from activated M2 macrophages, osteoclasts isolated from mouse arthritis specimens possess the characteristics of M1 and M2 macrophages.删除4：<u>26</u> Thus, the differentiation of osteoclasts is highly dependent on the microenvironment in which the cells are located.\nThe regulation of the immune system on bone metabolism can be manifested as a dual role in reducing osteoclast formation and anti-bone resorption. For example, CD4+ FoxP3+ T cells are both effective suppressor cells for osteoclast differentiation, and they also exhibit certain anti-inflammatory effects. These cells directly inhibit the binding between CD80/cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4) required for osteoclast formation.删除4：<u>27</u> Another type of CD8-positive T cells reduces osteoclast formation by direct contact. These cells not only inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro but also inhibit bone destruction in RANKL-injected and ovariectomized mice.删除4：<u>28</u> Th1 cells are thought to play a role in promoting osteoclast formation because they also secrete RANKL.删除4：<u>29</u> At the same time, Th1 cells can also secrete IFN-γ, which inhibits this process.删除4：<u>30</u> CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells promote osteoclast differentiation by secreting RANKL, which is detected in large numbers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.删除4：<u>31</u> Therefore, IFN-γ produced by Th1 cells results in a direct and indirect inhibition of osteoclast formation.\nAs important immune cells, B cells play a role in not only inducing antigen-dependent T cells but also producing antibodies under healthy and infected conditions. Various effects mediated by B cells also include the secretion of cytokines and chemokines that mediate cell differentiation and inflammation, and are involved in the regulation of the RANK/RANKL/OPG system. Therefore, B lymphocytes play a key role in bone homeostasis, osteoclast formation, and osteogenesis.删除4：<u>32</u> Although research in 1998 demonstrated that B cells secrete anti-osteoclast factor OPG, historically, scholars believe that the main source of OPG is osteoblasts. Subsequent research has challenged this view. Researchers have found that B cells are the main source of OPG in mouse bone marrow (BM) under physiological conditions, accounting for 64% of total BM OPG production.删除4：<u>33</u> Under infection, B cells serve as an important source of the osteoclastogenesis factor RANKL.删除4：<u>34</u> In contrast, some scholars believe that B cells can inhibit the formation of osteoclasts by producing TGF-β and IFN-γ.删除4：<u>35</u> Overall, further research is needed to determine how B-cell-mediated immune responses are involved in the activation of osteoclasts in infection-related bone destruction.\nAntibiotic is a component of the treatment of traumatic bone infections, and it also has an important impact on bone metabolism. Antibiotic-loaded bone cement is widely used in the repair of traumatic bone defects. Gentamicin is an early antibiotic used in bone cement mixed preparations.

These cells not only inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro but also inhibit bone destruction in RANKL-injected and ovariectomized mice.删除4：<u>28</u> Th1 cells are thought to play a role in promoting osteoclast formation because they also secrete RANKL.删除4：<u>29</u> At the same time, Th1 cells can also secrete IFN-γ, which inhibits this process.删除4：<u>30</u> CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells promote osteoclast differentiation by secreting RANKL, which is detected in large numbers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.删除4：<u>31</u> Therefore, IFN-γ produced by Th1 cells results in a direct and indirect inhibition of osteoclast formation.\nAs important immune cells, B cells play a role in not only inducing antigen-dependent T cells but also producing antibodies under healthy and infected conditions. Various effects mediated by B cells also include the secretion of cytokines and chemokines that mediate cell differentiation and inflammation, and are involved in the regulation of the RANK/RANKL/OPG system. Therefore, B lymphocytes play a key role in bone homeostasis, osteoclast formation, and osteogenesis.删除4：<u>32</u> Although research in 1998 demonstrated that B cells secrete anti-osteoclast factor OPG, historically, scholars believe that the main source of OPG is osteoblasts. Subsequent research has challenged this view. Researchers have found that B cells are the main source of OPG in mouse bone marrow (BM) under physiological conditions, accounting for 64% of total BM OPG production.删除4：<u>33</u> Under infection, B cells serve as an important source of the osteoclastogenesis factor RANKL.删除4：<u>34</u> In contrast, some scholars believe that B cells can inhibit the formation of osteoclasts by producing TGF-β and IFN-γ.删除4：<u>35</u> Overall, further research is needed to determine how B-cell-mediated immune responses are involved in the activation of osteoclasts in infection-related bone destruction.\nAntibiotic is a component of the treatment of traumatic bone infections, and it also has an important impact on bone metabolism. Antibiotic-loaded bone cement is widely used in the repair of traumatic bone defects. Gentamicin is an early antibiotic used in bone cement mixed preparations. As bone cement is used more frequently, researchers have used mouse skulls to find that the use of gentamicin may result in inhibitory effect on bone tissue similar to its nephrotoxicity.删除4：<u>46</u> In another study using the C2C12 cell line as an osteoblast lineage, the researchers reduced the cell viability and alkaline phosphatase activity of cultured cells by topical application of high concentrations of gentamicin. Researchers also confirmed that gentamicin might be harmful to bone healing and repair in vivo.删除4：<u>47</u> Researchers applied different high-concentration antibiotics in the culture of primary human osteoblasts, and they measured the concentration of lactic acid in the cell culture supernatant as an indicator of glycolysis. The researchers observed that clindamycin, fluoroquinolone, linezolid, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, and tetracycline might produce cytotoxicity and a cytostatic effect on primary human osteoblasts by mitochondrial energy supply.删除4：<u>48</u> Vancomycin is a glycopeptide drug used in severe infections caused by drug-resistant strains. Researchers selected eight concentrations of 21 different types of antibiotics to stimulate osteoblasts, and they measured osteoblast deoxyribonucleic acid content and alkaline phosphatase activity to assess cell number and osteogenic activity. The results confirmed that amikacin, tobramycin, and vancomycin resulted in the least cytotoxicity, and high concentrations of drugs significantly affected cell proliferation and ALP activity. The data provide effective theoretical support for the local application of vancomycin in bone infections.删除4：<u>49</u>\nThe post-puberty phase of skeletal development is a critical period of plasticity, supporting approximately 40% of the peak bone mass. Hathaway-Schrader et al.50 reported that gut microbiota contribute to bone health. The team treated mice with a mixture of three antibiotics and found that antibiotic treatment led to changes in the intestinal microbiota of mice, which ultimately led to specific changes in the bacteria. As antibiotics destroy the intestinal microbiota, the researchers examined the integrity of the skeletal system and found that antibiotic-induced microflora changes exhibited little effect on cortical bone but caused high metabolic changes in trabecular bone. The results showed that after antibiotic treatment, osteoblast proliferation and differentiation did not change, while the number, size, and activity of osteoclasts increased. Further research deepened into the specific immune mechanisms of the bone marrow environment, demonstrating the effects of antibiotic treatment on bone marrow cells. By detecting immune cell populations in the bone marrow, the researchers found a significant increase in animal bone marrow-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the antibiotic-treated group. MDSCs can regulate innate and adaptive immune responses in a variety of diseases.\nDespite the direct effect of antibiotic toxicity on the bone cell line in bone infections, antibiotics should be absorbed mostly by the reduction of bacteria. Optimizing the route of administration and selecting sensitive antibiotics as soon as possible are critical in reducing the effects of its toxicity on cells.\nIn the past, many patients with traumatic bone infections eventually lost mobility due to severe bone destruction. Surgery is the only option for them. As the pathogenesis of traumatic-related inflammatory bone destruction is further revealed, especially in understanding the interrelationship between the immune system and the skeletal system, important advances have been made in the treatment of such diseases. For example, the use of the RANKL inhibitor Denosumab is based on the inhibition of excessive differentiation of osteoclasts in inflammatory bone destruction.删除4：<u>51</u> However, this treatment exhibits no anti-inflammatory effect, so it is also necessary to combine anti-inflammatory therapy. Several inhibitors of inflammatory factors are currently used to treat inflammatory diseases, including targeted inhibition of IL-1, IL-6R, IL-17, IL-12/23, and TNF-α. The TNF-α inhibitor exhibits both antiinflammatory and inhibitory functions of osteoclast formation. The IL-6R inhibitor, IL-12/23, and IL-17 inhibitor used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis all exhibit the above dual effects. IL-1 antagonists directly inhibit the differentiation and functional activation of osteoclasts while reducing the inflammatory response.删除4：<u>52</u> IL-1 inhibitors are mainly used in diseases where IL-1β is the main causative factor, such as gout.删除4：<u>53</u> Another small molecule inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammatory corpuscle has also been used in many mouse disease models, demonstrating that inflammatory corpuscles are also an effective target for such diseases, but there are no clinical reports of such drugs.删除4：<u>54</u> Drugs that regulate the acquired immune response, especially those that regulate T cell activity, also exhibit a function of effectively regulating bone resorption. For example, CTLA4 expressed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis inhibits osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting T cell activation and binding to osteoclast precursor cells.删除4：<u>55</u>\nIn general, the immune system is closely involved in the disease process of the skeletal system, and complex communication between the two systems needs to be further elucidated. The study of immune pathways regulating bone metabolism has been conducted to help us better understand these diseases. The development of basic research promoted the advancement of therapeutics, such as targeted therapy of cytokines in pathogenic factors, which can selectively resolve the cause, reduce the inflammation, delay the bone resorption, and thus treat the infection-related bone destruction.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2020.05.009</u>", "index": 19454, "show": true, "start": 19441, "end": 19504, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:30:22", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:31:14", "cost": 51.753}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:29", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:31:13", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:30:21"}

Due to the need to obtain a line of sight by aligning oral, laryngeal, and pharyngeal axes, however, the intubation with a DL is a complex technical skill.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> It is reported that the intubation success rate with a DL is only 50% in novices and a success rate of 90% cannot be expected until fifty intubations have been performed.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Thus, difficulty in intubation with a DL is a common problem in clinical practice, and complications associated with intubation using a DL are the main causes of perioperative morbidity and mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u>\nAdvancements in science and technology have made a possibility to develop the alternative indirect devices that can acquire the laryngeal view through a mini camera placed at the blade tip, transmitting it to a video monitor independent of the line of sight. This has led to the development of videolaryngoscope (VL). Unlike DL, VL can enable the intubators to visualize the glottis indirectly, with a wide viewing angle and without the need for alignment of the airway axes. Thus, VL has been seen as a revolutionary step in intubation technology and resulted in the striking changes on airway management strategy.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> As yet, there are a number of commercial VLs available, with the number constantly increasing and many existing devices being modified. The features of each particular VL may offer advantages or disadvantages, depending on the situations the clinicians have to manage.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The aim of this study was to describe the features of a new VL, UEscope, and provide clinical evidences regarding efficacy and safety of this device in adult tracheal intubation and its roles in modern airway management teaching according to the literatures published in the past 5 years.\nUEscope was created by the Zhejiang UE Medical Corp. (Zhejiang, China) and introduced into clinical practice in 2010. Before 2012, this device was named as HC VL. Since 2013, it was renamed as UEscope and has been available in the Asian, American, and European markets. UEscope is a VL with angulated blade or Miller blade available for use in patients from neonates to large adults and can provide high-quality, magnified airway images on a 2.5-inch portable color monitor 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. The main design features are portable and ergonomic. The overall height and weight are <20 cm and <200 g, respectively. A streamlined slim handle makes it very easy to be manipulated by intubators. All-angle adjustable monitor may not only improve flexibility of device insertion, but also can make UEscope easily viewable for teaching, training, and educational purposes.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> Moreover, its monitor is attached on the top of the handle, allowing the operator to focus on patient’s face and monitor simultaneously.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Bayonet connection between the handle and monitor can effectively prevent their disconnection and image interruption. In addition, UEscope has functional design for saving intubation pictures and video images as a digital airway recorder.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>\nUEscope has reusable and disposable device designs which are commercially available. A monitor can be used for all devices. The reusable device consists of an angulated blade with the handle and a monitor.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> There are four-size reusable angulated blades 通用删除7(英):<u>(1–4)</u> and two-size Miller blades (0 and 1) available. The reusable blades have a water-tight design and may be disinfected in hygienic traps. The edges of the blade are slanted to avoid damage to the upper airway.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> The disposable device includes three main parts: the handle with camera stick, monitor, and transparent angulated plastic blade sheath. The camera is installed on the tip of the camera stick. The disposable plastic blade sheath can cover the camera stick completely, in such a way that no part of camera stick comes in direct contact with patient’s mouth. Currently, UEscope has three-size disposable angulated blade sheaths (sizes 2–4). The reusable blade has an effective build-in anti-fog mechanism with multiple heating elements, and the disposable plastic blade sheath has a special anti-fog coating on its anterior transparent window.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>\nThe angulated blade design of UEscope is significantly different from those of sharply angulated VLs, such as Glidescope (Verathon Medical, Bothell, WA, USA), McGrath (Aircraft Medical, Edinburgh, Scotland), and Storz D-Blade (KARL STORZ Endoscopy, Tuttlingen, Germany) devices. The upward angle of UEscope blade is about 40°, which is larger than that of Macintosh DL, but less than that of Glidescope, McGrath, and Storz D-Blade VLs 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. Especially, Glidescope blade is curved upward with a 60° angle in the midline and the camera is located at a marked inflection point from which the distal portion of blade continues straightforward for another 58 mm.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Due to a 60° angle curvature of Glidescope blade, the field of view of camera located at the inflection point is not wide enough to cover the tangent of distal half of the blade, resulting in a blind area below the blade tip, which is 2 mm or 13 mm in the small- or medium-sized blades of original Glidescope VL, respectively.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> The Storz D-Blade VL is more acutely angulated than Glidescope device, and the optical component is carried more distally than it is on Glidescope device.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> The sharply angled blade is helpful to insert the device around the anatomic curve of the upper airway and to provide an improved laryngeal visualization by seeing \"around the corner\" in difficult airway situations.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> In fact, Glidescope, McGrath, and Storz D-Blade VLs are specially designed for managing difficult airways. However, relatively cumbersome and long handles of Glidescope and Storz D-Blade VLs can lead to difficulty in the device insertion.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,6]</u> Furthermore, the difference in their projected video images may present a challenge for tube passage for some intubators when using Storz D-Blade VL, particularly for those who are more experienced with the more proximal lens location of Glidescope device.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Since the video lens of Storz D-Blade VL is very close to the tip of the blade, it is also more difficult to position the tracheal tube in front of the glottis.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> When tracheal intubation is performed with sharply angulated VLs, thus, the ability to expose the larynx does not correlate with successful intubation, i.e. difficulty in passing the tube into the trachea through the glottis is a frequently troublesome problem.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> That is, a good laryngeal view does not always ensure easy intubation. This may be one of the reasons why they are useful for difficult intubations but slow down easy intubations.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>\nIn contrast, the location of UEscope’s camera and the inflection point of the blade are between Glidescope and Storz D-Blade VLs. As the camera’s field of vision covers the tangent of the distal half of blades, UEscope has no blind area below the blade tip and provides a panoramic view of the larynx, from above the epiglottis and posterior to the base of the tongue. These features of UEscope are designed for improvement of intubation performance and for use in normal and difficult airways.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,7,8,9,10]</u>\nJust as other angulated VLs, UEscope is inserted along the midline of the mouth, and no sweep of the tongue is required.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,7]</u> Once the blade is in the mouth, it is gradually moved in the midline along the tongue into the vallecula. Unlike DL, the blade position of UEscope is obtained by rotating the device around the natural curvature of the upper airway and it does not involve direct lifting of the tongue to obtain the best laryngeal view. If a poor laryngeal view is obtained, the optimization maneuver involves rocking the handle toward the intubators. After the larynx is adequately exposed, the styletted tracheal tube is inserted into the mouth along with the right side of the blade. When the tip of the tracheal tube reaches the glottis, the stylet is withdrawn and the tracheal tube is advanced downward into the trachea.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>\nFamiliarity with the nuances of UEscope is critical prior to use in patients, and intubators should be trained on the utilization of this device. One common mistake is to place the blade tip too close to the glottis, especially for novice intubator. Both withdrawing the blade slightly and providing more of a \"bird’s eye\" view allow more space for passage of tracheal tube and lessen the angle at which the tracheal tube must pass.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>\nAs the tracheal tube has to be introduced \"around the corner,\" a rigid stylet is recommended to preshape the tracheal tube to match the blade’s curvature. The manufacturer specifically supplies the bespoke stylets for adult patients with normal and difficult airways. In adult patients with a normal airway, Gao et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> show that both 40° and 60° angles of styletted tracheal tube may ensure successful intubation with UEscope, but a 60° angle stylet results in a higher first-attempt intubation success (FAIS) and a shorter intubation time (IT).\nTo minimize the risk of airway trauma during laryngoscopy and intubation with UEscope, a four-step technique is recommended.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> To facilitate insertion of the tube into the trachea, moreover, a slight rotation of the tracheal tube is required after removing the stylet in some cases.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>\nIn a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) including 600 adult patients, Wang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> compared the performance of UEscope and Macintosh DL and revealed that UEscope provided a better laryngeal view, a higher FAIS, and the shorter times required for laryngeal visualization and intubation, but the two devices were comparable in terms of intubation complications. Similarly, two RCTs in patients with a normal airway showed that the laryngeal visualization was improved and the need of cricoid pressure during laryngoscopy and times required for laryngeal visualization and intubation were decreased with UEscope compared to Macintosh DL, but the incidence of airway traumatic complications was not different between the two devices.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u>\nIn 100 patients aged 32–68 years, Yang通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> found that the laryngeal view and intubation success rate were not significantly different between UEscope and Macintosh DL, but IT was significantly shorter, and severity of postoperative sore throat (POST) was decreased with UEscope. In a RCT including 72 adult patients, Sun et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> demonstrated that an improved laryngeal view was obtained with UEscope, but IT and hemodynamic responses to intubation (HRTI) were not significantly different between UEscope and Macintosh DL.\nTwo RCTs in adult patients undergoing elective maxillofacial surgery and requiring nasotracheal intubation showed that, compared with Macintosh DL, UEscope provided a better laryngeal view, a less need of adjuncts, a higher FAIS, a shorter IT, and a weaker HRTI.通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24]</u>\nIn a RCT including 70 patients aged 18–60 years who underwent elective thoracic surgery, Gong et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> compared the placement of the double-lumen tube using UEscope and Macintosh DL and revealed that UEscope produced a better laryngeal view, but offered a longer IT. The time required for laryngeal visualization and HRTI were not significantly different between the two devices. Furthermore, they found that the cricoid pressure improved the success rate of the double-lumen tube placement with both devices.\nIn 80 patients aged 19–65 years who underwent elective thoracic surgery, Yang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> used the Macintosh DL as control to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UEscope for double-lumen tube placement and showed that the laryngeal visualization and intubation manipulations were easier, IT was shorter, and HRTI was weaker with UEscope, but airway traumatic complications were comparable between the two devices. In sixty adult patients undergoing general thoracic surgery, Hu通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> demonstrated that the left double-lumen tube placement using UEscope compared with Macintosh DL was associated with a shorter IT, a higher success rate of passing the tube into the targeted bronchia, and a lower incidence of POST, but HRTI did not significantly differ between the two devices.\nManagement of difficult airways is a challenge for anesthesiologists. Since the original aim of VL design is to solve a main issue of difficult airways, difficult intubation, it has rapidly become a first-line strategy for potential and/or encountered difficult intubations. In fact, most of the current algorithms for difficult airway management recommend VL as a rescue tool for difficult or failed intubation with a DL.通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29,30]</u> Hitherto, there have been many studies assessing the application and role of UEscope in difficult airway management.\nIn 40 patients with predicted difficult airways, Zeng et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> compared the tracheal intubation using UEscope and Macintosh DL and showed that an improved laryngeal view was obtained with UEscope, but intubation success rate, number of intubation attempts (NIA), and IT were comparable with the two devices. Interestingly, in four patients with failed intubation with Macintosh DL due to a Cormack and Lehane class 4, all rescuing intubations with UEscope were success.\nPatients with cervical spine injury often require the use of semirigid cervical collar or manual in-line stabilization (MILS) to prevent neck movements, which may cause the poor laryngeal visualization with a DL, leading to difficulty in intubation.通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33,34]</u> In a RCT including 120 patients aged 18–60 years with MILS, An et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> applied Macintosh DL as control device to assess the clinical efficacy of UEscope for orotracheal intubation. They showed that UEscope provided an improved laryngeal view, a higher intubation success rate, an easier intubation procedure, and a weaker HRTI, but resulted in a longer time required for laryngeal visualization. In contrast, three other RCTs comparing their intubation performance in patients with MILS showed that the IT was decreased with UEscope.通用删除6(英):<u>[35,36,37]</u> Furthermore, similar results were also obtained in high-level cervical spine injury patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> Thus, it is concluded that UEscope is a useful device for tracheal intubation in patients with cervical spine injury and MILS.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,35,36,37,38]</u>\nAirway management of obese patients is challenging because the obese body habitus can make mask ventilation and tracheal intubation technically difficult.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> In a RCT conducted on 80 obese patients aged 37–65 years with a body mass index >30 kg/m2, Wang and Zhang通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> compared the feasibility and safety of UEscope and Macintosh DL. They demonstrated that the FAIS was increased and incidences of airway traumatic complications and POST were decreased with UEscope, but HRTI did not significantly differ between the two devices.\nIn adult patients with predicted difficult airways who underwent cerebral aneurysm embolization, Liu et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> used the Macintosh DL as control device to evaluate performance and safety of UEscope. They found that UEscope decreased IT, attenuated HRTI, and reduced the incidence of POST and hoarseness.\nIn a RCT including 56 patients with known difficult airways due to severe post-burn scar contracture of the face and neck, Li et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> compared the clinical efficacy and safety of orotracheal intubation using UEscope and Macintosh DL. They showed that the laryngeal visualization was improved, intubation success rate was increased, and NIA and incidence of traumatic airway complications were decreased with UEscope. In five patients with failed intubation using a DL, moreover, successful intubation was achieved with UEscope. In 48 adult patients with difficult intubation using a DL, Wang and Xue通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> reported that UEscope improved the laryngeal visualization and achieved successful intubation in all patients.\nFinally, Yang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> compared the performance and safety of UEscope and Macintosh DL for nasotracheal intubation in seventy patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery with predicted difficult airways. They showed that UEscope improved laryngeal visualization, increased intubation success rate, and decreased NIA, IT, and needs of adjuncts.\nPatients requiring tracheal intubations in emergency department, intensive care unit, and prehospital setting are typical emergency conditions associated with hemodynamic disorders and respiratory crisis. Moreover, these patients often have a high risk of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation, even for the clinicians with adequate airway management skills. If inexperienced clinicians are responsible for managing the airway under such challenging situations, the risk of difficult laryngoscopy and intubation can be further compounded.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Thus, there is an increased incidence of complications during emergency intubation compared with elective intubation in the operating room.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Given that the goal of emergency intubation is FAIS, the use of VL in emergency airway management has significantly grown and been shown to increase FAIS, especially for patients with difficult airway predictors and those with failed attempts with a DL.通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45]</u>\nIn a RCT including 265 patients aged 16–81 years and requiring intubation in emergency department, Wang et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> compared the efficacy and safety of UEscope and Macintosh DL when intubation was performed by emergency attending physicians. They found that, in patients with a Cormack-Lehane class 3 or 4, UEscope was associated with significantly decreased times to laryngeal visualization and intubation, increased FAIS, and reduced incidences of traumatic airway complications and unintentional esophageal intubation. Furthermore, the results obtained by Pan et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> in 40 patients with a Cormack-Lehane class 3 or 4 and undergoing emergency intubation are the same as the findings of Wang et al.’ study.通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u>\nBy a RCT, Pan et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> evaluated the efficacy of UEscope and DL for emergency intubation by unskilled residents and experienced attending physicians. They showed that, when emergency intubation was performed with a DL, unskilled residents compared to experienced attending physicians had the lower rates of successful laryngeal visualization and FAIS, an increased NIA, a prolonged IT, and an increased incidence of intubation complications. When emergency intubation was performed with UEscope, however, these differences were no longer significant between unskilled and experienced clinicians. Thus, they conclude that UEscope can improve the unskilled emergency physicians’ competence for intubation. Furthermore, several RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of UEscope and DL for emergency intubation also demonstrated that UEscope provided a better laryngeal view, shorter times for laryngeal visualization and intubation, a higher intubation success rate, a better oxygenation, and a lower incidence of intubation complications.通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49,50,51,52]</u>\nIn 70 patients with cervical spine injury who required emergency intubation, Mao and Ling通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> compared UEscope and Macintosh DL and showed that UEscope improved laryngeal view, decreased IT, increased FAIS, and reduced traumatic airway complications. In a prehospital setting, two RCTs comparing the performance of UEscope and DL for emergency intubation demonstrate that laryngeal visualization is improved, times for laryngeal visualization and intubation are reduced, and FAIS and total intubation success rate are increased with UEscope.通用删除6(英):<u>[54,55]</u>\nThere are many VLs available and their efficacies maybe different among these devices due to various designs and shapes. To facilitate the suitable choice of these devices in airway management, comparing the performance of different devices in patients with various conditions is needed. In a RCT including 120 adult patients with MILS, An et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> showed that the time required for laryngeal visualization was decreased and the ease of orotracheal intubation was improved with UEscope compared to Glidescope VL.\nAll the four RCTs carried out in patients with normal airways demonstrate that the laryngeal views, IT, FAIS, and total intubation success rate are not significantly different between UEscope and Airtraq laryngoscope (Prodol, Vizcaya, Spain).通用删除6(英):<u>[56,57,58,59,60,61]</u> However, one of these trials finds that duration of heart rate increases after intubation with Glidescope VL and UEscope is longer than that with Airtraq laryngoscope, and the incidence of postoperative hoarseness and sore throat is significantly higher with Airtraq laryngoscope compared to Glidescope VL and UEscope.通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>\nWith the evidence available in favor of VL, most anesthetists will rely on the VLs when confronted with a difficult intubation.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> However, when patient is already anesthetized and the intubation with a VL fails, only a limited number of options remain and no uniformity of strategy to manage VL failure is recommended. The available evidence supports the usefulness of combined VL and other devices (including tube introducer, fiber optic bronchoscope [FOB], Bonfils intubation fiberscope, and Boedeker intubation forceps) in such difficult conditions.通用删除6(英):<u>[60,61,62,63]</u> There have also been some trials comparing the safety and efficacy of combined UEscope and other devices.\nIn a RCT including 90 adult patients with a normal airway, Zhao and An通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u> assessed the clinical performance and safety of combined FOB and UEscope for orotracheal intubation. The patients were randomly assigned to receive the FOB, UEscope, and a combination of FOB with UEscope for intubations. The results showed no significant differences among the three techniques in the NIA, and between UEscope and combined techniques in the times required for laryngeal visualization and intubation. However, times required for laryngeal visualization and intubation were significantly longer when using a FOB technique than when using a combined technique. In elderly patients with Mallampati airway class 3 or 4, He et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> used the UEscope as control to evaluate the clinical value of combined UEscope and FOB for orotracheal intubation and found that the times required for laryngeal visualization and intubation, NIA, HRTI, incidences of airway traumatic complications, and POST were decreased with a combined technique. In patients aged 20–60 years with a predicted difficult airway, He通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> showed that, compared to the FOB technique, combined FOB and UEscope decreased the times required for laryngeal visualization and intubation, NIA, and incidence of airway traumatic complications, but the two techniques were comparable with respect to HRTI. In patients with cervical spine immobilization who required nasotracheal intubation, combined UEscope and FOB provides a higher FAIS, a shorter IT, and a lower incidence of POST than the FOB technique.通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u>\nIn adult patients with predicted difficult intubations, Shan et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u> assessed the clinical application of combined rigid bronchoscope and UEscope and showed that combined technique was superior to individual use of UEscope in terms of IT, NIA, and incidence of POST, but the two techniques were similar in terms of HRTI. In 80 adult patients with predicted difficult airways, moreover, Liu et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u> assessed the clinical performance of combined FOB and UEscope for double-lumen tube placement. They demonstrated that, compared to the FOB technique, combined technique provided an easier procedure, a higher FAIS, a weaker HRTI, and a lower incidence of POST.\nTeaching tracheal intubation with a DL involving the line-of-sight techniques is difficult because the teacher cannot share the airway images with student. In contrast, VL provides a shared view for teacher and student, i.e. the high-quality, magnified airway images on VL monitor allow teachers to explain the anatomy of the upper airway and procedures of laryngoscopy and intubation to students. Furthermore, when a student is endeavoring intubation, a teacher can see the video monitor and provide a feedback.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>\nDue to a portable design and an all-angle adjustable high-resolution video monitor with recording function, UEscope has extensively been used for tracheal intubation teaching and shown a number of advantages.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,70,71,72,73]</u> First, UEscope allows for skill training on simulator outside operating room, reducing the potential risk for patient injury when the student has only rudimentary skill.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Second, UEscope is a better educational tool than the \"look over my shoulder\" training method and allows the teacher to see in detail what the student is doing while performing intubation. Third, when the training is performed in the operating room, because the airway images can be seen by the teacher and student, and the procedure can be optimized in real time, it is more likely that the students can complete a tracheal intubation themselves without teacher taking over. This is especially useful for rapid sequence inductions and in patients at the risks of hypoxia and aspiration.通用删除6(英):<u>[74]</u> Fourth, during airway management training, the shared view on monitor can create a dynamic interaction, which facilitates teamwork and communication of the whole training team. This may stimulate enthusiasm of the students to learn intubation skill, improving the quality and outcomes of airway management training. Fifth, the ability to record the intubation as a \"digital airway recorder\" is useful for training as it allows the teacher to review with a student at leisure.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>\nThe available evidence shows that the visual intubation teaching method with the UEscope is superior to traditional teaching method with a DL in terms of the training outcomes and satisfaction grades of students. Furthermore, acquisition of intubation skill with the UEscope by novice anesthesiologists is easier than attainment of intubation skill with a DL.通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u> In addition, training novice anesthesiologists in intubation skill with a DL is more effective when using UEscope than when using Macintosh DL.通用删除6(英):<u>[72]</u>\nAlthough VL is initially designed as difficult intubation device, nothing can guarantee intubation success. The current airway assessment is predicated on difficult intubation with a DL, but a predicated difficult intubation with a DL does not mean that intubation with a VL will be difficult and vice versa.通用删除6(英):<u>[73]</u> Thus, it is important to take all the essential steps to maximize FAIS, especially for patients with difficult airways and emergency conditions.通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45]</u> One key of such steps is choosing the best tool for the job. It is suggested that the optimal VL should be offered to all patients and not only in those considered most difficult. This will provide the best care in any condition, assuring an acquirement in the experience and competence with techniques and an improvement in the comprehension of their limitations and value.通用删除6(英):<u>[74]</u> Recently, the use of VL as a standard care to replace DL for all tracheal intubations has been appealed by airway experts.通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u>\nThe available evidence shows that, compared with a DL, UEscope provides an improved laryngeal view, a decreased IT, and an increased intubation success rate in adult patients with normal and difficult airways. These findings are somewhat different from the results of previous publications regarding other angulated VLs, such as Glidescope device; they can improve laryngeal visualization in patients with normal and difficult airways, but there are no conclusive benefits with regard to IT and intubation success, especially for patients with normal airways.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u> Typically, they are useful for difficult intubations, but slow down easy intubations; they are associated with a higher intubation success rate and a faster IT only for unskilled intubators, but provide no benefit in either of these outcomes with skilled intubators.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,76,77,78]</u> Furthermore, a comparative study in patients with cervical spine immobilization shows that the time for laryngeal visualization is decreased and the ease of intubation is improved with UEscope when compared with Glidescope VL.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Accordingly, we reckon that UEscope may provide more benefits than other angulated VLs in patients with normal and difficult airways.\nWhen comparing these findings of UEscope and other VLs obtained from different studies, however, there are several important considerations. First, the brand and blade design of VL have been shown to affect suitability for various clinical indications, the use of adjuncts, and volume of the oropharynx within which to maneuver. Moreover, slight design modification may significantly change the success rate and IT with VLs.通用删除6(英):<u>[79,80]</u> Thus, different designs may be attributable to more benefits with UEscope. Second, all the available trials comparing the performance of UEscope and DL are executed in Chinese patients. It is unclear whether these findings can be generalized into non-Chinese patients. Third, some of the clinical trials comparing UEscope with DL lack the definitions of competence for intubators. It is thus unclear whether different learning curves of studied devices would have been attributable to the study conclusions. Fourth, there are inconsistent conclusions as to whether or not UEscope is less likely to be stressful and traumatic than the DL, especially for patients with difficult airways. Fifth, there are many VLs available, but only few clinical trials have compared the clinical performance of UEscope with Glidescope VL and Airtraq laryngoscope. Thus, the lack of enough evidence gives overall recommendations as to the choice of these devices in various airway conditions. Sixth, some of the clinical trials comparing UEscope with DL have small clinical sample sizes and are not very powerful to provide clinical evidence.\nAs a new intubation tool, UEscope has several interesting features including the intermediate blade curvatures, the blades available for use from neonates to large adults, a compact overall size, a low weight, all-angle adjustable high-resolution monitor, effective anti-fog mechanisms, and built-in video recording function. These features make the use of UEscope very appealing. With a number of clinical studies published in the recent years, its roles in airway management and education have been well established. The available evidence supports that UEscope can be used as a primary intubation tool, particularly when the intubators have less experience of airway management and when preoperative airway screening suggests intubation difficult. However, some open questions remain: is UEscope the best care for all patients, including non-Chinese patients? Other than the limited mouth open, are there other causes of difficult intubation with UEscope? Can such difficulties be predicted preoperatively? Is intubation with UEscope less likely to be stressful and traumatic? To address these issues, more comparative studies with large samples are still needed.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:46:11", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:46:41", "cost": 29.687}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:46:41", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:46:11"}

Patients with atrial fibrillation and hypertension have an even higher risk of stroke than patients with either disease alone,通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u> mainly because of the increased risk of embolic stroke associated with atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation is effective in the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, regardless of whether warfarin or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are used. However, in China, anticoagulation is underused as a treatment for atrial fibrillation because of the high cost and the risk of bleeding.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Some advanced invasive techniques have proven to be particularly effective in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, the success rate for persistent atrial fibrillation is low.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>\nAntihypertensive therapy significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications in patients with hypertension. In patients with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure reduction is associated with a lower risk of major bleeding, especially in those receiving anticoagulant therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u> Recent researches showed that intensive antihypertensive treatment in patients with hypertension at high cardiovascular risk had the potential to reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13,14]</u> However, few studies have investigated intensive antihypertensive treatment in patients with hypertension and atrial fibrillation.\nStatins are widely used in hypertensive patients with cardiovascular risk factors to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> In the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA) study in hypertensive patients with at least 3 other cardiovascular risk factors but without apparent elevation of serum total cholesterol (<6.5 mmol/L), adding atorvastatin 10 mg daily to the treatment regimen was associated with a 36% reduction in the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease and a 27% reduction in the incidence of fatal and non-fatal stroke.通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17,18]</u> The presence of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients with hypertension was associated with a significantly higher cardiovascular risk after adjusting for serum total cholesterol.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> A recent meta-analysis of observational studies showed that statin therapy was associated with 41% and 25% lowering of risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Thus, patients with both hypertension and atrial fibrillation may not only benefit from statin therapy but also require even higher dosages of statins.\nTherefore, we have designed the Intensive Management of Blood PRESSure and Cholesterol in Elderly Chinese Patients with Hypertension and Atrial FibrillatION (IMPRESSION) trial to investigate whether intensive management of blood pressure and cholesterol would further prevent composite adverse outcomes, including non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death.\nThe present study is designed as a multi-center, 2×2 factorial, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint study. Eligible elderly (≥65 years) patients with both hypertension and atrial fibrillation will be randomly assigned into one of the 4 intervention arms: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> intensive blood pressure and cholesterol management; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> intensive blood pressure and less intensive blood cholesterol management; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> less intensive blood pressure and intensive blood cholesterol management; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> less intensive blood pressure and cholesterol management. Randomized patients are scheduled for a follow-up by the end of the first month and every 3 months thereafter.\nThe study participants will be recruited from community dwellers through a screening procedure. Eligible participants are men and women aged ≥65 years who meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria as follows: Major inclusion criteria include the presence of hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Hypertension is defined as a clinical blood pressure of 140-179/90-109 mmHg in untreated patients and 140-159/90-99 mmHg in patients treated with monotherapy or combination therapy of 2 low-dose antihypertensive drugs. Atrial fibrillation is defined as a newly diagnosed case by 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) or a previously documented diagnosis of atrial fibrillation with either sinus or atrial fibrillation rhythm. Details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 1.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria.\n删除重复语句：<u>Inclusion and exclusion criteria.</u>\nECG: Electrocardiogram; HbA1c: Glycosylated hemoglobin.\nPotentially eligible residents will be invited to undergo an atrial fibrillation screening procedure. During the screening visit, a single-lead (lead I) ECG will be recorded for 30 seconds with a handheld ECG device (Kardia Mobile®, Mountain View, California, USA). Every ECG rhythm will be reviewed by a cardiologist from the research team. In each center, approximately 1200 individuals will be screened for the recruitment of 30 patients with both hypertension and atrial fibrillation. At the screening visit (2 weeks before randomization), an initial assessment of selection criteria will be performed based on clinical history to determine eligibility. Potentially eligible patients will be invited to participate in the study. After informed consent is obtained, the patient will enter a run-in period, during which a 7-day home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) will be performed with an automated oscillometric blood pressure monitor (Omron HEM-9200T, Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan). If the participant is still eligible after a 2-week run-in period, he or she will have the following information collected and measurements performed, including full medical history, physical examinations, blood and urine sampling, office blood pressure measurement (OBPM), and an ECG examination. Blood measurements included routine tests, serum sodium, potassium and chloride, plasma glucose, and serum lipids, liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), creatinine, and uric acid. A urine dipstick test will be performed for spot urine sampling. Cognitive function will be assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination, and frailty will be assessed using the frailty index scale.通用删除6(英):<u>[21,22]</u>\nAt each study site, the investigator will arrange a randomization visit within 1 month of the screening period. After stratification for age (≥75 years vs. <75 years), sex, and center, eligible patients will be randomized into one of the 4 intervention arms: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> intensive blood pressure and cholesterol management using a combination of amlodipine/atorvastatin 5/20 mg/day and allisartan tablets 240 mg/day; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> intensive blood pressure and less intensive blood cholesterol management using a combination of amlodipine/atorvastatin 5/10 mg/day and allisartan tablets 240 mg/day; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> less intensive blood pressure and intensive blood cholesterol management using amlodipine/atorvastatin 5/20 mg/day; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> less intensive blood pressure and cholesterol management using amlodipine/atorvastatin 5/10 mg/day 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nAntihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs will be provided by the trial at no cost to the participants. Other antihypertensive drugs will not be allowed to be used during the follow-up, unless the participants have an office blood pressure ≥150/90 mmHg at a follow-up visit. In this case, antihypertensive agents other than calcium-channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ie, a thiazide diuretic, a β-blocker, an α-blocker, or spironolactone) will be allowed.\nAll randomized participants will be asked for a follow-up by the end of the first month after randomization and every 3 months thereafter. A 7-day HBPM will be performed before every clinic visit. For safety reasons, serum liver transaminase (ALT and AST), creatinine, uric acid, sodium, potassium, chloride, and creatine kinase will be measured at the first month visit. Serum lipids will be measured at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.

Meanwhile, the secondary outcomes will include all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, coronary artery revascularization, peripheral artery revascularization, transient ischemic stroke, and end-stage renal disease.\nAdverse events (AEs), including events observed by an investigator or reported by the participant, will be recorded on the AE form during follow-up. Serious AEs (SAEs) will be reported to the coordinating center and other authorities within 24 hours of the event. All AEs marked possibly, probably, or definitely related will be considered as related to the intervention. All SAE reports will be assessed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) chair monthly and at the DSMB meetings every 6 months. The DSMB will be in charge of protecting trial participants and monitoring trial data, including identifying any tendency, such as increases in unexpected events. The DSMB will take proper action where necessary.\nThe sample size was estimated based on the potential benefits the antihypertensive combination therapy brings. According to previously published reports, the event rate per year of ischemic stroke could be up to 5.3% in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with an average age of 70 years. To estimate the sample size, we have assumed a 5% event rate per year of the composite primary outcome in patients with hypertension and atrial fibrillation, including non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death.通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24,25]</u> If a 25% effect rate corresponds to a 10 mmHg between-group difference in systolic blood pressure in the intensive antihypertensive therapy group,通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u> an alpha of 0.05 (2-sided t test), and a power (1-beta) of 80% is assumed, with a dropout rate of 20% during the study period, at least 481 subjects per study group was considered necessary, for a total of 1200 randomized patients. The sample size will offer 80% power for 25% effect rate corresponding to a 0.90 mmol/L between-group difference, or 60% power for 20% effect rate corresponding to a 0.72 mmol/L between-group difference in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration in the intensive blood cholesterol-lowering group.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>\nData collected at the participating center will be documented in an electronic case report form (e-CRF) on the trial website. Files containing data from device-based examinations (HBPM data and ECG recordings) will also be uploaded to the trial website linked to the study e-CRF for further analysis by the coordinating center. Clinical data including demographics, blood and urine laboratory tests (ie, serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), fasting plasma glucose, serum uric acid, Na+, K+, and lipids, and urinary sediment), and AE forms during follow-up will be uploaded to the e-CRF.\nClinical data and raw data from device-based examinations acquired by various techniques will be uploaded in the e-CRF and on the study website supervised by the Data Management Coordinating Center, including an audit trail system. The quality of data acquired with these examinations (ie, ECG, OBPM, and HBPM) will be validated by an expert at the coordinating center. Cardiovascular events (ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, other major cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular and all-cause death) and renal outcomes reported by the investigators and supported by clinical documents (ie, diagnostic tests and medical reports) will be adjudicated by a committee of clinical experts, who will be blinded to the assigned treatment groups, blood pressure levels, and organ damage measurements.\nFor descriptive analyses, categorical data will be presented as frequencies and continuous data as means ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range). For inferential analyses, statistics will be at the 5% probability level, unless stated otherwise. Unpaired t-test (or Mann-Whitney U test in case of non-normal distribution) for continuous variables will be applied to evaluate significant between-group differences for primary and secondary outcomes. The incidence of AEs will be classified by the treatment group. All these analyses will be performed by treatment group, and for the study population as a whole.\nThe risk ratio model will be used to compare the incidence of composite primary outcomes between intensive and less intensive antihypertensive and lipid-lowering groups. Target organ damage will also be compared between intensive and less intensive antihypertensive and lipid-lowering groups using 2-way analysis of variance for continuous variables and the Chi-square test for categorical variables. Subgroup analyses can be performed for the primary endpoint according to age, sex, or other major baseline characteristics.\nThe IMPRESSION study protocol has initially obtained approval from the Ethics Committee of Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. All study centers in this study will apply for approval from the Ethics Review Committees and/or Institution Review Board in their hospitals. The procedures set out in this protocol, including the conduct, evaluation, and documentation, are designed to ensure that the sponsor and investigator abide by the Good Clinical Practice guidelines and follow the guiding principles detailed in the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThe trial commenced screening and recruitment on 15 December 2019 in 43 participating hospitals. As of January 2021, 3907 patients have been enrolled in the screening. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 4.6% (95% CI: 3.9%-5.3%, n= 181), including 4.5% (95% CI: 3.9%-5.2%) with known atrial fibrillation either in atrial fibrillation rhythm (2.6%, 95% CI: 2.1%-3.1%, n= 103) or sinus rhythm (1.9%, 95% CI: 1.5%- 2.3%, n= 75) and 0.1% (95% CI: 0.01%-0.2%) with newly detected and ECG-confirmed atrial fibrillation (n= 3). Of these 181 patients with atrial fibrillation, 15 patients were randomized into the trial because they had hypertension and met all inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trial. Screening and recruitment are estimated to continue until 2022. After completion of the enrolment, the IMPRESSION team will focus on the follow-up of the participants, ensuring treatment adherence and high-quality data collection, monitoring safety, and collecting and adjudicating trial endpoints.\nThe IMPRESSION trial targets a group of high-risk patients with both hypertension and atrial fibrillation and aims to determine whether intensive management of blood pressure and cholesterol provides more cardiovascular protection. The findings of this trial will support better patient-centered management plans for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in individuals and provide significant clinical evidence for statins in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 09:55:44", "endTime": "2024/10/09 09:58:13", "cost": 149.289}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 17:58:13", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 17:55:43"}

There are many reports on the effect of rapamycin (RPM) on the treatment of carcinogenesis. The goal of this study was to test whether RPM could enhance the susceptibility of both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate carcinoma cells to DOC.Methods Prostate cancer (PC) cell lines (LNCap, PC3 and AILNCap) were cultured and treated with RPM and DOC alone or in combination. The effects of therapeutic agents on cells were determined by the WST-1 assay. Apoptosis induction was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. The apopcyto caspase colorimetric assay kit was applied to measure the activities of caspases 3 and 9. The antitumor effects of RPM and DOC against PC cells were also assessed in nude mice using four randomized groups: control, RPM, DOC and combination drug therapy by measuring tumor size. All the animals tolerated both RPM and DOC without significant weight loss.Results RPM and DOC caused dosage-dependent growth suppression of PC cells. RPM could increase the susceptibility of PC cells to DOC significantly, and combined treatment with RPM and DOC caused synergistic growth suppression in all examined PC cell lines by isobolographic analysis. Both RPM and DOC significantly induced apoptosis in a dosage-dependent manner. RPM (10 nmol/L), DOC (1 nmol/L), and combined treatment induced apoptosis rate were 8%, 17% and 38%, respectively (the control was 2%). RPM could promote the apoptosis induced by DOC in PC cell lines. Both RPM and DOC significantly increased the caspase activity in a dosage-dependent manner. The relative activities of caspase 9 in control, RPM, DOC and RPM+DOC groups were 0.22±0.02, 0.36±0.06, 0.47±0.05 and 0.84±0.08, respectively. The relative activities of cespase 3 were 0.21±0.02, 0.24±0.05, 0.42±0.06 and 0.81±0.09, respectively. Either RPM or DOC alone significantly inhibited the growth of PC cells in nude mice compared to the control. The combination of RPM and DOC produced a significant reduction in tumor volume when compared to RPM or DOC alone. After 5-week treatment, the tumor sizes of LNCap in control, RPM, DOC and RPM+DOC groups were (570±56) mm~3, (412±41) mm~3, (425±46) mm~3 and (221±26) mm~3, respectively.Conclusions RPM could significantly increase the susceptibility of both androgen-dependent and -independent PC cells to DOC; the synergy of RPM and DOC was demonstrated. RPM enhanced the DOC-induced upregulation of caspase activity, resulting in an increasing number of cells in sub-G1 phases. The synergy of the combined treatment might be observed in both androgen-dependent and -independent PC cell lines。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:34:54", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:35:18", "cost": 24.281}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:35:17", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:34:53"}

Subsequently, two independent research teams identified a short-secreted peptide that binds to APJ and named it elabela/Toddler.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u> The gene AK092578, which encodes the elabela protein, is a non-coding RNA located on chromosome 4.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> The precursor peptide of elabela consists of 54 amino acids and is highly conserved in mammals. Elabela-54 is cleaved to generate a mature elabela-32 peptide with two conserved di-arginine motifs, resulting in further processing into elabela-2 or elabela-11 by furin-like endopeptidase 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Different elabela isoforms may have different functions, of which elabela-32 is the most studied at present.\nHowever, evidences indicate that apelin and elabela may not bind to APJ in the same way. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that C-terminal moiety (Arg28, Val29, Pro30, Phe31, and Pro32) and His26 residues of elabela were most important for receptor binding,通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> whereas the key pharmacophores (Arg2, Pro3, Arg4, and Leu5) of apelin-13 are primarily located at the N-terminal. A regulatory role for elabela/apelin-APJ axis has been shown in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology, thus making it a potential target for cardiovascular drug discovery.\nTo gain further insight into the relevance of elabela/apelin-APJ axis in blood pressure regulation, investigators have examined the expression of the axis in both patients with hypertension and animal models of hypertension. The results point to a critical role of elabela/apelin-APJ axis in regulating vascular tone during the development of hypertension, indicating predictive and therapeutic value of elabela/apelin-APJ axis in hypertension. Notably, a marked decrease in circulating elabela and apelin levels were observed in patients with essential hypertension and general hypertension 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u> In addition, elabela has been demonstrated to cause vasodilation in coronary arteries通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> to reverse vasopressor responses during pulmonary arterial hypertension and Ang II-induced hypertension 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> Moreover, continued elabela treatment and elabela gene therapy effectively delayed elevation of blood pressure levels in hypertensive rats 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Mechanistically, elabela-induced relaxation in isolated mouse aorta could not be abolished in the presence of nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor (ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester [L-NAME]), suggesting a NO-independent mechanism in the relaxation response to elabela.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> As a result, the specific mechanisms following elabela activation warrant detailed investigation in future studies in the context of hypertension.\nRegulatory roles of the elabela/apelin-APJ axis in hypertension and related diseases.\n删除重复语句：<u>Regulatory roles of the elabela/apelin-APJ axis in hypertension and related diseases.</u>\nADMA: Asymmetric dimethylarginine; AKT: Protein kinase B; Ang II: Angiotensin II; APJ: Apelin receptor; ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ICR: Institute of Cancer Research; KO: Knock out; mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin; NO: Nitric oxide; PASMCs: Pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Pro-BNP: Pro-brain natriuretic peptide; RAS: Renin-angiotensin system; VSMCs: Vascular smooth muscle cells.\nIntraperitoneal injection of apelin has been implicated in downregulation of both systolic and diastolic pressure levels in anesthetized normotensive animals 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> Shortly thereafter, intravenous administration of apelin was shown to cause hypotensive effects通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> and venodilation.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> Apelin administration increased NO production in hypertensive mice and rats.通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23]</u> The blood pressure-lowering effects of apelin were blocked by L-NAME. The studies revealed that apelin inhibited the calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> and abrogated abnormal Ang II-induced contraction in intra-renal arteries from diabetic mice through increasing phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1 and Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> These findings suggested that apelin promotes vasodilation via a NO-dependent mechanism. Moreover, apelin promotes vasodilation via a prostanoid-dependent mechanism, as apelin administration promotes vasodilation in human mammary arteries, and this vasodilation can be abolished by cyclooxygenase inhibitor.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u>\nThe renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key pathway in the development and progression of hypertension. It has been reported that administration of exogenous elabela-32 significantly lowered systolic blood pressure levels in hypertensive rats, accompanied with a reduction of Ang II and prorenin/renin excretion, supporting the antagonistic interaction between elabela and intrarenal RAS 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2 and Figure 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Apelin-induced vasodilation and depressor responses are preserved during RAS activation both in healthy humans and in patients with heart failure.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>\nFurthermore, activation of the elabela/apelin-APJ axis has an antagonistic effect toward AT1R-mediated responses, either by forming heterodimers with the receptor or by increasing NO-dependent signaling 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[29,30]</u> APJ is often co-expressed with AT1R and functions as an endogenous counter-regulator in the blood vessel wall.通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31]</u> Both mRNA and protein levels of APJ were reduced in heart, kidney, and aorta of hypertensive rats 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33]</u> APJ can form heterodimers with bradykinin receptors, neurotensin receptor-1, and κ-opioid receptors,通用删除6(英):<u>[30,34,35,36]</u> all of which are involved in cardiovascular regulation and all of whose ligands are sensitive to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteolysis,通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> implying that homodimers-oligomers of APJ could possibly mediate different signaling events in comparison to APJ monomers.\nMost available evidences indicate that apelin plays a significant role in lowering blood pressure in hypertensive animal models. Nonetheless, several studies have reported the effect of systemic administration of apelin on blood pressure elevation. For instance, a brief initial decrease in arterial pressure was observed after intravenous administration of apelin in conscious sheep, followed by increased arterial pressure and peripheral vascular resistance 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> The biphasic hemodynamic response is possibly related to the use of high-dose apelin, and to the compensatory response caused by the rapid decrease in blood pressure. Apelin may also cause concentration-dependent vasoconstriction in isolated caudal arteries when endothelial cells are damaged by asymmetric dimethylarginine 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[39,40]</u> In L-NAME-treated mice, apelin has been found to induce elevated levels of systolic blood pressure by activating APJ on VSMCs, while endothelial cells are dysfunctional.通用删除6(英):<u>[40,41]</u> Based on the vascular bed and underlying conditions, apelin may cause either vasodilation or vasoconstriction.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> These dual actions of apelin are attributed to the presence of APJ in both the endothelial and smooth muscle cell layers of blood vessel walls and the integrity of endothelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[40,42,43]</u> Notably, apelin-mediated vasoconstriction was significantly elevated in the presence of an α1-adrenergic receptor (α1-AR) agonist while it was significantly decreased in APJ-overexpression but α1-AR-deficient mice.通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> These results indicate that the interaction between APJ and α1-AR is an important and complex mechanism contributing to vasoconstriction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying apelin-induced vasoconstriction are poorly understood, and the downstream signaling of heterodimerization between APJ and α1-AR merits further investigation.\nIn addition, apelin may act on the central nervous system to regulate peripheral vascular function. The increased expression of apelin gene was found in rostral ventrolateral medulla of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Subsequently, overexpression of apelin in rostral ventrolateral medulla of normotensive rats was demonstrated to increase mean arterial blood pressure through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-dependent superoxide formation 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[45,46]</u> Central apelin promotes vasoconstriction through increasing myosin light chain phosphorylation via Gαi/o-dependent activation of protein kinase C and Na+-Ca2+ exchange-dependent pathways 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u> Vasopressor responses to apelin have been observed following injection of the peptide into cardiovascular regulatory regions of the brain.通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49]</u> In conscious rats, intracerebroventricular and intravenous administration of apelin caused a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial pressure, but the peripheral effects of apelin were relatively weak compared to its central effects, and central regulatory mechanisms of blood pressure are mainly related to the neurohormonal mechanism and sympathetic nervous system 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> The reason for these discrepancies of apelin in blood pressure regulation is unclear. However, possible explanations are as follows. The pressor response to intravenous injection of apelin may be related to the direct effect of apelin on the heart or peripheral sympathetic nervous system. Another possible explanation may be related to experiment conditions: as the injection is implemented in the context of no anesthesia, the blood pressure levels of rats will definitely increase under stress.\nIn addition, apelin inhibits NO-induced activation of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (BKCa) channels in cerebral artery smooth muscle cells, which may be another mechanism leading to vasoconstriction 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[43,50]</u> In intracerebroventricular administration, elabela binds and activates APJ, resulting in arginine vasopressin release and enhanced PI3K-AKT phosphorylation, consequently raising blood pressure, which may further cause cardiovascular remodeling 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>\nConsistent with its critical roles in blood pressure regulation, the elabela/apelin-APJ axis exhibits potent effects in the development and severity of hypertensive diseases. Endogenous elabela levels were reduced in hypertensive patients associated with hypertension-related vascular damage.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Intriguingly, in our previously published works, we revealed the Ang II-mediated apoptosis and autophagy imbalance in rat aortic adventitial fibroblasts, leading to vascular injury and remodeling, which could be dramatically reversed by pretreatment with elabela.通用删除6(英):<u>[16,51,52]</u> We also found that hypertensive patients with heart failure with higher plasma elabela levels had a better major adverse cardiac event-free survival than those with lower plasma elabela levels, implying that decreased plasma elabela levels in hypertensive patients were closely associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> In a rat model of pulmonary hypertension, administration of exogenous elabela improves right ventricular systolic pressure levels and pulmonary vascular remodeling.通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u> Elabela deficiency promotes pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular malformations while exogenous elabela alleviates pre-eclampsia symptoms in elabela-deficient mice 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>\nThe role of apelin in the pathophysiology of hypertensive disease has also received considerable attention. Circulating apelin levels are reduced in essential hypertensive patients, and decreased apelin levels are independently associated with more profound cardiac dysfunction.通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u> Meanwhile, apelin levels were downregulated in patients with aortic valve stenosis in comparison to controls.通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u> Apelin has been revealed to restore declining heart function, which is consistent with the beneficial therapeutic effects of apelin 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[41,57]</u>\nIn addition to causing a depressor response during renovascular hypertension via APJ-kappa-opioid receptor heterodimers,通用删除6(英):<u>[58,59]</u> apelin-13 also remarkably accelerated the cell cycle process of VSMCs, and promoted the transition from G0/G1 to S phase during mitosis and stimulated VSMC proliferation via PI3K/AKT/extracellular signal-regulated kinase通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u> and Jagged-1/Notch3通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u> signaling pathways. In contrast, apelin treatment reduces pulmonary VSMCs proliferation in hypoxic conditions via PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u> Likewise, downregulation of apelin signaling during pulmonary hypertension is correlated with hyper-proliferation of pulmonary endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u> Apelin attenuated Ang II-induced contractions in pulmonary arteries from normoxic animals, but not in arteries from animals exposed to chronic hypoxia, implying the changes of the APJ in the signal transduction downstream.通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u>\nOf note, apelin increases NO formation to quench superoxide-induced changes in the vascular wall, which eliminate Ang II-induced atherosclerosis in ApoE KO mice 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> The apelin-APJ axis increased ACE2 promoter activity in vitro and upregulated ACE2 expression in failing hearts in vivo, which could increase conversion of Ang II to Angiotensin 1-7.通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> In contrast to apelin, the elabela-APJ axis protects from pressure-overload-induced heart failure, possibly by suppressing ACE rather than ACE2 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>\nActivation of the elabela/apelin-APJ axis exhibited beneficial effects in the context of endothelial dysfunction such as end-stage heart failure, atherosclerosis, and obesity.通用删除6(英):<u>[67,68]</u> The elabela/apelin-APJ axis may be a mediator for atherosclerosis,通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u> as the apelin gene was upregulated in atherosclerosis plaques.通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u> Collectively, the elabela/apelin-APJ axis has multiple protective functions in hypertensive conditions through its involvement in regulation of VSMCs and endothelial cells; the regulation is complex and might change during different pathologic conditions. Therefore, the means to precisely modulate the axis so as to develop it in a beneficial direction needs to be determined.\nHypertension has been recognized as a main risk factor for worldwide mortality. There is a continuing need for potent medications to reduce mortality and improve patients’ adherence to the hypertension treatment. Administration of apelin or elabela typically results in marked reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure levels and increases in blood flow. The elabela/apelin-APJ axis exerts essential roles in regulating vascular tone by counterbalancing the action of the Ang II/AT1R axis and activating the eNOS/NO signaling. Furthermore, The elabela/apelin-APJ axis demonstrates beneficial effects in vascular physiology and pathophysiology, such as angiogenesis, cellular proliferation, fibrosis, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular remodeling and dysfunction. Intriguingly, the effects of the elabela/apelin-APJ axis on vascular tone may depend upon blood vessel type or various pathological conditions. More importantly, the broad distribution of elabela/apelin and alternative isoforms implicated its distinct functions in diverse cardiac and vascular cells and tissue types.\nAlthough elabela/apelin-APJ axis plays critical roles in blood pressure regulation, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. A growing number of studies are devoted to shed new light on the regulatory roles of the elabela/apelin-APJ axis in vascular physiology and pathophysiology. At present, many clinical trials are evaluating the potential benefits of elabela/apelin analogs and novel APJ agonists in treating various cardiovascular disorders. Therefore, novel and innovative pharmacological approaches and anti-hypertensive drugs are expected to be developed to achieve long-term blood pressure reduction, improve hypertensive organ damage in people with hypertension, and thus reduce mortality and health care costs worldwide. Thus, targeting the elabela/apelin-APJ axis has emerged as a promising approach against progression of hypertension and hypertensive cardiovascular dysfunction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:44:13", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:44:20", "cost": 6.719}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:44:19", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:44:12"}

In a population-based study in the USA, the prevalence of VHD was reported in 13.2% of people aged >75 years, with degenerative lesions being dominant.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> In the United Kingdom, moderate or severe VHD prevalence in patients aged >65 years exceeded 11%.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> An epidemiological study suggested that the prevalence of VHD in the Hubei Province of China was approximately 2.05% in people aged >60 years.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Although rheumatic valvular diseases accounted for the majority of VHD in China, the prevalence of degenerative valvular diseases has also noticeably increased due to significant improvements in social economics and aging of the Chinese population.\nThe main treatment options for VHD include conservative medical treatment, interventional therapy, and surgery. As conservative treatment is unable to efficiently improve prognosis, surgical valve replacement or repair is one of the standard treatments for various VHD. However, a large number of patients cannot receive surgery due to contraindications, advanced age, poor cardiac function, or comorbidities. Therefore, interventional therapy techniques for valvular diseases have emerged, bringing novel treatment options to the aforementioned patients. This review aimed to summarize the current state of VHD transcatheter treatment and related possible challenges in the future.\nThe prevalence of moderate or severe aortic diseases approaches 4% in patients aged >75 years in the USA.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> In addition, there are more than 2 million patients with aortic valvular disease aged >75 years in China, of which more than 400,000 are in urgent need of surgery or intervention.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> According to the dominant anatomic and functional consequences of aortic failure, aortic valvular diseases can be divided into aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic regurgitation (AR). The European Valvular Heart Disease Survey showed that AS and AR comprised 24.4% and 7.5%, respectively, in cases of VHD without history of interventional therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> In China, AR is more prevalent than AS, especially in patients aged >75 years (2.85% vs. 0.89%).通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> According to the European Valvular Heart Disease Survey results, up to 33% of patients with VHD could not undergo surgery, and this rate is even higher in China. The 2-year mortality rate of patients with symptomaptic severe AS is as high as 50% if no surgery was performed. Considering the unmet needs to treat AS and AR, TAVR is a considerable option.\nThe first TAVR was performed in 2002 by Cribier et al通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> in France using a balloon-expandable Cribier-Edwards valve. Subsequently, TAVR has developed rapidly with a series of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) being carried out successively since 2007, including a total of about 15,000 patients, supporting the corresponding guidelines 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]</u> The earliest RCT on TAVR was the landmark study—the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) trial, which included patients with severe AS who were unable to undergo surgery and suggested that TAVR with a balloon-expandable valve had lower rates of all-cause mortality at a 2-year follow-up than standard medical therapy (43.3% vs. 68.0%, P < 0.001).通用删除6(英):<u>[10,22]</u> Moreover, TAVR was comparable to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in terms of mortality (33.9% vs. 35.0%, P= 0.78), symptom remission, and hemodynamic improvement at a 2-year follow-up in patients at high risk of surgery.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,23]</u> Therefore, the 2012 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (ESC/EACTS) guidelines and 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for VHD management suggested TAVR as a recommended treatment option for patients with severe AS who are unable to undergo surgery with a level of recommendation (L-R) I and level of evidence (L-E) B and as an alternative treatment option for surgically high-risk patients (L-R IIa, L-E B).通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25]</u> Subsequently, as confirmed by a series of researches, the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines for VHD management increased the recommendation strength of TAVR for patients unable to undergo surgery and high-risk patients (L-R I, L-E A). Furthermore, as the 2-year follow-up results of the PARTNER 2 RCT suggested that TAVR and SAVR showed similar incidence of death or disabling stroke for intermediate-risk patients with severe AS (P= 0.25), the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines for VHD management listed intermediate-risk patients as the indicated population for TAVR (L-R IIa, L-E B-R),通用删除6(英):<u>[14,26]</u> while the 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines for VHD management further included patients with frailty, porcelain aorta, or chest radiation sequelae (L-R I, L-E B).通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> This recommendation was supported by multiple clinical studies, including the PARTNER 1 trial, U.S. Corevalve High Risk trial, Surgical Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (SURTAVI) trial, PARTNER 2 trial, and Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention (NOTION) trial.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13,15,21]</u> In 2019, the Evolut Low Risk trial, which included surgically low-risk patients treated by TAVR with the self-expanding valve, suggested that the composite endpoint of death or disabling stroke after TAVR was not inferior to that after SAVR at a 2-year follow-up (P > 0.999).通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> In addition, the PARTNER 3 trial that included the balloon-expandable valve suggested that the composite endpoint rate was significantly lower in the TAVR cohort than in the SAVR cohort at a 1-year follow-up (8.5% vs. 15.1%, P < 0.001).通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Therefore, the 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines for VHD management recommended TAVR over SAVR for all-comer patients aged >80 years with a life expectancy of < 10 years (L-R I, L-E A), making a tradeoff for all patients aged between 65 and 80 years (L-R I, L-E A).通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> It is anticipated that the next version of the ESC/EACTS guidelines for VHD management will broaden the indications for TAVR in surgically low-risk patients.\nOverview of important RCTs associated with TAVR.\n删除重复语句：<u>Overview of important RCTs associated with TAVR.</u>\nAR: Aortic regurgitation; CI: Confidence interval; HR: Hazard ratio; KCCQ: Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire; MI: Myocardial infarction; NYHA: New York Heart Association Classification; PVL: Peri-valvular leakage; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; SAVR: Surgical aortic valve replacement; STS-PROM: Society of Thoracic Surgeons - predicted risk of mortality; SVD: Structural valve deterioration; TAVI: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation; TAVR: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement.\n* Comparations were always made by TAVR vs. SAVR standard medical therapy.\nTAVR was promoted in China relatively later than in Western countries. In October 2010, Junbo Ge successfully performed the first-in-man (FIM) TAVR domestically. Since then, a number of domestic hospitals have successfully performed TAVR using imported prostheses for research purposes due to the lack of market-approved devices. In September 2012, the Fuwai Hospital was the first to successfully perform TAVR using the domestic Venus-A valve (Venus Medtech Co. Hangzhou, China) and initiated the clinical registry of Venus-A valve, marking the arrival of the domestic TAVR device era. An early single-center clinical study in China has shown that the Venus-A valve had similar 2-year survival outcomes to the CoreValve in patients unable to undergo surgery and surgically high-risk patients (11.1% vs. 7.4%, P= 0.64)通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> and similar 1-year survival outcomes to the Sapien valve and J-Valve (P= 0.850),通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> providing early evidence to support the application of the Venus-A valve.\nCompared to Western TAVR candidates, Chinese TAVR candidates 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> are more often presenting with bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs)通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> have more severe aortic valve calcification通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> present more prevalent AR通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> have smaller average diameter of the femoral artery通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> comprise a higher prevalence of rheumatic valvular disease than that of degenerative lesions.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>\nAccording to the characteristics of Chinese candidate patients, researchers have proposed many solutions as follows: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> for patients with severe calcification, \"supra-annular sizing\" using a comprehensive assessment of the supra-annular structure is proposed to optimize valve size selection通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u>; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> for patients with BAV lesions, \"balloon sizing\" is used to assist valve size selection通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> for patients with AS and no severely calcified leaflets, \"direct valve implantation\" is used to reduce the damage to the integrity of landing zone caused by pre-dilatation and improve the device success rate.通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> The 5-year results of the Venus-A valve registry have shown promising long-term results, with an all-cause mortality of 20.8%; the Venus-A valve has occupied the largest proportion of transcatheter aortic prostheses used in the domestic market.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> More than 4000 cases of TAVR have been completed successfully by the end of 2019 in approximately 200 hospitals from over 20 Chinese provinces or cities.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>\nAccording to their development timeline, aortic valve prostheses can be divided into early- and new-generation valves. Early-generation transcatheter aortic valves mainly comprised the CoreValve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) and the Sapien/Sapien XT (Edwards Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, California, USA) valves. Such valves usually include a relatively large delivery system profile, no anti-leakage design, and no retrievable function. With improvements, the new-generation transcatheter aortic valves have been developed with antileakage design such as outer skirt, retrievable function, and a low delivery system profile. According to different valve expansion mechanisms, prostheses are generally divided into balloon-expandable and self-expanding valve 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u> 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nComparative overview of devices for TAVR.\n删除重复语句：<u>Comparative overview of devices for TAVR.</u>\nAR: Aortic regurgitation; CE: Conformite europeene; FDA: Food and Drug Administration of the USA; L: Large; M: Medium; NMPA: National Medical Product Administration; PPM: Permanent pacemaker implantation; PVL: Peri-valvular leakage; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; S: Small; TA: Transapical access; TAVR: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement; TF: Transfemoral access.\nCurrently, balloon-expandable valves mainly come from Edwards Lifesciences Limited Liability Company (Irvine, California, USA), which developed the Sapien, Sapien XT, and new generation of Sapien 3 and Sapien 3 Ultra valve systems. These balloon-expandable valves are all used for transfemoral access, retrograding to the aorta, and anchoring by balloon inflation in the designated position. Compared to early-generation valves, new-generation valves can reduce peri-valvular leakage (PVL), advance the delivery system easily, and avoid left ventricular damage ulteriorly. The serials of the PARTNER trials,通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,12,14,16,18,20]</u> which used Sapien, Sapein XT, and Sapien 3 valves for TAVR in high-, intermediate-, and low-risk patients, demonstrated that patients with AS treated by TAVR had outcomes not inferior to those treated by SAVR, thus validating the safety and effectiveness of these valves. According to a clinical study, TAVR using the CoreValve was associated with a higher risk of PVL (15.5% vs. 8.3%, P < 0.0001) and higher in-hospital (5.6% vs. 4.2%, P= 0.01) and 2-year (29.8% vs. 26.6%, P= 0.003) mortality than that using Sapien XT or Sapien 3 valves.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> Accordingly, the balloon-expandable TAVR technology represented by the Sapien valves occupies an important position in the global market and is the most widespread balloon-expandable valve worldwide. So far, there are more than 450,000 patients who have underwent the implantation of serials of the Sapien valves worldwide. In addition, the Sapien 3 and Sapien 3 Ultra valves have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the USA and gained the conformite europeene (CE) mark from the European Union in 2019 to be used in surgically low-risk patients with severe AS. In June 2020, the Sapien 3 valve clinical trial had been completed in China with supporting results, and the valve has been approved for marketing domestically.\nUnlike balloon-expandable valves, self-expanding valves are designed to anchor by progressively being released and do not require balloon assistance during their deployment. The Medtronic company (Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA), whose main valves include the CoreValve and new-generation Evolut R/Pro valve, is the first company to develop and promote transcatheter self-expanding aortic valves. The new-generation valves incorporate a design such as outer-skirt that reduce PVL and have retrievable function, a simpler delivery system, and a more consistent radial force, which have shown favorable rates of all-cause mortality and complications in the Evolut Low Risk trials.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> Accordingly, the Evolut R/PRO valve has been approved by the FDA and gained the CE mark in 2019 to be used in low-risk patients with severe AS. The Accurate neo valve, developed by Boston Scientific (Natick, Massachusetts, USA), is a special-releasing self-expanding valve with a supra-annular design. During release, the distal end is released firstly to anchor, and the valve stent is subsequently pushed to the native aortic annulus; the proximal end of the stent is released after automatic positioning. The new-generation Accurate neo 2 valve is mainly improved with the skirt against PVL. The Accurate neo valve is associated with higher rates of residual AR than the Sapien 3 valve.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> However, its supra-annular design with low residual gradients may be advantageous in patients with a small anatomy or mild calcification or those undergoing valve-in-valve treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[39,40]</u>\nThe self-expanding Portico valve, developed by Abbott Vascular (Santa Clara, California, USA), allows valve retraction in a low-leaflet position within the large-cell stent to reduce left ventricular outflow tract protrusion and provide easy access for future coronary interventions. The 1-year outcomes of the trial named International Long-Term Follow-Up Study of Patients Implanted with a PorticoTM Valve (PORTICO-I, NCT01802788), which involved 941 patients with an average Society of Thoracic Surgeons-predicted risk of mortality (STS-PROM) of 5.8%, demonstrated rates of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, disabling stroke, and myocardial infarction of 12.1%, 6.6%, 2.2%, and 2.5%, respectively, in addition to favorable hemodynamic results of low transvalvular pressure gradient and incidence of significant PVL.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>\nThe first transcatheter aortic valve used in China is the self-expanding Venus-A valve (Venus MedTech, Hangzhou, China), which has a strong radial force to be fully deployed in patients with severely calcified AS. Between September 2012 and January 2015, 101 patients were enrolled into the Venus-A clinical trial. At the 1-year follow-up of this trial, the all-cause mortality was only 6.1%, and cardiac function significantly improved in all patients. This valve was finally approved by the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA) for marketing in China on April 25, 2017. The second-generation product of this valve is the Venus-A plus valve, which is upgraded with retrievable and relocatable function to effectively improve the success and safety of TAVR. The Venus-A plus clinical trial showed that this valve system was safer than the first-generation valve and had a low incidence of composite endpoint events at 30-day follow-up (16.13% vs. 27.7%).通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> In November 2020, this valve was approved for marketing and became the first domestically retrievable TAVR system in China.\nThe VitaFlow valve system (MicroPort Scientific Corporation, Shanghai, China) is a self-expanding valve, with an innovative double-layer skirt, strong radial force, and large-cell stent design. A multicenter, single-arm study involving 110 symptomatic patients with AS with an average STS-PROM of 8.84% reported 1-year rate of all-cause death, major stroke, major vascular complication, coronary artery obstruction, and new pacemaker implantation 2.7%, 2.7%, 2.7%, 1.8%, and 19.1%, respectively, without moderate or severe PVL.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> In July 2019, this valve system passed its clinical trial and was marketed in China, becoming the first local self-expandable valve made by bovine pericardial tissue. The second-generation VitaFlow II valve system (MicroPort Scientific Corporation, Shanghai, China) has retrievable function and an anti-PVL structure, and the clinical trial for this valve started in 2018 and is ongoing at the time of writing this study.\nThe TaurusOne valve is a self-expanding valve from the Peijia Medical Limited Corporation (Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China), and the clinical trial for this valve is ongoing at the time of writing this study. The second-generation product, TaurusElite valve, has been upgraded with retrievable function; the pre-market clinical trial for this valve began in December 2019 and is ongoing at the time of writing this study. The J-Valve (JieCheng Medical Technology Co. Ltd. Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China), another transapical second-generation expandable valve, has 3 graspers for fixation on the periphery of the stent connected by active strings, facilitating anchoring, especially in patients with AR with rare severe calcification. This valve could capture leaflets and reduce displacement risk after valve releasing. The J-Valve registry included 107 AS or AR patients, with an average age of 74.4 years and a EuroScore of 27.5 points. The 30-day and 2-year cardiac mortality rate was 2.8% and 4.7%, respectively.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> In May 2017, the J-Valve became the first transapical transcatheter aortic valve to be marketed in China.\nIn China, the proportion of candidate patients for TAVR with BAV is approximately 40%, significantly exceeding that in Europe and the USA, in which valves for BAV cases comprising <10% of commercially used valves for TAVR.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> BAVs have unfavorable anatomic characteristics for TAVR, such as a noncircular and oversized annulus, severe and unevenly distributed calcification on leaflets, and concomitant ascending aorta dilation, which were all previously considered as relative contraindications to TAVR. However, an exploration study including a population of severe AS with BAV using the Sapien 3 and Evolut R/Pro valves showed favorable results with 30-day, 1-year, and 2-year mortality rates of 2.0%, 6.7%, and 12.5%, respectively.通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u> With continuous successful TAVRs in patients with BAV, domestic hospitals have accumulated experience in the application of TAVR in such patients, especially using the Venus-A valve,通用删除6(英):<u>[45,46,47]</u> indicating that TAVR is feasible and safe for candidate patients with BAV. Therefore, BAV is regarded as a relative indication for TAVR by the consensus of Chinese experts.\nThe latest 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines for VHD management suggested that all-comer patients aged between 65 and 80 years may be potential candidates for TAVR following a corresponding discretion by the heart team, leading to an increasing number of young patients undergoing TAVR. Therefore, the long-term durability of valves already becomes a problem which was faced by the patients and physicians. The long-term durability outcomes of the first-generation valves presented at the 2016 EuroPCR conference suggested that TAVR devices may be comparable to SAVR devices if the same definition of structural valve degeneration is used, with a time from operation to valve deterioration and re-intervention ranging between 7 and 11 years postoperatively.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> However, some studies have indicated that young patients who received TAVR might have a worse prognosis than old patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[49,50]</u> The NOTION II RCT planned to include surgically low-risk patients aged <75 years and compare the long-term follow-up outcomes for 5 to 10 years between patients who underwent TAVR and those who underwent SAVR, which is expected to provide more data on TAVR use in young patients.\nAccording to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) National Database, of 15,397 patients who underwent SAVR alone in 2006, 64.9% were aged >65 years, indicating a high risk of reoperation because they will be aged >80 years at the time of valve deterioration.通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> An international multicenter registry showed that transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation is safe and feasible for patients with surgical bioprosthetic valve deterioration.通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u> In addition, the 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines and 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines for VHD management proposed that transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation is a reasonable alternative to reoperation in surgical high-risk patients or those unable to undergo surgery with surgical bioprosthetic failure and limited valve expansion because of inability to use original surgical prostheses, leading to a risk of patient-prosthesis mismatch. Bioprosthetic valve fractures may potentially solve this issue.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> Considering the high risk of patient-prosthesis mismatch and poor prognosis of the aforementioned patients, surgeons are advised to carefully balance the advantages and disadvantages during index surgery and select a bioprosthesis with a larger size, if possible.\nSAVR is currently a standard treatment for pure AR, but a number of patients with contraindications or high surgical risk cannot receive surgery. Such patients may benefit from TAVR using the minimally invasive technique. However, anatomical challenges, such as the coexisting aortic root or ascending aorta dilation and large size of the aortic annulus, still exist. Moreover, lesions in patients with pure AR often lack clarification, possibly making it difficult for transcatheter valves to anchor stably and consequently increasing post-operative migration or PVL risk. The JenaValve and domestic J-Valve, with special three U-shaped graspers to fix on leaflets, may be suitable for such patients, even if the transapical approach is used. Because of the high prevalence of domestic AR, several researches have shown successful deployment of the J-Valve in patients with pure AR, indicating the feasibility and safety of TAVR procedure.通用删除6(英):<u>[43,54,55]</u>\nCoronary occlusion is a devastating complication that requires adequate preoperative assessment such as computed tomography assessing to reduce its risk, especially in patients with BAV, severe valvular calcification, low coronary ostium, or history of coronary artery disease. The bioprosthetic or native aortic scallop intentional laceration to prevent iatrogenic coronary artery obstruction during TAVR (BASILICA) technique, coronary protection, and chimney stent strategy may help reduce the incidence of coronary occlusion, but there are risks of associated complications and treatment failure.通用删除6(英):<u>[56,57,58]</u> The difficulty of coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention greatly increases after TAVR, which is also a matter that requires full consideration and might be solved by improving the valve structure in the future.\nThe prevalence of moderate or severe mitral valve disease in patients aged >75 years in the USA might approach 10%.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> According to different hemodynamics, mitral diseases can be divided into mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation (MR). Mitral stenosis is prevalent in developing countries, with similar treatment results of surgery and percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty for this population.通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> MR is the most common VHD, with an incidence reaching 10% in the population aged >75 years in the Western countries.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> According to different pathogenesis processes, MR can be divided into primary or organic lesions and secondary or functional lesions. Approximately more than 18.1 million people worldwide were diagnosed with primary MR in 2017, resulting in 35,700 deaths, while secondary MR accounted for 65% of moderate or severe MR cases and affacted up to 24% of patients with systolic heart failure.通用删除6(英):<u>[60,61,62]</u> The spectrum of mitral disease in China is different from that in developed countries, with rheumatic lesions being the most prevalent and the incidence of degenerative lesions increasing in recent years. Researches have estimated that there are approximately 10 million patients with MR (≥grade III) requiring treatment in China.通用删除6(英):<u>[63,64]</u> However, these patients are often refused by surgeons because of contraindications. In the meantime, conservative medical therapies are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that there is still a considerable need for MR treatment. Therefore, transcatheter mitral valve intervention has been gradually adopted by physicians and patients due to its advantages of minimal invasiveness and short hospital stay. According to different modalities, transcatheter mitral valve intervention can be divided into transcatheter mitral valve repair and transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u> 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.\nComparative overview of devices for transcatheter mitral valve intervention.\n删除重复语句：<u>Comparative overview of devices for transcatheter mitral valve intervention.</u>\nCE: Conformite europeene; FDA: Food and Drug Administration of the USA; LCX: Left circumflex artery; MV: Mitral valve; NMPA: National Medical Product Administration; TMVR: Transcatheter mitral valve repair; TR: Tricuspid regurgitation; TV: Tricuspid valve.\nTranscatheter edge-to-edge repair is based on surgical edge-to-edge mitral valve repair, which uses special mitral clippers for puncturing the atrial septum via the femoral vein to clamp the mitral valve and reduce the regurgitation orifice area. This special mitral clipper was first developed by Tec Deldman’s team in 1999 and was named MitraClip (Abbott Vascular, Menlo Park, California, USA). The early results of the Endovascular Valve Edge-to-Edge Repair study (EVEREST II, NCT00209274) showed that intervention using MitraClip was slightly inferior to conventional surgery in reducing MR but had similar clinical improvements and superior safety.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> Therefore, the 2012 ESC/EACTS guidelines for VHD management recommended surgical high-risk patients with severe primary MR and patients unable to undergo surgery as candidates for MitraClip therapy (L-R IIb, L-E C). According to the favorable long-term 5-year follow-up results of the EVEREST II study, MitraClip was approved by FDA to be used for treating surgical high-risk patients and patients with degenerative MR in 2013 after gaining the CE mark in 2008.通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> For functional MR treatment, there were some differences in the results of 2 important studies. The Percutaneous Repair with the Mitraclip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation (MITRA-FR, NCT01920698) trial suggested that MitraClip did not improve the rate of mortality or heart failure rehospitalization, despite optimization using guideline-directed management therapy in patients with functional MR. However, the Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation (COAPT) trial showed opposite results.通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u> In March 2019, the FDA approved MitraClip to be used for the treatment of functional MR based on the results of the COAPT trial, which has been more rigorously designed and conducted and adopted by the 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines for VHD management as well. The long-term follow-up results of the MITRA-FR and COAPT trials still had completely different conclusions, making the use of MitraClip for treating functional MR controversial. But the treatment benefit of population enrolled according to COAPT criteria has established the potential feasibility of Mitraclip usage in functioanl MR patients. MitraClip is currently the most widely used transcatheter mitral repair device in the market and was updated to its fourth generation, MitraClip G4, which has 4 types of clips; MitraClip G4 was successively approved by FDA and gained the CE mark in September 2019 and September 2020, respectively. Compared with TAVR, the development of MitraClip is relatively lagging in China. In 2012, the first MitraClip procedure for MR treatment was completed in China, and continuous other successful corresponding procedures have been performed in other domestic centers. In 2020, MitraClip obtained Chinese NMPA approval.\nPASCAL (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California, USA) is similar to MitraClip, despite its rhomboid folding clip structure. The force of clipping and leaflet fixation is based on elastic preformed metal retraction, without additional kinetic work. The PASCAL multicenter FIM study showed a high rate of procedural success and good post-operative MR reduction.通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u> The multicenter single-arm clinical Edwards PASCAL Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair System study (CLASP) suggested that the overall safety of this device was satisfactory.通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u> In February 2019, PASCAL received the CE mark, together with the large-scale RCT CLASP IID/IIF approved by FDA.\nIn China, there are mainly 2 domestic devices for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. DragonFly (Valgen Medtech Co. Hangzhou, China) is the first transfemoral mitral repair device in China, which has the independent ability for each clip to capture a leaflet and the unique clamp design allowing the clamp arm to clip with low tension. The 2020 Catheter Interventions in Congenital, Structural and Valvular Heart Disease (CSI) Webinar conference reported that the first 10 DragonFly cases in China had been completed with a device success rate of 100%, and all patients had an MR ≤ grade 2 before discharge. More follow-up outcomes will be collected continuously, and the clinical registry of DragonFly approved by the Chinese NMPA is about to be carried out. Another device is ValveClamp (Hanyu Medtech Co. Shanghai, China), the third transcatheter edge-to-edge repair device introduced internationally. ValveClamp can be advanced either via the peripheral arteries or the apex with a mean device time of 28.5 minutes. The 12 FIM cases of ValveClamp had a procedural success rate of approximately 100%, with no major adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, the obviously reduced maximal regurgitant orifice area was maintained at 1- and 3-month follow-ups according to a report on the 2019 China Interventional Therapeutics (CIT) conference. At present, the premarketing multi-center trial of Valve-Clamp (CLAMP-2, NCT03869164) is conducted in 10 cardiovascular centers nationwide. The second-generation product of ValveClamp, which is inserted via the femoral artery, will soon be used in clinical practice.\nIndirect transcatheter annuloplasty implants a special device in the coronary sinus to reduce the annulus size, thereby reducing the mitral valve orifice area and regurgitation. The representative device is Carillon (Cardiac Dimension Inc. Kirkland, Washington, USA). Although the initial clinical study Mitral Annuloplasty Device European Union Study has been completed and has gained the CE mark, Carillon was not progressed to be used in clinical practice due to its low procedural success rate and coronary artery occlusion risk. The device may compress the coronary circumflex branch when deployed, resulting in secondary myocardial ischemia and even myocardial infarction. Nevertheless, this device remains the only CE-approved indirect transcatheter mitral annuloplasty device.\nDirect transcatheter annuloplasty can reduce mitral annulus size by placing an adjustable prosthetic annulus through a catheter. The representative devices are Cardioband (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California, USA) and Mitralign (Mitralign Inc, Tewksbury, Massachusetts, USA). Cardioband is inserted by puncturing the atrial septum through the venous approach, with an annular contraction ratio reaching approximately 25% to 30%, which is suitable for patients with secondary MR. Researches have shown that the proportion of patients with MR ≥ grade 3 decreased from 77.4% preoperatively to 10.7% 1 month postoperatively and remained at 13.6% at a 7-month follow-up.通用删除6(英):<u>[70]</u> Preoperative screening requires special attention to the anatomy of the circumflex artery to avoid complications, and significant mitral annulus calcification may limit the screening efficiency. Unlike Cardioband, the Mitralign system shrinks the annulus size by tightening a string between the pledgets anchored to the annulus through artery approach. The FIM study of Mitralign showed that the device success rate was 70.4%; MR was reduced in 50% of patients, and there was significant cardiac functional improvement at a 6-month follow-up.通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u>\nTranscatheter artificial chordae implantation originated from a surgery for fixing prolapsed leaflets using an artificial chordae in patients who have long or ruptured mitral chordae tendineae, and the representative device is NeoChord (NeoChord, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA), which is suitable for patients with mitral valve prolapse/flail. Subsequent study data showed that NeoChord had good efficacy and safety and a low incidence of corresponding complications通用删除6(英):<u>[72,73]</u> The aforementioned Neo-Chord studies only included surgical low-risk patients, and the safety and efficacy of this device in surgical high-risk patients need to be confirmed in the future.\nGiven the complexity of the mitral valve anatomy and the pathogenesis of related diseases, combined transcatheter procedures may be necessary. Accordingly, the transcatheter COMBO mitral valve therapy has been proposed.通用删除6(英):<u>[74]</u> Moreover, in China, MitralStitch (Valgen Medtech, Hangzhou, China) is a representative device for combined procedures as it can achieve not only artificial chordal implantation but also complete mitral edge-to-edge repair using the transapical approach in a broader range of candidate patients. The first MitralStitch procedure was completed in 2018, and the single-center study related to this device achieved promising results.通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u> In April 2019, a prospective, multicenter, single group assignment study for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of MitralStitch mitral valve repair system in patients with moderate to severe and severe mitral regurgitation (MIRACLE II, NCT04080362) was initiated and is currently ongoing at the time of writing this study.\nDue to the complex anatomy of the mitral valve, MR may have various etiologies with great heterogeneity, which are difficult for one device to repair. Therefore, TMVI may be a potential technical solution. TMVI can be divided into valve-in-mitral annular calcification (valve-in-mac), valve-in-native mitral valve (valve-in-valve), and valve-in-degenerated surgical bioprostheses or rings (valve-in-ring), with valve-in-valve having the best performance. Since the FIM TMVI was successfully performed in Denmark using the Cardi AQ valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California, USA) in 2012, new devices have been continuously emerging, including the Tendyne device (Tendyne Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Abbott Vascular, Roseville, Minnesota, USA), Intrepid System (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA), Neovasc Tiara Device (Neovasc, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada), Fortis System (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California, USA), HighLife Device (Peijia Medical Limited Corporation, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China), Caisson System (Maple Grove, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA), MValve Device (Herzliya, Tel Aviv, Israel), and NCS NaviGate System (NaviGate Cardiac Structures, LakeFore St, California, USA), with the first 2 valves being the most commonly used in clinical practice. The Tendyne valve is a D-shaped retrievable TMVI device with an atrial rim to avoid PVL and the ability to perform apical string fixation to avoid displacement. In 2019, the 1-year follow-up results of the first 100 patients receiving the Tendyne valve showed a device success rate of 97%, none or trace MR rate of 98.7% at 30 days and 1-year all-cause mortality of 27.6%.通用删除6(英):<u>[76,77]</u> The ongoing global multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using the Tendyne mitral valve system for the treatment of symptomatic mitral regurgitation (SUMMIT, NCT03433274) will further verify the safety and efficacy of the Tendyne valve. The Intrepid valve is another TMVI valve that is similar to the Tendyne valve. The FIM study of the Intrepid valve included 50 patients and showed a device success rate of 98%, with significantly decreased MR, increased cardiac function, and a 30-day mortality of 14%.通用删除6(英):<u>[78]</u> The transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) with the Medtronic IntrepidTM system in patients with severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation (APOLLO, NCT03242642) RCT reported at the 2019 Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) conference that the 30-day mortality rate related to this device was only 2%. Simultaneously, the optimization and iterative updates of the Intrepid transcatheter mitral valve repair system in 2019 made it possible to implant the valve through peripheral venous approach, with a lower risk of myocardial injury and the avoidance of chest incision. Mi-thos (NewMed Medical, Shanghai, China) is a domestic TMVI system that is implanted using the transapical approach. This device was reportedly successfully used in a patient with a degenerated bioprosthetic mitral valve and severe MR and was preliminarily effective.通用删除6(英):<u>[79]</u> HighLife (Peijia Medical Limited Corporation, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China) is a self-expanding valve used for TMVR via transseptal access based on mechanism of \"valve-in-ring\" . The implantation procedure of HighLife valve consists of 2 steps plus 2 accesses, which includes placing loop and positioned subannular implant around the subannular structure via femoral artery access and valve implantation via transseptal access. The first two cases with severe functional MR who received HighLife valve implantation achieved safe and excellent early hemodynamic performance.通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u>\nTranscatheter mitral valve repair can largely reduce MR, but the low acceptance rate and high in-hospital mortality remain major drawbacks. In addition, transcatheter mitral valve repair mainly treats only one type of anatomical lesion at once, which could not achieve one-stop treatment as surgery. So far, the edge-to-edge repair technique is the only transcatheter treatment recommended by current guidelines for primary and secondary severe symptomatic MR. However, device durability remains controversial. Although TMVI achieved satisfactory performance with good valve function, low rate of PVL, and short-term complications, it is associated with several problems. High risks of acute coronary complications and sub-valvular structure damage during transcatheter mitral valve deployment need to be considered. Meanwhile, due to some anatomical features of the mitral valve, including asymmetric annulus, irregular geometric leaflet, excessive annular size, non-calcification tissue, and complex sub-valvular structures, the difficulty to locate and anchor the mitral valve prosthesis remains an intractable problem. Moreover, detailed problems still existed such as 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> manipulation in the asymmetric calcification-free mitral annulus with high hemodynamic pressure; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> risk of obstruction by the anterior mitral valve in the left ventricular outflow tract; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> residual PVL, which often leads to hemolysis; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> thrombosis risk; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the need for a transapical approach with a relatively large sheath; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> technical heterogeneity; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> durability under the mechanical stress induced by movement during the cardiac cycle.\nAlthough there is still not much evidence for TMVI, new devices will be continuously innovated, and more researches will be published due to natural advantages of its design and improvements in theoretical understanding. We believed that TMVI may become the new paradigm for MR treatment in the near future for those patients who are not suitable for transcatheter mitral valve repair.\nTricuspid stenosis is rare, while tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is the most common tricuspid valve disease, with an incidence of approximately 200,000 and >300,000 patients per year in the USA and Europe, respectively.通用删除6(英):<u>[81]</u> Most TRs are secondary lesions often associated with left heart diseases or atrial fibrillation that have a poor prognosis. However, TR has not received enough clinical attention, and few patients undergo independent tricuspid valve surgery, which is associated with high in-hospital mortality. Current treatment options for TR are limited. Surgical tricuspid valve repair or replacement provides no significant benefit, and medical treatment effects are poor. Nevertheless, some studies have shown that left-sided valve surgery combined with tricuspid valve repair may improve the prognosis of patients with TR,通用删除6(英):<u>[82]</u> suggesting the necessity of timely treatment for TR. Recently, research has demonstrated that transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention is associated with better survival and reduced heart failure rehospitalization occurrence than conservative medical therapy alone, preliminarily confirming the effectiveness of interventional therapy 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>.通用删除6(英):<u>[83]</u>\nThe TriCinch System (4TECH Cardio Ltd, Galway, Ireland) is a transcatheter tricuspid annuloplasty device used to reduce the annulus size using an anchored coil at the junction of the anterior-posterior tricuspid valve leaflets. The annular diameter and regurgitation degree reduced postoperatively when the system was first applied, and the quality of life improved at 6 months postoperatively.通用删除6(英):<u>[84]</u> The second-generation TriCinch Coil system had better stability than the first-generation device and successfully converted the severe TR to mild TR postoperatively.通用删除6(英):<u>[85]</u> The multicenter study percutaneous treatment of tricuspid valve regurgitation with the TriCinch systemTM (PREVENT, NCT02098200), which aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the TriCinch Coil system, is ongoing at the time of writing this study. The mechanism of Trialign (Mitraling, Tewksbury, Massachusetts, USA) is similar to that of the TriCinch Coil system. Intraoperatively, the catheter can reach the joint of the posterior-anterior or posterior-septal leaflet through the jugular vein and tighten the sutures linked to pledgets to fold the posterior leaflet, whose tension provided by a stent in postcava, thereby reducing the diameter of the tricuspid annulus. The registry trial early feasibility of the mitralign percutaneous tricuspid valve annuloplasty system (PTVAS) for symptomatic chronic functional tricuspid regurgitation (SCOUT, NCT02574650) related to the Trialign system showed that all 15 included patients with moderate or severe TR successfully underwent operation. At 30 days postoperatively, 12 patients had reduced effective regurgitant orifice area and significantly improved cardiac function, while 3 patients suffered pledget detachment,通用删除6(英):<u>[86]</u> confirming the feasibility of the usage of Trialign for functional TR treatment. Moreover, the associated SCOUT-II study that is currently ongoing at the time of writing this study is focusing on patients with trivial to moderate TR. The MIA device (Micro Interventional Devices, Inc. Newton, Pennsylvania, USA) comprises multiple polymeric anchors positioned between the anteroposterior and posteroseptal commissures and has a high technical success rate and high rate of valve area reduction.通用删除6(英):<u>[87]</u>\nThe Mitralign system, which was originally designed for MR treatment, is now indicated for patients with functional TR. This system can convert the tricuspid valve into the bicuspid valve by suturing and folding the annulus of the septal leaflet through the trans-jugular approach. The preliminary results of the SCOUT study showed that patients who underwent Mitralign implantation had significantly reduced regurgitation at 30 days postoperatively.通用删除6(英):<u>[86]</u> Another mitral valvular device is the Cardioband system, which gained the CE mark for TR treatment. The latest tricuspid regurgitation repair with cardioband transcatheter system (TRI-REPAIR, NCT02981953) clinical trial related to the Cardioband system reported sustained reduced annular size and TR severity at 2-year follow-up.通用删除6(英):<u>[88]</u>\nThe TriClip system (Abbott Vascular, Menlo Park, California, USA) clamps the anterior and septal leaflet or the posterior and septal leaflet via the femoral vein, similar to MitraClip. The trial to evaluate treatment with Abbott transcatheter clip repair system in patients with moderate or greater tricuspid regurgitation (TRILUMINATE, NCT03227757), which included 85 patients with moderate to severe TR treated with the TriClip system, demonstrated that 86% of patients had decreased TR by at least 1 grade at a 30-day follow-up.通用删除6(英):<u>[89]</u> In April 2020, the TriClip system gained the CE mark, becoming the first approved transcatheter tricuspid valve repair device in the world.\nMitraClip, an effective device for treating degenerative and functional MR, is increasingly used in transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention. The multicenter multi-device Trivalve registry is the largest study to validate the efficacy of severe TR interventions, with MitraClip comprising over 60% of devices. The preliminary results of this study published in the 2018 Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) conference showed favorable procedural success rates, device durability, and clinical benefits, and similar results can also be found in the PASCAL system, which was also used for patients with MR initially, combining the design concept of FORMA (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California, USA) and the MitraClip system in addition to a central spacer that fills the regurgitant area and 2 independently grasping arms. The FIM experience of PASCAL suggested that this device has high procedural success and acceptable safety and induces significant clinical improvement通用删除6(英):<u>[90]</u>; PASCAL later became approved for commercial use in patients with TR in Europe in May 2020.\nThe FORMA system enhances coaptation by placing a spacer at the regurgitant orifice while preserving the original leaflet. Research has shown that TR significantly decreased postoperatively using this device.通用删除6(英):<u>[91]</u> The early feasibility study of this device is currently ongoing and will expectedly further evaluate its safety. However, this device is only suitable for patients with small regurgitant orifices.\nThe representative valve for orthotopic transcatheter tricuspid valve implantation is NaviGate (NaviGate Cardiac Structures, Lake Forest, California, USA). The NaviGate valve consists of equine pericardial tissue and nitinol stents sized between 36 and 52 mm and is used in patients with severe TR using either the jugular vein or atrium approach. Thus far, this valve has been used in surgical high-risk patients with TR in multiple clinical centers. Results have shown that this device has effectively improved cardiac function and right heart remodeling in patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[92,93]</u> However, the problems of PVL and its non-retrievable design pose some challenges related to its usage. In the future, the optimal population for this valve and corresponding long-term outcomes should be studied.\nThe LuX-Valve (Jenscare Biotechnology, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China), a transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement device developed in China, consists of bovine pericardial tissue and nitinol stents in addition to a skirt to prevent PVL. The deployment of this device does not require radial force but fixed by a special anchoring structure. Of the 12 patients included in the FIM study of this device, only 1 patient died in the hospital due to myocardial infarction.通用删除6(英):<u>[94]</u>\nHeterotopic transcatheter tricuspid valve implantation can reduce the load of right heart by preventing the blood reflux into the superior and inferior vena cava during systole. Lauten et al通用删除6(英):<u>[95]</u> first proposed the idea of prosthesis in the vena cava to reduce TR and relieve heart failure symptoms. The Edwards Sapien XT valve and TricValve (P & F Products & Features Vertriebs GmbH, Vienna, Austria), a self-expanding valve with 2 separate stents, were reported to be first used in humans in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The Edwards Sapien XT valve is effective for improving dyspnea but has a high in-hospital mortality rate.通用删除6(英):<u>[96]</u> Another bi-leaflet valve that has been used in humans is the Tricento valve (NVT GmbH, Hechingen, Germany). After implantation, TR and right atrial dilatation did not significantly improve in most patients, with 1 patient having alleviated symptoms postoperatively and another dying of end-stage renal failure after 4 months.通用删除6(英):<u>[97,98]</u> Consequently, such a device cannot fundamentally treat TR and may even cause further tricuspid annulus dilation, impeding the further usage of these devices.\nAlthough transcatheter valve intervention by an experienced surgeon in patients with left-sided heart valvular disease can provide references for interventional TR treatment, transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention still faces many challenges due to the particular anatomy of valves, including 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the large tricuspid annulus proximal to the right coronary artery; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> thin wall of the right ventricle, which has a high perforation risk; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> frequent presence of pacemaker or defibrillator leads during manipulation; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> adjacent location of the valve to the sinoatrial node and His bundle, which causes a high risk of conduction disturbances. In addition, low blood flow velocity in the right heart increases thrombosis and endocarditis risks. Although exploration studies have preliminarily confirmed that interventional therapy for TR is partially safe and effective in some cases, most studies on interventional therapy for TR are observational and have small sample sizes. Currently, the indications for interventional therapy for TR are still unclear, and whether early intervention for patients with mild to moderate TR has any benefits remains to be further validated. However, there is no doubt that tricuspid valve disease will be an important topic in the field of transcatheter valvular therapy in the near future. More well-designed RCTs with larger populations are needed to provide evidence for transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention.\nThe earliest transcatheter valve implantation technique, TPVI, was performed in 2000通用删除6(英):<u>[99]</u>; this surgery is mainly performed to treat patients with pulmonary regurgitation (PR) after surgery for complex congenital heart diseases, such as tetralogy of Fallot. Severe PR may lead to significantly reduced exercise tolerance and even ventricular arrhythmias or sudden death in patients; therefore, these patients may require surgical valve replacement, which has a high risk of reoperation. TPVI has evolved to become an attractive alternative to surgery in such patients, as supported by the early results of corresponding studies.\nThe main valves used in Europe and the USA are Melody (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) or serial Sapien valves. However, these 2 valves need additional pre-mounted stents in the right ventricular outflow tract before implantation and have a relatively limited size (Melody ≤ 24 mm, and Sapien ≤ 29 mm). More than 85% of patients who underwent surgery for tetralogy of Fallot in China have a pulmonary annulus diameter >30 mm postoperatively; therefore, the aforementioend 2 valves are not suitable for most Chinese patients.\nThe domestic Venus P-Valve system (Venus Medtech Co. Hangzhou, China) is the first transcatheter self-expanding valve in the world and is especially used for patients with PR in clinical settings; this device does not require a pre-mounted stent. The early clinical trial for this device showed that the success rate was 98.2 %, and the all-cause mortality was 3.6% at 1-year follow-up.通用删除6(英):<u>[100]</u> In 2016 and 2019, the pre-CE mark trial and the Investigational Device Exemption study for FDA were officially initiated, respectively. Venus P-valve implantation has provided satisfactory results with a high success rates and low complication rates in an inherently challenging patient population globally.通用删除6(英):<u>[101]</u>\nFuture developments in the field of TPVI should aim to reduce the complication rate, increase the freedom of re-intervention, and most importantly, expand the indicated population. The TVPI-related infective endocarditis rate is relatively high; therefore, it is necessary to initiate more research on the management of postoperative infective endocarditis. TPVI devices should be further improved to include a low profile design, long durability, low opening resistance, rapid and reliable closure, and non-thrombogenic properties.\nThe development of transcatheter intervention for VHD provides alternative options for patients who are unable to undergo surgery or not benefit from conservative medical therapy, with superior clinical outcomes in selected population. There are multiple international valve conferences and workshops being organized, such as the serial of PCR conferences, CIT conference, TVT conferences, TCT conference, TAVI Workshop in Latin America, and so on, to provided lectures and updated information about interventional cardiology. With the accumulation of evidence and device improvements, the indications for heart valvular intervention have been gradually expanding. In China, there are many current remarkable achievements in the field of interventional therapy for VHD combined with cuttingedge novel innovations. Intervention therapy for VHD has been continuously popularized and promoted, which is anticipated to benefit an increasing number of patients in the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:32:21", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:33:27", "cost": 66.363}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:33:27", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:32:20"}

Failure to control inflammation over time causes cartilage damage, bone erosion, and joint ankylosis, leading to joint deformities and functional loss.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> To effectively control the disease to achieve remission, the disease activity must be accurately evaluated, and the disease activity index (DAI) can help to judge the improvement and guide treatment. Currently, the evaluation of RA is not obtained from a single index. The criteria used to evaluate RA are composite indices. Disease activity score 28 (DAS28), simplified disease activity index (SDAI), and clinical disease activity index (CDAI) are commonly used in clinical practice, but there is no generally accepted \"gold standard.\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>\nDifferent indices can categorize the same patient into different disease activity groups, leading to differences in treatment. Therefore, previous studies comparing RA DAIs have been numerous.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5,6,7]</u> Some studies have suggested that the cutoff values of some indices should be adjusted, while other studies have suggested that the formulas for calculating indices should be revised, adding some factors, including sex, age, disease duration, and so on.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u> Some studies have suggested that different regions and races might have differences in DAIs; in particular, the cutoff value of DAS28-C-reactive protein (CRP) in Asia might be reduced, so DAIs should be compared in different regions.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,10,11]</u>\nMany countries have performed their own studies of RA DAIs.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,11,12]</u> The results of the reports have been inconsistent.

The aim was to analyze the correlation and consistency of the DAIs and to explore the indices’ thresholds as \"suitable for Chinese.\"\nEthics approval for the registry was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of PUMCH 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. JS-2038)</u>, which was accepted by all of the participating centers as the central institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all of the patients at enrollment.\nMulticenter baseline data were selected from the CREDIT database from November 2016 to August 2018 for a cross-sectional study. The database contains information about RA patients in more than 500 hospitals in 26 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China. All of the hospitals are Class A tertiary hospitals, with independent departments of rheumatology and immunology, and the doctors participating in the evaluation are rheumatic specialists. These doctors have been trained and have practiced for many years, so the evaluation of RA disease activity is relatively objective and standard. Patients older than 16 years were selected to meet the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for RA diagnosis,通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> and the relevant data and examination results were complete. Patients with other autoimmune diseases or acute infections were excluded from this study.\nThe study variables mostly included sex, age, disease duration, pain visual analog scale (VAS), physician’s global VAS, patient’s global VAS, 28-tender joint count, 28-swollen joint count, ESR, high-sensitivity CRP, rheumatoid factor (RF), DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP, SDAI, and CDAI. The above information was collected, calculated, and saved in accordance with the requirements of the CREDIT database. Laboratory examinations were performed in designated laboratories according to uniform standards.\nAfter careful data review, 152 patients younger than 16 years and 2159 cases with other autoimmune diseases or acute infections or incomplete core data were excluded from the data analysis. Quantitative parametric data were expressed using mean and standard deviations, while non-parametric data were expressed in medians and inter-quartile ranges (IQRs). Qualitative data were expressed in numbers and percentages. Most of the data were not normally distributed and were analyzed using Spearman correlation. The concordance between clinometric indices was accessed by quadratic weighted kappa value, for which patients were classified into the ordinal categories of disease activity according to the cutoff points proposed by ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Non-concordant percentages were calculated by the number of misclassified people divided by the total number. Moreover, the Bland-Altman plot was constructed to examine agreement between the DAS28 measures.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> According to previous reports, a difference of >0.6 between the DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP was considered greater than measurement error, and a difference >1.2 was clinically significant.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,11]</u> Therefore, instead of using the mean and standard deviation, cutoffs of (±) 0.6 and (±) 1.2 were used to denote the limits of agreement in the plots. In addition, we used the ACR/EULAR 2010 RA definition of remission通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>: SDAI ≤3.3 was set as the standard, and we used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to analyze DAS28 and CDAI; the optimal cutoff point was determined using the maximum Youden index. SPSS  was used for data analysis, and a two-sided P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe characteristics of the RA patients included in the study are shown in Table 1. A total of 24,541 (80.46%) patients were female. The mean age of the patients was 52.6 ± 13.1 years, and the median disease duration was 4 通用删除7(英):<u>(1, 10)</u> years. Of the patients, 84.70% were seropositive for RF. According to the DAIs, approximately 80% of the patients had moderately and highly active disease. The mean DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP scores of the patients were 5.1 ± 1.7 and 4.5 ± 1.6, respectively, and the median (IQR) of the SDAI and CDAI were 24.6 (14.9, 39.7) and 22.5 (13.5, 36.8), respectively.\nDemographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 30,501 RA patients.\n删除重复语句：<u>Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 30,501 RA patients.</u>\nCDAI: Clinical disease activity index; CRP: C-reactive protein; DAS28: Disease activity score 28; ESR: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate; IQR: Interquartile range; PhGA: Physician global assessment; PtGA: Patient global assessment; RA: Rheumatoid arthritis; RF: Rheumatoid factor; SDAI: Simplified disease activity index; SJC: Swollen joint count; TJC: Tender joint count; VAS: Visual analog scale.\nTable 2 shows that there was a high correlation among all four index scores; the correlation coefficients were all >0.9 (P < 0.001).

The mean DAS28-ESR was significantly higher than the mean DAS28-CRP (P < 0.001). The Bland-Altman plots showed similar findings. Positive differences between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP were observed in 83% of cases, and the average difference was 0.54 (95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.58). The plot 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u> also showed that an absolute difference of ≤0.6 was observed in 14,993 patients (49.16%); 40.75% of the differences ranged from 0.6 to 1.2, and 10.09% were >1.2.\nEvery DAI classified the disease into four same categories: remission, low disease activity (LDA), moderate disease activity (MDA), and high disease activity (HDA).

While comparing DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP, 28.96% of patients were in different groups, 25.94% of patients were assigned to a higher disease activity group, and 3.02% were assigned to a lower group using DAS28-ESR. Similarly, comparing SDAI and CDAI, 6.07% of patients were assigned to a higher disease activity group, and 2.63% were assigned to a lower group using CDAI. Between DAS28-ESR and SDAI, 25.7% were in different groups, 13.4% of patients were assigned to a higher disease activity group, and 12.3% were assigned to a lower group using SDAI.

The study included 30,501 RA patients who met the enrollment criteria and were included in the database from 26 provinces in China since 2016.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18]</u> Unlike previous studies, the majority of the study population were in remission and LDA, and we know that most of our population was in MDA or HDA. Unlike conventional clinical trials, this study was entirely a non-interventional study of real-world RA patients, so the results can be well applied to clinical practice.\nSimilar to previous studies,通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8,12]</u> there were high correlations among the four DAIs in Chinese RA patients, with Spearman rho >0.9. Compared with previous studies, the correlation between DAIs was 0.7 to 0.9, which was higher in China. Everyone seems to agree that a high degree of correlation does not imply a high degree of consistency. Many studies have used kappa coefficients to analyze the consistency between DAIs, but the kappa results have been quite different, and opposite conclusions have been obtained. In some studies,通用删除6(英):<u>[5,9,19]</u> the kappa coefficients were 0.3 to 0.5, and the consistency between DAIs was fair, while in other studies,通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> the values were approximately 0.8, so the conclusions regarding consistency between DAIs have been various. For these reasons, previous studies have generally explained the differences in disease status among the subjects involved. However, we believe that the main reason for the differences was that different studies have used different statistical methods to calculate kappa values. The result calculated by the simple kappa method was obviously lower than that of the weighted kappa method. Then, the same consistency standard was used to evaluate the results, so different conclusions were drawn. Because the variables were multiple ordered (remission, LDA, MDA, and HDA), we believe that the weighted kappa method was more appropriate. On this basis, we obtained the results that the weighted kappa between DAIs were 0.6 to 0.8, and the values were highly consistent.\nInterestingly, although there were obvious differences in consistency analysis, all of the studies agreed that DAIs were not interchangeable. Although those results were highly correlated and highly consistent among DAIs, the conclusions were also the same. Some studies used Bland-Altman plots to analyze why DAIs were not interchangeable. In this study, the absolute difference between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP was >1.2 in 10.09% of the patients, with >5% suggesting that DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP were not interchangeable. This outcome was consistent with previous studies. The plot also showed that 83% of patients had DAS28-ESR greater than DAS28-CRP, with an average difference of 0.54. A conclusion similar to previous studies was obtained: compared with DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP might underestimate the disease state and overestimate the treatment efficacy, and the threshold of DAS28-CRP might be down-regulated. In addition, we would also like to mention that the Bland-Altman method is inappropriate for comparing the consistency between SDAI and CDAI for methodological reasons.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nIf we discussed whether DAIs were interchangeable, we believe that DAIs are mainly categorical variables, rather than continuous variables. Therefore, the cross tables and the non-consistent ratios might better reflect the classification differences between indices. Previous studies have reported that the proportion of inconsistencies among the four DAIs can reach up to 50%.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,10]</u> In our study, approximately 30% of the patients were grouped differently by different DAIs. We further compared the inconsistencies of each group using the cross tables and found that SDAI and CDAI were more conservative than DAS28 in evaluating the disease state. This outcome is similar to what Gaujoux-Viala et al通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> reported: \"the main limitation of the DAS28 is a broader definition of remission.\" Therefore, we also suggest that the four indices are not interchangeable.\nSince the indices are not interchangeable, many studies have considered some ways to improve the grouping consistency between indices; the common way has been to revise the cutoff values for DAIs. The re-definition of the optimal remission cutoff values is an exploratory attempt. There is no consensus on how to revise the current cutoff values. We set SDAI ≤3.3 as the standard and used ROC curves to determine the new remission thresholds for DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP, and CDAI. SDAI ≤3.3 is considered the remission standard for the following two reasons. 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Compared with the DAS28, the SDAI formula is simpler, and previous studies have shown that the SDAI is more conservative than the DAS28. Therefore, similar articles have mostly chosen the SDAI as the standard. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> We chose this standard to render our results comparable with other foreign studies. Our results were different from most previous studies. Analyzing the reasons, the study population and the patients’ disease states were different. Moreover, the analytical methods used were different. In Fleischmann research, three methods were used to calculate the average value, and the ROC curve analysis obtained higher cutoff values using the maximum Youden index. Our purpose is to prove that the same patient is categorized into different disease activity groups according to different DAI cutoff values. Considering one index as the standard, the calculated cutoff values of other indices are quite different from the current criteria. Therefore, different indices are not interchangeable, and we might also attempt to evaluate the conservatism of each DAI.\nIn addition, some studies have suggested revising the formula for DAS28. Others have suggested that factors that could affect DAIs, such as sex and age, be added to the formula. However, all of the authors noted that these were only suggestions and required further validation in large samples and different populations. Here, we must point out that assessing the entire population is almost impossible, so developing a universal formula is difficult. Moreover, a potential problem of amending or adding more variables to the existing formula is that it could cause the DAIs to become more complicated, thereby reducing their use in clinical practice. Considering the clinical practical application, the SDAI and CDAI have great advantages because of their simple formulas, and they might also be easier to understand by patients and might therefore enhance adherence to treatment regimens.\nOur study had several limitations. First, this study was a cross-sectional study, and it was not possible to compare the effects of different DAIs on disease improvement and analyze the evolution of disagreements over time. Second, China is a multi-ethnic country, and our study did not group by race, so it might have ignored the impact of ethnic minorities on DAIs.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Finally, we did not consider other possible confounding factors as grouping variables, such as treatment, course of the disease, etc.\nTo conclude, based on a large number of detailed and accurate data from the CREDIT database, we analyzed and compared the four DAIs of RA patients in China for the first time. There is a high degree of correlation and large weighted kappa values among RA DAIs in China. However, approximately 30% of the patients were grouped differently by different DAIs, which could lead to a discrepancy in treatment, so we believe that the DAIs are interchangeable. The SDAI and CDAI are more conservative than the DAS28 in evaluating the disease state. Considering the purpose of targeted treatment, the SDAI and CDAI might be more reliable and convenient than DAS28. In the future, more follow-up studies of DAIs in assessing treatment improvement should be performed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Table 2 shows that there was a high correlation among all four index scores; the correlation coefficients were all >0.9 (P < 0.001).

Informed consent was obtained from all of the patients at enrollment.\nMulticenter baseline data were selected from the CREDIT database from November 2016 to August 2018 for a cross-sectional study. The database contains information about RA patients in more than 500 hospitals in 26 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China. All of the hospitals are Class A tertiary hospitals, with independent departments of rheumatology and immunology, and the doctors participating in the evaluation are rheumatic specialists. These doctors have been trained and have practiced for many years, so the evaluation of RA disease activity is relatively objective and standard. Patients older than 16 years were selected to meet the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for RA diagnosis,通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> and the relevant data and examination results were complete. Patients with other autoimmune diseases or acute infections were excluded from this study.\nThe study variables mostly included sex, age, disease duration, pain visual analog scale (VAS), physician’s global VAS, patient’s global VAS, 28-tender joint count, 28-swollen joint count, ESR, high-sensitivity CRP, rheumatoid factor (RF), DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP, SDAI, and CDAI. The above information was collected, calculated, and saved in accordance with the requirements of the CREDIT database. Laboratory examinations were performed in designated laboratories according to uniform standards.\nAfter careful data review, 152 patients younger than 16 years and 2159 cases with other autoimmune diseases or acute infections or incomplete core data were excluded from the data analysis. Quantitative parametric data were expressed using mean and standard deviations, while non-parametric data were expressed in medians and inter-quartile ranges (IQRs). Qualitative data were expressed in numbers and percentages. Most of the data were not normally distributed and were analyzed using Spearman correlation. The concordance between clinometric indices was accessed by quadratic weighted kappa value, for which patients were classified into the ordinal categories of disease activity according to the cutoff points proposed by ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Non-concordant percentages were calculated by the number of misclassified people divided by the total number. Moreover, the Bland-Altman plot was constructed to examine agreement between the DAS28 measures.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> According to previous reports, a difference of >0.6 between the DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP was considered greater than measurement error, and a difference >1.2 was clinically significant.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,11]</u> Therefore, instead of using the mean and standard deviation, cutoffs of (±) 0.6 and (±) 1.2 were used to denote the limits of agreement in the plots. In addition, we used the ACR/EULAR 2010 RA definition of remission通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>: SDAI ≤3.3 was set as the standard, and we used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to analyze DAS28 and CDAI; the optimal cutoff point was determined using the maximum Youden index. SPSS  was used for data analysis, and a two-sided P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe characteristics of the RA patients included in the study are shown in Table 1. A total of 24,541 (80.46%) patients were female. The mean age of the patients was 52.6 ± 13.1 years, and the median disease duration was 4 通用删除7(英):<u>(1, 10)</u> years. Of the patients, 84.70% were seropositive for RF. According to the DAIs, approximately 80% of the patients had moderately and highly active disease. The mean DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP scores of the patients were 5.1 ± 1.7 and 4.5 ± 1.6, respectively, and the median (IQR) of the SDAI and CDAI were 24.6 (14.9, 39.7) and 22.5 (13.5, 36.8), respectively.\nDemographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 30,501 RA patients.\n删除重复语句：<u>Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 30,501 RA patients.</u>\nCDAI: Clinical disease activity index; CRP: C-reactive protein; DAS28: Disease activity score 28; ESR: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate; IQR: Interquartile range; PhGA: Physician global assessment; PtGA: Patient global assessment; RA: Rheumatoid arthritis; RF: Rheumatoid factor; SDAI: Simplified disease activity index; SJC: Swollen joint count; TJC: Tender joint count; VAS: Visual analog scale.\nTable 2 shows that there was a high correlation among all four index scores; the correlation coefficients were all >0.9 (P < 0.001).

The mean DAS28-ESR was significantly higher than the mean DAS28-CRP (P < 0.001). The Bland-Altman plots showed similar findings. Positive differences between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP were observed in 83% of cases, and the average difference was 0.54 (95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.58). The plot 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u> also showed that an absolute difference of ≤0.6 was observed in 14,993 patients (49.16%); 40.75% of the differences ranged from 0.6 to 1.2, and 10.09% were >1.2.\nEvery DAI classified the disease into four same categories: remission, low disease activity (LDA), moderate disease activity (MDA), and high disease activity (HDA). Four DAI pairwise comparisons are presented in cross tables 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3; Supplementary Tables 1-5, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A547]</u>. The weighted kappa score between DAS28-CRP and CDAI was the lowest (weighted kappa = 0.637), and the score between SDAI and CDAI was the highest (weighted kappa = 0.895). Almost all of the weighted kappa scores were >0.6 (P < 0.001), representing that the four indices had good consistency in classifying disease activity categories.\nConsistency analysis between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP.\n删除重复语句：<u>Consistency analysis between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP.</u>\n*P < 0.001.

The proportion of discordance between SDAI and CDAI was lowest (8.70%), and the proportion between DAS28-CRP and CDAI was highest (32.79%). While comparing DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP, 28.96% of patients were in different groups, 25.94% of patients were assigned to a higher disease activity group, and 3.02% were assigned to a lower group using DAS28-ESR. Similarly, comparing SDAI and CDAI, 6.07% of patients were assigned to a higher disease activity group, and 2.63% were assigned to a lower group using CDAI. Between DAS28-ESR and SDAI, 25.7% were in different groups, 13.4% of patients were assigned to a higher disease activity group, and 12.3% were assigned to a lower group using SDAI.

The study included 30,501 RA patients who met the enrollment criteria and were included in the database from 26 provinces in China since 2016.通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18]</u> Unlike previous studies, the majority of the study population were in remission and LDA, and we know that most of our population was in MDA or HDA. Unlike conventional clinical trials, this study was entirely a non-interventional study of real-world RA patients, so the results can be well applied to clinical practice.\nSimilar to previous studies,通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8,12]</u> there were high correlations among the four DAIs in Chinese RA patients, with Spearman rho >0.9. Compared with previous studies, the correlation between DAIs was 0.7 to 0.9, which was higher in China. Everyone seems to agree that a high degree of correlation does not imply a high degree of consistency. Many studies have used kappa coefficients to analyze the consistency between DAIs, but the kappa results have been quite different, and opposite conclusions have been obtained. In some studies,通用删除6(英):<u>[5,9,19]</u> the kappa coefficients were 0.3 to 0.5, and the consistency between DAIs was fair, while in other studies,通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> the values were approximately 0.8, so the conclusions regarding consistency between DAIs have been various. For these reasons, previous studies have generally explained the differences in disease status among the subjects involved. However, we believe that the main reason for the differences was that different studies have used different statistical methods to calculate kappa values. The result calculated by the simple kappa method was obviously lower than that of the weighted kappa method. Then, the same consistency standard was used to evaluate the results, so different conclusions were drawn. Because the variables were multiple ordered (remission, LDA, MDA, and HDA), we believe that the weighted kappa method was more appropriate. On this basis, we obtained the results that the weighted kappa between DAIs were 0.6 to 0.8, and the values were highly consistent.\nInterestingly, although there were obvious differences in consistency analysis, all of the studies agreed that DAIs were not interchangeable. Although those results were highly correlated and highly consistent among DAIs, the conclusions were also the same. Some studies used Bland-Altman plots to analyze why DAIs were not interchangeable. In this study, the absolute difference between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP was >1.2 in 10.09% of the patients, with >5% suggesting that DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP were not interchangeable. This outcome was consistent with previous studies. The plot also showed that 83% of patients had DAS28-ESR greater than DAS28-CRP, with an average difference of 0.54. A conclusion similar to previous studies was obtained: compared with DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP might underestimate the disease state and overestimate the treatment efficacy, and the threshold of DAS28-CRP might be down-regulated. In addition, we would also like to mention that the Bland-Altman method is inappropriate for comparing the consistency between SDAI and CDAI for methodological reasons.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nIf we discussed whether DAIs were interchangeable, we believe that DAIs are mainly categorical variables, rather than continuous variables. Therefore, the cross tables and the non-consistent ratios might better reflect the classification differences between indices. Previous studies have reported that the proportion of inconsistencies among the four DAIs can reach up to 50%.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,10]</u> In our study, approximately 30% of the patients were grouped differently by different DAIs. We further compared the inconsistencies of each group using the cross tables and found that SDAI and CDAI were more conservative than DAS28 in evaluating the disease state. This outcome is similar to what Gaujoux-Viala et al通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> reported: \"the main limitation of the DAS28 is a broader definition of remission.\" Therefore, we also suggest that the four indices are not interchangeable.\nSince the indices are not interchangeable, many studies have considered some ways to improve the grouping consistency between indices; the common way has been to revise the cutoff values for DAIs. The re-definition of the optimal remission cutoff values is an exploratory attempt. There is no consensus on how to revise the current cutoff values. We set SDAI ≤3.3 as the standard and used ROC curves to determine the new remission thresholds for DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP, and CDAI. SDAI ≤3.3 is considered the remission standard for the following two reasons. 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Compared with the DAS28, the SDAI formula is simpler, and previous studies have shown that the SDAI is more conservative than the DAS28. Therefore, similar articles have mostly chosen the SDAI as the standard. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> We chose this standard to render our results comparable with other foreign studies. Our results were different from most previous studies. Analyzing the reasons, the study population and the patients’ disease states were different. Moreover, the analytical methods used were different. In Fleischmann research, three methods were used to calculate the average value, and the ROC curve analysis obtained higher cutoff values using the maximum Youden index. Our purpose is to prove that the same patient is categorized into different disease activity groups according to different DAI cutoff values. Considering one index as the standard, the calculated cutoff values of other indices are quite different from the current criteria. Therefore, different indices are not interchangeable, and we might also attempt to evaluate the conservatism of each DAI.\nIn addition, some studies have suggested revising the formula for DAS28. Others have suggested that factors that could affect DAIs, such as sex and age, be added to the formula. However, all of the authors noted that these were only suggestions and required further validation in large samples and different populations. Here, we must point out that assessing the entire population is almost impossible, so developing a universal formula is difficult. Moreover, a potential problem of amending or adding more variables to the existing formula is that it could cause the DAIs to become more complicated, thereby reducing their use in clinical practice. Considering the clinical practical application, the SDAI and CDAI have great advantages because of their simple formulas, and they might also be easier to understand by patients and might therefore enhance adherence to treatment regimens.\nOur study had several limitations. First, this study was a cross-sectional study, and it was not possible to compare the effects of different DAIs on disease improvement and analyze the evolution of disagreements over time. Second, China is a multi-ethnic country, and our study did not group by race, so it might have ignored the impact of ethnic minorities on DAIs.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Finally, we did not consider other possible confounding factors as grouping variables, such as treatment, course of the disease, etc.\nTo conclude, based on a large number of detailed and accurate data from the CREDIT database, we analyzed and compared the four DAIs of RA patients in China for the first time. There is a high degree of correlation and large weighted kappa values among RA DAIs in China. However, approximately 30% of the patients were grouped differently by different DAIs, which could lead to a discrepancy in treatment, so we believe that the DAIs are interchangeable. The SDAI and CDAI are more conservative than the DAS28 in evaluating the disease state. Considering the purpose of targeted treatment, the SDAI and CDAI might be more reliable and convenient than DAS28. In the future, more follow-up studies of DAIs in assessing treatment improvement should be performed.", "index": 7082, "show": true, "start": 7082, "end": 7307, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:40:21", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:41:02", "cost": 41.384}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:41:02", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:40:21"}

Alzheimer′s disease (AD) is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking, and behavior. Using the available literature, this review will examine whether there is any effect of LDR on AD. The available evidence shows that although LDR can alter the expression of some genes related to AD such as Apbb1, Lrp1, and Il1α，these alterations do not cause AD-like syndromes in animals, suggesting that LDR may also simultaneously upregulate several protective mechanisms that prevent the eventual development of AD. Furthermore, LDR seems capable of improving the symptoms of AD, as evidenced by the experience of an 81-year-old female AD patient. This patient was diagnosed with AD more than 10 years ago and gradually progressed to advanced AD in 2015, despite routine treatment. The patient then received about 12 computed tomography scans (about 40 mGy each) up until Nov. 2017, which significantly improved her quality of life and reduced several AD symptoms. The improvement in this patient′s medical condition led to a few recent clinical trials investigating the effects of LDR on AD. To date, there is no efficient therapy available for AD, thus whether exposure to LDR at 100 mGy can provide a preventive or therapeutic effect for AD is an important issue. If LDR is a potential treatment for AD, as suggested by this reported case, this non-invasive approach would also bear the merit that it would be unlikely to cause a significant radiation health risk, as the LDR could be delivered locally to the head without any impact on other organs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:18:03", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:18:13", "cost": 9.85}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:18:11", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:18:01"}

The patients in the ozone therapy group were treated with basic treatments plus ozone therapy system. Basic autohemotherapy was used. One hundred milliliter venous blood was drawn from each patient,and was mixed with 100 ml (35 μg/ml) medical ozone and then was returned the blood to the patient intravenously, once every other day for 20 days. Only the basic treatments were given to the control group. PRA, All, ALD, renal blood flow and damage to renal function of the two groups before treatment and 20 days after treatment were compared. Survival rates were also compared.Results Twenty days after the treatment, in ozone therapy group, PRA was (1.31±0.12) ng·ml-1·h-1, All (111.25±17.35)pg/ml, ALD (251.31 ±22.60) pg/ml, which decreased significantly compared with those before treatment (PRA (2.23±0.13)ng·ml-1 ·h1, AⅡ (155.18±19.13) pg/ml, ALD (405.31±29.88) pg/ml, t=4.67-14.23, P &lt;0.01), also lower than those of control group 20 days after the treatment (PRA (2.02±0.11) ng·ml-1·h-1, All (162.21±15.32) pg/ml, ALD (401.20±35.02) pg/ml,t=4.97-15.61, P &lt;0.01); renal blood flow was (175.15±28.20) ml/min, which increased compared with that before the treatment ((125.68±21.25) ml/min) and was higher than that of control group 20 days after the treatment ((128.59±23.15)ml/min, t=4.78, 4.61, P &lt;0.01). Renal damage occurred in 2 cases (5%) in ozone therapy group, less than that in control group (9 cases, 21%) (X2=5.295, P &lt;0.05). Thirty-three cases (77%) in ozone therapy group vs. 16 cases (38%) in control group survived (X2=12.993, P&lt;0.01).Conclusions Basic treatment plus medical ozone therapy for patients with chronic severe hepatitis could decrease PRA, All and ALD levels significantly increase renal blood flow, prevent renal damage to certain extent and improve survival rate of the patients。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:41:51", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:41:58", "cost": 7.826}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:41:58", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:41:50"}

Hand-assisted laparoscopic technique was designed to facilitate the performance of difficult laparoscopic procedure. This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy and superiority of hand-assisted laparoscopic splenectomy (HALS) for splenomegaly.Methods From November 1994 to January 2006, 36 patients with splenomegaly (final spleen weight ＞700 g) were treated with laparoscopic operations for splenectomy in our hospital. Conventional LS was performed in 16 patients (7men and 9 women, group 1) and HALS in the other 20 patients (12 men and 8 women, group 2). The patients' features,intraoperative details and the postoperative outcomes in the both groups were compared.Results The both groups were comparable in the terms of patient's age ((38±12) years vs (43±14)years, P＞0.05), the greatest splenic diameter ((24±5)cm vs (27±7)cm, P＞0.05), preoperative platelet count ((118±94)×109/L vs (97±81)×109/L,P＞0.05) and diagnosis. Compared with LS group, operation time ((195±71) minutes vs (141±64) minutes, P＜0.05) was shorter, intraoperative blood loss ((138±80)ml vs (86±45)ml, P＜0.05) and conversion rate (4/16 vs 0/20, P＜0.05) were lower, but hospital stay ((5.3±3.8) days vs (7.4±1.6) days, P＜0.05) was longer in HALS group.

It accounts for approximately 1% of all intracranial tumors and commonly locates in the cerebellopontine angle, parasellar region, and the fourth ventricle. Cerebrospinal fluid density on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with nonenhancing is their typical images. However, epidermoid cysts occurring in an uncommon location with atypical MRI may cause the difficult diagnosis. While the radiological and pathological features of atypical epidermoid cysts have still been unclear, we reported an epidermoid cyst that was located in facies convexa cerebri and presented with atypical images.\nA 17-year-old girl was experienced for few minutes’ unconsciousness, three times in recent 3 months. Each time before faint, she could feel intermittent numbness in both lower limbs, developing from distal to proximal, following some moderate to intense exercise. No positive family history was obtained. Physical examination revealed that the only neurological positive sign was hypoesthesia in her left lower extremity. Lesion showed block mass in parietal lobe closed to the parietal bone with iso- or hypo-intensity on T1-weighted MRI, and hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI. There was no empty shadow in the lesion due to the absence of vascular flow and the boundary remained clear. Middle structure shifting was not found. Simultaneously, remarkable enhancing was not discovered after Gd-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid administration 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a, Figure 1b, Figure 1c]</u>. Lesion also showed the hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Meanwhile, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) showed low creatine, choline, N-acetylaspartate (creatine and N-acetylaspartate were obvious), and inverted peak of lactate.\nThe patient underwent surgery by right parietal approach to the parietal lobe. Tumor with pearly appearance, approximately 3 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm, was in facies convexa cerebri. Taking attention to protecting superior sagittal sinus and avoiding rupture of the cyst, the neurosurgeon totally resected the tumor. Yellow and cheese-like cyst contents emerged after splitting the tumor. Intraoperative frozen pathology declared keratosis and squamous epithelium with the consideration of epidermoid cyst.\nSlight numbness in the left leg was left over without any other neurological deficits after operation. During the hospitalization, unconsciousness was not relieved. The patient was discharged on the 7th day after surgery without any neurological deterioration. On the day of discharge, postoperative pathology also confirmed diagnosis of epidermoid cyst according to remarkable keratosis and squamous epithelium. Moreover, it showed hemorrhage in tumor as arrows pointing 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1d]</u>. Followed up for 6 months, the symptom of the patient had improved without any unconsciousness.\nIntracranial epidermoid cysts are slow-growing benign tumors, arising from the inclusion of ectodermal tissue during the neural tube closure or formation of the secondary cerebral vesicles. So far, this is the first case of epidermoid cyst that was located in the facies convexa cerebri with atypical images. In preoperative MRI, iso- or hypo-intensity on T1-weighted and hyperintensity on T2-weighted without conspicuous enhance offered little hint of actual diagnosis. Nevertheless, with the help of histopathology, we speculated that atypical MRI was due to hemorrhage in the epidermoid cyst. In general, atypical MRI in intracranial epidermoid cysts may be attributed to factors of high proteinaceous content or abundance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the cyst, creamy texture or nonsolid of the cyst contents, and calcification and hemorrhage within the cyst.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Hemorrhage of epidermoid cyst can lead to atypical images in the form of variable signal intensity on MRI, according to the age of the bleed.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> In 2013, Ren et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> verified hemorrhage in 21 patients of 24 atypical intracranial epidermoid cysts. Accordingly, we confirmed that atypical MRI rests ascribable to spontaneous hemorrhage in the case.\nMoreover, we also conducted MRS and DWI before operation. DWI images showed markedly restricted diffusion with high signal intensity, the same as typical DWI findings. MRS images demonstrated low creatine, choline, N-acetylaspartate (creatine and N-acetylaspartate were obvious), and inverted peak of lactate, differing with widely accepted typical spectrum of an intracranial epidermoid cyst, which presents with a high lactate peak at 1.3 ppm with a virtual absence of the normal brain metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, creatine, and choline).通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> In 2013, Schoors et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> described that glycolysis had influence on activating and restraining pathological neovascularization. As MRS images prompted reduced glycolysis, we inferred the lesion had pathological neovascularization in the progress of this case.\nIn intracranial epidermoid cyst, total removal of lesion is the definitive and ideal treatment. Simultaneously, to reach none chemical inflammation and better outcome, clearing free pieces of tumor and protecting important vessels and functional region become indispensable. As a result, a good outcome of our patient was affirmed in follow-up.\nIn brief, epidermoid cyst presenting with atypical images located in facies convexa cerebri is very rare. Atypical magnetic resonance findings can be caused by hemorrhage within epidermoid cysts. Fluctuation of lactate in lesion gives hint of pathological neovascularization. To achieve good outcome, thorough preoperative magnetic resonance examination and intraoperative total resection become necessary in similar cases.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:22:37", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:23:09", "cost": 32.267}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:23:08", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:22:35"}

Follow-up was achieved by telephone call or searching of the medical records, which was ended on December 31, 2016.\nThe routine LDLT procedures were performed using a right-lobe graft by the same surgical team; only three recipients underwent left lobe graft transplantation. The donor operation began with cholecystectomy, followed by dissociation of the right lobe. All recipients underwent duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis.\nInduction of anesthesia was achieved by a total intravenous injection with propofol, midazolam, and fentanyl. Rocuronium or vecuronium was used to facilitate intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol and remifentanil. Neuromuscular blockade, by cisatracurium or vecuronium, was maintained throughout surgery. Invasive arterial pressure and central venous pressure were routinely monitored. Other intraoperative monitoring included constant end-tidal CO2 partial pressure, 5-lead electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry.\nBecause the supply of blood products is insufficient compared to the massive consumption in China, our center adopted a strict blood transfusion protocol. Allogeneic packed RBCs (PRBCs) were transfused for hemoglobin <70 g/L or hematocrit <0.20, with a goal of maintaining hematocrit between 0.25 and 0.30. The utilization of other blood products such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets was decided based on both laboratory values (international normalized ratio [INR] >2.0 and platelet count <20 × 109/L) and clinical criteria such as wound hemorrhage or blood loss not corrected by surgical management.\nOnly five recent recipients received irradiated PRBCs, while the others were transfused with nonirradiated blood products. All platelets used in our center were apheresis platelets, in which 1 unit was concentrated from a single donor (1 unit contains 2.5 × 1011 platelets). Although we most often used FFP for plasma transfusion, FP was also occasionally transfused (1 unit = 100 ml). All RBCs used were PRBCs, in which 1 unit was concentrated from 200 ml of whole blood.\nRecipients were admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) specialized for LT immediately after the surgery. Blood tests including blood cell counts, coagulation, liver biochemistry, and renal function were implemented daily for 3 weeks after LDLT. Doppler ultrasonography was used to monitor the vascular flow in the graft. All recipients received immunosuppression regimens based on tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil with or without corticosteroid. When they were stable, recipients were transferred to the clinical ward for further therapy. During the postoperative period, the need for blood products was determined by the surgeons based on, but not limited to, laboratory findings such as blood cell counts and coagulation studies.\nAll data involving recipients and donors, from demographic baseline to surgical factors, were acquired by scrutinizing the recipients’ electronic medical records. When necessary, the original recipient paper records were reviewed. A total of 24 risk factors associated with short- or long-term outcomes were selected by reviewing the literature.\nThus, the recipient-related valuables, for example, age, gender, diagnosis, previous abdominal surgery, body weight, graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR, %), Child-Pugh classification, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score calculated with the most recent blood test results available before LDLT, were all included.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,6,24,25,26,27,28,29]</u> MELD score = 9.6 × Ln creatinine (mg/dl) + 3.8 × Ln bilirubin (mg/dl) + 11.2 × Ln (INR) + 6.4 × etiology (biliary or alcoholic cirrhosis was 0, otherwise 1).通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Donor-related variables such as donor age, gender, and graft weight were also collected.通用删除6(英):<u>[24,31]</u> Meanwhile, the following risk factors during the surgery were noted: cold ischemic time (min), warm ischemic time (min), operating time (min), and intraoperative blood loss (L).通用删除6(英):<u>[20,25,31]</u> The consumption of blood products during the operation and for 48 h postoperatively was also recorded (blood transfusions were mostly performed during this period in our center). ABO blood group comparison and the most recent preoperative laboratory values of serum alanine transaminase, serum total bilirubin level, creatinine level, hemoglobin, platelet count, and INR were also documented.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,22]</u>\nThe short-term outcomes were accessed by 90-day cumulative survival, and the long-term outcomes were evaluated by overall survival. Patient survival was defined as the time period between transplantation and the end of follow-up or patient death. In this study, missing data per variable was <3%. No patient was lost to follow-up.\nThe continuous and categorical variables were expressed as median (Q1–Q3) and number (%), respectively. When necessary, continuous variables were cut off by clinical threshold or receiver-operating characteristics (ROCs) curve. Categorical variables were compared by Pearson’s Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were compared by the Mann-Whitney U-test. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and the log-rank test were used for recipient survival analysis. A univariate Cox analysis was performed to determine risk factors associated with recipient survival. Factors with P < 0.10 were selected as potential risk factors and were further analyzed in a multivariate Cox proportional-hazard mode with forward stepwise selection. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each variable. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors associated with platelet transfusion. For the purpose of mitigating impact from confounding factors, propensity score analysis was also utilized. The propensity score is the probability of treatment distribution conditional on observed baseline characteristics. Patients who shared a similar value of the propensity score had a similar distribution of baseline covariates to adjust for potential confounders.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Two-sided level of significance was set at P < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using the software SPSS Statistics version 23.0 (IBM Corp. New York, USA).\nA total of 126 recipients who underwent adult-to-adult LDLT between December 1, 2006, and December 1, 2015, were included in this retrospective study. Recipient and donor characteristics and demographics, including preoperative laboratory values and potential surgical-related risk factors, are summarized in Table 1. Recipients with or without apheresis platelet transfusion were compared. Compared to recipients without apheresis platelet transfusion, the MELD score, Child-Pugh classification, blood loss, total bilirubin level, and INR were significantly higher and hemoglobin and platelet counts were lower in those with apheresis platelet transfusion. Not surprisingly, recipients with apheresis platelet transfusion also received more PRBCs and FFP. When analyzing the length of hospital stay, those recipients who died during the hospitalization were excluded (n = 17). Recipients who received platelets had longer hospital stays (39 通用删除6(英):<u>[32–58]</u> days vs. 32 通用删除6(英):<u>[24–42]</u> days, P = 0.001). The donors’ age (23 通用删除6(英):<u>[22–27]</u> years vs. 25 通用删除6(英):<u>[22- 27]</u> years, P = 0.122) and gender (male/female: 62/7 vs. 54/3, P = 0.313) were comparable between recipients with and without apheresis platelet transfusion.\nRecipients characteristics and demographics in this study\n删除重复语句：<u>Recipients characteristics and demographics in this study</u>\nData are presented as median (Q1–Q3), n or n (%). *Z values, otherwise Chi-square values. HBV: Hepatitis B virus; GRWR: Graft-to-recipient weight ratio; MELD: Model for end-stage liver disease; ALT: Alanine transaminase; INR: International normalized ratio; PRBC: Packed red blood cell; FFP: Fresh frozen plasma; PLTs: Platelets.\nAll 126 recipients were transfused with FFP, 119 (94.4%) recipients received PRBCs, and 57 (45.2%) patients received apheresis platelets. The median consumption of blood products during surgery and 48 h postoperatively was 23 通用删除7(英):<u>(19–33)</u> U of FFP, 11 通用删除7(英):<u>(6–19)</u> U of PRBCs, and 0 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–1)</u> U of apheresis platelets, as shown in Table 1. No whole blood was administered and only two recipients required cell salvage technology.\nTo determine the variables associated with perioperative platelet transfusion, those with P < 0.05, such as the MELD score, Child-Pugh classification, PRBCs, FFP, blood loss, total bilirubin level, INR, hemoglobin, and platelet counts were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis, which revealed that only lower preoperative platelet count (odds ratio OR = 0.969, 95% CI: 0.956- 0.983, P < 0.001), higher MELD score, (OR = 1.083, 95% CI: 1.024–1.146, P = 0.005), and more PRBCs transfusion (OR = 1.129, 95% CI: 1.058–1.204, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of perioperative platelet transfusion. No collinearity was recognized after collinearity determination among these three factors.\nThe average survival time of this population was 91 months and the median survival time was longer than 120 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 89.9%, 78.1%, and 76.6%, respectively, in recipients who did not receive platelets. Among recipients transfused with platelets, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 75.4%, 71.8%, and 70.1%, respectively. The log-rank test was performed and no significant differences were found between two groups (P = 0.229).\nTherefore, the Cox proportional-hazards model was applied for adjusting confounders. The results of the univariate analysis of the potential risk factors for overall survival are summarized in Table 2. In the multivariate analysis, while the P value of the serum creatinine level was <0.05, it was still replaced by the MELD score, which was calculated using the creatinine level. Obviously, the MELD score was a better indicator of preoperative disease severity. Transfusion requirements have also been considered to be surrogates for sicker patients and introducing the MELD score into the multivariate analysis can diminish confounders. Thus, recipients’ age, ABO blood group comparison, MELD score, blood loss, operating time, units of PRBCs, FFP, platelets, as well as preoperative platelet count were entered into the multivariate Cox model using forward selection. The results still suggested that platelet transfusion had no effect on overall survival. Nevertheless, recipients' age (HR = 1.045, 95% CI: 1.005–1.086, P = 0.025), ABO blood group comparison (HR = 2.990, 95% CI: 1.341–6.669, P = 0.007), and units of PRBCs (HR = 1.036, 95% CI: 1.006–1.067, P = 0.018) were independent risk factors 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>. A ROCs curve analysis and Youden’s index were used to define the ideal cutoff points; 10 U of PRBCs (area under the curve = 0.655, P = 0.008) was decided as the appropriate cutoff value that offered the best prediction for survival (sensitivity = 0.794, specificity = 0.500).\nUnivariate analysis of survival for recipients receiving living donor liver transplantation in this study\n删除重复语句：<u>Univariate analysis of survival for recipients receiving living donor liver transplantation in this study</u>\nHBV: Hepatitis B virus; GRWR: Graft-to-recipient weight ratio; MELD: Model for end-stage liver disease; ALT: Alanine transaminase; INR: International normalized ratio; HR: Hazard ratio; CI: Confidence interval; FFP: Fresh frozen plasma; PLTs: Platelets; PRBC: Packed red blood cell.\nMultivariate Cox proportional-hazards model for survival\n删除重复语句：<u>Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model for survival</u>\nGRWR: Graft-to-recipient weight ratio; MELD: Model for end-stage liver disease; HR: Hazard ratio; CI: Confidence interval; PRBC: Packed red blood cell; FFP: Fresh frozen plasma; PLTs: Platelets.\nThe Schoenfeld residuals test was performed and proved this Cox model to be satisfied with the proportional hazards assumption. To further verify the conclusion, the propensity score was calculated by performing a propensity score matching program in SPSS software, which made the baseline covariates listed in Table 1 balanced (except for hospital stay). We then made covariate adjustment using the propensity score as described by Austin and Mamdani.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> The estimated score was introduced into the multivariate Cox analysis as an independent covariate; other variables such as the recipient’s age, ABO group comparison, and units of PRBCs were still considered as independent risk factors. The final propensity score-adjustment HR was 1.041 (1.002–1.081) for recipient’s age, 3.080 (1.380–6.876) for ABO group comparison, and 1.058 (1.015–1.103) for units of PRBCs.\nAlthough platelet transfusion was not regarded as a risk factor for overall survival, we found that it was associated with 90-day cumulative survival via K-M curve and log-rank test, as shown in Figure 2. Similar procedures were processed as described above. The results of the univariate analysis are shown in Table 2. The GRWR was selected instead of graft weight and recipient body weight and INR was replaced by MELD score. Blood loss and preoperative platelet count were added to adjust confounders. Thus, GRWR, blood loss, platelet count, MELD score, ABO group comparison, units of PRBCs, FFP, and platelets were entered into the multivariate Cox model 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>. The results suggested that unit of platelets (HR = 3.103, 95% CI: 1.720–5.600, P < 0.001) was an independent risk factor and high preoperative platelet count (>50 × 109/L) was an independent protective factor (HR = 0.170, 95% CI: 0.040–0.730, P = 0.017) for 90-day survival. One unit of platelets (area under the curve = 0.687, P = 0.016) was decided as the appropriate cutoff value that offered sensitivity with 0.750 and specificity with 0.591 to the best prediction for survival by ROC curve analysis. When propensity score-adjustment analysis was performed, the adjusted HR was 3.705 (1.784–7.094) for units of platelets and 0.184 (0.040–0.845) for platelet count.\nAdult-to-adult LDLT, evolved from pediatric LT, has been regarded as a practical cure for end-stage liver diseases in recent decades, particularly in Asian countries where cultural or religious values impact access to cadavers. Although blood loss and perioperative blood transfusion (PBT) during LT have been significantly decreased with enhanced surgical techniques and anesthetic management, the impact of blood products on recipient outcomes should still be considered carefully. Previous studies have demonstrated that PBT was linked with worse outcomes in noncardiac surgery通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> and in solid malignancy resection such as gastric operations.通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>\nHowever, little information about PBT in LDLT is known. Therefore, we studied LDLT recipients and confirmed that single-donor apheresis platelets played a negative role in 90-day survival as did pooled random donor platelets.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Pooled platelet concentrates are isolated from donated whole blood with the plasma method or buffy coat (BC) method. The former method prepares platelet-rich plasma by centrifuging whole blood softly at first and then spinning the plasma hard to sediment and separate platelets. Multiple units (generally 5–10) are pooled to create an adult dose shortly before transfusion. With the BC method, whole blood is centrifuged hard directly to form the BC layer, which contains PRBCs, leukocytes, and platelets. When pools of 4 or 5 BCs are prepared, the platelet-rich supernatant is made through soft-spin centrifugation.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> Single-donor platelets (SDPs) can be obtained by apheresis, which collects platelet concentrates from a single donor using a cell separator and the remainder of blood cells are simultaneously returned to the donor via the device. Apparently, whole-blood-derived platelet (WBDP) has higher donor exposure and is associated with a higher incidence of viral transmission and allergic transfusion reaction as expected.通用删除6(英):<u>[36,37]</u> Various cytokines and chemokines, histamine, for instance, accumulating during the storage of plasma play important roles in allergic reactions.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>\nWe therefore hypothesized that low survival rates associated with platelet transfusion described in previous research may contribute to WBDP. Nevertheless, this retrospective study revealed that SDP is an independent risk factor on 90-day survival. Pereboom et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> retrospectively analyzed their clinical data and attributed this platelet-associated mortality in DDLT recipients to acute lung injury (ALI). Furthermore, perioperative platelet transfusion was also identified as a risk factor in lung transplantation and coronary artery bypass graft surgery.通用删除6(英):<u>[38,39]</u> Platelets are plasma-rich blood products, passive transfer of antileukocyte antibodies via plasma and the accumulation of inflammatory mediators during storage may contribute to lung endothelial injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Meanwhile, platelets facilitated the formation of postoperative thrombosis and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by induction of sinusoidal endothelial cell apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[23,40]</u> However, focused on LDLT, Han et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> found liver regeneration to increase in relation to the amount of platelet transfusion and platelet count postreperfusion. To our knowledge, platelets influence tissue regeneration by secreting various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors; controlling of apoptosis; and interactions with progenitor cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> Platelet-derived serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine was thought to stimulate hepatocyte mitosis in vitro and was responsible for liver regeneration in healthy liver donors.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> We speculated that the adverse effect of platelets in enhancing ALI was superior to its impact on liver regeneration in the early period, so that low 90-day survival was observed. This indicated that we should not broaden the criteria for platelet transfusion only because platelets can facilitate liver regeneration. However, it is interesting to us that SDP had no impact on overall survival in this study. That may be the result of inflammation, I/R injury, or thrombosis formation associated with platelets that were only predominant for a short period. Whether platelets play an important role in long-term follow-up will require additional research.\nRegarding PRBC transfusion, previous results indicated that it was decreased 1-, 2-, and 5-year and the overall survival rate in recipients with LT.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7,8,12,15,16,17]</u> We confirmed that perioperative PRBCs utilization, especially more than 10 units for LDLT, was indeed an independent risk factor for overall survival in the multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model, but we also noticed that there was no effect on 90-day survival. Because a tiny minority of patients did not receive PRBCs, we are not convinced that PRBCs have no effect on short-term outcomes. Moreover, Benson et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> had already reported that PRBCs increased the risk of postoperative infection in a dose-dependent manner. They also implied that plasma-enriched products promoted the development of transfusion-related ALI. In addition, a large PRBCs transfusion may lead to iron overload, which may give rise to free radicals that eventually damage the cells and impair organ function. Residual donor leukocytes in PRBCs, human leukocyte antigen peptides, bioactive lipids, and preservation lesion were responsible for poor outcomes after PRBCs transfusion. Massive PRBCs transfusion will also lead to immunologic adverse effects and metabolic derangements and may facilitate the formation of hepatic artery thrombosis after LT.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> Thus, we should avoid large PRBCs transfusions and use leukocyte reduction techniques to improve outcomes.\nFFP was transfused more often in recipients with LT; however, few studies focused on it. Massicotte et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> observed that any amount of intraoperative plasma were decreased 1-year survival in DDLT. Nacoti et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> also found that FFP was an independent risk factor for pediatric LT. However, other research as well as ours regarding FFP mostly inferred that it was not associated with poor survival.\nIn this study, we affirmed that recipients' age and ABO blood group comparisons were independent risk factors for LDLT recipients in terms of overall survival and high preoperative platelet count was a protective factor for 90-day survival.\nAs far as we know, antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) can be induced by anti-donor ABO antibodies. Methods of desensitization to alleviate AMR such as plasmapheresis, splenectomy, aggressive immunosuppression, and intravenous immunoglobulin may result in unsatisfactory outcomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> Although no ABO-incomparable transplantation was performed in this population, the result showed that long-term outcomes of ABO-identical transplantation were still better than ABO-compatible ones. As the majority of the previous research only focused on the discrepancy between ABO-compatible and ABO-incompatible LT, whether ABO-identical LT was really superior to ABO-compatible LT remains unknown. We supposed that it may share a similar mechanism as the ABO-incompatible LT, leading to worse outcomes such as high occurrence of rejection, severe infection, and biliary duct and vascular complications. As for advanced age, worse outcomes are reported earlier, especially for Child-Pugh class C patients. Elderly recipients may had a worse response to anti-infection therapy once they were admitted to ICU after LT and may suffer an increased incidence of malignancies.通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45]</u> GRWR and MELD score were not identified as risk factors in univariate and multivariate analyses possibly because of the small sample size.\nSeveral limitations existed in the present study. First, this study was conducted by retrospectively reviewing previous clinical data, so we could not prove causality between blood transfusion and patient’s survival, the statistical associations of perioperative SDP (apheresis) and RBC transfusion with early- and late-term postoperative mortality after LDLT might not be causal relationship. Although we had estimated sample size by mimicking a prospective cohort study focusing on platelet transfusion before data collection, the 66 patients necessary in the exposure and control groups were not satisfied in this study. Only 57 recipients had a perioperative platelet transfusion experience. The small total sample size, a relatively large proportion of censored data, and risk factors such as intraoperative adverse cardiovascular events, use of inotropic agents, and surgical complications were not taken into consideration may have led to the weakness of the multivariate Cox model. Therefore, a large sample, multicenter, prospective study is necessary. Another criticism was that we did not take preoperative blood transfusions and other postoperative related risk factors into consideration. Finally, graft survival might be as important as patient survival and it should be considered as an outcome criterion. Unfortunately, this information was missed in medical records for numerous patients during that time.\nIn conclusion, this study found that perioperative apheresis platelet transfusion was associated with lower 90-day survival and high preoperative platelet count was a protective factor for LDLT recipients. However, platelets had no effect on overall survival. We also recognized that lower preoperative platelet count, higher MELD score and more PRBCs transfusions were independent predictors for perioperative platelet transfusion. Meanwhile, we confirmed the relationship between PRBC transfusion and poor overall survival in Cox analysis. Apart from PRBCs, the recipient’s age and ABO-blood group comparison were identified as independent risks factors for overall survival in LDLT recipients. Furthermore, we did not find that FFP transfusion influenced a patient’s short- or long-term outcomes. Although we could not reach a direct causal conclusion, we still considered that the results of this study are beneficial to anesthesiologists and surgeons when they decide whether to use blood products in LDLT.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "删除2：(the China Organ Transplant Response System was officially launched in 2011, since that time, liver donation after cardiac death surged)", "content": "【0】Liver transplantation (LT) has been considered one of the most effective treatments for patients with end-stage liver disease. However, a remaining challenge for the transplantation community is a relative scarcity of deceased donor graft.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> Therefore, in addition to deceased donor LT (DDLT), living donor LT (LDLT) has emerged as a solution to the lack of deceased donor organs and has effectively expanded the donor pool.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Although it is a complicated surgical procedure that deals with the right or left lobe and dramatic physiological changes resulting from liver regeneration,通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> a recent meta-analysis revealed that LDLT was associated with a higher rate of surgical complications but with no significant difference in perioperative mortality compared to DDLT.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>\nBoth DDLT and LDLT recipients often require blood transfusion during surgery or in the postoperative period because of coagulation defects or severe bleeding from the procedure itself.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u> Although the utilization of blood products such as red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, and plasma has decreased in recent decades, its detriment to recipients cannot be ignored. The potential hazards of allogeneic blood transfusion include viral or bacterial transmission, allergic reaction, disordered immunoreaction, transfusion-related lung injury, and kidney failure.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Many previous studies have demonstrated that RBC transfusion is associated with postoperative complications and that it is an independent risk factor for survival after DDLT通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]</u> or LDLT.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u> Nevertheless, studies on platelet transfusion are rare and the results are controversial.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,11,13,19,20,21,22]</u> Moreover, platelets had already been supposed to stimulate hepatocyte mitosis and accelerate liver regeneration in healthy liver donors.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> Considering that the previous research was mostly based on DDLT, we conducted this retrospective study to assess the relationship between blood transfusion and the outcomes of LDLT which include small-for-size syndrome and liver regeneration, focusing in particular on the influence of apheresis platelets.\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, with a waiver of informed consent due to the retrospective study design.\nA search of the electronic medical records in the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, ranging from December 1, 2006, to December 1, 2015, identified a total of 139 recipients undergoing LDLT. All donors were adults who were related to the recipients. All procedures surrounding LDLT were strictly supervised by the ethics community. No donors suffered severe complications or death. Pediatric transplantations (age <18 years; n = 6), retransplantations (n = 5), and combined organ transplantations (n = 1) were excluded from this study.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Recipient who died during surgery was also excluded (n = 1). Thus, 126 recipients who underwent their first adult-to-adult LDLT were included in the study, in which 94% of patients received LDLT before 2012 删除2：<u>(the China Organ Transplant Response System was officially launched in 2011, since that time, liver donation after cardiac death surged)</u>. Follow-up was achieved by telephone call or searching of the medical records, which was ended on December 31, 2016.\nThe routine LDLT procedures were performed using a right-lobe graft by the same surgical team; only three recipients underwent left lobe graft transplantation. The donor operation began with cholecystectomy, followed by dissociation of the right lobe. All recipients underwent duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis.\nInduction of anesthesia was achieved by a total intravenous injection with propofol, midazolam, and fentanyl. Rocuronium or vecuronium was used to facilitate intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol and remifentanil. Neuromuscular blockade, by cisatracurium or vecuronium, was maintained throughout surgery. Invasive arterial pressure and central venous pressure were routinely monitored. Other intraoperative monitoring included constant end-tidal CO2 partial pressure, 5-lead electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry.\nBecause the supply of blood products is insufficient compared to the massive consumption in China, our center adopted a strict blood transfusion protocol. Allogeneic packed RBCs (PRBCs) were transfused for hemoglobin <70 g/L or hematocrit <0.20, with a goal of maintaining hematocrit between 0.25 and 0.30. The utilization of other blood products such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets was decided based on both laboratory values (international normalized ratio [INR] >2.0 and platelet count <20 × 109/L) and clinical criteria such as wound hemorrhage or blood loss not corrected by surgical management.\nOnly five recent recipients received irradiated PRBCs, while the others were transfused with nonirradiated blood products. All platelets used in our center were apheresis platelets, in which 1 unit was concentrated from a single donor (1 unit contains 2.5 × 1011 platelets). Although we most often used FFP for plasma transfusion, FP was also occasionally transfused (1 unit = 100 ml). All RBCs used were PRBCs, in which 1 unit was concentrated from 200 ml of whole blood.\nRecipients were admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) specialized for LT immediately after the surgery. Blood tests including blood cell counts, coagulation, liver biochemistry, and renal function were implemented daily for 3 weeks after LDLT. Doppler ultrasonography was used to monitor the vascular flow in the graft. All recipients received immunosuppression regimens based on tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil with or without corticosteroid. When they were stable, recipients were transferred to the clinical ward for further therapy. During the postoperative period, the need for blood products was determined by the surgeons based on, but not limited to, laboratory findings such as blood cell counts and coagulation studies.\nAll data involving recipients and donors, from demographic baseline to surgical factors, were acquired by scrutinizing the recipients’ electronic medical records. When necessary, the original recipient paper records were reviewed. A total of 24 risk factors associated with short- or long-term outcomes were selected by reviewing the literature.\nThus, the recipient-related valuables, for example, age, gender, diagnosis, previous abdominal surgery, body weight, graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR, %), Child-Pugh classification, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score calculated with the most recent blood test results available before LDLT, were all included.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,6,24,25,26,27,28,29]</u> MELD score = 9.6 × Ln creatinine (mg/dl) + 3.8 × Ln bilirubin (mg/dl) + 11.2 × Ln (INR) + 6.4 × etiology (biliary or alcoholic cirrhosis was 0, otherwise 1).通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Donor-related variables such as donor age, gender, and graft weight were also collected.通用删除6(英):<u>[24,31]</u> Meanwhile, the following risk factors during the surgery were noted: cold ischemic time (min), warm ischemic time (min), operating time (min), and intraoperative blood loss (L).通用删除6(英):<u>[20,25,31]</u> The consumption of blood products during the operation and for 48 h postoperatively was also recorded (blood transfusions were mostly performed during this period in our center). ABO blood group comparison and the most recent preoperative laboratory values of serum alanine transaminase, serum total bilirubin level, creatinine level, hemoglobin, platelet count, and INR were also documented.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,22]</u>\nThe short-term outcomes were accessed by 90-day cumulative survival, and the long-term outcomes were evaluated by overall survival. Patient survival was defined as the time period between transplantation and the end of follow-up or patient death. In this study, missing data per variable was <3%. No patient was lost to follow-up.\nThe continuous and categorical variables were expressed as median (Q1–Q3) and number (%), respectively. When necessary, continuous variables were cut off by clinical threshold or receiver-operating characteristics (ROCs) curve. Categorical variables were compared by Pearson’s Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were compared by the Mann-Whitney U-test. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and the log-rank test were used for recipient survival analysis. A univariate Cox analysis was performed to determine risk factors associated with recipient survival. Factors with P < 0.10 were selected as potential risk factors and were further analyzed in a multivariate Cox proportional-hazard mode with forward stepwise selection. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each variable. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors associated with platelet transfusion. For the purpose of mitigating impact from confounding factors, propensity score analysis was also utilized. The propensity score is the probability of treatment distribution conditional on observed baseline characteristics. Patients who shared a similar value of the propensity score had a similar distribution of baseline covariates to adjust for potential confounders.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Two-sided level of significance was set at P < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using the software SPSS Statistics version 23.0 (IBM Corp. New York, USA).\nA total of 126 recipients who underwent adult-to-adult LDLT between December 1, 2006, and December 1, 2015, were included in this retrospective study. Recipient and donor characteristics and demographics, including preoperative laboratory values and potential surgical-related risk factors, are summarized in Table 1. Recipients with or without apheresis platelet transfusion were compared. Compared to recipients without apheresis platelet transfusion, the MELD score, Child-Pugh classification, blood loss, total bilirubin level, and INR were significantly higher and hemoglobin and platelet counts were lower in those with apheresis platelet transfusion. Not surprisingly, recipients with apheresis platelet transfusion also received more PRBCs and FFP. When analyzing the length of hospital stay, those recipients who died during the hospitalization were excluded (n = 17). Recipients who received platelets had longer hospital stays (39 通用删除6(英):<u>[32–58]</u> days vs. 32 通用删除6(英):<u>[24–42]</u> days, P = 0.001). The donors’ age (23 通用删除6(英):<u>[22–27]</u> years vs. 25 通用删除6(英):<u>[22- 27]</u> years, P = 0.122) and gender (male/female: 62/7 vs. 54/3, P = 0.313) were comparable between recipients with and without apheresis platelet transfusion.\nRecipients characteristics and demographics in this study\n删除重复语句：<u>Recipients characteristics and demographics in this study</u>\nData are presented as median (Q1–Q3), n or n (%). *Z values, otherwise Chi-square values. HBV: Hepatitis B virus; GRWR: Graft-to-recipient weight ratio; MELD: Model for end-stage liver disease; ALT: Alanine transaminase; INR: International normalized ratio; PRBC: Packed red blood cell; FFP: Fresh frozen plasma; PLTs: Platelets.\nAll 126 recipients were transfused with FFP, 119 (94.4%) recipients received PRBCs, and 57 (45.2%) patients received apheresis platelets. The median consumption of blood products during surgery and 48 h postoperatively was 23 通用删除7(英):<u>(19–33)</u> U of FFP, 11 通用删除7(英):<u>(6–19)</u> U of PRBCs, and 0 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–1)</u> U of apheresis platelets, as shown in Table 1. No whole blood was administered and only two recipients required cell salvage technology.\nTo determine the variables associated with perioperative platelet transfusion, those with P < 0.05, such as the MELD score, Child-Pugh classification, PRBCs, FFP, blood loss, total bilirubin level, INR, hemoglobin, and platelet counts were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis, which revealed that only lower preoperative platelet count (odds ratio OR = 0.969, 95% CI: 0.956- 0.983, P < 0.001), higher MELD score, (OR = 1.083, 95% CI: 1.024–1.146, P = 0.005), and more PRBCs transfusion (OR = 1.129, 95% CI: 1.058–1.204, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of perioperative platelet transfusion. No collinearity was recognized after collinearity determination among these three factors.\nThe average survival time of this population was 91 months and the median survival time was longer than 120 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 89.9%, 78.1%, and 76.6%, respectively, in recipients who did not receive platelets. Among recipients transfused with platelets, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 75.4%, 71.8%, and 70.1%, respectively. The log-rank test was performed and no significant differences were found between two groups (P = 0.229).\nTherefore, the Cox proportional-hazards model was applied for adjusting confounders. The results of the univariate analysis of the potential risk factors for overall survival are summarized in Table 2. In the multivariate analysis, while the P value of the serum creatinine level was <0.05, it was still replaced by the MELD score, which was calculated using the creatinine level. Obviously, the MELD score was a better indicator of preoperative disease severity. Transfusion requirements have also been considered to be surrogates for sicker patients and introducing the MELD score into the multivariate analysis can diminish confounders. Thus, recipients’ age, ABO blood group comparison, MELD score, blood loss, operating time, units of PRBCs, FFP, platelets, as well as preoperative platelet count were entered into the multivariate Cox model using forward selection. The results still suggested that platelet transfusion had no effect on overall survival. Nevertheless, recipients' age (HR = 1.045, 95% CI: 1.005–1.086, P = 0.025), ABO blood group comparison (HR = 2.990, 95% CI: 1.341–6.669, P = 0.007), and units of PRBCs (HR = 1.036, 95% CI: 1.006–1.067, P = 0.018) were independent risk factors 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>. A ROCs curve analysis and Youden’s index were used to define the ideal cutoff points; 10 U of PRBCs (area under the curve = 0.655, P = 0.008) was decided as the appropriate cutoff value that offered the best prediction for survival (sensitivity = 0.794, specificity = 0.500).\nUnivariate analysis of survival for recipients receiving living donor liver transplantation in this study\n删除重复语句：<u>Univariate analysis of survival for recipients receiving living donor liver transplantation in this study</u>\nHBV: Hepatitis B virus; GRWR: Graft-to-recipient weight ratio; MELD: Model for end-stage liver disease; ALT: Alanine transaminase; INR: International normalized ratio; HR: Hazard ratio; CI: Confidence interval; FFP: Fresh frozen plasma; PLTs: Platelets; PRBC: Packed red blood cell.\nMultivariate Cox proportional-hazards model for survival\n删除重复语句：<u>Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model for survival</u>\nGRWR: Graft-to-recipient weight ratio; MELD: Model for end-stage liver disease; HR: Hazard ratio; CI: Confidence interval; PRBC: Packed red blood cell; FFP: Fresh frozen plasma; PLTs: Platelets.\nThe Schoenfeld residuals test was performed and proved this Cox model to be satisfied with the proportional hazards assumption. To further verify the conclusion, the propensity score was calculated by performing a propensity score matching program in SPSS software, which made the baseline covariates listed in Table 1 balanced (except for hospital stay). We then made covariate adjustment using the propensity score as described by Austin and Mamdani.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> The estimated score was introduced into the multivariate Cox analysis as an independent covariate; other variables such as the recipient’s age, ABO group comparison, and units of PRBCs were still considered as independent risk factors. The final propensity score-adjustment HR was 1.041 (1.002–1.081) for recipient’s age, 3.080 (1.380–6.876) for ABO group comparison, and 1.058 (1.015–1.103) for units of PRBCs.\nAlthough platelet transfusion was not regarded as a risk factor for overall survival, we found that it was associated with 90-day cumulative survival via K-M curve and log-rank test, as shown in Figure 2. Similar procedures were processed as described above. The results of the univariate analysis are shown in Table 2. The GRWR was selected instead of graft weight and recipient body weight and INR was replaced by MELD score. Blood loss and preoperative platelet count were added to adjust confounders. Thus, GRWR, blood loss, platelet count, MELD score, ABO group comparison, units of PRBCs, FFP, and platelets were entered into the multivariate Cox model 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>. The results suggested that unit of platelets (HR = 3.103, 95% CI: 1.720–5.600, P < 0.001) was an independent risk factor and high preoperative platelet count (>50 × 109/L) was an independent protective factor (HR = 0.170, 95% CI: 0.040–0.730, P = 0.017) for 90-day survival. One unit of platelets (area under the curve = 0.687, P = 0.016) was decided as the appropriate cutoff value that offered sensitivity with 0.750 and specificity with 0.591 to the best prediction for survival by ROC curve analysis. When propensity score-adjustment analysis was performed, the adjusted HR was 3.705 (1.784–7.094) for units of platelets and 0.184 (0.040–0.845) for platelet count.\nAdult-to-adult LDLT, evolved from pediatric LT, has been regarded as a practical cure for end-stage liver diseases in recent decades, particularly in Asian countries where cultural or religious values impact access to cadavers. Although blood loss and perioperative blood transfusion (PBT) during LT have been significantly decreased with enhanced surgical techniques and anesthetic management, the impact of blood products on recipient outcomes should still be considered carefully. Previous studies have demonstrated that PBT was linked with worse outcomes in noncardiac surgery通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> and in solid malignancy resection such as gastric operations.通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u>\nHowever, little information about PBT in LDLT is known. Therefore, we studied LDLT recipients and confirmed that single-donor apheresis platelets played a negative role in 90-day survival as did pooled random donor platelets.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Pooled platelet concentrates are isolated from donated whole blood with the plasma method or buffy coat (BC) method. The former method prepares platelet-rich plasma by centrifuging whole blood softly at first and then spinning the plasma hard to sediment and separate platelets. Multiple units (generally 5–10) are pooled to create an adult dose shortly before transfusion. With the BC method, whole blood is centrifuged hard directly to form the BC layer, which contains PRBCs, leukocytes, and platelets. When pools of 4 or 5 BCs are prepared, the platelet-rich supernatant is made through soft-spin centrifugation.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> Single-donor platelets (SDPs) can be obtained by apheresis, which collects platelet concentrates from a single donor using a cell separator and the remainder of blood cells are simultaneously returned to the donor via the device. Apparently, whole-blood-derived platelet (WBDP) has higher donor exposure and is associated with a higher incidence of viral transmission and allergic transfusion reaction as expected.通用删除6(英):<u>[36,37]</u> Various cytokines and chemokines, histamine, for instance, accumulating during the storage of plasma play important roles in allergic reactions.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>\nWe therefore hypothesized that low survival rates associated with platelet transfusion described in previous research may contribute to WBDP. Nevertheless, this retrospective study revealed that SDP is an independent risk factor on 90-day survival. Pereboom et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> retrospectively analyzed their clinical data and attributed this platelet-associated mortality in DDLT recipients to acute lung injury (ALI). Furthermore, perioperative platelet transfusion was also identified as a risk factor in lung transplantation and coronary artery bypass graft surgery.通用删除6(英):<u>[38,39]</u> Platelets are plasma-rich blood products, passive transfer of antileukocyte antibodies via plasma and the accumulation of inflammatory mediators during storage may contribute to lung endothelial injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Meanwhile, platelets facilitated the formation of postoperative thrombosis and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by induction of sinusoidal endothelial cell apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[23,40]</u> However, focused on LDLT, Han et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> found liver regeneration to increase in relation to the amount of platelet transfusion and platelet count postreperfusion. To our knowledge, platelets influence tissue regeneration by secreting various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors; controlling of apoptosis; and interactions with progenitor cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u> Platelet-derived serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine was thought to stimulate hepatocyte mitosis in vitro and was responsible for liver regeneration in healthy liver donors.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> We speculated that the adverse effect of platelets in enhancing ALI was superior to its impact on liver regeneration in the early period, so that low 90-day survival was observed. This indicated that we should not broaden the criteria for platelet transfusion only because platelets can facilitate liver regeneration. However, it is interesting to us that SDP had no impact on overall survival in this study. That may be the result of inflammation, I/R injury, or thrombosis formation associated with platelets that were only predominant for a short period. Whether platelets play an important role in long-term follow-up will require additional research.\nRegarding PRBC transfusion, previous results indicated that it was decreased 1-, 2-, and 5-year and the overall survival rate in recipients with LT.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7,8,12,15,16,17]</u> We confirmed that perioperative PRBCs utilization, especially more than 10 units for LDLT, was indeed an independent risk factor for overall survival in the multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model, but we also noticed that there was no effect on 90-day survival. Because a tiny minority of patients did not receive PRBCs, we are not convinced that PRBCs have no effect on short-term outcomes. Moreover, Benson et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> had already reported that PRBCs increased the risk of postoperative infection in a dose-dependent manner. They also implied that plasma-enriched products promoted the development of transfusion-related ALI. In addition, a large PRBCs transfusion may lead to iron overload, which may give rise to free radicals that eventually damage the cells and impair organ function. Residual donor leukocytes in PRBCs, human leukocyte antigen peptides, bioactive lipids, and preservation lesion were responsible for poor outcomes after PRBCs transfusion. Massive PRBCs transfusion will also lead to immunologic adverse effects and metabolic derangements and may facilitate the formation of hepatic artery thrombosis after LT.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> Thus, we should avoid large PRBCs transfusions and use leukocyte reduction techniques to improve outcomes.\nFFP was transfused more often in recipients with LT; however, few studies focused on it. Massicotte et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> observed that any amount of intraoperative plasma were decreased 1-year survival in DDLT. Nacoti et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> also found that FFP was an independent risk factor for pediatric LT. However, other research as well as ours regarding FFP mostly inferred that it was not associated with poor survival.\nIn this study, we affirmed that recipients' age and ABO blood group comparisons were independent risk factors for LDLT recipients in terms of overall survival and high preoperative platelet count was a protective factor for 90-day survival.\nAs far as we know, antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) can be induced by anti-donor ABO antibodies. Methods of desensitization to alleviate AMR such as plasmapheresis, splenectomy, aggressive immunosuppression, and intravenous immunoglobulin may result in unsatisfactory outcomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> Although no ABO-incomparable transplantation was performed in this population, the result showed that long-term outcomes of ABO-identical transplantation were still better than ABO-compatible ones. As the majority of the previous research only focused on the discrepancy between ABO-compatible and ABO-incompatible LT, whether ABO-identical LT was really superior to ABO-compatible LT remains unknown. We supposed that it may share a similar mechanism as the ABO-incompatible LT, leading to worse outcomes such as high occurrence of rejection, severe infection, and biliary duct and vascular complications. As for advanced age, worse outcomes are reported earlier, especially for Child-Pugh class C patients. Elderly recipients may had a worse response to anti-infection therapy once they were admitted to ICU after LT and may suffer an increased incidence of malignancies.通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45]</u> GRWR and MELD score were not identified as risk factors in univariate and multivariate analyses possibly because of the small sample size.\nSeveral limitations existed in the present study. First, this study was conducted by retrospectively reviewing previous clinical data, so we could not prove causality between blood transfusion and patient’s survival, the statistical associations of perioperative SDP (apheresis) and RBC transfusion with early- and late-term postoperative mortality after LDLT might not be causal relationship. Although we had estimated sample size by mimicking a prospective cohort study focusing on platelet transfusion before data collection, the 66 patients necessary in the exposure and control groups were not satisfied in this study. Only 57 recipients had a perioperative platelet transfusion experience. The small total sample size, a relatively large proportion of censored data, and risk factors such as intraoperative adverse cardiovascular events, use of inotropic agents, and surgical complications were not taken into consideration may have led to the weakness of the multivariate Cox model. Therefore, a large sample, multicenter, prospective study is necessary. Another criticism was that we did not take preoperative blood transfusions and other postoperative related risk factors into consideration. Finally, graft survival might be as important as patient survival and it should be considered as an outcome criterion. Unfortunately, this information was missed in medical records for numerous patients during that time.\nIn conclusion, this study found that perioperative apheresis platelet transfusion was associated with lower 90-day survival and high preoperative platelet count was a protective factor for LDLT recipients. However, platelets had no effect on overall survival. We also recognized that lower preoperative platelet count, higher MELD score and more PRBCs transfusions were independent predictors for perioperative platelet transfusion. Meanwhile, we confirmed the relationship between PRBC transfusion and poor overall survival in Cox analysis. Apart from PRBCs, the recipient’s age and ABO-blood group comparison were identified as independent risks factors for overall survival in LDLT recipients. Furthermore, we did not find that FFP transfusion influenced a patient’s short- or long-term outcomes. Although we could not reach a direct causal conclusion, we still considered that the results of this study are beneficial to anesthesiologists and surgeons when they decide whether to use blood products in LDLT.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "index": 3344, "show": true, "start": 3344, "end": 3484, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:18:39", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:19:23", "cost": 44.148}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:19:23", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:18:38"}

However, these observations provide no elucidation of the potential role of children in transmitting the disease.\nWell-documented scientifically is the major transmission role children have had historically in the spread of respiratory infections — generally through their close interactions in schools and child-care centres. Moreover, children and teenagers aged 5-17 are considered to play the most important role in mass influenza A epidemics 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. While the lack of severity of COVID-19 in children contrasts with that of other respiratory viruses such as influenza, similarities in the mode of transmission still exist. Recent studies have demonstrated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) does infect children; with about 50% of pediatric cases asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Consequently, they may have an important role in transmission — albeit at lower levels than adults — and could be \"silent\" transmitters (i.e. infectious without showing clinical signs of disease). Worryingly, in many countries it is common for children to be cared for, or be in close contact with, elderly people, for example, grandparents — the very age group most at risk of acquiring serious respiratory complications resulting in death.\nIn the absence of a vaccine or effective therapeutic drugs, preventive measures such as: good hygiene practices — hand washing, cough etiquette, disinfection of surfaces and social distancing represent the major weapons against COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) states, \"the best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about SARS-CoV-2, the disease it causes and how it spreads\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. We have seen that health and hygiene campaigns, which reinforce consistent messaging and persuade people to alter their habits, are effective in reducing infection rates. To date, however, most of the messaging has targeted the general population — not children specifically. Children are able to copy parent behaviour, but are not equipped with a true understanding of why they are being asked to make changes, potentially resulting in confusion, fear and lapses in hygiene or social protocols. Development of an appropriate and engaging hygiene and social distancing education campaign targeting children is urgently needed in order to reinforce adult messages appropriately and maximise child compliance. Accordingly, we provide an overview of COVID-19-related health education/promotion messaging currently available, and posit the way forward for engaging schoolchildren.\nThe WHO is the main international body providing information to the public, health sector, and governments. Messaging around COVID-19 for the public incorporates: global situation updates; information on transmission; signs and symptoms of infection; prevention and control practices (i.e. good hygiene and physical distancing); and specific information for pregnant women and travelers, or those recently visiting or returning from hot spot areas. Resources for the media also explain how to relay messages regarding prevention measures. Delivery of these messages uses a variety of formats including information sheets, videos and infographics. These are available on the WHO website and their social media platforms. Advice is provided for parents on communicating with children about COVID-19. Some materials are available for schools on age-appropriate health education regarding the virus and the associated disease but messages specifically targeting children are lacking and have caused confusion and anxiety for those too young to engage with the current campaigns.\nMessages similar to those provided by WHO, but with a local context, have been disseminated by the United States Centers for Disease Control (US CDC), which has a series of COVID-19 educational videos available on their website and on YouTube. In countries outside the USA, departments and ministries of health have also released similar messaging campaigns in print and multi-media formats via mass media channels and social media platforms. Specific resources are available for health professionals, including aged care providers, pathology providers and health care managers; and while there is a smattering of messages targeting young children — mainly via YouTube — there is a serious deficiency of appropriate specific resources systematically embedded in schools to provide consistent messaging for children worldwide.\nHealth messages that are positive, engaging, entertaining, fun and humorous, while providing accurate age-appropriate understanding are important features when targeting schoolchildren. The value of a moving image in health education was highlighted as early as 1988 in a manual published by the WHO 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>, which pointed out that no other media, creates such lively interest as television. Television programs such as Sesame Street, Between the Lions, and Blue’s Clues have contributed to reinforcing positive influences in the cognitive development of young children. Cartoons also have a long history of popularity with children — highlighted by the Disney and Warner Brothers franchises — and are used to reinforce learning and interaction. As such, this entertainment-education approach has provided a highly effective forum for health education interventions targeting schoolchildren. Videos/cartoons have proven to be of great value 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. Compared to text-based teaching videos/cartoons can reinforce desired behaviour for children as they learn through direct observation, a critical element in behaviour 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>.\nWith the urgent need to develop specific COVID-19 prevention messages for schoolchildren it is logical to develop a cartoon video-based entertainment education approach, with a discrete, engaging and highly informative story line, emphasising correct hand washing procedures and the social distancing concept. One highly successful and proven intervention is \"The Magic Glasses\" , an inexpensive and engaging 12-min cartoon-based hygiene education intervention package, which is combined with classroom discussions, drawing and essay competitions, and a pamphlet (derived from the cartoon) to reinforce the health messages. The cartoon can be accessed at https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1204885. The focus of the intervention is to visually inform children about the transmission and prevention of soil-transmitted helminths; it has been rigorously tested with success in resource-poor settings across Asia including China 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>, the Philippines and Vietnam; and is currently being developed for the Lower Mekong Region including its adaptation to carcinogenic liver fluke infections. To our knowledge, no such cartoon-based intervention is currently available as a preventive approach against COVID-19.\nThe cartoon concept enables children to identify with characters to visualise the intestinal parasitic worms and their eggs in people and the environment to reinforce the importance of good hygiene and associated health behaviours 通用删除6(英):<u>[5, 6]</u>. This is directly applicable to the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 — whereby virus would be visualised in people and the environment — and the associated messages for prevention. The formative research process used to develop the original \"Magic Glasses\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> would be used here to identify risk factors and drivers for behaviour change in order to translate them into the preventive messages. Key messages of such an intervention could include hand washing, care in coughing and sneezing, tissue use and disposal, physical distancing (which particularly lends itself to visual display) and what to do when feeling unwell. It also reinforces how the virus behaves to assist children’s understanding and allay fear. Readily available for systematic delivery in schools — implemented as part of the curriculum over the course of the school year — and for parents, the cartoon would be accessible via mainstream media and social media platforms (e.g. YouTube). The cartoon would also be applicable for television broadcast. Furthermore, and very importantly, utilising a scientifically validated health education intervention to disseminate COVID-19 messaging to children ensures that reliable and factual information is delivered through official channels (such as schools) to an audience who are considered to be highly vulnerable to becoming victims of misinformation or 'infodemics’ 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>.\nHealth education and promotion are important components of disease prevention activities in general, but during disease outbreaks and health emergencies, they play a key role in an active response by offering well-established tools (especially important in the absence of specific drug therapies and vaccines) to communicate and engage quickly and effectively with the public and prevent infections. Messaging specifically targeting children who may well be acting as \"silent\" transmitters of COVID-19 is presently lacking. A video/cartoon-based entertainment-education intervention would fill this need. This is important now during the peak of transmission and, most importantly, to reinforce and habituate good hygiene practices long-term to prevent rebound infections, given the pandemic is expected to continue for at least the remainder of 2020 if not longer if COVID-19 becomes endemic. Targeted COVID-19 messages to children will also be effective for influenza prevention and considerably help reduce COVID-19/Influenza co-morbidity; in addition, it will provide a targeted explanation to help minimise fear and anxiety in young children. With the current international debate around school closures/openings, having this preventive intervention in place in schools would contribute to mitigating the risk and provide greater confidence for schools to be open to authorities and parents alike.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:37:48", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:38:03", "cost": 14.289}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:38:02", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:37:48"}

Other than applying the well-established electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, other imaging testsing and clinical symptoms and signs watching, DRE urgently requires a set of molecular biomarkers to clarify the early prognosis, wherein microRNAs play an important role 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21,22]</u>.\nmiRNA is a non-coding single-stranded RNA molecule with length of about 20–24 nucleotides and has highly conservatism, tissue specificity and temporality. It does not have open reading frame and mainly regulates expression of gene after transcription 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Most miRNA genes are present in the genome as the form of single copy, multiple copies or a gene cluster. Each miRNA can regulate one or more target genes, while several miRNAs can regulate the same target gene. miRNA regulates the expression level of proteins in cells through this complicated network 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Essentially, miRNA is a highly conserved non-coding single-stranded endogenous RNA molecule that plays an important role in the negative regulation of the target gene expression after transcription 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>.\nIn animal experiments about DRE, researchers mainly focused on temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis by artificially modeling mice or rats. Researchers further compartmentalized subgroups by distinguishing different time phases of seizures, different locations and different injury statuses of the brain.\nThe detection of abnormal expression of miRNAs in tissue is usually obtained during status epilepticus (SE) and after induction of SE at 1 day, 1 week or over 2 months. Distinct expression levels of miRNAs have been discovered at all time points. Thus, researchers considered the alteration of miRNA levels in interictal periods and chronic stage to have great diagnostic significance. To date, over 350 different miRNAs are postulated to closely correlate with epileptogenesis and epilepsy development while only up to 20 % of these miRNAs have been identified in brain tissues of epilepsy animal models 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. Researchers suppose that such heterogeneity may be the result of the influence exerted by epilepsy-induced brain tissue damage to miRNA detection, thus choosing to conduct miRNA profiling in brain tissues extracted at least 2 months (chronic stage) after epileptic seizures. Four animal-based studies utilizing gene chips to identify miRNA expression, respectively conducted by Song et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> Hu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Bot et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> and Gorter et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>, together reported about 25 differentially expressed miRNAs. Those mentioned in more than one of the studies include 14 up-regulated miRNAs and 9 down-regulated miRNAs. Up-regulated miRNAs includes miR-21, miR-23a, miR-23b, miR-24, miR-27a, miR-27b, miR-34a, miR-126, miR-132, miR-140, miR-146a, miR-152, miR-210 and miR-212 while down-regulated miRNAs includes miR-33, miR-138, miR-139, miR-187, miR-190, miR-218a, miR-301a, miR-551b and miR-935. Among the up-regulated miRNAs only three were mentioned in three human experiments, which are miR-21, miR-132 and miR-146a 通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31,32]</u>. Of note, miR-134 is also an important microRNA that is up-regulated during epilepsy, which is only profiled in one human experiment of Jimenez-Manteos et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.\nThrough distinguishing differential damage statuses (including intercerebral hemorrhagic injury (H), ischemic injury (I) and kainate seizures (K)) of rat brains after epileptic seizures in 24 h, Liu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> identified 91 miRNAs in brain (I+:24, H+:17, K+:13; I-:13, H-:12, K-:18) and 147 miRNAs in blood (I+:10 H+:21 K+:21 I-:65 H-:20 K-:10) that exhibits abnormal expressions (fold change > 1.5) in three damage statuses. Among them, miRNAs that show aberrant expression in mice brain tissue of all three damage statuses includes up-regulated miR-542-3p and down-regulated miR-122, miR-155, miR-362-3p and miR-450-5p. In blood, five up-regulated miRNAs were clearly documented miR-96, miR-152, miR-298, miR-333 and miR-505. Seven down-regulated miRNAs were also found in the blood: being miR-125a-5p, miR-130b, miR-142-3p, miR-330, miR-342-5p, miR-347 and miR-685 miRNAs that are both regulated in brain and blood include miR-298, miR-503, miR-672, miR-10a, miR-182 and miR-200b (SI & I+); miR-155, miR-362-3p, miR-223 and miR-210 (SI & I-); miR-148b, miR-503, miR-298, miR-423-5p, miR-10a, miR-345-5p and miR-674 (SH & LB(H)+); miR-10b, miR-203, miR-362-3p, miR-155, miR-20b-3p and miR-200a (SH & LB(H)-); miR-298 (K+); miR-155, miR-29c, miR-34b-3p, miR-98, miR-122, miR-203 and miR-450a (K-). Since considerable amounts of miRNAs have been successfully identified, future studies should focus more on the clinical significance of particular miRNAs used as biomarkers or potential therapeutic targets.\nJan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> have analyzed the miRNA expression in three brain regions-hippocampal CA1, hippocampal dentate gyrus and parahippocampal cortex-correlated with TLE in rats and obtained tissue after electrically-induced SE at 1 day, 1 week and 3–4 months. Results revealed that 18, 16 and 7 miRNAs were identified respectively in the hippocampal CA1 in the aforementioned three time phases. Among them, miR-21 exhibits high expression in both tissue obtained in 1 day and 1 week after SE induction and miR-143, miR-23a, miR-27a showed up-regulation in tissue obtained after 1 week and 3–4 months. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus, there were 20, 15 and 37 miRNAs respectively detected in the three time phases. Three miRNAs-miR-132, miR-21, miR-212 - exhibited up-regulation in all three time phases while miR-142-5p was up-regulated in 1 days and 1 weeks after SE. miR-146a, miR-212, miR-23a were up-regulated in 1 day and 3–4 months after SE and miR-223 showed up-regulation in 1 day and 3–4 months after SE. In the parahippocampal cortex, 31, 37 and 22 miRNAs respectively were profiled in three time phases. miR-21 and miR-223 displayed up-regulation in all three time phases; 12 miRNAs (miR-142-5p, miR-294, miR-32, miR-351, miR-3596c, miR-466b-1, miR-466b-2, miR-466c, miR-466d, miR-675, miR-758 and miR-883)were up-regulated in 1 day and 1 week after SE samples,; and 6 miRNAs (miR-193, miR-199a-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-23a, miR-27a, miR-34a) presented up-regulation in both 1 week and 3–4 months. However, extremely few miRNAs were identified in the hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus and not a single miRNA was identified in all three time phases. In the parahippocampal cortex, respectively 68, 102 and 7 miRNAs were identified in three time phases while only miR-137 was down-regulated in all three time phases. Currently no research has focused on the relationship between miR-137 and intractable epilepsy. Aside from brain tissue, Jan et al. also profiled miRNAs in plasm and 3 miRNAs were detected, being miR-142-5p detected in 1 day after SE, miR-21-5p in 1 week after SE and miR-146-5p in 3–4 months after SE. No miRNA was detected in two or three time phases.\nAlthough such substantial miRNAs were identified in tissue and plasm in different time phases, areas and damage statuses, few miRNAs show essential clinical significance. Blondal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> assessed 119 miRNAs that are most commonly found in normal plasm, wherein 9 miRNAs are overlapped with those identified by Jan et al. in brain tissue and 8 miRNAs plasma (5 tissue + 3 plasm) are overlapped with those detected by Liu et al. in brain tissue and plasm. These respectively are miR-21, miR-142-5p, miR-146a, miR-23a, miR-223, miR-32, miR-199a-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-27a (Jan et al. Tissue overlapped), miR-122, miR-152, miR-505, miR-125a-5p, miR-142-3p (Liu et al. Tissue overlapped), miR-20b, miR-29c, miR-122 (Liu et al. Plasm overlapped) The scarcity of these findings indicates that these miRNAs may have little relation with epileptogenesis. However, microRNAs such as miR-146a are still validated to be highly implicated in epileptogenesis. Thus, whether those 17 micro-RNAs are involved in epileptogenesis or not requires further discussion.\nBased on this research, approximately 26 miRNAs exert a direct or indirect influence in animal experiments of epilepsy diagnosis, being miR-542-3p, miR-362-3p, miR-450-5p, miR-96, miR-143, miR-23a, miR-155, miR-152, miR-298, miR-333, miR-330, miR-342-5p, miR-347, miR-34, miR-294, miR-351, miR-466 family (b-1/b-2/c), miR-675, miR-758, miR-883, miR-193, miR-134, miR-132, miR-146a. Other microRNAs may also play a role in epilepsy, but this remains to be explored.\nTwo studies published in 2012 on miRNA profiles in TLE revealed a considerable amount of dysregulated miRNAs in human diseased tissue. Kan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> focused on medial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), a subtype of TLE caused by hippocampal sclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>. They performed genome-wide miRNA profiling in 20 human hippocampal tissue samples, including both sclerotic and non-sclerotic. The study also identified 51 strongly regulated miRNAs, wherein 11 miRNAs play essential roles. Of the 11 miRNAs, 7 were up-regulated-miR-190, miR-20a, miR-32, miR-374a, miR-26b, miR-193a-3p, miR-92b and 4 were down-regulated - miR-184, miR-138, miR-221, miR-222. Kan et al. found that miR-92b, miR-637, and miR-665 showed inconsistent localization between being prominent in the cytoplasm of neurons in autopsy controls and being in the nucleus of both neurons and astrocytes in mTLE samples. However, miR-138 expression was limited to the cytoplasm in mTLE patients. These findings together suggest that the localization of a specific miRNA may have significant clinical applications 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>. Consequently, detecting the nuclear expression of miR-92a, miR-637 and miR-665 may be a useful method for epilepsy diagnosis. Furthermore, 16 miRNAs involved in epileptogenesis were identified by summarizing the meaningful results from many studies, including miRNAs modulating neuronal maturation (miR-137 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>), neural cell proliferation in cortex (miR-9 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>, miR-124 通用删除6(英):<u>[41,42]</u>, miR-137 通用删除6(英):<u>[40,43]</u>, miR-184 通用删除6(英):<u>[40,44,45]</u> and let-7b 通用删除6(英):<u>[40,43,46]</u>), and neural differentiation (miR-153 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>, miR-324 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>, miR-181a 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>, miR-34a 通用删除6(英):<u>[27,48]</u>). Other miRNAs are reported to be critical in neuronal migration (miR-9 通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>, miR-134 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>, miR-137 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>), neuronal differentiation (miR-125b 通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> miR-137 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>) and neural inflammation (miR-146a 通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>).\nResearch on epilepsy-related microRNAs in human experiments typically progress slowly because factors key factors such as drug treatment influence miRNA profiling results. No clear result has been established on the relationship between microRNA and intractable epilepsy in human experiments, leaving a huge development space for applying microRNAs to potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in refractory epilepsy. In this regard, it is a promising research direction to profile miRNA expression in both diseased brain tissue and corresponding plasm samples, and then compare fold changes of miRNA expressions to those in control groups.\nThe mechanism of down-regulation of a series of miRNA in TLE patients is well understood. McKiernan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> profiled miRNA expression in sclerotic hippocampi from TLE patients and found a significant down-regulation of 37 miRNAs out of the total 380 human miRNAs. In order to identify the cause of these miRNAs’ collapse, McKiernan et al. measured the transcript level of 4 pri-miRNAs and found no reduction of their levels, but a prominent decrease in Dicer level was identified. Dicer is an RNase III essential to the cleavage of pre-miRNA to mature miRNA. The deletion of Dicer in the neural system typically leads to neuronal dysfunction, neurodegeneration, macular degeneration, epilepsy seizure and cognitive deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>[53,54,55,56,57]</u>. The loss of Dicer appears specific to TLE patients with HS and cause a failure of miRNA biogenesis, which further gives rise to degenerative changes in cortex and hippocampal morphology that have been observed in human epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>. Aside from Dicer, other components of miRNA biogenesis may also play a role in miRNA expression regulation and may provide potential explanation for specific miRNA up-regulation. McKiernan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> also noticed that Ago2 levels were higher in non-sclerotic TLE patients. This indicates that epileptic seizures may up-regulate AGO2, by which miR-451, an up-regulated miRNA in TLE tissue, could be processed independently of Dicer 通用删除6(英):<u>[58,59]</u>.\nThere are two other established miRNA regulators of note in the neural system and epilepsy: cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and transcription factors. CREB that regulates miR-132, contributing to the development of synaptic network plasticity. Transcription factors like myocyte enhancing factor 2 (Mef2) up-regulate the miR379-410 cluster, wherein miR-134 exhibits the essential role of promoting dendritic outgrowth of hippocampal neurons by inhibiting translation of translational repressor Pumilio2 mRNA 通用删除6(英):<u>[60,61]</u>.\nAlthough miRNA is predicted to regulate the expression of hundreds of proteins involved in wide-ranging biological processes, the processes regulated by miRNA may be restricted in epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Inflammation and neuron morphology modulation may be two of the most prominent regulatory roles of miRNA in epileptogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Similar to miRNA in tumorigenesis, miRNAs exhibit a dual role in epileptogenesis– neuroprotection or induce neural cell death. A large number of studies have shown that the occurrence of epilepsy with nerve cells apoptosis, Synaptic connections reconstruction, glial fibers cell hyperplasia, abnormal pathways is closely related to the formation and inflammatory response 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u>. Repeated seizures can result in hippocampus neuron apoptosis in brain, the abnormal formation excitatory synapses loop, and ultimately improve the intractable temporal lobe epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24]</u>. Thus, miRNAs may be through regulating nerve cells apoptosis, synaptic contact reconstruction, glial fiber cell hyperplasia, inflammation involved in the occurrence of epilepsy development.\nIn the study of human disease, involves only less than 100 kinds of micrornas associated with refractory epilepsy, and collect more meaningful experimental results including up-regulation of miRNAs : miR-146a,-132,-9, -99a,-27a,-203,-135a, −4521 通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u>; the down-regulation of miRNAs:miR-30a/b,-138,-324,-330,-187,-194-5p,-301a- 3p,-30b-5p,-342-5p, −4446-3p 通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u>.\nAlthough miRNA research remains in its early stages, it certainly could have great applications in the molecular diagnosis of intractable epilepsy. As research into this area progresses, the miRNA with specificity and sensitivity will likely be found among numerous miRNAs related to epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u>. In time, this will lead to the development of effective strategies for the early screening, clinical diagnosis, treament and preventation of refractory epilepsy. The research of miRNA involved in epilepsy has great application prospect and huge potential in diagnosis and treatment of intractable epilepsy on the basis of the molecular biology.\nThe authors have no personal financial or institutional interest in any of the drugs, materials, or devices described in this article.

However, a consensus definition and prognosis for DRE remained elusive 通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u>. In 2010, the International League against epilepsy (ILAE) addressed the need for a definition, declaring that \"Drug resistant epilepsy may be defined as failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used AED schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>.

Results revealed that 18, 16 and 7 miRNAs were identified respectively in the hippocampal CA1 in the aforementioned three time phases. Among them, miR-21 exhibits high expression in both tissue obtained in 1 day and 1 week after SE induction and miR-143, miR-23a, miR-27a showed up-regulation in tissue obtained after 1 week and 3–4 months.

Tissue overlapped), miR-122, miR-152, miR-505, miR-125a-5p, miR-142-3p (Liu et al. Tissue overlapped), miR-20b, miR-29c, miR-122 (Liu et al. Plasm overlapped) The scarcity of these findings indicates that these miRNAs may have little relation with epileptogenesis. However, microRNAs such as miR-146a are still validated to be highly implicated in epileptogenesis. Thus, whether those 17 micro-RNAs are involved in epileptogenesis or not requires further discussion.\nBased on this research, approximately 26 miRNAs exert a direct or indirect influence in animal experiments of epilepsy diagnosis, being miR-542-3p, miR-362-3p, miR-450-5p, miR-96, miR-143, miR-23a, miR-155, miR-152, miR-298, miR-333, miR-330, miR-342-5p, miR-347, miR-34, miR-294, miR-351, miR-466 family (b-1/b-2/c), miR-675, miR-758, miR-883, miR-193, miR-134, miR-132, miR-146a. Other microRNAs may also play a role in epilepsy, but this remains to be explored.\nTwo studies published in 2012 on miRNA profiles in TLE revealed a considerable amount of dysregulated miRNAs in human diseased tissue. Kan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> focused on medial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), a subtype of TLE caused by hippocampal sclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>. They performed genome-wide miRNA profiling in 20 human hippocampal tissue samples, including both sclerotic and non-sclerotic. The study also identified 51 strongly regulated miRNAs, wherein 11 miRNAs play essential roles. Of the 11 miRNAs, 7 were up-regulated-miR-190, miR-20a, miR-32, miR-374a, miR-26b, miR-193a-3p, miR-92b and 4 were down-regulated - miR-184, miR-138, miR-221, miR-222. Kan et al. found that miR-92b, miR-637, and miR-665 showed inconsistent localization between being prominent in the cytoplasm of neurons in autopsy controls and being in the nucleus of both neurons and astrocytes in mTLE samples. However, miR-138 expression was limited to the cytoplasm in mTLE patients. These findings together suggest that the localization of a specific miRNA may have significant clinical applications 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u>. Consequently, detecting the nuclear expression of miR-92a, miR-637 and miR-665 may be a useful method for epilepsy diagnosis. Furthermore, 16 miRNAs involved in epileptogenesis were identified by summarizing the meaningful results from many studies, including miRNAs modulating neuronal maturation (miR-137 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>), neural cell proliferation in cortex (miR-9 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>, miR-124 通用删除6(英):<u>[41,42]</u>, miR-137 通用删除6(英):<u>[40,43]</u>, miR-184 通用删除6(英):<u>[40,44,45]</u> and let-7b 通用删除6(英):<u>[40,43,46]</u>), and neural differentiation (miR-153 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>, miR-324 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>, miR-181a 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>, miR-34a 通用删除6(英):<u>[27,48]</u>). Other miRNAs are reported to be critical in neuronal migration (miR-9 通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>, miR-134 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>, miR-137 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>), neuronal differentiation (miR-125b 通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u> miR-137 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>) and neural inflammation (miR-146a 通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>).\nResearch on epilepsy-related microRNAs in human experiments typically progress slowly because factors key factors such as drug treatment influence miRNA profiling results. No clear result has been established on the relationship between microRNA and intractable epilepsy in human experiments, leaving a huge development space for applying microRNAs to potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in refractory epilepsy. In this regard, it is a promising research direction to profile miRNA expression in both diseased brain tissue and corresponding plasm samples, and then compare fold changes of miRNA expressions to those in control groups.\nThe mechanism of down-regulation of a series of miRNA in TLE patients is well understood. McKiernan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> profiled miRNA expression in sclerotic hippocampi from TLE patients and found a significant down-regulation of 37 miRNAs out of the total 380 human miRNAs. In order to identify the cause of these miRNAs’ collapse, McKiernan et al. measured the transcript level of 4 pri-miRNAs and found no reduction of their levels, but a prominent decrease in Dicer level was identified. Dicer is an RNase III essential to the cleavage of pre-miRNA to mature miRNA. The deletion of Dicer in the neural system typically leads to neuronal dysfunction, neurodegeneration, macular degeneration, epilepsy seizure and cognitive deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>[53,54,55,56,57]</u>. The loss of Dicer appears specific to TLE patients with HS and cause a failure of miRNA biogenesis, which further gives rise to degenerative changes in cortex and hippocampal morphology that have been observed in human epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>. Aside from Dicer, other components of miRNA biogenesis may also play a role in miRNA expression regulation and may provide potential explanation for specific miRNA up-regulation. McKiernan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> also noticed that Ago2 levels were higher in non-sclerotic TLE patients. This indicates that epileptic seizures may up-regulate AGO2, by which miR-451, an up-regulated miRNA in TLE tissue, could be processed independently of Dicer 通用删除6(英):<u>[58,59]</u>.\nThere are two other established miRNA regulators of note in the neural system and epilepsy: cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and transcription factors. CREB that regulates miR-132, contributing to the development of synaptic network plasticity. Transcription factors like myocyte enhancing factor 2 (Mef2) up-regulate the miR379-410 cluster, wherein miR-134 exhibits the essential role of promoting dendritic outgrowth of hippocampal neurons by inhibiting translation of translational repressor Pumilio2 mRNA 通用删除6(英):<u>[60,61]</u>.\nAlthough miRNA is predicted to regulate the expression of hundreds of proteins involved in wide-ranging biological processes, the processes regulated by miRNA may be restricted in epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Inflammation and neuron morphology modulation may be two of the most prominent regulatory roles of miRNA in epileptogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>. Similar to miRNA in tumorigenesis, miRNAs exhibit a dual role in epileptogenesis– neuroprotection or induce neural cell death. A large number of studies have shown that the occurrence of epilepsy with nerve cells apoptosis, Synaptic connections reconstruction, glial fibers cell hyperplasia, abnormal pathways is closely related to the formation and inflammatory response 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u>. Repeated seizures can result in hippocampus neuron apoptosis in brain, the abnormal formation excitatory synapses loop, and ultimately improve the intractable temporal lobe epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24]</u>. Thus, miRNAs may be through regulating nerve cells apoptosis, synaptic contact reconstruction, glial fiber cell hyperplasia, inflammation involved in the occurrence of epilepsy development.\nIn the study of human disease, involves only less than 100 kinds of micrornas associated with refractory epilepsy, and collect more meaningful experimental results including up-regulation of miRNAs : miR-146a,-132,-9, -99a,-27a,-203,-135a, −4521 通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u>; the down-regulation of miRNAs:miR-30a/b,-138,-324,-330,-187,-194-5p,-301a- 3p,-30b-5p,-342-5p, −4446-3p 通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u>.\nAlthough miRNA research remains in its early stages, it certainly could have great applications in the molecular diagnosis of intractable epilepsy. As research into this area progresses, the miRNA with specificity and sensitivity will likely be found among numerous miRNAs related to epilepsy 通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u>. In time, this will lead to the development of effective strategies for the early screening, clinical diagnosis, treament and preventation of refractory epilepsy. The research of miRNA involved in epilepsy has great application prospect and huge potential in diagnosis and treatment of intractable epilepsy on the basis of the molecular biology.\nThe authors have no personal financial or institutional interest in any of the drugs, materials, or devices described in this article.

Approximately 10 % of the publics have at least one seizure during their lifetime and among them about 30 % will develop epilepsy, suffering substantial deleterious influence on their health due to long-term use of drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Nowadays it lacks a complete understanding of the epileptogenic process but it is thought to involve neuronal death or dysfunction, neurogenesis and others 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Many researchs now support miRNAs as a critical layer of gene expression regulation in epilepsy, which provides new putative targets for the control of seizures, seizure-induced damage and as potential biomarkers of epileptogenesis. miRNA is detected in many biofluids, including serum and CSF and it appears to be very stable 通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u>.\nCurrent strategies to fight epilepsy focus on arresting epileptogenesis induced by brain trauma and other diseases through treatment of anti-epileptic drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Substantial research has focused on the involvement of microRNAs in epilepsy, including screening the aberrant expression of microRNAs and searching their target genes. The isolation of miRNAs’ target genes would enable the development of a better understanding of the etiology, and the establishment of diagnostic biomarkers, and the identification of novel miRNA-based therapeutics.\nGlobally, the estimated proportion of the general population with active epilepsy is about 0.5-1 % and 20–30 % of those patients will develop a drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) 通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u>. Clinical trials demonstrated that cerebrovascular diseases, encephalitis and cortical dysplasia function as main causes of DRE. Diseases including West syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and tuberous sclerosis could assist in identifying DRE 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Moreover, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) represents the most common syndrome in adults and often develops pharmacoresistence 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. TLE frequently develops into DRE as a result of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9,10]</u>, inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>, neurocysticercosis 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>, brain insult 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>, or malformations of cortical development 通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15]</u>. However, a consensus definition and prognosis for DRE remained elusive 通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u>. In 2010, the International League against epilepsy (ILAE) addressed the need for a definition, declaring that \"Drug resistant epilepsy may be defined as failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used AED schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. This proposal provided a precise definition of DRE but, left forming an efficacious prognosis method for DRE unexplored to this day. Past early-identification of DRE is mainly based on clinical manifestations like the number of seizures 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>. Other than applying the well-established electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, other imaging testsing and clinical symptoms and signs watching, DRE urgently requires a set of molecular biomarkers to clarify the early prognosis, wherein microRNAs play an important role 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21,22]</u>.\nmiRNA is a non-coding single-stranded RNA molecule with length of about 20–24 nucleotides and has highly conservatism, tissue specificity and temporality. It does not have open reading frame and mainly regulates expression of gene after transcription 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. Most miRNA genes are present in the genome as the form of single copy, multiple copies or a gene cluster. Each miRNA can regulate one or more target genes, while several miRNAs can regulate the same target gene. miRNA regulates the expression level of proteins in cells through this complicated network 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Essentially, miRNA is a highly conserved non-coding single-stranded endogenous RNA molecule that plays an important role in the negative regulation of the target gene expression after transcription 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>.\nIn animal experiments about DRE, researchers mainly focused on temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis by artificially modeling mice or rats. Researchers further compartmentalized subgroups by distinguishing different time phases of seizures, different locations and different injury statuses of the brain.\nThe detection of abnormal expression of miRNAs in tissue is usually obtained during status epilepticus (SE) and after induction of SE at 1 day, 1 week or over 2 months. Distinct expression levels of miRNAs have been discovered at all time points. Thus, researchers considered the alteration of miRNA levels in interictal periods and chronic stage to have great diagnostic significance. To date, over 350 different miRNAs are postulated to closely correlate with epileptogenesis and epilepsy development while only up to 20 % of these miRNAs have been identified in brain tissues of epilepsy animal models 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>. Researchers suppose that such heterogeneity may be the result of the influence exerted by epilepsy-induced brain tissue damage to miRNA detection, thus choosing to conduct miRNA profiling in brain tissues extracted at least 2 months (chronic stage) after epileptic seizures. Four animal-based studies utilizing gene chips to identify miRNA expression, respectively conducted by Song et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> Hu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Bot et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> and Gorter et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>, together reported about 25 differentially expressed miRNAs. Those mentioned in more than one of the studies include 14 up-regulated miRNAs and 9 down-regulated miRNAs. Up-regulated miRNAs includes miR-21, miR-23a, miR-23b, miR-24, miR-27a, miR-27b, miR-34a, miR-126, miR-132, miR-140, miR-146a, miR-152, miR-210 and miR-212 while down-regulated miRNAs includes miR-33, miR-138, miR-139, miR-187, miR-190, miR-218a, miR-301a, miR-551b and miR-935. Among the up-regulated miRNAs only three were mentioned in three human experiments, which are miR-21, miR-132 and miR-146a 通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31,32]</u>. Of note, miR-134 is also an important microRNA that is up-regulated during epilepsy, which is only profiled in one human experiment of Jimenez-Manteos et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>.\nThrough distinguishing differential damage statuses (including intercerebral hemorrhagic injury (H), ischemic injury (I) and kainate seizures (K)) of rat brains after epileptic seizures in 24 h, Liu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> identified 91 miRNAs in brain (I+:24, H+:17, K+:13; I-:13, H-:12, K-:18) and 147 miRNAs in blood (I+:10 H+:21 K+:21 I-:65 H-:20 K-:10) that exhibits abnormal expressions (fold change > 1.5) in three damage statuses. Among them, miRNAs that show aberrant expression in mice brain tissue of all three damage statuses includes up-regulated miR-542-3p and down-regulated miR-122, miR-155, miR-362-3p and miR-450-5p. In blood, five up-regulated miRNAs were clearly documented miR-96, miR-152, miR-298, miR-333 and miR-505. Seven down-regulated miRNAs were also found in the blood: being miR-125a-5p, miR-130b, miR-142-3p, miR-330, miR-342-5p, miR-347 and miR-685 miRNAs that are both regulated in brain and blood include miR-298, miR-503, miR-672, miR-10a, miR-182 and miR-200b (SI & I+); miR-155, miR-362-3p, miR-223 and miR-210 (SI & I-); miR-148b, miR-503, miR-298, miR-423-5p, miR-10a, miR-345-5p and miR-674 (SH & LB(H)+); miR-10b, miR-203, miR-362-3p, miR-155, miR-20b-3p and miR-200a (SH & LB(H)-); miR-298 (K+); miR-155, miR-29c, miR-34b-3p, miR-98, miR-122, miR-203 and miR-450a (K-). Since considerable amounts of miRNAs have been successfully identified, future studies should focus more on the clinical significance of particular miRNAs used as biomarkers or potential therapeutic targets.\nJan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> have analyzed the miRNA expression in three brain regions-hippocampal CA1, hippocampal dentate gyrus and parahippocampal cortex-correlated with TLE in rats and obtained tissue after electrically-induced SE at 1 day, 1 week and 3–4 months. Results revealed that 18, 16 and 7 miRNAs were identified respectively in the hippocampal CA1 in the aforementioned three time phases. Among them, miR-21 exhibits high expression in both tissue obtained in 1 day and 1 week after SE induction and miR-143, miR-23a, miR-27a showed up-regulation in tissue obtained after 1 week and 3–4 months. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus, there were 20, 15 and 37 miRNAs respectively detected in the three time phases. Three miRNAs-miR-132, miR-21, miR-212 - exhibited up-regulation in all three time phases while miR-142-5p was up-regulated in 1 days and 1 weeks after SE. miR-146a, miR-212, miR-23a were up-regulated in 1 day and 3–4 months after SE and miR-223 showed up-regulation in 1 day and 3–4 months after SE. In the parahippocampal cortex, 31, 37 and 22 miRNAs respectively were profiled in three time phases. miR-21 and miR-223 displayed up-regulation in all three time phases; 12 miRNAs (miR-142-5p, miR-294, miR-32, miR-351, miR-3596c, miR-466b-1, miR-466b-2, miR-466c, miR-466d, miR-675, miR-758 and miR-883)were up-regulated in 1 day and 1 week after SE samples,; and 6 miRNAs (miR-193, miR-199a-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-23a, miR-27a, miR-34a) presented up-regulation in both 1 week and 3–4 months. However, extremely few miRNAs were identified in the hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus and not a single miRNA was identified in all three time phases. In the parahippocampal cortex, respectively 68, 102 and 7 miRNAs were identified in three time phases while only miR-137 was down-regulated in all three time phases. Currently no research has focused on the relationship between miR-137 and intractable epilepsy. Aside from brain tissue, Jan et al. also profiled miRNAs in plasm and 3 miRNAs were detected, being miR-142-5p detected in 1 day after SE, miR-21-5p in 1 week after SE and miR-146-5p in 3–4 months after SE. No miRNA was detected in two or three time phases.\nAlthough such substantial miRNAs were identified in tissue and plasm in different time phases, areas and damage statuses, few miRNAs show essential clinical significance. Blondal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> assessed 119 miRNAs that are most commonly found in normal plasm, wherein 9 miRNAs are overlapped with those identified by Jan et al. in brain tissue and 8 miRNAs plasma (5 tissue + 3 plasm) are overlapped with those detected by Liu et al. in brain tissue and plasm. These respectively are miR-21, miR-142-5p, miR-146a, miR-23a, miR-223, miR-32, miR-199a-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-27a (Jan et al. Tissue overlapped), miR-122, miR-152, miR-505, miR-125a-5p, miR-142-3p (Liu et al. Tissue overlapped), miR-20b, miR-29c, miR-122 (Liu et al.

The lack of available autologous materials such as buccal mucosa and prepuce drives researchers to seek substitute biomaterials through tissue engineering. Over the past decades, urinary tract reconstruction using various natural or synthetic biomaterials has emerged to address the issue, through the use of various materials including small intestinal submucosa, bladder acellular matrix (BAM), polyglycolic acid, poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), etc.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3,4]</u> Although natural and synthetic biomaterials each have their own merits, their drawbacks should not be ignored in their application. For natural biomaterials, which are often sourced from animals, the possibility of disease transmission and heterogeneity in the physical configuration of these xenografts remains an unsolved problem. For synthetic biomaterials, the lack of molecular signals diminishes cell attachment onto these biomaterials and therefore compromises cell activity and proliferation. Last but not least, neither natural nor synthetic biomaterials can achieve spatial cell distribution within the materials, which could expose cells to the outer environment, thus handicapping their function.\nThe traditional tissue engineering approach for fabricating urinary tract patch mainly depends on the cell-scaffold strategy: using a mold to produce a porous biomaterial, manually seeding smooth muscle cells, and urothelial cells (UCs) onto the biomaterial and waiting for cell infiltration. The seeding duration often lasts 1 week,通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u> meaning a sandwich coculture or triculture of multiple types of cells in the porous biomaterial might require 2 to 3 weeks,通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> which makes building \"off the shelf\" tissue-engineered urinary tract patch difficult for research and clinical applications. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting, newly emanated from traditional additive manufacturing, is being utilized to overcome the drawbacks mentioned above in tissue engineering. Compared to the classic cell-scaffold strategy, 3D bioprinting could be used to construct a scaffold containing cells in a single step using certain biomaterials. Furthermore, with the assistance of computer design, the shape of the bioprinted structure could attain diversity without the constraint of the molds employed in the conventional tissue engineering approach. Our previous study verified that microtissues (MTs) composed of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) could enhance smooth muscle differentiation and cell viability during micro-extrusion 3D bioprinting通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>; hence, a bioprinted structure incorporating ID-MTs might pro-vide a substrate for producing a tissue-engineered urinary tract patch. Here, we implanted a bioprinted structure into nude mice subcutaneously for encapsulation, and 1 week after implantation, UCs were seeded onto these encapsulated structures. In this study, we combined 3D bioprinting and tissue engineering method to form a tissue-engineered urinary tract patch, which could be employed for the application on Beagles urinary tract defect mode to verify its effectiveness on urinary tract reconstruction in further investigation.\n删除3：<u>This study was approved by the Clinical Ethics Committee of Fourth Medical Center of People’s Liberation Army General Hospital, and wavier of patient consent was approved.</u>\nThe hADSCs were purchased from Cyagen (passage 2, Lot. HUXMD-01001, USA). Briefly, the purchased hADSCs were recovered in a 37°C water bath and then transferred to a 10-mL centrifuge tube. Next, 5 mL of culture medium (α-minimum Eagle’s medium [α-MEM] containing 100 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum, all purchased from Corning, USA) was added to suspend the cells. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min, then the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was resuspended with culture medium and seeded onto 10-cm petri dishes. When the cells reached 80 % to 90% confluence, they were passaged by 0.25% ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA)-trypsin (Solarbio, China).\nFlow cytometry was utilized to characterize the hADSCs. Cells at passage 3 were digested with 0.25% EDTA-trypsin and washed three times in phosphate buffer saline (PBS; Keygen, China) after centrifugation (1500 × g for 5 min). Afterward, 1 × 104 cells/tube were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20 min with the following primary antibodies: CD44 (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC] conjugated), CD105 (allophycocyanin conjugated), CD45 (phycoerythrin [PE] conjugated), CD34 (PE conjugated) (all purchased from BD Bioscience, USA), and fluorescence line height-2 was set as blank. Then, the cells were washed again twice with PBS, centrifuged (1500 × g for 5 min) and resuspended in 200 μL of PBS. Finally, CD surface antigens wereanalyzedwithaflowcytometer (BDFACSCalibur, USA).\nPassages 3 to 5 of the hADSCs were employed to generate MTs. As we previously described, the hanging-drop method was utilized to form MTs consisting of hADSCs.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Briefly, 5 × 105 hADSCs were suspended in 1 mL of culture medium or smooth muscle inductive medium (SMIM; culture medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL of transforming growth factor-β1; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to form MTs based on gravity-forced cell assembly. The MTs (10,000 cells in 20 μL) generated in the culture medium were defined as non-induced MTs (NI-MTs), while the MTs generated in SMIM were defined as ID-MTs. Both NI-MTs and ID-MTs were kept for 3 days in a hangingdrop array at 37℃ in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nAdhered hADSCs were maintained in the culture medium, and NI-MTs were subjected to Western blotting. Cells were washed with 4°C PBS (Keygen) thrice and then lysed in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (ApplyGen Technology, China) to obtain the total protein. The concentration of total protein was measured with a bicinchoninic acid protein quantitation assay (Keygen). Thirty micrograms of protein was then separated using 8 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (Millipore, USA) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (Cell Signaling Technology, USA) in tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST; ApplyGen Technology) buffer for 2 h. Then, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The primary antibodies were as follows: rabbit polyclonal tumor necrosis factor alphastimulated gene-6 (TSG-6, 1:1000, Lot. ab128266; Abcam, UK), rabbit polyclonal vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) (1:1000, Lot. ab46154; Abcam), and mouse polyclonal β-actin (1:1000, Lot. ab20272; Abcam) antibodies. Next, the membranes were washed with TBST for 10 min three times. Then, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (1:5000; ZSGB-BIO, China) for 90 min at room temperature and then washed thrice with TBST. After adding enhanced chemilu-minescence detection reagents (ApplyGen Technology), the membranes were visualized by scanning the immunostaining band 删除2：<u>(GE ImageQuant LAS4000, USA)</u>. The band intensity was analyzed with Image-Pro-plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc. Rockville, MD, USA). And the results were represented as histograms with GraphPad Prism 6 Software (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA).\nA micro-extrusion 3D bioprinter (Regenovo 3D bioprinter, China) was employed to fabricate a 3D structure containing hADSCs/NI-MTs/ID-MTs as we previously described.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Briefly, each group was embedded into hydrogels using a 20-mL hyperthermia-dissolved solution of 0.2 g/mL of gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) mixed evenly with a 10-mL solution including 0.04 g/mL of sodium alginates (Sigma-Aldrich) at 25°C. We utilized a syringe with an orifice diameter of 340 μm for constructing the 3D structure, and all used syringes, syringe-paired inner sealers, and nozzles were autoclaved before the bioprinting process. First, the bioprinting platform with a temporal-fixed 60 mm petri dish used as a substrate was rapidly cooled for 45 min to 4℃ and underwent ultraviolet sterilization. Then, we fabricated the desired 3D structure by maintaining the bioink at a temperature of less than 8°C during extrusion from the syringe and placement. Last, each fresh structure was immediately sprinkled with 2 mL of sterile 10% calcium chloride at 4°C for 10 min to complete the cross-linking process and then immersed in culture medium (hADSCs and NI-MTs) or SMIM (ID-MTs) and cultured in the incubator at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nTo encapsulate the bioprinted structure, three different bioprinted structures containing hADSCs/NI-MTs/ID-MTs were implanted subcutaneously into BALB/C nude mice (Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology, China, this experiment was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Fourth Medical Center of People’s Liberation Army General Hospital), with two pieces of the structure per animal (20 male nude mice and 20 female nude mice). Briefly, 10-week-old mice were anesthetized through intraperitoneal injection of barbital (40 mg/kg), and then the dorsal skin midline was incised and blunt dissected to separate dorsal pockets (two pockets per animal). The structures were implanted into these separated pockets, and the incisions were closed by continuous suture. After 7 days, these nude mice were executed, and the implanted structures were harvested.\nFreshly bioprinted and implanted structures retrieved from nude mice were fixed in 4% buffered formalin for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. Then, these samples were processed for histologic and immunofluorescent staining in sections of 4 μm. For histologic analysis, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was employed to inspect the construction of implanted structures, and Masson’s trichrome staining was utilized to reveal smooth muscle and collagen fibers in the implanted structures. In this staining process, smooth muscle fibers were stained with red, and collagen fibers were stained with blue.\nVascularization of implanted structures was revealed by immunofluorescent double staining of CD31 and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Sections of implanted structures were permeabilized and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) in PBS (Keygen) for 15 min at room temperature. Then, sections were incubated with primary antibodies 删除2：<u>(mouse anti-human CD31 [ab24590], 1:500, and rabbit anti-human α-SMA [ab5694; Abcam] 1:300)</u> overnight at 4°C. Afterward, the sections were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000; Abcam) for 60 min at room temperature and rinsed with PBS thrice. For nuclear staining, the sections were incubated with 4＇,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Keygen) for 15 min. Last, the sections were photographed and recorded using a LEICA DMI 4000B digital microscope camera system (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany).\nTo further investigate the phenotype of the NI-MTs and ID-MTs in the implanted structure, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed as follows. The sections were deparaffinized, and antigen retrieval was carried out by microwaving the sections for 6 min at 100℃ in EDTA-antigen retrieval buffers (Servicebio, China). Then, the sections were washed with PBS thrice for 5 min and immersed in 3% hydrogen dioxide solution for 25 min. The sections were then washed with PBS three times again for 5 min and blocked by 3% bovine serum albumin (Solarbio) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies 删除2：<u>(rabbit anti-human α-SMA, 1:300, Lot. ab5694; mouse anti-human smoothelin, 1:200, Lot. ab8969, all purchased from Abcam)</u> at 4°C overnight, and then the sections were washed with PBS (Keygen) thrice and incubated with secondary antibodies (HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse; DAKO, Denmark) for 50 min at room temperature. Then, the sections were washed with PBS, and bound antibodies were detected using a 3,3＇-diaminobenzidine detection kit (DAKO), followed by hematoxylin counterstaining for 3 min.\nFor Masson’s trichrome staining and IHC staining of α-SMA and smoothelin, the integral optical density (IOD) and area of interest were calculated by Image-Pro-plus 6.0 software for further semi-quantitative analysis, and the results were represented as histograms with GraphPad Prism 6 Software.\nHuman normal ureteral tissues came from patients undergoing radical nephrectomy. After collected, ureteral tissues were washed thrice with PBS at room temperature, and then split open with eye scissors, and washed with PBS three times again. Then, the mucosa was separated from the ureteral tissues by forcep and minced into 1 mm pieces. These pieces were gathered and placed onto a 6-cm petri dish and treated with 0.05% EDTA-trypsin (Solarbio) for 25 min at room temperature. The digestion carried out by trypsin was terminated with α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1590 × g. Then the suspension was discarded and the pellet was resuspended with 1.5 mL of keratinocyte serum-free media (KSFM; Gibco, USA) and added onto a 10-cm petri dish gently, then cultured in the incubator at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 48 h of incubation, the outgrowth of cells from each piece of ureteral tissue can be observed, and 3 mL of additional KSFM was added to support cell growth. When UCs were 95% confluent, they were passaged by 0.05% EDTA-trypsin (Solarbio), and passages 3 to 6 of UCs were used to conduct further experiments。\nUCs were seeded onto retrieved structures to construct tissue-engineered urinary tract patch. Briefly, UCs were detached from petri dishes and centrifuged. Then, the UCs were resuspended with KSFM, and the cell concentration was adjusted such that 1 mL of solution contained 5 × 105 cells. The retrieved structure was trimmed and transferred to 96-well plates. Then, 200 μL of the suspension of UCs was dropped onto the top of the retrieved structure, and the seeded structure was incubated at 37℃ in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. To examine the seeded UCs on the implanted structure, immunofluorescent double staining of cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and α-SMA was conducted as aforementioned in the protocol for CD31 and α-SMA double staining, with the primary antibodies including mouse anti-human anti-pan cytokeratin antibody AE1/AE3 (1:300, ab961; Abcam), and rabbit anti-human α-SMA (1:300, ab5694; Abcam).\nStatistical analyses were performed with SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. The comparison between groups was performed using t test, and a value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nA large number of hADSCs were attained from the recovery of purchased hADSCs, and after 2 to 3 days of culture, the hADSCs presented the \"hill-vally\" morphology 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. Passage 4 of the hADSCs were harvested from the petri dish to generate MTs, and at day 3 after generation, the MTs were collected for use in 3D bioprinting 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>. Correspondingly, passage 4 of the hADSCs was detached from the petri dish for 3D bioprinting as a control for microscopic observation. After the bioprinting process, both adhered hADSCs and MTs exhibited a shrunken diameter 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1C and Figure 1D]</u>, and the configuration of the adhered hADSCs was changed to a round shape, while the MTs largely maintained their morphology. The flow cytometry results showed that the hADSCs presented a strong positivity for CD44 and CD105, while no signal was detected for CD45 and CD34. The percentage of positive cells was 99.98%, 99.97%, 0.02%, and 0.04% 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nNon-induced adhered hADSCs and MTs were obtained for analysis of VEGFA and TSG-6 expression. Analysis showed that the expression of VEGFA and TSG-6 was much higher in MTs than in hADSCs. The semiquantitative assay showed that the band intensity of VEGFA and TSG-6 in the MTs and hADSCs was 0.649 ± 0.150 vs. 0.355 ± 0.038, t= 3.291, P= 0.030, and 1.256 ± 0.401 vs. 0.492 ± 0.092, t = 3.216, P = 0.032, respectively 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. These results were consistent with those of our previous study.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nSeveral 2 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm (length × width × height) structures were bioprinted for histologic analysis and subcutaneous implantation into nude mice. Figure 3A presents the gross inspection of the freshly bioprinted structure, and two pieces of the bioprinted structure were implanted into one animal subcutaneously 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3B]</u>. After in vivo maturation for 7 days, the implanted structures were extracted. After extraction, the structures had roughly held their configuration and were encapsulated, although some parts of the structures were fragmented 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3C]</u>.\nHE staining demonstrated the morphology of the implanted 3D structure 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>. After subcutaneous implantation for 7 days, both MTs and hADSCs were found to maintain their shape in the retrieved 3D structures.\nImmunofluorescent double staining of CD31 and α-SMA revealed vascularization of the implanted structures通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5A]</u>. As depicted, the bioprinted structure could form neo-vascular tissue (CD31 and α-SMA doublestained) in the MTs group, while only a little α-SMA was expressed and vascular morphology was hardly observed in the hADSCs group. The expression of interleukin (IL)-2 in the MTs group was lower than that in the hADSCs group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5B]</u>, but semi-quantitative analysis showed that there was no statistical significance in the difference between the two groups (MTs vs. hADSCs: 7.67 ± 1.26 vs. 12.6 ± 4.79, t = 1.724, P = 0.16).\nMasson’s trichrome staining revealed smooth muscle fibers and collagen fibers in the implanted structures 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u>. As the test depicted, NI-MTs in the implanted structures could form several collagen fibers, but smooth muscle fibers were rare. Meanwhile, ID-MTs in the implanted structures generated collagen fibers and smooth muscle fibers at the same time. Semi-quantitative analysis showed that the mean IOD (mean IOD = IOD summation/area summation) was 71.7 ± 14.2 (NI-MTs) vs. 35.7 ± 11.4 (ID-MTs) for collagen fibers (t= 3.428, P= 0.027) and 12.8 ± 1.9 (NI-MTs) vs. 30.6 ± 8.9 (ID-MTs) for smooth muscle fibers (t= 3.369, P = 0.028).\nIHC staining showed that the expression of α-SMA and smoothelin was much higher in the ID-MTs than in the NI-MTs after 7 days of implantation 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7]</u>. Semiquantitative analysis demonstrated that the mean IOD was 0.0613 ± 0.0172 (ID-MTs) vs. 0.002 ± 0.001 (NI-MTs) (t = 5.994, P = 0.027) for α-SMA and 0.0355 ± 0.0128 (ID-MTs) and 0.0035 ± 0.0022 (NI-MTs) (t= 4.268, P = 0.013) for smoothelin, thus suggesting that ID-MTs could maintain their phenotype in the bioprinted structure during the 7-day in vivo encapsulation process.\nAfter 7 to 10 days, primary culture of UCs was established, and passages 3 to 6 were employed for the next experiments. At passage 4, the UCs presented a typical cobblestone morphology 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 8A]</u>. After seeding with UCs for 1 week, the UCs were viable and lined up mainly in a monolayer on the encapsulated structures, which incorporated ID-MTs/NI-MTs, as confirmed by immunofluorescent staining of AE1/AE3 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 8B and Figure 8C]</u>.\nUrinary tract reconstruction remains a challenging surgical intervention due to the shortage of appropriate biomaterials for replacement of urinary tract defects. Clinical autografting of tissue such as lingual or oral buccal mucosa and prepuce is often used for urethra reconstruction and yields satisfactory outcomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13,14,15]</u> However, harvesting these autografts is traumatic and might cause complications including infection, bleeding, tricholithiasis, etc.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> In addition, the limited source of these autografts restricts second chances at urinary tract reconstruction, which drives researchers to look for other substitutions. Under these circumstances, natural and synthetic biomaterials have been discovered for use in urinary tract reconstruction. Despite their advantages in biocapability and modifiability, both natural and synthetic biomaterials are unable to disperse cells into themselves. This means that cells are seeded onto the surface of these biomaterials and a wait is required to achieve infiltration,通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,17,18]</u> thus prolonging their preparation time and limiting their further application.\nThe 3D bioprinting has shed light on tissue engineering. Compared to the traditional cell-infiltration strategy, 3D bioprinting can be used to fabricate a computer-designed construct of cells and bioinks, which accelerates the process of building a tissue-engineered structure and makes it possible to produce \"off the shelf\" substitutes for the replacement of defective native tissue. In the present study, we employed 3D bioprinting to fabricate smooth muscle-ID-MTs into a designed structure and encapsulated the bioprinted structures through subcutaneous implantation into nude mice. HE staining showed that after 1 week of implantation, the MTs largely preserved their morphology, and Masson’s trichrome staining revealed that NI-MTs were collagen fiber-rich and smooth muscle fiber depleted, while ID-MTs were the opposite, suggesting that the implanted structure utilizing ID-MTs could mimic the smooth muscle layer of native urinary tract.\nOne of the major concerns for tissue engineering is vascularization and anti-inflammation of the fabricated structure because grafts from natural or synthetic biomaterials for urinary tract reconstruction often end up failing due to lack of blood supply and the presence of inflammation or immunorejection. Although our previous investigation indicated that MTs gain better cell viability than single cells during the 3D bioprinting process,通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> vascularization, and anti-inflammation still play a crucial role in the survival of the implanted structure and the fate of the incorporated MTs. Many researchers have discovered various ways to enhance the vascularization of tissueengineered structures. Heller et al通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> constructed tissueengineered buccal mucosa by triculturing epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts in a native collagen membrane. The results verified that the capillary-like structures in the native membrane became functional blood vessels through anastomosis with host vasculature after implantation into nude mice. Wang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> wrapped PLGA nanospheres with VEGF and modified a BAM graft with these nanospheres to reconstruct rabbit urethra. Their results suggested that anterior urethra reconstruction with the sustained-release of VEGF by PLGA nanospheresmodified BAMG stents could reduce postoperative restenosis. Another interesting study conducted by Jia et al通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> showed that collagen scaffold bound with collagen-binding VEGF (VEGF) could promote urethral tissue regeneration and improve the function of the neourethra in an extensive urethral defect beagle model. In this research, the expression of VEGFA and TSG-6 was investigated with a Western blotting assay, and the results demonstrated that both VEGFA and TSG-6 were expressed at a much higher level in MTs than in monolayer-cultured hADSCs, which is consistent with our previous study.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> A similar investigation was performed by Freeman et al通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> They pre-vascularized chondrogenically primed human mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) aggregates by culturing them in endothelial growth medium, and then the aggregates were implanted into nude rats. The results showed that the pre-vascularized cartilaginous aggregates formed mature endogenous vessels. In comparison with the aforementioned studies, our present study revealed that MTs of hADSCs could express VEGFA without any other manipulation and, thus, shed light on vascularization in vivo when MTs were employed for tissue-engineered structures instead of the classic single-cell strategy. Moreover, immunofluorescent staining of CD31 and α-SMA in the retrieved structure confirmed neo-vascularization in the MTs group, while the monolayer hADSC group only had little neo-vascularization. For antiinflammation, TSG-6 is a well-known anti-inflammatory protein that has been investigated by many scholars. Among these studies, Magaña-Guerrero et al通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> found that conditioned medium from human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells was able to diminish the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and TSG-6 participates in the inhibition mechanism of reactive oxygen species-dependent NETs. Yun et al通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> identified that both mesenchymal stromal cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (MSCs) and bone marrow-derived MSCs exert therapeutic effects in the cornea by reducing inflammation in part through the expression of TSG-6. Previous research conducted by Zhou et al通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> utilized MTs constructed of hADSCs to treat erectile dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, and the results verified that the MTs expressed VEGF, nerve growth factor, and TSG-6, which was partly similar to our present study. Attractively, we noticed that even in monolayer-cultured hADSCs, there was also expression of TSG-6 to some degree, suggesting that hADSCs have the potential to alleviate inflammation, in accordance with the results of Song et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Neverthe-less, the higher expression of TSG-6 in MTs makes them a preferable candidate for fabricating tissue-engineered structures. In the following IHC results, the observed trend that the expression of IL-2 was lower in MTs than in hADSCs confirmed that bioprinted structures containing MTs might cause milder immunorejection, since IL-2 is a useful indicator of this type of inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u>\nIn our previous study, we found that combining hanging-drop cultures with SMIM could enhance the smooth muscle differentiation of hADSCs in vitro,通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> but whether or not ID-MTs could maintain their phenotype in vivo was still unknown. According to studies conducted by other researchers, when cells infiltrate the biomaterials, their phenotypes might be changed and impose a negative effect on cell function.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Therefore, IHC was employed to examine the phenotype of ID-MTs in the bioprinted structure after subcutaneous implantation, and NI-MTs were set as the control. After 7 days of implantation, the expression of α-SMA and smoothelin in ID-MTs indicated the stability of their phenotypes, while NI-MTs had little expression of these two smooth muscle markers. These results supported the use of MTs to create a supporting matrix, or so-called substrate, for UCs by bioprinting a urinary tract patch.\nUrothelial tissue plays an important role in native urinary tract due to its barrier function, which prevents urine leakage into deeper tissue layers.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> In our previous study, the subcutaneous implantation of a poly (L-lactic acid) scaffold into nude mice could induce the formation of capsules on the structure,通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> and it was proven that the entrapped UCs lined up mainly in a monolayer on the capsular stents within an embedding period of 1 week. In the present study, we isolated and expanded human UCs from the ureter and then seeded the UCs onto the encapsulated structure. The results of immunofluorescence showed the expression of urothelial marker AE1/AE3 on the encapsulated structure, revealing that the UCs formed monolayer on the bioprinted urinary tract patch, thus developing a \"barrier\" to protect the bioprinted urinary tract patch from urine seepage.\nIn conclusion, we built a tissue-engineered urinary tract patch by combining 3D bioprinting and subcutaneous implantation. The results from Western blotting and histology analysis demonstrated that the ID-MTs consisting of hADSCs might be a preferable candidate for use in constructing a urinary tract patch for UC adhesion. Further investigation is required to examine its effectiveness for urinary tract reconstruction in an animal model.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81570601)</u>.</u>\n删除7：<u>None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "删除2：(mouse anti-human CD31 [ab24590], 1:500, and rabbit anti-human α-SMA [ab5694; Abcam] 1:300)", "content": "【0】Urinary tract stricture caused by catheterization, trauma, or infection often requires surgical intervention such as urinary tract reconstruction.

For synthetic biomaterials, the lack of molecular signals diminishes cell attachment onto these biomaterials and therefore compromises cell activity and proliferation. Last but not least, neither natural nor synthetic biomaterials can achieve spatial cell distribution within the materials, which could expose cells to the outer environment, thus handicapping their function.\nThe traditional tissue engineering approach for fabricating urinary tract patch mainly depends on the cell-scaffold strategy: using a mold to produce a porous biomaterial, manually seeding smooth muscle cells, and urothelial cells (UCs) onto the biomaterial and waiting for cell infiltration. The seeding duration often lasts 1 week,通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u> meaning a sandwich coculture or triculture of multiple types of cells in the porous biomaterial might require 2 to 3 weeks,通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> which makes building \"off the shelf\" tissue-engineered urinary tract patch difficult for research and clinical applications. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting, newly emanated from traditional additive manufacturing, is being utilized to overcome the drawbacks mentioned above in tissue engineering. Compared to the classic cell-scaffold strategy, 3D bioprinting could be used to construct a scaffold containing cells in a single step using certain biomaterials. Furthermore, with the assistance of computer design, the shape of the bioprinted structure could attain diversity without the constraint of the molds employed in the conventional tissue engineering approach. Our previous study verified that microtissues (MTs) composed of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) could enhance smooth muscle differentiation and cell viability during micro-extrusion 3D bioprinting通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>; hence, a bioprinted structure incorporating ID-MTs might pro-vide a substrate for producing a tissue-engineered urinary tract patch. Here, we implanted a bioprinted structure into nude mice subcutaneously for encapsulation, and 1 week after implantation, UCs were seeded onto these encapsulated structures. In this study, we combined 3D bioprinting and tissue engineering method to form a tissue-engineered urinary tract patch, which could be employed for the application on Beagles urinary tract defect mode to verify its effectiveness on urinary tract reconstruction in further investigation.\n删除3：<u>This study was approved by the Clinical Ethics Committee of Fourth Medical Center of People’s Liberation Army General Hospital, and wavier of patient consent was approved.</u>\nThe hADSCs were purchased from Cyagen (passage 2, Lot. HUXMD-01001, USA). Briefly, the purchased hADSCs were recovered in a 37°C water bath and then transferred to a 10-mL centrifuge tube. Next, 5 mL of culture medium (α-minimum Eagle’s medium [α-MEM] containing 100 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum, all purchased from Corning, USA) was added to suspend the cells. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min, then the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was resuspended with culture medium and seeded onto 10-cm petri dishes. When the cells reached 80 % to 90% confluence, they were passaged by 0.25% ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA)-trypsin (Solarbio, China).\nFlow cytometry was utilized to characterize the hADSCs. Cells at passage 3 were digested with 0.25% EDTA-trypsin and washed three times in phosphate buffer saline (PBS; Keygen, China) after centrifugation (1500 × g for 5 min). Afterward, 1 × 104 cells/tube were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20 min with the following primary antibodies: CD44 (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC] conjugated), CD105 (allophycocyanin conjugated), CD45 (phycoerythrin [PE] conjugated), CD34 (PE conjugated) (all purchased from BD Bioscience, USA), and fluorescence line height-2 was set as blank. Then, the cells were washed again twice with PBS, centrifuged (1500 × g for 5 min) and resuspended in 200 μL of PBS. Finally, CD surface antigens wereanalyzedwithaflowcytometer (BDFACSCalibur, USA).\nPassages 3 to 5 of the hADSCs were employed to generate MTs. As we previously described, the hanging-drop method was utilized to form MTs consisting of hADSCs.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Briefly, 5 × 105 hADSCs were suspended in 1 mL of culture medium or smooth muscle inductive medium (SMIM; culture medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL of transforming growth factor-β1; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to form MTs based on gravity-forced cell assembly. The MTs (10,000 cells in 20 μL) generated in the culture medium were defined as non-induced MTs (NI-MTs), while the MTs generated in SMIM were defined as ID-MTs. Both NI-MTs and ID-MTs were kept for 3 days in a hangingdrop array at 37℃ in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nAdhered hADSCs were maintained in the culture medium, and NI-MTs were subjected to Western blotting. Cells were washed with 4°C PBS (Keygen) thrice and then lysed in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (ApplyGen Technology, China) to obtain the total protein. The concentration of total protein was measured with a bicinchoninic acid protein quantitation assay (Keygen). Thirty micrograms of protein was then separated using 8 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (Millipore, USA) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (Cell Signaling Technology, USA) in tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST; ApplyGen Technology) buffer for 2 h. Then, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The primary antibodies were as follows: rabbit polyclonal tumor necrosis factor alphastimulated gene-6 (TSG-6, 1:1000, Lot. ab128266; Abcam, UK), rabbit polyclonal vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) (1:1000, Lot. ab46154; Abcam), and mouse polyclonal β-actin (1:1000, Lot. ab20272; Abcam) antibodies. Next, the membranes were washed with TBST for 10 min three times. Then, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (1:5000; ZSGB-BIO, China) for 90 min at room temperature and then washed thrice with TBST. After adding enhanced chemilu-minescence detection reagents (ApplyGen Technology), the membranes were visualized by scanning the immunostaining band 删除2：<u>(GE ImageQuant LAS4000, USA)</u>. The band intensity was analyzed with Image-Pro-plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc. Rockville, MD, USA). And the results were represented as histograms with GraphPad Prism 6 Software (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA).\nA micro-extrusion 3D bioprinter (Regenovo 3D bioprinter, China) was employed to fabricate a 3D structure containing hADSCs/NI-MTs/ID-MTs as we previously described.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Briefly, each group was embedded into hydrogels using a 20-mL hyperthermia-dissolved solution of 0.2 g/mL of gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) mixed evenly with a 10-mL solution including 0.04 g/mL of sodium alginates (Sigma-Aldrich) at 25°C. We utilized a syringe with an orifice diameter of 340 μm for constructing the 3D structure, and all used syringes, syringe-paired inner sealers, and nozzles were autoclaved before the bioprinting process. First, the bioprinting platform with a temporal-fixed 60 mm petri dish used as a substrate was rapidly cooled for 45 min to 4℃ and underwent ultraviolet sterilization. Then, we fabricated the desired 3D structure by maintaining the bioink at a temperature of less than 8°C during extrusion from the syringe and placement. Last, each fresh structure was immediately sprinkled with 2 mL of sterile 10% calcium chloride at 4°C for 10 min to complete the cross-linking process and then immersed in culture medium (hADSCs and NI-MTs) or SMIM (ID-MTs) and cultured in the incubator at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nTo encapsulate the bioprinted structure, three different bioprinted structures containing hADSCs/NI-MTs/ID-MTs were implanted subcutaneously into BALB/C nude mice (Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology, China, this experiment was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Fourth Medical Center of People’s Liberation Army General Hospital), with two pieces of the structure per animal (20 male nude mice and 20 female nude mice). Briefly, 10-week-old mice were anesthetized through intraperitoneal injection of barbital (40 mg/kg), and then the dorsal skin midline was incised and blunt dissected to separate dorsal pockets (two pockets per animal). The structures were implanted into these separated pockets, and the incisions were closed by continuous suture. After 7 days, these nude mice were executed, and the implanted structures were harvested.\nFreshly bioprinted and implanted structures retrieved from nude mice were fixed in 4% buffered formalin for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. Then, these samples were processed for histologic and immunofluorescent staining in sections of 4 μm. For histologic analysis, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was employed to inspect the construction of implanted structures, and Masson’s trichrome staining was utilized to reveal smooth muscle and collagen fibers in the implanted structures. In this staining process, smooth muscle fibers were stained with red, and collagen fibers were stained with blue.\nVascularization of implanted structures was revealed by immunofluorescent double staining of CD31 and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Sections of implanted structures were permeabilized and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) in PBS (Keygen) for 15 min at room temperature. Then, sections were incubated with primary antibodies 删除2：<u>(mouse anti-human CD31 [ab24590], 1:500, and rabbit anti-human α-SMA [ab5694; Abcam] 1:300)</u> overnight at 4°C. Afterward, the sections were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000; Abcam) for 60 min at room temperature and rinsed with PBS thrice. For nuclear staining, the sections were incubated with 4＇,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Keygen) for 15 min. Last, the sections were photographed and recorded using a LEICA DMI 4000B digital microscope camera system (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany).\nTo further investigate the phenotype of the NI-MTs and ID-MTs in the implanted structure, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed as follows. The sections were deparaffinized, and antigen retrieval was carried out by microwaving the sections for 6 min at 100℃ in EDTA-antigen retrieval buffers (Servicebio, China). Then, the sections were washed with PBS thrice for 5 min and immersed in 3% hydrogen dioxide solution for 25 min. The sections were then washed with PBS three times again for 5 min and blocked by 3% bovine serum albumin (Solarbio) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies 删除2：<u>(rabbit anti-human α-SMA, 1:300, Lot. ab5694; mouse anti-human smoothelin, 1:200, Lot. ab8969, all purchased from Abcam)</u> at 4°C overnight, and then the sections were washed with PBS (Keygen) thrice and incubated with secondary antibodies (HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse; DAKO, Denmark) for 50 min at room temperature. Then, the sections were washed with PBS, and bound antibodies were detected using a 3,3＇-diaminobenzidine detection kit (DAKO), followed by hematoxylin counterstaining for 3 min.\nFor Masson’s trichrome staining and IHC staining of α-SMA and smoothelin, the integral optical density (IOD) and area of interest were calculated by Image-Pro-plus 6.0 software for further semi-quantitative analysis, and the results were represented as histograms with GraphPad Prism 6 Software.\nHuman normal ureteral tissues came from patients undergoing radical nephrectomy. After collected, ureteral tissues were washed thrice with PBS at room temperature, and then split open with eye scissors, and washed with PBS three times again. Then, the mucosa was separated from the ureteral tissues by forcep and minced into 1 mm pieces. These pieces were gathered and placed onto a 6-cm petri dish and treated with 0.05% EDTA-trypsin (Solarbio) for 25 min at room temperature. The digestion carried out by trypsin was terminated with α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1590 × g. Then the suspension was discarded and the pellet was resuspended with 1.5 mL of keratinocyte serum-free media (KSFM; Gibco, USA) and added onto a 10-cm petri dish gently, then cultured in the incubator at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 48 h of incubation, the outgrowth of cells from each piece of ureteral tissue can be observed, and 3 mL of additional KSFM was added to support cell growth. When UCs were 95% confluent, they were passaged by 0.05% EDTA-trypsin (Solarbio), and passages 3 to 6 of UCs were used to conduct further experiments。\nUCs were seeded onto retrieved structures to construct tissue-engineered urinary tract patch. Briefly, UCs were detached from petri dishes and centrifuged. Then, the UCs were resuspended with KSFM, and the cell concentration was adjusted such that 1 mL of solution contained 5 × 105 cells. The retrieved structure was trimmed and transferred to 96-well plates. Then, 200 μL of the suspension of UCs was dropped onto the top of the retrieved structure, and the seeded structure was incubated at 37℃ in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. To examine the seeded UCs on the implanted structure, immunofluorescent double staining of cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and α-SMA was conducted as aforementioned in the protocol for CD31 and α-SMA double staining, with the primary antibodies including mouse anti-human anti-pan cytokeratin antibody AE1/AE3 (1:300, ab961; Abcam), and rabbit anti-human α-SMA (1:300, ab5694; Abcam).\nStatistical analyses were performed with SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. The comparison between groups was performed using t test, and a value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nA large number of hADSCs were attained from the recovery of purchased hADSCs, and after 2 to 3 days of culture, the hADSCs presented the \"hill-vally\" morphology 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. Passage 4 of the hADSCs were harvested from the petri dish to generate MTs, and at day 3 after generation, the MTs were collected for use in 3D bioprinting 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>. Correspondingly, passage 4 of the hADSCs was detached from the petri dish for 3D bioprinting as a control for microscopic observation. After the bioprinting process, both adhered hADSCs and MTs exhibited a shrunken diameter 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1C and Figure 1D]</u>, and the configuration of the adhered hADSCs was changed to a round shape, while the MTs largely maintained their morphology. The flow cytometry results showed that the hADSCs presented a strong positivity for CD44 and CD105, while no signal was detected for CD45 and CD34. The percentage of positive cells was 99.98%, 99.97%, 0.02%, and 0.04% 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nNon-induced adhered hADSCs and MTs were obtained for analysis of VEGFA and TSG-6 expression. Analysis showed that the expression of VEGFA and TSG-6 was much higher in MTs than in hADSCs. The semiquantitative assay showed that the band intensity of VEGFA and TSG-6 in the MTs and hADSCs was 0.649 ± 0.150 vs. 0.355 ± 0.038, t= 3.291, P= 0.030, and 1.256 ± 0.401 vs. 0.492 ± 0.092, t = 3.216, P = 0.032, respectively 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. These results were consistent with those of our previous study.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nSeveral 2 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm (length × width × height) structures were bioprinted for histologic analysis and subcutaneous implantation into nude mice. Figure 3A presents the gross inspection of the freshly bioprinted structure, and two pieces of the bioprinted structure were implanted into one animal subcutaneously 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3B]</u>. After in vivo maturation for 7 days, the implanted structures were extracted. After extraction, the structures had roughly held their configuration and were encapsulated, although some parts of the structures were fragmented 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3C]</u>.\nHE staining demonstrated the morphology of the implanted 3D structure 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>. After subcutaneous implantation for 7 days, both MTs and hADSCs were found to maintain their shape in the retrieved 3D structures.\nImmunofluorescent double staining of CD31 and α-SMA revealed vascularization of the implanted structures通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5A]</u>. As depicted, the bioprinted structure could form neo-vascular tissue (CD31 and α-SMA doublestained) in the MTs group, while only a little α-SMA was expressed and vascular morphology was hardly observed in the hADSCs group. The expression of interleukin (IL)-2 in the MTs group was lower than that in the hADSCs group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5B]</u>, but semi-quantitative analysis showed that there was no statistical significance in the difference between the two groups (MTs vs. hADSCs: 7.67 ± 1.26 vs. 12.6 ± 4.79, t = 1.724, P = 0.16).\nMasson’s trichrome staining revealed smooth muscle fibers and collagen fibers in the implanted structures 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u>. As the test depicted, NI-MTs in the implanted structures could form several collagen fibers, but smooth muscle fibers were rare. Meanwhile, ID-MTs in the implanted structures generated collagen fibers and smooth muscle fibers at the same time. Semi-quantitative analysis showed that the mean IOD (mean IOD = IOD summation/area summation) was 71.7 ± 14.2 (NI-MTs) vs. 35.7 ± 11.4 (ID-MTs) for collagen fibers (t= 3.428, P= 0.027) and 12.8 ± 1.9 (NI-MTs) vs. 30.6 ± 8.9 (ID-MTs) for smooth muscle fibers (t= 3.369, P = 0.028).\nIHC staining showed that the expression of α-SMA and smoothelin was much higher in the ID-MTs than in the NI-MTs after 7 days of implantation 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7]</u>. Semiquantitative analysis demonstrated that the mean IOD was 0.0613 ± 0.0172 (ID-MTs) vs. 0.002 ± 0.001 (NI-MTs) (t = 5.994, P = 0.027) for α-SMA and 0.0355 ± 0.0128 (ID-MTs) and 0.0035 ± 0.0022 (NI-MTs) (t= 4.268, P = 0.013) for smoothelin, thus suggesting that ID-MTs could maintain their phenotype in the bioprinted structure during the 7-day in vivo encapsulation process.\nAfter 7 to 10 days, primary culture of UCs was established, and passages 3 to 6 were employed for the next experiments. At passage 4, the UCs presented a typical cobblestone morphology 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 8A]</u>. After seeding with UCs for 1 week, the UCs were viable and lined up mainly in a monolayer on the encapsulated structures, which incorporated ID-MTs/NI-MTs, as confirmed by immunofluorescent staining of AE1/AE3 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 8B and Figure 8C]</u>.\nUrinary tract reconstruction remains a challenging surgical intervention due to the shortage of appropriate biomaterials for replacement of urinary tract defects. Clinical autografting of tissue such as lingual or oral buccal mucosa and prepuce is often used for urethra reconstruction and yields satisfactory outcomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13,14,15]</u> However, harvesting these autografts is traumatic and might cause complications including infection, bleeding, tricholithiasis, etc.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> In addition, the limited source of these autografts restricts second chances at urinary tract reconstruction, which drives researchers to look for other substitutions. Under these circumstances, natural and synthetic biomaterials have been discovered for use in urinary tract reconstruction. Despite their advantages in biocapability and modifiability, both natural and synthetic biomaterials are unable to disperse cells into themselves. This means that cells are seeded onto the surface of these biomaterials and a wait is required to achieve infiltration,通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,17,18]</u> thus prolonging their preparation time and limiting their further application.\nThe 3D bioprinting has shed light on tissue engineering. Compared to the traditional cell-infiltration strategy, 3D bioprinting can be used to fabricate a computer-designed construct of cells and bioinks, which accelerates the process of building a tissue-engineered structure and makes it possible to produce \"off the shelf\" substitutes for the replacement of defective native tissue. In the present study, we employed 3D bioprinting to fabricate smooth muscle-ID-MTs into a designed structure and encapsulated the bioprinted structures through subcutaneous implantation into nude mice. HE staining showed that after 1 week of implantation, the MTs largely preserved their morphology, and Masson’s trichrome staining revealed that NI-MTs were collagen fiber-rich and smooth muscle fiber depleted, while ID-MTs were the opposite, suggesting that the implanted structure utilizing ID-MTs could mimic the smooth muscle layer of native urinary tract.\nOne of the major concerns for tissue engineering is vascularization and anti-inflammation of the fabricated structure because grafts from natural or synthetic biomaterials for urinary tract reconstruction often end up failing due to lack of blood supply and the presence of inflammation or immunorejection. Although our previous investigation indicated that MTs gain better cell viability than single cells during the 3D bioprinting process,通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> vascularization, and anti-inflammation still play a crucial role in the survival of the implanted structure and the fate of the incorporated MTs. Many researchers have discovered various ways to enhance the vascularization of tissueengineered structures. Heller et al通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> constructed tissueengineered buccal mucosa by triculturing epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts in a native collagen membrane. The results verified that the capillary-like structures in the native membrane became functional blood vessels through anastomosis with host vasculature after implantation into nude mice. Wang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> wrapped PLGA nanospheres with VEGF and modified a BAM graft with these nanospheres to reconstruct rabbit urethra. Their results suggested that anterior urethra reconstruction with the sustained-release of VEGF by PLGA nanospheresmodified BAMG stents could reduce postoperative restenosis. Another interesting study conducted by Jia et al通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> showed that collagen scaffold bound with collagen-binding VEGF (VEGF) could promote urethral tissue regeneration and improve the function of the neourethra in an extensive urethral defect beagle model. In this research, the expression of VEGFA and TSG-6 was investigated with a Western blotting assay, and the results demonstrated that both VEGFA and TSG-6 were expressed at a much higher level in MTs than in monolayer-cultured hADSCs, which is consistent with our previous study.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> A similar investigation was performed by Freeman et al通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> They pre-vascularized chondrogenically primed human mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) aggregates by culturing them in endothelial growth medium, and then the aggregates were implanted into nude rats. The results showed that the pre-vascularized cartilaginous aggregates formed mature endogenous vessels. In comparison with the aforementioned studies, our present study revealed that MTs of hADSCs could express VEGFA without any other manipulation and, thus, shed light on vascularization in vivo when MTs were employed for tissue-engineered structures instead of the classic single-cell strategy. Moreover, immunofluorescent staining of CD31 and α-SMA in the retrieved structure confirmed neo-vascularization in the MTs group, while the monolayer hADSC group only had little neo-vascularization. For antiinflammation, TSG-6 is a well-known anti-inflammatory protein that has been investigated by many scholars. Among these studies, Magaña-Guerrero et al通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> found that conditioned medium from human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells was able to diminish the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and TSG-6 participates in the inhibition mechanism of reactive oxygen species-dependent NETs. Yun et al通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> identified that both mesenchymal stromal cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (MSCs) and bone marrow-derived MSCs exert therapeutic effects in the cornea by reducing inflammation in part through the expression of TSG-6. Previous research conducted by Zhou et al通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> utilized MTs constructed of hADSCs to treat erectile dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, and the results verified that the MTs expressed VEGF, nerve growth factor, and TSG-6, which was partly similar to our present study. Attractively, we noticed that even in monolayer-cultured hADSCs, there was also expression of TSG-6 to some degree, suggesting that hADSCs have the potential to alleviate inflammation, in accordance with the results of Song et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Neverthe-less, the higher expression of TSG-6 in MTs makes them a preferable candidate for fabricating tissue-engineered structures. In the following IHC results, the observed trend that the expression of IL-2 was lower in MTs than in hADSCs confirmed that bioprinted structures containing MTs might cause milder immunorejection, since IL-2 is a useful indicator of this type of inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u>\nIn our previous study, we found that combining hanging-drop cultures with SMIM could enhance the smooth muscle differentiation of hADSCs in vitro,通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> but whether or not ID-MTs could maintain their phenotype in vivo was still unknown. According to studies conducted by other researchers, when cells infiltrate the biomaterials, their phenotypes might be changed and impose a negative effect on cell function.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Therefore, IHC was employed to examine the phenotype of ID-MTs in the bioprinted structure after subcutaneous implantation, and NI-MTs were set as the control. After 7 days of implantation, the expression of α-SMA and smoothelin in ID-MTs indicated the stability of their phenotypes, while NI-MTs had little expression of these two smooth muscle markers. These results supported the use of MTs to create a supporting matrix, or so-called substrate, for UCs by bioprinting a urinary tract patch.\nUrothelial tissue plays an important role in native urinary tract due to its barrier function, which prevents urine leakage into deeper tissue layers.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> In our previous study, the subcutaneous implantation of a poly (L-lactic acid) scaffold into nude mice could induce the formation of capsules on the structure,通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> and it was proven that the entrapped UCs lined up mainly in a monolayer on the capsular stents within an embedding period of 1 week. In the present study, we isolated and expanded human UCs from the ureter and then seeded the UCs onto the encapsulated structure. The results of immunofluorescence showed the expression of urothelial marker AE1/AE3 on the encapsulated structure, revealing that the UCs formed monolayer on the bioprinted urinary tract patch, thus developing a \"barrier\" to protect the bioprinted urinary tract patch from urine seepage.\nIn conclusion, we built a tissue-engineered urinary tract patch by combining 3D bioprinting and subcutaneous implantation. The results from Western blotting and histology analysis demonstrated that the ID-MTs consisting of hADSCs might be a preferable candidate for use in constructing a urinary tract patch for UC adhesion. Further investigation is required to examine its effectiveness for urinary tract reconstruction in an animal model.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81570601)</u>.</u>\n删除7：<u>None.</u>", "index": 10599, "show": true, "start": 10599, "end": 10694, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "删除2：(rabbit anti-human α-SMA, 1:300, Lot. ab5694; mouse anti-human smoothelin, 1:200, Lot. ab8969, all purchased from Abcam)", "content": "【0】Urinary tract stricture caused by catheterization, trauma, or infection often requires surgical intervention such as urinary tract reconstruction.

Next, 5 mL of culture medium (α-minimum Eagle’s medium [α-MEM] containing 100 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum, all purchased from Corning, USA) was added to suspend the cells. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min, then the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was resuspended with culture medium and seeded onto 10-cm petri dishes. When the cells reached 80 % to 90% confluence, they were passaged by 0.25% ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA)-trypsin (Solarbio, China).\nFlow cytometry was utilized to characterize the hADSCs. Cells at passage 3 were digested with 0.25% EDTA-trypsin and washed three times in phosphate buffer saline (PBS; Keygen, China) after centrifugation (1500 × g for 5 min). Afterward, 1 × 104 cells/tube were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20 min with the following primary antibodies: CD44 (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC] conjugated), CD105 (allophycocyanin conjugated), CD45 (phycoerythrin [PE] conjugated), CD34 (PE conjugated) (all purchased from BD Bioscience, USA), and fluorescence line height-2 was set as blank. Then, the cells were washed again twice with PBS, centrifuged (1500 × g for 5 min) and resuspended in 200 μL of PBS. Finally, CD surface antigens wereanalyzedwithaflowcytometer (BDFACSCalibur, USA).\nPassages 3 to 5 of the hADSCs were employed to generate MTs. As we previously described, the hanging-drop method was utilized to form MTs consisting of hADSCs.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Briefly, 5 × 105 hADSCs were suspended in 1 mL of culture medium or smooth muscle inductive medium (SMIM; culture medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL of transforming growth factor-β1; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to form MTs based on gravity-forced cell assembly. The MTs (10,000 cells in 20 μL) generated in the culture medium were defined as non-induced MTs (NI-MTs), while the MTs generated in SMIM were defined as ID-MTs. Both NI-MTs and ID-MTs were kept for 3 days in a hangingdrop array at 37℃ in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nAdhered hADSCs were maintained in the culture medium, and NI-MTs were subjected to Western blotting. Cells were washed with 4°C PBS (Keygen) thrice and then lysed in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (ApplyGen Technology, China) to obtain the total protein. The concentration of total protein was measured with a bicinchoninic acid protein quantitation assay (Keygen). Thirty micrograms of protein was then separated using 8 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (Millipore, USA) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (Cell Signaling Technology, USA) in tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST; ApplyGen Technology) buffer for 2 h. Then, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The primary antibodies were as follows: rabbit polyclonal tumor necrosis factor alphastimulated gene-6 (TSG-6, 1:1000, Lot. ab128266; Abcam, UK), rabbit polyclonal vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) (1:1000, Lot. ab46154; Abcam), and mouse polyclonal β-actin (1:1000, Lot. ab20272; Abcam) antibodies. Next, the membranes were washed with TBST for 10 min three times. Then, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (1:5000; ZSGB-BIO, China) for 90 min at room temperature and then washed thrice with TBST. After adding enhanced chemilu-minescence detection reagents (ApplyGen Technology), the membranes were visualized by scanning the immunostaining band 删除2：<u>(GE ImageQuant LAS4000, USA)</u>. The band intensity was analyzed with Image-Pro-plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc. Rockville, MD, USA). And the results were represented as histograms with GraphPad Prism 6 Software (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA).\nA micro-extrusion 3D bioprinter (Regenovo 3D bioprinter, China) was employed to fabricate a 3D structure containing hADSCs/NI-MTs/ID-MTs as we previously described.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Briefly, each group was embedded into hydrogels using a 20-mL hyperthermia-dissolved solution of 0.2 g/mL of gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) mixed evenly with a 10-mL solution including 0.04 g/mL of sodium alginates (Sigma-Aldrich) at 25°C. We utilized a syringe with an orifice diameter of 340 μm for constructing the 3D structure, and all used syringes, syringe-paired inner sealers, and nozzles were autoclaved before the bioprinting process. First, the bioprinting platform with a temporal-fixed 60 mm petri dish used as a substrate was rapidly cooled for 45 min to 4℃ and underwent ultraviolet sterilization. Then, we fabricated the desired 3D structure by maintaining the bioink at a temperature of less than 8°C during extrusion from the syringe and placement. Last, each fresh structure was immediately sprinkled with 2 mL of sterile 10% calcium chloride at 4°C for 10 min to complete the cross-linking process and then immersed in culture medium (hADSCs and NI-MTs) or SMIM (ID-MTs) and cultured in the incubator at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nTo encapsulate the bioprinted structure, three different bioprinted structures containing hADSCs/NI-MTs/ID-MTs were implanted subcutaneously into BALB/C nude mice (Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology, China, this experiment was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Fourth Medical Center of People’s Liberation Army General Hospital), with two pieces of the structure per animal (20 male nude mice and 20 female nude mice). Briefly, 10-week-old mice were anesthetized through intraperitoneal injection of barbital (40 mg/kg), and then the dorsal skin midline was incised and blunt dissected to separate dorsal pockets (two pockets per animal). The structures were implanted into these separated pockets, and the incisions were closed by continuous suture. After 7 days, these nude mice were executed, and the implanted structures were harvested.\nFreshly bioprinted and implanted structures retrieved from nude mice were fixed in 4% buffered formalin for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. Then, these samples were processed for histologic and immunofluorescent staining in sections of 4 μm. For histologic analysis, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was employed to inspect the construction of implanted structures, and Masson’s trichrome staining was utilized to reveal smooth muscle and collagen fibers in the implanted structures. In this staining process, smooth muscle fibers were stained with red, and collagen fibers were stained with blue.\nVascularization of implanted structures was revealed by immunofluorescent double staining of CD31 and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Sections of implanted structures were permeabilized and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) in PBS (Keygen) for 15 min at room temperature. Then, sections were incubated with primary antibodies <mark>删除2：(mouse anti-human CD31 [ab24590], 1:500, and rabbit anti-human α-SMA [ab5694; Abcam] 1:300)</mark>00)</u> overnight at 4°C. Afterward, the sections were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000; Abcam) for 60 min at room temperature and rinsed with PBS thrice. For nuclear staining, the sections were incubated with 4＇,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Keygen) for 15 min. Last, the sections were photographed and recorded using a LEICA DMI 4000B digital microscope camera system (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany).\nTo further investigate the phenotype of the NI-MTs and ID-MTs in the implanted structure, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed as follows. The sections were deparaffinized, and antigen retrieval was carried out by microwaving the sections for 6 min at 100℃ in EDTA-antigen retrieval buffers (Servicebio, China). Then, the sections were washed with PBS thrice for 5 min and immersed in 3% hydrogen dioxide solution for 25 min. The sections were then washed with PBS three times again for 5 min and blocked by 3% bovine serum albumin (Solarbio) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies 删除2：<u>(rabbit anti-human α-SMA, 1:300, Lot. ab5694; mouse anti-human smoothelin, 1:200, Lot. ab8969, all purchased from Abcam)</u> at 4°C overnight, and then the sections were washed with PBS (Keygen) thrice and incubated with secondary antibodies (HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse; DAKO, Denmark) for 50 min at room temperature. Then, the sections were washed with PBS, and bound antibodies were detected using a 3,3＇-diaminobenzidine detection kit (DAKO), followed by hematoxylin counterstaining for 3 min.\nFor Masson’s trichrome staining and IHC staining of α-SMA and smoothelin, the integral optical density (IOD) and area of interest were calculated by Image-Pro-plus 6.0 software for further semi-quantitative analysis, and the results were represented as histograms with GraphPad Prism 6 Software.\nHuman normal ureteral tissues came from patients undergoing radical nephrectomy. After collected, ureteral tissues were washed thrice with PBS at room temperature, and then split open with eye scissors, and washed with PBS three times again. Then, the mucosa was separated from the ureteral tissues by forcep and minced into 1 mm pieces. These pieces were gathered and placed onto a 6-cm petri dish and treated with 0.05% EDTA-trypsin (Solarbio) for 25 min at room temperature. The digestion carried out by trypsin was terminated with α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1590 × g. Then the suspension was discarded and the pellet was resuspended with 1.5 mL of keratinocyte serum-free media (KSFM; Gibco, USA) and added onto a 10-cm petri dish gently, then cultured in the incubator at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 48 h of incubation, the outgrowth of cells from each piece of ureteral tissue can be observed, and 3 mL of additional KSFM was added to support cell growth. When UCs were 95% confluent, they were passaged by 0.05% EDTA-trypsin (Solarbio), and passages 3 to 6 of UCs were used to conduct further experiments。\nUCs were seeded onto retrieved structures to construct tissue-engineered urinary tract patch. Briefly, UCs were detached from petri dishes and centrifuged. Then, the UCs were resuspended with KSFM, and the cell concentration was adjusted such that 1 mL of solution contained 5 × 105 cells. The retrieved structure was trimmed and transferred to 96-well plates. Then, 200 μL of the suspension of UCs was dropped onto the top of the retrieved structure, and the seeded structure was incubated at 37℃ in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. To examine the seeded UCs on the implanted structure, immunofluorescent double staining of cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and α-SMA was conducted as aforementioned in the protocol for CD31 and α-SMA double staining, with the primary antibodies including mouse anti-human anti-pan cytokeratin antibody AE1/AE3 (1:300, ab961; Abcam), and rabbit anti-human α-SMA (1:300, ab5694; Abcam).\nStatistical analyses were performed with SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. The comparison between groups was performed using t test, and a value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nA large number of hADSCs were attained from the recovery of purchased hADSCs, and after 2 to 3 days of culture, the hADSCs presented the \"hill-vally\" morphology 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. Passage 4 of the hADSCs were harvested from the petri dish to generate MTs, and at day 3 after generation, the MTs were collected for use in 3D bioprinting 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>. Correspondingly, passage 4 of the hADSCs was detached from the petri dish for 3D bioprinting as a control for microscopic observation. After the bioprinting process, both adhered hADSCs and MTs exhibited a shrunken diameter 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1C and Figure 1D]</u>, and the configuration of the adhered hADSCs was changed to a round shape, while the MTs largely maintained their morphology. The flow cytometry results showed that the hADSCs presented a strong positivity for CD44 and CD105, while no signal was detected for CD45 and CD34. The percentage of positive cells was 99.98%, 99.97%, 0.02%, and 0.04% 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nNon-induced adhered hADSCs and MTs were obtained for analysis of VEGFA and TSG-6 expression. Analysis showed that the expression of VEGFA and TSG-6 was much higher in MTs than in hADSCs. The semiquantitative assay showed that the band intensity of VEGFA and TSG-6 in the MTs and hADSCs was 0.649 ± 0.150 vs. 0.355 ± 0.038, t= 3.291, P= 0.030, and 1.256 ± 0.401 vs. 0.492 ± 0.092, t = 3.216, P = 0.032, respectively 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. These results were consistent with those of our previous study.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>\nSeveral 2 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm (length × width × height) structures were bioprinted for histologic analysis and subcutaneous implantation into nude mice. Figure 3A presents the gross inspection of the freshly bioprinted structure, and two pieces of the bioprinted structure were implanted into one animal subcutaneously 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3B]</u>. After in vivo maturation for 7 days, the implanted structures were extracted. After extraction, the structures had roughly held their configuration and were encapsulated, although some parts of the structures were fragmented 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3C]</u>.\nHE staining demonstrated the morphology of the implanted 3D structure 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>. After subcutaneous implantation for 7 days, both MTs and hADSCs were found to maintain their shape in the retrieved 3D structures.\nImmunofluorescent double staining of CD31 and α-SMA revealed vascularization of the implanted structures通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5A]</u>. As depicted, the bioprinted structure could form neo-vascular tissue (CD31 and α-SMA doublestained) in the MTs group, while only a little α-SMA was expressed and vascular morphology was hardly observed in the hADSCs group. The expression of interleukin (IL)-2 in the MTs group was lower than that in the hADSCs group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5B]</u>, but semi-quantitative analysis showed that there was no statistical significance in the difference between the two groups (MTs vs. hADSCs: 7.67 ± 1.26 vs. 12.6 ± 4.79, t = 1.724, P = 0.16).\nMasson’s trichrome staining revealed smooth muscle fibers and collagen fibers in the implanted structures 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u>. As the test depicted, NI-MTs in the implanted structures could form several collagen fibers, but smooth muscle fibers were rare. Meanwhile, ID-MTs in the implanted structures generated collagen fibers and smooth muscle fibers at the same time. Semi-quantitative analysis showed that the mean IOD (mean IOD = IOD summation/area summation) was 71.7 ± 14.2 (NI-MTs) vs. 35.7 ± 11.4 (ID-MTs) for collagen fibers (t= 3.428, P= 0.027) and 12.8 ± 1.9 (NI-MTs) vs. 30.6 ± 8.9 (ID-MTs) for smooth muscle fibers (t= 3.369, P = 0.028).\nIHC staining showed that the expression of α-SMA and smoothelin was much higher in the ID-MTs than in the NI-MTs after 7 days of implantation 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7]</u>. Semiquantitative analysis demonstrated that the mean IOD was 0.0613 ± 0.0172 (ID-MTs) vs. 0.002 ± 0.001 (NI-MTs) (t = 5.994, P = 0.027) for α-SMA and 0.0355 ± 0.0128 (ID-MTs) and 0.0035 ± 0.0022 (NI-MTs) (t= 4.268, P = 0.013) for smoothelin, thus suggesting that ID-MTs could maintain their phenotype in the bioprinted structure during the 7-day in vivo encapsulation process.\nAfter 7 to 10 days, primary culture of UCs was established, and passages 3 to 6 were employed for the next experiments. At passage 4, the UCs presented a typical cobblestone morphology 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 8A]</u>. After seeding with UCs for 1 week, the UCs were viable and lined up mainly in a monolayer on the encapsulated structures, which incorporated ID-MTs/NI-MTs, as confirmed by immunofluorescent staining of AE1/AE3 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 8B and Figure 8C]</u>.\nUrinary tract reconstruction remains a challenging surgical intervention due to the shortage of appropriate biomaterials for replacement of urinary tract defects. Clinical autografting of tissue such as lingual or oral buccal mucosa and prepuce is often used for urethra reconstruction and yields satisfactory outcomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13,14,15]</u> However, harvesting these autografts is traumatic and might cause complications including infection, bleeding, tricholithiasis, etc.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> In addition, the limited source of these autografts restricts second chances at urinary tract reconstruction, which drives researchers to look for other substitutions. Under these circumstances, natural and synthetic biomaterials have been discovered for use in urinary tract reconstruction. Despite their advantages in biocapability and modifiability, both natural and synthetic biomaterials are unable to disperse cells into themselves. This means that cells are seeded onto the surface of these biomaterials and a wait is required to achieve infiltration,通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,17,18]</u> thus prolonging their preparation time and limiting their further application.\nThe 3D bioprinting has shed light on tissue engineering. Compared to the traditional cell-infiltration strategy, 3D bioprinting can be used to fabricate a computer-designed construct of cells and bioinks, which accelerates the process of building a tissue-engineered structure and makes it possible to produce \"off the shelf\" substitutes for the replacement of defective native tissue. In the present study, we employed 3D bioprinting to fabricate smooth muscle-ID-MTs into a designed structure and encapsulated the bioprinted structures through subcutaneous implantation into nude mice. HE staining showed that after 1 week of implantation, the MTs largely preserved their morphology, and Masson’s trichrome staining revealed that NI-MTs were collagen fiber-rich and smooth muscle fiber depleted, while ID-MTs were the opposite, suggesting that the implanted structure utilizing ID-MTs could mimic the smooth muscle layer of native urinary tract.\nOne of the major concerns for tissue engineering is vascularization and anti-inflammation of the fabricated structure because grafts from natural or synthetic biomaterials for urinary tract reconstruction often end up failing due to lack of blood supply and the presence of inflammation or immunorejection. Although our previous investigation indicated that MTs gain better cell viability than single cells during the 3D bioprinting process,通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> vascularization, and anti-inflammation still play a crucial role in the survival of the implanted structure and the fate of the incorporated MTs. Many researchers have discovered various ways to enhance the vascularization of tissueengineered structures. Heller et al通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> constructed tissueengineered buccal mucosa by triculturing epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts in a native collagen membrane. The results verified that the capillary-like structures in the native membrane became functional blood vessels through anastomosis with host vasculature after implantation into nude mice. Wang et al通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> wrapped PLGA nanospheres with VEGF and modified a BAM graft with these nanospheres to reconstruct rabbit urethra. Their results suggested that anterior urethra reconstruction with the sustained-release of VEGF by PLGA nanospheresmodified BAMG stents could reduce postoperative restenosis. Another interesting study conducted by Jia et al通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> showed that collagen scaffold bound with collagen-binding VEGF (VEGF) could promote urethral tissue regeneration and improve the function of the neourethra in an extensive urethral defect beagle model. In this research, the expression of VEGFA and TSG-6 was investigated with a Western blotting assay, and the results demonstrated that both VEGFA and TSG-6 were expressed at a much higher level in MTs than in monolayer-cultured hADSCs, which is consistent with our previous study.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> A similar investigation was performed by Freeman et al通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> They pre-vascularized chondrogenically primed human mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) aggregates by culturing them in endothelial growth medium, and then the aggregates were implanted into nude rats. The results showed that the pre-vascularized cartilaginous aggregates formed mature endogenous vessels. In comparison with the aforementioned studies, our present study revealed that MTs of hADSCs could express VEGFA without any other manipulation and, thus, shed light on vascularization in vivo when MTs were employed for tissue-engineered structures instead of the classic single-cell strategy. Moreover, immunofluorescent staining of CD31 and α-SMA in the retrieved structure confirmed neo-vascularization in the MTs group, while the monolayer hADSC group only had little neo-vascularization. For antiinflammation, TSG-6 is a well-known anti-inflammatory protein that has been investigated by many scholars. Among these studies, Magaña-Guerrero et al通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> found that conditioned medium from human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells was able to diminish the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and TSG-6 participates in the inhibition mechanism of reactive oxygen species-dependent NETs. Yun et al通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> identified that both mesenchymal stromal cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (MSCs) and bone marrow-derived MSCs exert therapeutic effects in the cornea by reducing inflammation in part through the expression of TSG-6. Previous research conducted by Zhou et al通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> utilized MTs constructed of hADSCs to treat erectile dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, and the results verified that the MTs expressed VEGF, nerve growth factor, and TSG-6, which was partly similar to our present study. Attractively, we noticed that even in monolayer-cultured hADSCs, there was also expression of TSG-6 to some degree, suggesting that hADSCs have the potential to alleviate inflammation, in accordance with the results of Song et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Neverthe-less, the higher expression of TSG-6 in MTs makes them a preferable candidate for fabricating tissue-engineered structures. In the following IHC results, the observed trend that the expression of IL-2 was lower in MTs than in hADSCs confirmed that bioprinted structures containing MTs might cause milder immunorejection, since IL-2 is a useful indicator of this type of inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u>\nIn our previous study, we found that combining hanging-drop cultures with SMIM could enhance the smooth muscle differentiation of hADSCs in vitro,通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> but whether or not ID-MTs could maintain their phenotype in vivo was still unknown. According to studies conducted by other researchers, when cells infiltrate the biomaterials, their phenotypes might be changed and impose a negative effect on cell function.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Therefore, IHC was employed to examine the phenotype of ID-MTs in the bioprinted structure after subcutaneous implantation, and NI-MTs were set as the control. After 7 days of implantation, the expression of α-SMA and smoothelin in ID-MTs indicated the stability of their phenotypes, while NI-MTs had little expression of these two smooth muscle markers. These results supported the use of MTs to create a supporting matrix, or so-called substrate, for UCs by bioprinting a urinary tract patch.\nUrothelial tissue plays an important role in native urinary tract due to its barrier function, which prevents urine leakage into deeper tissue layers.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> In our previous study, the subcutaneous implantation of a poly (L-lactic acid) scaffold into nude mice could induce the formation of capsules on the structure,通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> and it was proven that the entrapped UCs lined up mainly in a monolayer on the capsular stents within an embedding period of 1 week. In the present study, we isolated and expanded human UCs from the ureter and then seeded the UCs onto the encapsulated structure. The results of immunofluorescence showed the expression of urothelial marker AE1/AE3 on the encapsulated structure, revealing that the UCs formed monolayer on the bioprinted urinary tract patch, thus developing a \"barrier\" to protect the bioprinted urinary tract patch from urine seepage.\nIn conclusion, we built a tissue-engineered urinary tract patch by combining 3D bioprinting and subcutaneous implantation. The results from Western blotting and histology analysis demonstrated that the ID-MTs consisting of hADSCs might be a preferable candidate for use in constructing a urinary tract patch for UC adhesion. Further investigation is required to examine its effectiveness for urinary tract reconstruction in an animal model.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81570601)</u>.</u>\n删除7：<u>None.</u>", "index": 11817, "show": true, "start": 11804, "end": 11928, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:01:47", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:02:50", "cost": 63.765}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:02:50", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:01:45"}

The changes of the pressure in the bladder base chamber and proximal urethra were recorded synchronously before and after administration of autonomic drugs. All data were analyzed with Student's t test.RESULTSThe bladder base had little response to acetylcholine (Ach) which however promoted a contraction of the proximal urethra. The effect of Ach on the proximal urethra was antagonized by phentolamine, but not by atropine. Isoprenaline resulted in relaxation of the bladder base, though it had little effect on the urethra. Norepinephrine (NE) produced contraction of the bladder base and urethra, while phentolamine caused a reduction in the bladder base and urethral pressure, and blocked the response of the bladder outlet region to NE. Angiotensin amide (AII) caused contraction of the bladder base and urethra, which was not obliterated by phentolamine.CONCLUSIONSThe cholinergic drug has no influence on the in vivo canine bladder base, but causes a contraction of the proximal urethra through indirect activation of alpha-receptors.

Although the primary cause of ischemic stroke has been attributed to blood flow interruption, the specific mechanisms underlying the progression of the disease, in particular the secondary cell death processes remain not fully understood. A widely postulated cell death pathway implicated in stroke involves mitochondrial Ca2+ overload induced by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Such aberrant mitochondrial Ca2+ overload has been shown to play a vital role in the onset and progression of pathophysiological process in the early phases of ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Previous studies have demonstrated that the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), which possesses two transmembrane domains and forms tetrameric highly specific mitochondrial Ca2+ channels, is responsible for the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake 1 (MICU1) has been demonstrated to be a key regulator of MCU 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. This MICU1 regulation (albeit inhibition) of MCU acti- vation occurs at low cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]c, while MICU1 as an activator of MCU ensues at high [Ca2+]c (2.5 μM) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Interestingly, upregulated expression of MCU and increased [Ca2+]c accompany the early stages of cerebral ischemic damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[2, 3]</u>.\nIn view of the reported interaction between MICU1 and MCU, whereby MICU1 activates MCU at high [Ca2+]c 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>, we advanced the hypothesis that if indeed MICU1 is involved in the early pathogenesis of stroke, then MICU1 upregulation should be detected acutely in discrete regions of the ischemic stroke brain. Thus, we examined here the expression of MICU1 both at protein and mRNA levels at the acute stages of experimentally induced ischemic stroke in animals. The results from this study should provide insights into the specific timing and brain regions associated with MICU1 upregulation after cerebral ischemia.\nWe used adult male Sprague–Dawley rats which weighed between 250 and 280 g, purchased from Hebei Medical University Experimental Animal Center. All rats were kept on a 12 h-light/12 h-dark with humidity of 55 ± 5%, and had free access to food and water. Rats were randomly divided into eight groups as control (normal control), sham (sham operated), MCAO 3 h, MCAO 6 h, MCAO 12 h, MCAO 24 h, MCAO 48 h, MCAO 72 h. The brain samples were collected from the rats after decapitation. The sample size of n = 5 was estimated based power analysis taking into account our pre- vious studies demonstrating the minimum number of samples needed to demonstrate 25% difference between treatment groups.\nRats underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>[4, 5]</u>. After induction of anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection with 10% chloral hydrate (250 mg/kg), a nylon filament (diameter 0.265 mm) was inserted intraluminally into the Internal carotid artery (ICA) about 18 to 20 mm deep. Gentamicin was used to protect against infection at the incision site. Rats of the sham group received the same surgery except for the filament insertion. The body temperatures of the rats were maintained at 37 ± 1 °C by an electric blanket during the surgery. Moreover, physiological measures, including pH, pCO2, pO2, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure were recorded, and did not significantly differ among animals, confirming a homogenous set of stroke animals was enrolled in this study.\nAll investigators testing the animals were blinded to the treatment condition. Animals were subjected to neurological exam by using a scale for grading the ischemic injuryinduced dysfunctions as follows: 0, rats extend straight both forelimbs, indicating no observable deficit; 1, rats keep the left forelimb to the breast and extend straight the right forelimb; 2, rats show decreased resistance to lateral push in addition to behavior in score 1 without circling; 3, rats twist the upper half of their body in addition to behavior in score 2. The animal was subjected to this test 3 times, and the scores from all 3 tests were averaged to give a mean neurologic deficit score (maximum possible score, 9 points divided by 3 tests = 3).\nThe volume of infarction was analyzed using the triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), a histological assay for determining dehydrogenase activity. Under deep anesthesia (chloral hydrate, 500 mg/kg, i.p.) animals were perfused intracardiacally with saline. Brains were then harvested, blocked, and processed for TTC staining. The volume of infarction was measured in each slice and summed using computerized planimetry (PC-based Image Tools software). The volume of infarction was computed as: 2 mm (thickness of the slice) × [sum of the infarction area in all brain slices (mm2)]. To minimize artifacts produced by post-ischemic edema in the infarcted area, the infarction area in the ipsilateral hemisphere was indirectly measured by subtracting the non-infarcted area in the ipsilateral hemisphere from the total intact area of the contralateral hemisphere.\nThe Total Protein Extraction Kit (Applygen Technologies Inc. Beijing, China) was used to obtain the total protein of the brain tissue, focusing on the peak area of ischemic tissue (bregma 1 to −1 mm). About 30 μg total protein samples were applied to electrophoresis and then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore Corporation, USA) as previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. After being blocked with 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti- MICU1 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in 5% milk. Polyclonal mouse anti-beta actin antibody (1:3000, Bioworld Technology) was used as a loading control. Membranes were incubated by fluorescent labeling second antibodies (IRDye 800-conjugate rabbit anti-goat IgG or rabbit anti-mouse IgG 1:5000 dilution; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. We analyzed the relative density of bands on the Odyssey infrared scanner (LICOR Bioscience, Lincoln, NE, USA).\nParaffin-embedded sections were used to evaluate the expression of MICU1 at 6 h and 12 h after MCAO as pre- viously described 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The brains of the rats were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde over 24 h at 4 °C, embedded in paraffin after being dehydrated in different gradients of alcohols. Then cut the brain into 5 μm per slice. Brain sections were blocked in 3% normal donkey serum and then incubated with MICU1 goat polyclonal antibody (1: 100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibodies were used the next day (Zhongshan Biology Technology Company, Beijing, China). Five visual fields of the ischemic regions (bregma 1 to −1 mm which corresponded to core and peri-infarct areas to fully capture the extent of cell death) were selected to count the mean density value under a 400× microscope. A separate cohort of animals were also subjected to MCAO, with animals euthanized at 6 h and 12 h after stroke, and brains harvested as above, but processed for double-labeling of MICU1 (1: 100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the neuronal marker MAP2 (1:100 Abcam). The regions of interest for estimation of MICU1 expression and MAP2 positive cells included the peak area of ischemic regions (bregma 1 to −1 mm), which were photographically captured (Axiophot2; Zeiss), and cells were quantified by counting per HPF view selected at random and corrected by the Abercrombie formula. Six captured fields in each coronal level, using three anterior-posterior levels, were used to analyze the MICU1 expression and MAP2 positive cells, using Scion Image software (Scion, Frederick, MD). Binary images were created using a distinct threshold, and then the positive areas were calculated.\nRats’ brain tissue, also focusing on the peak area of ischemic tissue (bregma 1 to −1 mm), was rapidly dissected and the total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA (2 μg) from each sample was applied to reverse transcribed for synthesized cDNA. Primers were synthesized by Shanghai Biological Engineering Technology Company Limited. Forward and reverse primers were 5’-TTCCTCACAACGGTGCTCTC- 3’ and 5’-CCAGACTTGAGGGTGTTCCC-3’ for MICU1 and 5’-CCCATCTATGAGGGTTACGC-3’ and 5’-TTTA ATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3’ for β-actin. Each sample was measured in triplicate and all samples were normalized by β-actin. Relative gene expression was calculated with the 2-ΔΔCT method and then analyzed using logarithmic transformation.\nAll results are shown as mean ± standard error. One-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls and LSD tests were applied for multiple comparisons. Mann–Whitney U test was applied for neurological deficit score. The differences with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nThe present induction of experimental stroke, MCAO, in adult rats replicated the well-established focal cerebral ischemia model which led to a significant cortical and subcortical infarction  corresponding neurological deficits . Cerebral infarcts was evident in TTC staining, which showed about 45% of the ipsilateral hemisphere infarcted compared to the contralateral intact hemisphere . The neurological deficits using the forelimb extension test confirmed that all rats subjected to MCAO surgery completely cannot extend the contralateral forelimb .\nWe detected the expression of MICU1 at protein level by western blot with whole tissue lysates collected from the rats’ brain regions from bregma 1 to −1 mm. Our results suggested that the expression of MICU1 was not notably changed at 3 h after ischemia, while significantly increased at 6-12 h after the middle cerebral artery occlusion, then the expression decreased gradually .\nWe further measured the expression of MICU1 by immunohistochemistry in the neurons located in the same region of ischemic brains subject to MCAO at 6 and 12 h after ischemia. As expected, obviously increased MICU1 were found at both 6 h and12h , which was consistent with the results of Western blot. These results suggested that the expression of MICU1 was indeed up-regulated at protein level after ischemia.\nIn this study, we also measured the mRNA level of MICU1 at brain regions from bregma 1 to −1 mm after cerebral ischemia. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to detect the change of MICU1 mRNA expression at different time points after MCAO in rats as previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. We obtained consistent results in Western blot assays, showing that mRNA expression of MICU1 increased at 6-12 h after brain ischemia, and gradually decreased after 12 h .\nThe present study revealed that MICU1 expression was upregulated in the early stage (6 h and 12 h) of cerebral ischemia. The expression of MICU1 was co-localization with neurons in ischemic regions of the brain, suggesting an intimate association of MICU1 expression and the evolving pathology in acute stroke.\nCa2+ overload plays an important role in pathophysiological process after cerebral ischemic damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Previous studies showed that a rise of calcium concentration signals an increased cellular energy demand and mediates a number of pathways that can precipitate mitochondrial injury and cell death 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Of interest, increments in [Ca2+]c are detected at the acute phases after MCAO 通用删除6(英):<u>[10, 11, 12]</u>. At approximately the same time, the expression of MCU is up-regulated 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Of interest, the aberrant pathophysiological cascade of cell death events at the early stage of cerebral ischemia may involve MCU- mediated Ca2+ alterations that can lead to perturbed homeostasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1, 9, 13]</u>. That MICU1 is a key regulator of MCU implicates MICU1 serving a pivotal role in the initial progression of stroke. In particular, MICU1 can activate MCU at high [Ca2+]c 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>, which can subsequently promote MCU-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and ultimately cell death. However, this remains speculative as we have not yet established that the upregulation of MICU1 expression directly modulates MCAO onset and progression.\nAdditional studies are warranted to demonstrate causeand-effect relationship between MICU1 and MCAO, which may include the use gene and pharmacologic knockout or inhibition of MICU1. At best, our study showed that the expression of MICU1 was up-regulated in acute ischemic stroke, which paralleled previous studies demonstrating elevated [Ca2+]c and increased MCU at the same time period.\nOur results indicate that MICU1 upregulation accompanied acute ischemic stroke. Because MICU1 is involved in Ca2+ homeostasis by regulating MCU activation, this study supports MICU1 as a novel molecular target for abrogating the calcium overload detected in the early phase of cerebral ischemia.\nMCAO: Middle cerebral artery occlusion; MCU: Mitochondrial calcium uniporter; MICU1: Mitochondrial calcium uptake 1; qPCR: Real time quantitative PCR; SD: Sprague–Dawley\nThe authors acknowledge the funding sources listed above.

Because MICU1 is involved in Ca2+ homeostasis by regulating MCU activation, this study supports MICU1 as a novel molecular target for abrogating the calcium overload detected in the early phase of cerebral ischemia.\nMCAO: Middle cerebral artery occlusion; MCU: Mitochondrial calcium uniporter; MICU1: Mitochondrial calcium uptake 1; qPCR: Real time quantitative PCR; SD: Sprague–Dawley\nThe authors acknowledge the funding sources listed above.

Although the primary cause of ischemic stroke has been attributed to blood flow interruption, the specific mechanisms underlying the progression of the disease, in particular the secondary cell death processes remain not fully understood. A widely postulated cell death pathway implicated in stroke involves mitochondrial Ca2+ overload induced by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Such aberrant mitochondrial Ca2+ overload has been shown to play a vital role in the onset and progression of pathophysiological process in the early phases of ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Previous studies have demonstrated that the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), which possesses two transmembrane domains and forms tetrameric highly specific mitochondrial Ca2+ channels, is responsible for the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake 1 (MICU1) has been demonstrated to be a key regulator of MCU 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. This MICU1 regulation (albeit inhibition) of MCU acti- vation occurs at low cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]c, while MICU1 as an activator of MCU ensues at high [Ca2+]c (2.5 μM) 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Interestingly, upregulated expression of MCU and increased [Ca2+]c accompany the early stages of cerebral ischemic damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[2, 3]</u>.\nIn view of the reported interaction between MICU1 and MCU, whereby MICU1 activates MCU at high [Ca2+]c 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>, we advanced the hypothesis that if indeed MICU1 is involved in the early pathogenesis of stroke, then MICU1 upregulation should be detected acutely in discrete regions of the ischemic stroke brain. Thus, we examined here the expression of MICU1 both at protein and mRNA levels at the acute stages of experimentally induced ischemic stroke in animals. The results from this study should provide insights into the specific timing and brain regions associated with MICU1 upregulation after cerebral ischemia.\nWe used adult male Sprague–Dawley rats which weighed between 250 and 280 g, purchased from Hebei Medical University Experimental Animal Center. All rats were kept on a 12 h-light/12 h-dark with humidity of 55 ± 5%, and had free access to food and water. Rats were randomly divided into eight groups as control (normal control), sham (sham operated), MCAO 3 h, MCAO 6 h, MCAO 12 h, MCAO 24 h, MCAO 48 h, MCAO 72 h. The brain samples were collected from the rats after decapitation. The sample size of n = 5 was estimated based power analysis taking into account our pre- vious studies demonstrating the minimum number of samples needed to demonstrate 25% difference between treatment groups.\nRats underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>[4, 5]</u>. After induction of anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection with 10% chloral hydrate (250 mg/kg), a nylon filament (diameter 0.265 mm) was inserted intraluminally into the Internal carotid artery (ICA) about 18 to 20 mm deep. Gentamicin was used to protect against infection at the incision site. Rats of the sham group received the same surgery except for the filament insertion. The body temperatures of the rats were maintained at 37 ± 1 °C by an electric blanket during the surgery. Moreover, physiological measures, including pH, pCO2, pO2, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure were recorded, and did not significantly differ among animals, confirming a homogenous set of stroke animals was enrolled in this study.\nAll investigators testing the animals were blinded to the treatment condition. Animals were subjected to neurological exam by using a scale for grading the ischemic injuryinduced dysfunctions as follows: 0, rats extend straight both forelimbs, indicating no observable deficit; 1, rats keep the left forelimb to the breast and extend straight the right forelimb; 2, rats show decreased resistance to lateral push in addition to behavior in score 1 without circling; 3, rats twist the upper half of their body in addition to behavior in score 2. The animal was subjected to this test 3 times, and the scores from all 3 tests were averaged to give a mean neurologic deficit score (maximum possible score, 9 points divided by 3 tests = 3).\nThe volume of infarction was analyzed using the triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), a histological assay for determining dehydrogenase activity. Under deep anesthesia (chloral hydrate, 500 mg/kg, i.p.) animals were perfused intracardiacally with saline. Brains were then harvested, blocked, and processed for TTC staining. The volume of infarction was measured in each slice and summed using computerized planimetry (PC-based Image Tools software). The volume of infarction was computed as: 2 mm (thickness of the slice) × [sum of the infarction area in all brain slices (mm2)]. To minimize artifacts produced by post-ischemic edema in the infarcted area, the infarction area in the ipsilateral hemisphere was indirectly measured by subtracting the non-infarcted area in the ipsilateral hemisphere from the total intact area of the contralateral hemisphere.\nThe Total Protein Extraction Kit (Applygen Technologies Inc. Beijing, China) was used to obtain the total protein of the brain tissue, focusing on the peak area of ischemic tissue (bregma 1 to −1 mm). About 30 μg total protein samples were applied to electrophoresis and then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore Corporation, USA) as previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. After being blocked with 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti- MICU1 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in 5% milk. Polyclonal mouse anti-beta actin antibody (1:3000, Bioworld Technology) was used as a loading control. Membranes were incubated by fluorescent labeling second antibodies (IRDye 800-conjugate rabbit anti-goat IgG or rabbit anti-mouse IgG 1:5000 dilution; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. We analyzed the relative density of bands on the Odyssey infrared scanner (LICOR Bioscience, Lincoln, NE, USA).\nParaffin-embedded sections were used to evaluate the expression of MICU1 at 6 h and 12 h after MCAO as pre- viously described 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. The brains of the rats were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde over 24 h at 4 °C, embedded in paraffin after being dehydrated in different gradients of alcohols. Then cut the brain into 5 μm per slice. Brain sections were blocked in 3% normal donkey serum and then incubated with MICU1 goat polyclonal antibody (1: 100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibodies were used the next day (Zhongshan Biology Technology Company, Beijing, China). Five visual fields of the ischemic regions (bregma 1 to −1 mm which corresponded to core and peri-infarct areas to fully capture the extent of cell death) were selected to count the mean density value under a 400× microscope. A separate cohort of animals were also subjected to MCAO, with animals euthanized at 6 h and 12 h after stroke, and brains harvested as above, but processed for double-labeling of MICU1 (1: 100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the neuronal marker MAP2 (1:100 Abcam). The regions of interest for estimation of MICU1 expression and MAP2 positive cells included the peak area of ischemic regions (bregma 1 to −1 mm), which were photographically captured (Axiophot2; Zeiss), and cells were quantified by counting per HPF view selected at random and corrected by the Abercrombie formula. Six captured fields in each coronal level, using three anterior-posterior levels, were used to analyze the MICU1 expression and MAP2 positive cells, using Scion Image software (Scion, Frederick, MD). Binary images were created using a distinct threshold, and then the positive areas were calculated.\nRats’ brain tissue, also focusing on the peak area of ischemic tissue (bregma 1 to −1 mm), was rapidly dissected and the total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA (2 μg) from each sample was applied to reverse transcribed for synthesized cDNA. Primers were synthesized by Shanghai Biological Engineering Technology Company Limited. Forward and reverse primers were 5’-TTCCTCACAACGGTGCTCTC- 3’ and 5’-CCAGACTTGAGGGTGTTCCC-3’ for MICU1 and 5’-CCCATCTATGAGGGTTACGC-3’ and 5’-TTTA ATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3’ for β-actin. Each sample was measured in triplicate and all samples were normalized by β-actin. Relative gene expression was calculated with the 2-ΔΔCT method and then analyzed using logarithmic transformation.\nAll results are shown as mean ± standard error. One-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls and LSD tests were applied for multiple comparisons. Mann–Whitney U test was applied for neurological deficit score. The differences with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nThe present induction of experimental stroke, MCAO, in adult rats replicated the well-established focal cerebral ischemia model which led to a significant cortical and subcortical infarction  corresponding neurological deficits . Cerebral infarcts was evident in TTC staining, which showed about 45% of the ipsilateral hemisphere infarcted compared to the contralateral intact hemisphere . The neurological deficits using the forelimb extension test confirmed that all rats subjected to MCAO surgery completely cannot extend the contralateral forelimb .\nWe detected the expression of MICU1 at protein level by western blot with whole tissue lysates collected from the rats’ brain regions from bregma 1 to −1 mm. Our results suggested that the expression of MICU1 was not notably changed at 3 h after ischemia, while significantly increased at 6-12 h after the middle cerebral artery occlusion, then the expression decreased gradually .\nWe further measured the expression of MICU1 by immunohistochemistry in the neurons located in the same region of ischemic brains subject to MCAO at 6 and 12 h after ischemia. As expected, obviously increased MICU1 were found at both 6 h and12h , which was consistent with the results of Western blot. These results suggested that the expression of MICU1 was indeed up-regulated at protein level after ischemia.\nIn this study, we also measured the mRNA level of MICU1 at brain regions from bregma 1 to −1 mm after cerebral ischemia. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to detect the change of MICU1 mRNA expression at different time points after MCAO in rats as previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. We obtained consistent results in Western blot assays, showing that mRNA expression of MICU1 increased at 6-12 h after brain ischemia, and gradually decreased after 12 h .\nThe present study revealed that MICU1 expression was upregulated in the early stage (6 h and 12 h) of cerebral ischemia. The expression of MICU1 was co-localization with neurons in ischemic regions of the brain, suggesting an intimate association of MICU1 expression and the evolving pathology in acute stroke.\nCa2+ overload plays an important role in pathophysiological process after cerebral ischemic damage 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Previous studies showed that a rise of calcium concentration signals an increased cellular energy demand and mediates a number of pathways that can precipitate mitochondrial injury and cell death 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. Of interest, increments in [Ca2+]c are detected at the acute phases after MCAO 通用删除6(英):<u>[10, 11, 12]</u>. At approximately the same time, the expression of MCU is up-regulated 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Of interest, the aberrant pathophysiological cascade of cell death events at the early stage of cerebral ischemia may involve MCU- mediated Ca2+ alterations that can lead to perturbed homeostasis 通用删除6(英):<u>[1, 9, 13]</u>. That MICU1 is a key regulator of MCU implicates MICU1 serving a pivotal role in the initial progression of stroke. In particular, MICU1 can activate MCU at high [Ca2+]c 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>, which can subsequently promote MCU-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and ultimately cell death. However, this remains speculative as we have not yet established that the upregulation of MICU1 expression directly modulates MCAO onset and progression.\nAdditional studies are warranted to demonstrate causeand-effect relationship between MICU1 and MCAO, which may include the use gene and pharmacologic knockout or inhibition of MICU1. At best, our study showed that the expression of MICU1 was up-regulated in acute ischemic stroke, which paralleled previous studies demonstrating elevated [Ca2+]c and increased MCU at the same time period.\nOur results indicate that MICU1 upregulation accompanied acute ischemic stroke. Because MICU1 is involved in Ca2+ homeostasis by regulating MCU activation, this study supports MICU1 as a novel molecular target for abrogating the calcium overload detected in the early phase of cerebral ischemia.\nMCAO: Middle cerebral artery occlusion; MCU: Mitochondrial calcium uniporter; MICU1: Mitochondrial calcium uptake 1; qPCR: Real time quantitative PCR; SD: Sprague–Dawley\n<mark>The authors acknowledge the funding sources listed above.

He appeared to be unwilling to talk to his family, whereas he had previously been social and caring. He exhibited unusual behavior, dressing his clothes inside out, and impulsively eating foods. He also had excessive daytime sleepiness. However, the patient himself was unaware of this behavior. He was suspected as having herpes simplex encephalitis in the local hospital and was then administered acyclovir intravenously for 21 days. The patient’s condition did not improve.\nThe patient was healthy, except for cerebral infarction 15 years ago, which resulted in mildly weakened muscle strength of the right lower limb. He regularly takes indapamide 2.5 mg q.d. and controls blood pressure at 140–150/80–90 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). He had no history of allergies, mental disorders, trauma, and surgery. He had a 500 pack-year history of cigarette smoking but had quit 15 years earlier. He drank 65 g of alcohol/day but also quit 15 years ago. There was no known relevant family history.\nHis vital signs were normal on a physical examination. No lesions were noted on the mouth or oropharynx. A tough and movable mass with tenderness was accessible on the left side of the neck (3.0 cm in diameter). Examination of the cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal systems was unremarkable.\nA neurological examination showed that the patient was alert, with normal orientation and comprehension. His speech was fluent without paraphasias, but he had a lack of motivation. He could perform serial subtractions of the numbers 7 from 100. He could register and repeat the names of three objects, but he recalled none of them after 3 min. His pupils were equal in size, symmetric, and reactive to light and accommodation. Examinations of the cranial nerves showed that they were almost normal. Strength was mildly weakened in the right limb and a right Babinski’s sign was observed. Sensation and coordination examinations were normal. A mini-mental state examination showed 20 points, which suggested moderate dementia. The memory quotient score was 48 points, which indicated severe memory impairment.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head on March 4 showed abnormal signals in the bilateral hippocampus of temporal lobes, medial frontal gyrus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia region, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and corpus callosum on T2-weighted 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u> and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging. There was slight abnormal contrast-enhancement in MRI with gadolinium enhancement. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed an increased lactic acid peak and a slightly low NAA/creatine value. An electroencephalogram was mild to moderately abnormal, showing diffuse slow activity without epileptiform discharges.\nA lumbar puncture was performed on March 9. Additional laboratory reports showed abnormal results for electrolyte levels, renal function, and paraneoplastic antibodies, anti-Hu (++) and anti-PNMA2 (+). A smear of the cerebrospinal fluid showed no bacteria, fungi, or tumor cells. The patient had hyponatremia without edema. Because serum osmolality was low and urine osmolality was greater than serum osmolality, the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) was diagnosed. We treated him with restriction of fluid (1000–1500 ml/d) and oral sodium chloride powder (2 g, t.i.d.).\nCervical ultrasound showed no abnormalities of the thyroid. Multiple solid nodules were observed on the left side of the carotid artery, and the largest was 3.7 cm × 2.2 cm, with a smooth margin, regular shape, uneven echo, and high blood flow signal. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed distention in the edge of the right vocal cords. CT of the abdomen was normal.\nDepartment ofThoracic Surgery performed a biopsy of the left cervical mass on March 10. A positron-emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) scan on March 11 showed a hypermetabolic (remarkable F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake) soft tissue mass image in the right posterior wall of the hyopharynx (2.5 cm × 2.6 cm) involving the glottis. Simultaneously, a whole-body PET/CT examination ruled out other related carcinomas, such as small cell lung cancer and testicular tumor.\nHistologically, the tumor was mainly composed of nests of epithelioid cells with oval, enlarged nuclei and a slight cytoplasm, with the scattered distribution of lymphocytes. Some syncytial cells were enlarged and cytologically atypical. Vesicular nuclei were commonly seen with a distinct nucleolus and mitotic figures 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1b]</u>. According to immunohistochemical analysis, the tumor cells were positive for the epithelial markers cytokeratin 5 (CK5) and CK8. The neuroendocrine markers chromogranin, synaptophysin, and neuron-specific enolase were negative. The squamous cell marker P63 was partially positive. Transcription of Epstein–Barr virus-encoded nonpolyadenylated RNAs is present in most nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs),通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> but it was negative in our patient. In spite of this, the pathological findings are most consistent with metastatic NPC.\nSIADH, as a manifestation of paraneoplastic syndrome, mainly occurs because the tumor secretes substances that mimic normal hormones. Nonetheless, in our case, the neuroendocrine markers were negative. Therefore, SIADH of our patient may be explained by immune-mediated dysfunction of the hypothalamus. In addition, limbic encephalitis, as a paraneoplastic neurological disorder, is immune-mediated. The mechanism entails tumor antigen expression being identical to the neural antigen that is normally expressed in the nervous system. However, the immune system identifies the normal neural antigen as foreign and mounts an immune attack.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>\nIn conclusion, neurological symptoms may precede the clinical manifestation of primary NPC or metastases, such as swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck. When paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis occurs, NPC should not be ignored while evidence of Epstein–Barr virus has not been found. This case underscores the importance of a comprehensive assessment and a well-grounded diagnosis of diseases.\n删除3：<u>Nil.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 09:58:33", "endTime": "2024/10/09 09:59:11", "cost": 37.501}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:28", "update_time": "2024-10-08 17:59:10", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 17:58:32"}

As the experience accumulated, the off-label use has been expanded to aneurysms of other locations 通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,5,6,7]</u>, small aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>, blood blister like aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u>, recurrent aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13]</u> and ruptured aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>. Though promising, there are also reported data related to unfavorable outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>, and selection of indication for treatment has gain much attention nowadays 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. The treatment effect of PED is accredited to the flow diversion effect, and aneurysms with concomitant complex angioarchitecture might result in disturbed flow. So whether the application of PED in these settings are suitable remains to be clarified. Here, we report the outcomes of 9 patients with 10 aneurysms that incorporated at least one of the following special angioarchitecture: fetal PCA, AVM, V-B junction and DAVF.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 210 consecutive patients who treated by PED between July 2015 to November 2016. Among those patients, 9 patients were identified with a special angioarchitecture that were qualified for the study, namely the aneurysm was related to fetal PCA, ipsilateral AVM, V-B junction and DAVF. The study was approved by the institutional review board of our center. We collected the clinical data and angiographic images of each patient, the clinical outcome was recorded as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at short to midterm follow-up . All patients were treated with dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of 100 mg of aspirin daily and 75 mg of clopidogrel for at least 5 days before the procedure. The inhibition rate was confirmed by TEG. AA% above 75% and ADP% above 50% were considered appropriate for treatment, the required MAADP was 31 mm–47 mm. Systemic heparin was used to achieve an activated clotting time of ≥250 s. We adopted routinely a triaxial system in the deployment of PED for anterior circulation aneurysm, however for aneurysms located on posterior circulation, a biaxial system consisting of 6Fr guiding catheter and Marksman microcatheter was sufficient. The concurrent AVM and DAVF are embolised via a transarterial approach by Onyx (ev3, USA).\nSummary of patients and aneurysms treated with pipeline\n删除重复语句：<u>Summary of patients and aneurysms treated with pipeline</u>\n*Rt = for right\n† Lt = for left\n‡ OphA = Ophthalmic Artery\n§ rIAs = ruptured intracerebral aneurysms\nII UIAs = unruptured intracerebral aneurysms\nWe identified 10 aneurysms from 9 patients that met our inclusion criteria . Our cohort included 1 patient with fetal PCA, 2 patients with ipsilateral AVM, 3 patients located on V-B junction and 3 patients with concomitant DAVF. All of the patients except Case NO. 3 were scored 6 according to the mRS system and were free from any neurological deficit. Case NO.3 died 20 days after operation in local hospital due to brain hemorrhage.\nThe size of aneurysms ranged from 2.5 mm*3.1 mm to 20.1 mm*32.1 mm. Case NO. 6 was treated one month ago and has not been followed up with DSA. The other two aneurysms at V-B junction as well as the aneurysms with fetal PCA or ipsilateral AVM remained canalized (Raymond Scale Score 3) on short to midterm angiographic follow up, even though the aneurysms decreased in size to some extent. On the contrary, all of the 4 aneurysms with concurrent DAVF achieved complete occlusion either through staged procedure or within one single session.\nWe discontinued clopidogrel use for Case No. 4 and 5, and the dual antiplatelet therapy for Case NO. 1 and 2, hoping that this modification of drugs would accelerate the occlusion of the aneurysm. None of these 4 patients received further invasive treatment and was under further angiographic follow up.\nThis was a 61 years old female presented with a ruptured PCoA aneurysm which incorporated the origin of a right fetal PCA. The aneurysm was measured 3.0 mm*4.0 mm with a relative wide neck and two daughter aneurysms . We postponed the procedure 20 days after the onset of SAH to avoid the potential risks of dual antiplatelet therapy. The daughter aneurysm located superiorly was considered to be the rupture point, so we first loosely embolised it with three coils measured 2 mm*3 cm, 1.5 mm*2 cm, 2 mm*4 cm, then we deployed a 4.5 mm*20 mm PED from M1 segment to supraclinoidal segment of ICA covering the neck of the aneurysm . No further coiling of the aneurysm was performed in consideration of the future patency of fetal PCA. The follow up angiogram on 4 months demonstrated the patency of the fetal PCA and the aneurysm has slightly decreased in size , however there remained contrast agent filling in the aneurysm sac. Note that the right A1 is no longer patent and the patient was asymptomatic due to the compensatory flow from the AComA . So we discontinued the dual antiplatelet therapy and leave this patient on MRI follow up, we will not retreat the patient unless the patient will present with headache and enlargement of the aneurysm on MRI image.\nWe have treated 3 patients (case 2, case 3, case 6) in total with an aneurysm whose parent artery was also the feeder of an ipsilateral AVM. Case 2 was a young female with a Spetzler-Martin grade 3 AVM of the right temporoparietal region. This diagnosis was confirmed 14 years ago when epilepsy firstly onset. This patient was on regular image follow up, and the DSA performed 10 months ago revealed a newly formed cavernous aneurysm . Since the aneurysm is the vulnerable part for rupture, we deployed a PED of 3.75 mm*30 mm to cover the neck, then loosely coiled the dome of the aneurysm with 3 coils, namely, Presidio 10 coil 7 mm*30 cm (Codman, USA), MicroPlex 10 Helical 10 mm*30 cm and 9 mm*30 cm (Stryker, USA). The total packing volume was 2.08% . 7 months angiographic follow up  demonstrated that the size of the aneurysm has decreased but still partial embolised. Case No. 3 was a 38-year-old male admitted into our department with an AVM (Spetzler-Martin grade 3) and an ophthalmic aneurysm which ruptured 45 days ago . The aneurysm measured 5 mm in length and 6 mm in width and there existed a daughter sac which presumed to be the rupture point. We then placed one PED (4.75 mm*18 mm) and further occluded it with 8 coils . The packing volume reached 40%. The whole procedure completed without any technical difficulties and the patient discharged without any neurological deficits, however, the patient died 20 days thereafter due to brain hemorrhage in local hospital.\nCase No. 4 was 34-year old female complained a gradually aggravated headache for 3 months. DSA showed a V-B junction aneurysm. Besides the aneurysm, the patient suffered from an AVM (Spetzler-Martin 3) that received feeding arteries both from the anterior posterior circulation . We deployed the PED (4.25 mm*25 mm) from the lower 1/3 of basilar artery to the left VA and further coiled the aneurysm loosely to achieve favorable stasis of flow . 3 months follow up indicated incomplete occlusion of the aneurysm . Case No. 5 was an 8-year-old girl presented with ataxia, vomiting and nausea. DSA indicated a large V-B junction dissecting aneurysm . Learned from the experience of case 4, we decided to telescoping two PEDs (4.25 mm*35 mm) to achieve a better flow diversion effect. Control angiography suggested that there was no apparent stasis of angiographic agent due to the persistent blood flow from the contralateral VA. So we decided to coil the aneurysm and concomitantly to occlude the aneurysm with a detachable balloon (Balt, France) . The patient recovered from general anesthesia smoothly and discharged without any neurological deficit. 3 months follow up angiography indicated a certain degree of decrease in size and the patient was free from any symptom, yet the aneurysm was still partially embolised . So, knowing that the V-B junction aneurysm is quite refractory in nature, we treated case No. 删除4：<u>6</u>  By overlapping 2 longest PEDs (4.25 mm*35 mm) to enhance the flow diversion effect and further occluded the contralateral VA with coils . It is inevitable to cover the perforating branches of basilar artery if you chose a 35 mm long PED. The patient experienced transient visual loss of both eyes, however, the patient completely recovered from these symptoms one day after operation. This patient is still on follow-up.\nWe treated 3 cases of aneurysm with concomitant DAVF either in one single session (Case No.7) or by a staged procedure 通用删除1(英):<u>(Case No. 8, Case No.9)</u>. Case No. 7 was a 56-year-old female with a transverse sinus DAVF whose feeding arteries were from right VA , right petrosquamous branch of ICA , right middle meningeal artery and right occipital artery . The aneurysm measured 2.9 mm*3.9 mm and was located near the origin of the right ophthalmic artery. We deployed a PED (4.0 mm*16 mm) to treat the aneurysm without further coiling it . We applied the Chapot’s technique to protect the sinus during embolization of the DAVF through the right middle meningeal artery , then we deflated the Copernic balloon (Balt, France) and embolised the residual part of fistula through the right occipital artery. The 6 month follow up demonstrated complete occlusion of the aneurysm  and minimal residual of DAVF. We performed staged procedures for Case NO.8 and NO.9, we first treated the anterior fossa DAVF (Case NO.8) and transversus sinus DAVF 通用删除1(英):<u>(Case NO. 9)</u> with Onyx-18 (ev-3, USA). Three months later, when complete occlusion of the fistula was confirmed, we performed PED for both patients. For the aneurysm of Case 9, its patent artery gave branch to feed the fistula, namely, the ipsilateral petrosquamous branch. While for case NO. 8, the right vertebral artery aneurysm was not correlated with any of the feeders of the anterior fossa DAVF. None of the 3 patients experienced any neurological complications, the aneurysms all completely occluded within short-term angiographic follow-up.\nIn our series, we reported the outcomes of 9 patients with 10 aneurysms that incorporated at least one of the following special angioarchitecture: fetal PCA, AVM, V-B junction and DAVF. Except that cases with DAVF were all recovered better and the aneurysms achieved complete occlusion on short to midterm follow-up, we encounter failure to treat aneurysms with fetal PCA, AVM and located at V-B junction. This result suggested that we should limit our use of PEDs in those settings.\nWith reference to other reports and as manifested in our case, there were 6 patients with fetal PCA aneurysm treated with PED in literature. All of the reported cases were performed in a way that the PED was placed from the M1 segment to the ICA, expecting that the PED would divert the flow from the fetal PCA. However, none of the aneurysms occluded completely on an angiographic follow up that ranged from 3 months to 30 months, even after the discontinuation of the dual antiplatelet therapy. Peter Kan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> presumed that failure of these cases is due to the fact that fetal PCA has constant anterograde flow without competitive flow through the ipsilateral P1 segment. Flow through the fetal PCA and the aneurysm sac remains high even after deployment of PED owing to the high physiologic demand of the posterior circulation. This high flow would undermine the stasis of blood in the aneurysm. So it is reasonable to manage this kind of aneurysms either by microsurgical clipping or coiling when feasible.\nIn patients harboring an AVM, concurrent arterial aneurysms occur in nearly 2.7–58% patients, with 10%–20% being most often cited in the largest case series. 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. These flow associated aneurysms are the weak points that significantly increase the risk of hemorrhage, so the treatment of these two lesions entails a thorough understanding of the hemodynamics and angioarchitecture 通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18,19,20]</u>. Considering the complex flow pattern, deployment of a flow diverter to the aneurysm might result in unfavorable outcome. Shakur et al. as well as other authors had reported that after PED placement, the hemodynamics in distal arteries will be disrupted and contribute to delayed ipsilateral intraparenchymal hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>[21,22]</u>. In our Case NO. 3, we are still not sure about whether the lethal hemorrhage was due to rerupture of the aneurysm or the AVM, since the patient died in a local hospital. But this case is adequate to alert our use of PED in these settings. Not only prone to rupture, the coexisting AVM might delay the occlusion of the aneurysm. Even though implanting a PED would lower the flow volume rate of the parent artery 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>, the flow through the parent artery which ultimately feed the AVM remains high, this will undermine the stasis of blood in the aneurysm. However, this is only a hypothesis that requires further validation of flow dynamic data.\nReports regarding the application of PED on aneurysms at V-B junction is still rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24,25]</u>, since covering the mid-basilar perforators predisposes the patient for brainstem stroke. By far, Munich et al. reported the largest cohort of patients with a vertebrobasilar fusiform aneurysm. At an average follow-up of 11 months, complete aneurysm occlusion was seen in 90% of the patients and 3 of the 11 patients (27%) suffered new neurological deficits postoperatively and one of these patients died 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Natarajan et al. has reported another series of 6 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. At an average follow up of 9 months, 5 of the 6 patients achieved complete obliteration of the aneurysm (83.3%). Only one patient in his series required a second procedure (16.7%), since DSA follow-up on 7 months demonstrated patency of the aneurysm sac. Besides that, one of the six patients experienced brainstem perforator stroke, the symptoms persisted and the mRS was 4 on 12 months’ follow-up. Despite the promising results in the literature, 1 of the 3 patients experienced a transient ischemic stroke, and DSA follow up at 3 months for the other 2 patients indicated partial embolization of the aneurysms. Two reasons might account for this disparity of results, namely the number of PEDs used and the length of follow up time. In Munich’s series, the average number of PEDs were 3.6, along with 2 Enterprise stents (Codman, USA). In Natarajan’s series, half of the patients were treated with more than 2 PEDs. Presumably, overlapping multiple PEDs will enhance the flow diversion effect, however at a higher risk of elevated ischemia rate. We only deployed one single PED for Case No. 4, the lack of adequate flow diversion might be the explanation for partial embolization. However, even though we overlapped two PEDs and sacrificed the left VA for Case NO. 5 with a balloon, the stasis was still unsatisfactory, and follow up at 3 months indicated patency of the aneurysm despite that the aneurysm indeed shrinked in size. For this case, the relatively short follow up time might be the excuse. Since the patient was free from the symptoms aforementioned, we discontinued clopidogrel and put this patient on further DSA follow up. In our experience, we take special cautions in the treatment of V-B junction aneurysms with PED, in that it requires a thorough analysis between a relative long interval for complete occlusion and the risk of overlapping multiple PEDs. Endovascular treatment of aneurysms located at vertebrobasilar junction was a demanding task. Traditional vascular approaches had unsatisfactory treatment outcome regarding the complete occlusion rate and complication rate. Flow diversion offers us with an alternative due to its capability of endoluminal reconstruction and avoids robust packing of coils in the aneurysms sac. Considering the low porosity of pipeline, we treated these aneurysms with great caution. Flow diversion treatment was initiated only when the aneurysm become enlarged or symptomatic on follow up. If left untreated at this timing, due to the increased risk of periprocedural compression of brain stem, the aneurysm will progress to a bigger volume that exclude the possibility of coiling, stent assisted coiling and flow diversion.\nThis is a retrospective review and only included a small number of patients. There exists inherent bias with such a study design. Besides that, we did not obtain hemodynamic data in patients, so we cannot illustrate how the coexistence of these angioarchitectures influenced the occlusion of the aneurysm. At last, the follow-up period is relatively short in patients with aneurysms at V-B junction, so we cannot give concrete data that our treatment modality is successful in the long term. However, our study did give us some hints on the selection of patients that will benefit from a pipeline embolization device.\nPED for aneurysms incorporated the fetal PCA and V-B junction might meet a high propensity for incomplete occlusion during short term follow up. The treatment of V-B junction aneurysms entails the sacrifice of the contralateral VA and overlapping multiple PEDs. We should pay special attentions to these aneurysms and seek a balance point between complete occlusion rate and the risk of ischemic stroke. Aneurysm with ipsilateral AVM is not suitable for PED treatment due to the risk of hemorrhage and incomplete occlusion during midterm follow up. For aneurysm with concurrent DAVF, the aneurysm might be safely and efficiently treated either in one session or by staged operation.\nAVM: Arteriovenous malformation; DAVF: Dural arteriovenous fistula; DSA: Digital subtracted angiography; ICA: Internal carotid artery; PCA: Posterior cerebral artery; PED: Pipeline embolization device; VA: Vertebral artery; V-B junction: Vertebral-basilar junction\nThis manuscript was founded by the National Natural Science Fund of China (grant no. 81371314) which was granted to Dr. Chuhan Jiang.\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this manuscript 通用删除8(英):<u>[and its supplementary table and figures]</u>.\nYZ: Conceived and designed the research, and revised the manuscript.

The treatment effect of PED is accredited to the flow diversion effect, and aneurysms with concomitant complex angioarchitecture might result in disturbed flow. So whether the application of PED in these settings are suitable remains to be clarified. Here, we report the outcomes of 9 patients with 10 aneurysms that incorporated at least one of the following special angioarchitecture: fetal PCA, AVM, V-B junction and DAVF.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 210 consecutive patients who treated by PED between July 2015 to November 2016. Among those patients, 9 patients were identified with a special angioarchitecture that were qualified for the study, namely the aneurysm was related to fetal PCA, ipsilateral AVM, V-B junction and DAVF. The study was approved by the institutional review board of our center. We collected the clinical data and angiographic images of each patient, the clinical outcome was recorded as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at short to midterm follow-up . All patients were treated with dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of 100 mg of aspirin daily and 75 mg of clopidogrel for at least 5 days before the procedure. The inhibition rate was confirmed by TEG. AA% above 75% and ADP% above 50% were considered appropriate for treatment, the required MAADP was 31 mm–47 mm. Systemic heparin was used to achieve an activated clotting time of ≥250 s. We adopted routinely a triaxial system in the deployment of PED for anterior circulation aneurysm, however for aneurysms located on posterior circulation, a biaxial system consisting of 6Fr guiding catheter and Marksman microcatheter was sufficient. The concurrent AVM and DAVF are embolised via a transarterial approach by Onyx (ev3, USA).\nSummary of patients and aneurysms treated with pipeline\n删除重复语句：<u>Summary of patients and aneurysms treated with pipeline</u>\n*Rt = for right\n† Lt = for left\n‡ OphA = Ophthalmic Artery\n§ rIAs = ruptured intracerebral aneurysms\nII UIAs = unruptured intracerebral aneurysms\nWe identified 10 aneurysms from 9 patients that met our inclusion criteria . Our cohort included 1 patient with fetal PCA, 2 patients with ipsilateral AVM, 3 patients located on V-B junction and 3 patients with concomitant DAVF. All of the patients except Case NO. 3 were scored 6 according to the mRS system and were free from any neurological deficit. Case NO.3 died 20 days after operation in local hospital due to brain hemorrhage.\nThe size of aneurysms ranged from 2.5 mm*3.1 mm to 20.1 mm*32.1 mm. Case NO. 6 was treated one month ago and has not been followed up with DSA. The other two aneurysms at V-B junction as well as the aneurysms with fetal PCA or ipsilateral AVM remained canalized (Raymond Scale Score 3) on short to midterm angiographic follow up, even though the aneurysms decreased in size to some extent. On the contrary, all of the 4 aneurysms with concurrent DAVF achieved complete occlusion either through staged procedure or within one single session.\nWe discontinued clopidogrel use for Case No. 4 and 5, and the dual antiplatelet therapy for Case NO. 1 and 2, hoping that this modification of drugs would accelerate the occlusion of the aneurysm. None of these 4 patients received further invasive treatment and was under further angiographic follow up.\nThis was a 61 years old female presented with a ruptured PCoA aneurysm which incorporated the origin of a right fetal PCA. The aneurysm was measured 3.0 mm*4.0 mm with a relative wide neck and two daughter aneurysms . We postponed the procedure 20 days after the onset of SAH to avoid the potential risks of dual antiplatelet therapy. The daughter aneurysm located superiorly was considered to be the rupture point, so we first loosely embolised it with three coils measured 2 mm*3 cm, 1.5 mm*2 cm, 2 mm*4 cm, then we deployed a 4.5 mm*20 mm PED from M1 segment to supraclinoidal segment of ICA covering the neck of the aneurysm . No further coiling of the aneurysm was performed in consideration of the future patency of fetal PCA. The follow up angiogram on 4 months demonstrated the patency of the fetal PCA and the aneurysm has slightly decreased in size , however there remained contrast agent filling in the aneurysm sac. Note that the right A1 is no longer patent and the patient was asymptomatic due to the compensatory flow from the AComA . So we discontinued the dual antiplatelet therapy and leave this patient on MRI follow up, we will not retreat the patient unless the patient will present with headache and enlargement of the aneurysm on MRI image.\nWe have treated 3 patients (case 2, case 3, case 6) in total with an aneurysm whose parent artery was also the feeder of an ipsilateral AVM. Case 2 was a young female with a Spetzler-Martin grade 3 AVM of the right temporoparietal region. This diagnosis was confirmed 14 years ago when epilepsy firstly onset. This patient was on regular image follow up, and the DSA performed 10 months ago revealed a newly formed cavernous aneurysm . Since the aneurysm is the vulnerable part for rupture, we deployed a PED of 3.75 mm*30 mm to cover the neck, then loosely coiled the dome of the aneurysm with 3 coils, namely, Presidio 10 coil 7 mm*30 cm (Codman, USA), MicroPlex 10 Helical 10 mm*30 cm and 9 mm*30 cm (Stryker, USA). The total packing volume was 2.08% . 7 months angiographic follow up  demonstrated that the size of the aneurysm has decreased but still partial embolised. Case No. 3 was a 38-year-old male admitted into our department with an AVM (Spetzler-Martin grade 3) and an ophthalmic aneurysm which ruptured 45 days ago . The aneurysm measured 5 mm in length and 6 mm in width and there existed a daughter sac which presumed to be the rupture point. We then placed one PED (4.75 mm*18 mm) and further occluded it with 8 coils . The packing volume reached 40%. The whole procedure completed without any technical difficulties and the patient discharged without any neurological deficits, however, the patient died 20 days thereafter due to brain hemorrhage in local hospital.\nCase No. 4 was 34-year old female complained a gradually aggravated headache for 3 months. DSA showed a V-B junction aneurysm. Besides the aneurysm, the patient suffered from an AVM (Spetzler-Martin 3) that received feeding arteries both from the anterior posterior circulation . We deployed the PED (4.25 mm*25 mm) from the lower 1/3 of basilar artery to the left VA and further coiled the aneurysm loosely to achieve favorable stasis of flow . 3 months follow up indicated incomplete occlusion of the aneurysm . Case No. 5 was an 8-year-old girl presented with ataxia, vomiting and nausea. DSA indicated a large V-B junction dissecting aneurysm . Learned from the experience of case 4, we decided to telescoping two PEDs (4.25 mm*35 mm) to achieve a better flow diversion effect. Control angiography suggested that there was no apparent stasis of angiographic agent due to the persistent blood flow from the contralateral VA. So we decided to coil the aneurysm and concomitantly to occlude the aneurysm with a detachable balloon (Balt, France) . The patient recovered from general anesthesia smoothly and discharged without any neurological deficit. 3 months follow up angiography indicated a certain degree of decrease in size and the patient was free from any symptom, yet the aneurysm was still partially embolised . So, knowing that the V-B junction aneurysm is quite refractory in nature, we treated case No. 删除4：<u>6</u>  By overlapping 2 longest PEDs (4.25 mm*35 mm) to enhance the flow diversion effect and further occluded the contralateral VA with coils . It is inevitable to cover the perforating branches of basilar artery if you chose a 35 mm long PED. The patient experienced transient visual loss of both eyes, however, the patient completely recovered from these symptoms one day after operation. This patient is still on follow-up.\nWe treated 3 cases of aneurysm with concomitant DAVF either in one single session (Case No.7) or by a staged procedure 通用删除1(英):<u>(Case No. 8, Case No.9)</u>. Case No. 7 was a 56-year-old female with a transverse sinus DAVF whose feeding arteries were from right VA , right petrosquamous branch of ICA , right middle meningeal artery and right occipital artery . The aneurysm measured 2.9 mm*3.9 mm and was located near the origin of the right ophthalmic artery. We deployed a PED (4.0 mm*16 mm) to treat the aneurysm without further coiling it . We applied the Chapot’s technique to protect the sinus during embolization of the DAVF through the right middle meningeal artery , then we deflated the Copernic balloon (Balt, France) and embolised the residual part of fistula through the right occipital artery. The 6 month follow up demonstrated complete occlusion of the aneurysm  and minimal residual of DAVF. We performed staged procedures for Case NO.8 and NO.9, we first treated the anterior fossa DAVF (Case NO.8) and transversus sinus DAVF 通用删除1(英):<u>(Case NO. 9)</u> with Onyx-18 (ev-3, USA). Three months later, when complete occlusion of the fistula was confirmed, we performed PED for both patients. For the aneurysm of Case 9, its patent artery gave branch to feed the fistula, namely, the ipsilateral petrosquamous branch. While for case NO. 8, the right vertebral artery aneurysm was not correlated with any of the feeders of the anterior fossa DAVF. None of the 3 patients experienced any neurological complications, the aneurysms all completely occluded within short-term angiographic follow-up.\nIn our series, we reported the outcomes of 9 patients with 10 aneurysms that incorporated at least one of the following special angioarchitecture: fetal PCA, AVM, V-B junction and DAVF. Except that cases with DAVF were all recovered better and the aneurysms achieved complete occlusion on short to midterm follow-up, we encounter failure to treat aneurysms with fetal PCA, AVM and located at V-B junction. This result suggested that we should limit our use of PEDs in those settings.\nWith reference to other reports and as manifested in our case, there were 6 patients with fetal PCA aneurysm treated with PED in literature. All of the reported cases were performed in a way that the PED was placed from the M1 segment to the ICA, expecting that the PED would divert the flow from the fetal PCA. However, none of the aneurysms occluded completely on an angiographic follow up that ranged from 3 months to 30 months, even after the discontinuation of the dual antiplatelet therapy. Peter Kan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> presumed that failure of these cases is due to the fact that fetal PCA has constant anterograde flow without competitive flow through the ipsilateral P1 segment. Flow through the fetal PCA and the aneurysm sac remains high even after deployment of PED owing to the high physiologic demand of the posterior circulation. This high flow would undermine the stasis of blood in the aneurysm. So it is reasonable to manage this kind of aneurysms either by microsurgical clipping or coiling when feasible.\nIn patients harboring an AVM, concurrent arterial aneurysms occur in nearly 2.7–58% patients, with 10%–20% being most often cited in the largest case series. 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.

However, this is only a hypothesis that requires further validation of flow dynamic data.\nReports regarding the application of PED on aneurysms at V-B junction is still rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24,25]</u>, since covering the mid-basilar perforators predisposes the patient for brainstem stroke. By far, Munich et al. reported the largest cohort of patients with a vertebrobasilar fusiform aneurysm. At an average follow-up of 11 months, complete aneurysm occlusion was seen in 90% of the patients and 3 of the 11 patients (27%) suffered new neurological deficits postoperatively and one of these patients died 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Natarajan et al. has reported another series of 6 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. At an average follow up of 9 months, 5 of the 6 patients achieved complete obliteration of the aneurysm (83.3%). Only one patient in his series required a second procedure (16.7%), since DSA follow-up on 7 months demonstrated patency of the aneurysm sac. Besides that, one of the six patients experienced brainstem perforator stroke, the symptoms persisted and the mRS was 4 on 12 months’ follow-up. Despite the promising results in the literature, 1 of the 3 patients experienced a transient ischemic stroke, and DSA follow up at 3 months for the other 2 patients indicated partial embolization of the aneurysms. Two reasons might account for this disparity of results, namely the number of PEDs used and the length of follow up time. In Munich’s series, the average number of PEDs were 3.6, along with 2 Enterprise stents (Codman, USA). In Natarajan’s series, half of the patients were treated with more than 2 PEDs. Presumably, overlapping multiple PEDs will enhance the flow diversion effect, however at a higher risk of elevated ischemia rate. We only deployed one single PED for Case No. 4, the lack of adequate flow diversion might be the explanation for partial embolization. However, even though we overlapped two PEDs and sacrificed the left VA for Case NO. 5 with a balloon, the stasis was still unsatisfactory, and follow up at 3 months indicated patency of the aneurysm despite that the aneurysm indeed shrinked in size. For this case, the relatively short follow up time might be the excuse. Since the patient was free from the symptoms aforementioned, we discontinued clopidogrel and put this patient on further DSA follow up. In our experience, we take special cautions in the treatment of V-B junction aneurysms with PED, in that it requires a thorough analysis between a relative long interval for complete occlusion and the risk of overlapping multiple PEDs. Endovascular treatment of aneurysms located at vertebrobasilar junction was a demanding task. Traditional vascular approaches had unsatisfactory treatment outcome regarding the complete occlusion rate and complication rate. Flow diversion offers us with an alternative due to its capability of endoluminal reconstruction and avoids robust packing of coils in the aneurysms sac.

Aneurysm with ipsilateral AVM is not suitable for PED treatment due to the risk of hemorrhage and incomplete occlusion during midterm follow up. For aneurysm with concurrent DAVF, the aneurysm might be safely and efficiently treated either in one session or by staged operation.\nAVM: Arteriovenous malformation; DAVF: Dural arteriovenous fistula; DSA: Digital subtracted angiography; ICA: Internal carotid artery; PCA: Posterior cerebral artery; PED: Pipeline embolization device; VA: Vertebral artery; V-B junction: Vertebral-basilar junction\nThis manuscript was founded by the National Natural Science Fund of China (grant no. 81371314) which was granted to Dr. Chuhan Jiang.\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this manuscript 通用删除8(英):<u>[and its supplementary table and figures]</u>.\nYZ: Conceived and designed the research, and revised the manuscript.

The study was approved by the institutional review board of our center. We collected the clinical data and angiographic images of each patient, the clinical outcome was recorded as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at short to midterm follow-up . All patients were treated with dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of 100 mg of aspirin daily and 75 mg of clopidogrel for at least 5 days before the procedure. The inhibition rate was confirmed by TEG. AA% above 75% and ADP% above 50% were considered appropriate for treatment, the required MAADP was 31 mm–47 mm. Systemic heparin was used to achieve an activated clotting time of ≥250 s. We adopted routinely a triaxial system in the deployment of PED for anterior circulation aneurysm, however for aneurysms located on posterior circulation, a biaxial system consisting of 6Fr guiding catheter and Marksman microcatheter was sufficient. The concurrent AVM and DAVF are embolised via a transarterial approach by Onyx (ev3, USA).\nSummary of patients and aneurysms treated with pipeline\n删除重复语句：<u>Summary of patients and aneurysms treated with pipeline</u>\n*Rt = for right\n† Lt = for left\n‡ OphA = Ophthalmic Artery\n§ rIAs = ruptured intracerebral aneurysms\nII UIAs = unruptured intracerebral aneurysms\nWe identified 10 aneurysms from 9 patients that met our inclusion criteria . Our cohort included 1 patient with fetal PCA, 2 patients with ipsilateral AVM, 3 patients located on V-B junction and 3 patients with concomitant DAVF. All of the patients except Case NO. 3 were scored 6 according to the mRS system and were free from any neurological deficit. Case NO.3 died 20 days after operation in local hospital due to brain hemorrhage.\nThe size of aneurysms ranged from 2.5 mm*3.1 mm to 20.1 mm*32.1 mm. Case NO. 6 was treated one month ago and has not been followed up with DSA. The other two aneurysms at V-B junction as well as the aneurysms with fetal PCA or ipsilateral AVM remained canalized (Raymond Scale Score 3) on short to midterm angiographic follow up, even though the aneurysms decreased in size to some extent. On the contrary, all of the 4 aneurysms with concurrent DAVF achieved complete occlusion either through staged procedure or within one single session.\nWe discontinued clopidogrel use for Case No. 4 and 5, and the dual antiplatelet therapy for Case NO. 1 and 2, hoping that this modification of drugs would accelerate the occlusion of the aneurysm. None of these 4 patients received further invasive treatment and was under further angiographic follow up.\nThis was a 61 years old female presented with a ruptured PCoA aneurysm which incorporated the origin of a right fetal PCA. The aneurysm was measured 3.0 mm*4.0 mm with a relative wide neck and two daughter aneurysms . We postponed the procedure 20 days after the onset of SAH to avoid the potential risks of dual antiplatelet therapy. The daughter aneurysm located superiorly was considered to be the rupture point, so we first loosely embolised it with three coils measured 2 mm*3 cm, 1.5 mm*2 cm, 2 mm*4 cm, then we deployed a 4.5 mm*20 mm PED from M1 segment to supraclinoidal segment of ICA covering the neck of the aneurysm . No further coiling of the aneurysm was performed in consideration of the future patency of fetal PCA. The follow up angiogram on 4 months demonstrated the patency of the fetal PCA and the aneurysm has slightly decreased in size , however there remained contrast agent filling in the aneurysm sac. Note that the right A1 is no longer patent and the patient was asymptomatic due to the compensatory flow from the AComA . So we discontinued the dual antiplatelet therapy and leave this patient on MRI follow up, we will not retreat the patient unless the patient will present with headache and enlargement of the aneurysm on MRI image.\nWe have treated 3 patients (case 2, case 3, case 6) in total with an aneurysm whose parent artery was also the feeder of an ipsilateral AVM. Case 2 was a young female with a Spetzler-Martin grade 3 AVM of the right temporoparietal region. This diagnosis was confirmed 14 years ago when epilepsy firstly onset. This patient was on regular image follow up, and the DSA performed 10 months ago revealed a newly formed cavernous aneurysm . Since the aneurysm is the vulnerable part for rupture, we deployed a PED of 3.75 mm*30 mm to cover the neck, then loosely coiled the dome of the aneurysm with 3 coils, namely, Presidio 10 coil 7 mm*30 cm (Codman, USA), MicroPlex 10 Helical 10 mm*30 cm and 9 mm*30 cm (Stryker, USA). The total packing volume was 2.08% . 7 months angiographic follow up  demonstrated that the size of the aneurysm has decreased but still partial embolised. Case No. 3 was a 38-year-old male admitted into our department with an AVM (Spetzler-Martin grade 3) and an ophthalmic aneurysm which ruptured 45 days ago . The aneurysm measured 5 mm in length and 6 mm in width and there existed a daughter sac which presumed to be the rupture point. We then placed one PED (4.75 mm*18 mm) and further occluded it with 8 coils . The packing volume reached 40%. The whole procedure completed without any technical difficulties and the patient discharged without any neurological deficits, however, the patient died 20 days thereafter due to brain hemorrhage in local hospital.\nCase No. 4 was 34-year old female complained a gradually aggravated headache for 3 months. DSA showed a V-B junction aneurysm. Besides the aneurysm, the patient suffered from an AVM (Spetzler-Martin 3) that received feeding arteries both from the anterior posterior circulation . We deployed the PED (4.25 mm*25 mm) from the lower 1/3 of basilar artery to the left VA and further coiled the aneurysm loosely to achieve favorable stasis of flow . 3 months follow up indicated incomplete occlusion of the aneurysm . Case No. 5 was an 8-year-old girl presented with ataxia, vomiting and nausea. DSA indicated a large V-B junction dissecting aneurysm . Learned from the experience of case 4, we decided to telescoping two PEDs (4.25 mm*35 mm) to achieve a better flow diversion effect. Control angiography suggested that there was no apparent stasis of angiographic agent due to the persistent blood flow from the contralateral VA. So we decided to coil the aneurysm and concomitantly to occlude the aneurysm with a detachable balloon (Balt, France) . The patient recovered from general anesthesia smoothly and discharged without any neurological deficit. 3 months follow up angiography indicated a certain degree of decrease in size and the patient was free from any symptom, yet the aneurysm was still partially embolised . So, knowing that the V-B junction aneurysm is quite refractory in nature, we treated case No. 删除4：<u>6</u>  By overlapping 2 longest PEDs (4.25 mm*35 mm) to enhance the flow diversion effect and further occluded the contralateral VA with coils . It is inevitable to cover the perforating branches of basilar artery if you chose a 35 mm long PED. The patient experienced transient visual loss of both eyes, however, the patient completely recovered from these symptoms one day after operation. This patient is still on follow-up.\nWe treated 3 cases of aneurysm with concomitant DAVF either in one single session (Case No.7) or by a staged procedure 通用删除1(英):<u>(Case No. 8, Case No.9)</u>. Case No. 7 was a 56-year-old female with a transverse sinus DAVF whose feeding arteries were from right VA , right petrosquamous branch of ICA , right middle meningeal artery and right occipital artery . The aneurysm measured 2.9 mm*3.9 mm and was located near the origin of the right ophthalmic artery. We deployed a PED (4.0 mm*16 mm) to treat the aneurysm without further coiling it . We applied the Chapot’s technique to protect the sinus during embolization of the DAVF through the right middle meningeal artery , then we deflated the Copernic balloon (Balt, France) and embolised the residual part of fistula through the right occipital artery. The 6 month follow up demonstrated complete occlusion of the aneurysm  and minimal residual of DAVF. We performed staged procedures for Case NO.8 and NO.9, we first treated the anterior fossa DAVF (Case NO.8) and transversus sinus DAVF 通用删除1(英):<u>(Case NO. 9)</u> with Onyx-18 (ev-3, USA). Three months later, when complete occlusion of the fistula was confirmed, we performed PED for both patients. For the aneurysm of Case 9, its patent artery gave branch to feed the fistula, namely, the ipsilateral petrosquamous branch. While for case NO. 8, the right vertebral artery aneurysm was not correlated with any of the feeders of the anterior fossa DAVF. None of the 3 patients experienced any neurological complications, the aneurysms all completely occluded within short-term angiographic follow-up.\nIn our series, we reported the outcomes of 9 patients with 10 aneurysms that incorporated at least one of the following special angioarchitecture: fetal PCA, AVM, V-B junction and DAVF. Except that cases with DAVF were all recovered better and the aneurysms achieved complete occlusion on short to midterm follow-up, we encounter failure to treat aneurysms with fetal PCA, AVM and located at V-B junction. This result suggested that we should limit our use of PEDs in those settings.\nWith reference to other reports and as manifested in our case, there were 6 patients with fetal PCA aneurysm treated with PED in literature. All of the reported cases were performed in a way that the PED was placed from the M1 segment to the ICA, expecting that the PED would divert the flow from the fetal PCA. However, none of the aneurysms occluded completely on an angiographic follow up that ranged from 3 months to 30 months, even after the discontinuation of the dual antiplatelet therapy. Peter Kan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> presumed that failure of these cases is due to the fact that fetal PCA has constant anterograde flow without competitive flow through the ipsilateral P1 segment. Flow through the fetal PCA and the aneurysm sac remains high even after deployment of PED owing to the high physiologic demand of the posterior circulation. This high flow would undermine the stasis of blood in the aneurysm. So it is reasonable to manage this kind of aneurysms either by microsurgical clipping or coiling when feasible.\nIn patients harboring an AVM, concurrent arterial aneurysms occur in nearly 2.7–58% patients, with 10%–20% being most often cited in the largest case series. 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>. These flow associated aneurysms are the weak points that significantly increase the risk of hemorrhage, so the treatment of these two lesions entails a thorough understanding of the hemodynamics and angioarchitecture 通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18,19,20]</u>. Considering the complex flow pattern, deployment of a flow diverter to the aneurysm might result in unfavorable outcome. Shakur et al. as well as other authors had reported that after PED placement, the hemodynamics in distal arteries will be disrupted and contribute to delayed ipsilateral intraparenchymal hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>[21,22]</u>. In our Case NO. 3, we are still not sure about whether the lethal hemorrhage was due to rerupture of the aneurysm or the AVM, since the patient died in a local hospital. But this case is adequate to alert our use of PED in these settings. Not only prone to rupture, the coexisting AVM might delay the occlusion of the aneurysm. Even though implanting a PED would lower the flow volume rate of the parent artery 通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>, the flow through the parent artery which ultimately feed the AVM remains high, this will undermine the stasis of blood in the aneurysm. However, this is only a hypothesis that requires further validation of flow dynamic data.\nReports regarding the application of PED on aneurysms at V-B junction is still rare 通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24,25]</u>, since covering the mid-basilar perforators predisposes the patient for brainstem stroke. By far, Munich et al. reported the largest cohort of patients with a vertebrobasilar fusiform aneurysm. At an average follow-up of 11 months, complete aneurysm occlusion was seen in 90% of the patients and 3 of the 11 patients (27%) suffered new neurological deficits postoperatively and one of these patients died 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. Natarajan et al. has reported another series of 6 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. At an average follow up of 9 months, 5 of the 6 patients achieved complete obliteration of the aneurysm (83.3%). Only one patient in his series required a second procedure (16.7%), since DSA follow-up on 7 months demonstrated patency of the aneurysm sac. Besides that, one of the six patients experienced brainstem perforator stroke, the symptoms persisted and the mRS was 4 on 12 months’ follow-up. Despite the promising results in the literature, 1 of the 3 patients experienced a transient ischemic stroke, and DSA follow up at 3 months for the other 2 patients indicated partial embolization of the aneurysms. Two reasons might account for this disparity of results, namely the number of PEDs used and the length of follow up time. In Munich’s series, the average number of PEDs were 3.6, along with 2 Enterprise stents (Codman, USA). In Natarajan’s series, half of the patients were treated with more than 2 PEDs. Presumably, overlapping multiple PEDs will enhance the flow diversion effect, however at a higher risk of elevated ischemia rate. We only deployed one single PED for Case No. 4, the lack of adequate flow diversion might be the explanation for partial embolization. However, even though we overlapped two PEDs and sacrificed the left VA for Case NO. 5 with a balloon, the stasis was still unsatisfactory, and follow up at 3 months indicated patency of the aneurysm despite that the aneurysm indeed shrinked in size. For this case, the relatively short follow up time might be the excuse. Since the patient was free from the symptoms aforementioned, we discontinued clopidogrel and put this patient on further DSA follow up. In our experience, we take special cautions in the treatment of V-B junction aneurysms with PED, in that it requires a thorough analysis between a relative long interval for complete occlusion and the risk of overlapping multiple PEDs. Endovascular treatment of aneurysms located at vertebrobasilar junction was a demanding task. Traditional vascular approaches had unsatisfactory treatment outcome regarding the complete occlusion rate and complication rate. Flow diversion offers us with an alternative due to its capability of endoluminal reconstruction and avoids robust packing of coils in the aneurysms sac. Considering the low porosity of pipeline, we treated these aneurysms with great caution. Flow diversion treatment was initiated only when the aneurysm become enlarged or symptomatic on follow up. If left untreated at this timing, due to the increased risk of periprocedural compression of brain stem, the aneurysm will progress to a bigger volume that exclude the possibility of coiling, stent assisted coiling and flow diversion.\nThis is a retrospective review and only included a small number of patients. There exists inherent bias with such a study design. Besides that, we did not obtain hemodynamic data in patients, so we cannot illustrate how the coexistence of these angioarchitectures influenced the occlusion of the aneurysm. At last, the follow-up period is relatively short in patients with aneurysms at V-B junction, so we cannot give concrete data that our treatment modality is successful in the long term. However, our study did give us some hints on the selection of patients that will benefit from a pipeline embolization device.\nPED for aneurysms incorporated the fetal PCA and V-B junction might meet a high propensity for incomplete occlusion during short term follow up. The treatment of V-B junction aneurysms entails the sacrifice of the contralateral VA and overlapping multiple PEDs. We should pay special attentions to these aneurysms and seek a balance point between complete occlusion rate and the risk of ischemic stroke. Aneurysm with ipsilateral AVM is not suitable for PED treatment due to the risk of hemorrhage and incomplete occlusion during midterm follow up. For aneurysm with concurrent DAVF, the aneurysm might be safely and efficiently treated either in one session or by staged operation.\nAVM: Arteriovenous malformation; DAVF: Dural arteriovenous fistula; DSA: Digital subtracted angiography; ICA: Internal carotid artery; PCA: Posterior cerebral artery; PED: Pipeline embolization device; VA: Vertebral artery; V-B junction: Vertebral-basilar junction<mark>\nThis manuscript was founded by the National Natural Science Fund of China (grant no. 81371314) which was granted to Dr. Chuhan Jiang.\n\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this manuscript 通用删除8(英):[and its supplementary table and figures].\n\nYZ: Conceived and designed the research, and revised the manuscript.

This study aimed to investigate the frequency of Y chromosome loss in the specific patients in order to determine whether it is an age related phenomena or a cytogenetic marker indicating a malignant change.Methods Five hundred and ninety-two male patients with a median age of 59 years old (22-95 years) were included in this study. These patients were divided into two groups: the study group, including 237 patients who had hematological disorders included myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML),chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma (MM), and lymphoma and the control group including 355 patients with no evidence of hematological disease. Both conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization using DNA probes specific for the centromere of chromosomes X or Y were performed according to our standard laboratory protocols.Results Twenty-four out of 237 patients with hematological disorders (10.1%) had Y chromosome loss. Of these 24patients, 2 patients had AML (5.0% of all AML patients), 2 patients had CML (5.7% of all CML patients), 2 patients had MPD (8.0% of all MPD patients), 3 patients had MM (10.0% of all MM patients), 5 patients had lymphoma (10.6% of all lymphoma patients) and 10 patients had MDS (16.7% of all MDS patients). Twenty-one out of these 24 patients had a loss of Y chromosome as the sole anomaly and the remaining three had a loss of Y chromosome accompanied with otherstructural changes detected by conventional cytogenetic analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis confirmed the routine cytogenetic results. All 24 patients had a loss of Y chromosome with a range of 17.5%-98.5% of cells. Two of the patients, one with AML and another with CML, had karyotype and FISH testing done both at the initial diagnosis and during remission. The results showed a loss of Y chromosome at initial diagnosis but a normal 46,XY karyotype during remission. Only 9 out of 355 patients (2.5%) without evidence of hematological disease had Y chromosome loss, among them 7 patients had cardiovascular diseases and 2 patients had kidney diseases. Comparison of the incidence of Y chromosome loss in patients with hematological disorders or without evidence of hematological disease using statistical analysis showed a statistically significance difference (P＜0.05).Conclusions The present study demonstrated that the frequency of Y chromosome loss is significantly higher in patients with hematological disorders than in patients without hematological disorders, which indicates that the loss of Y chromosome is associated with a neoplastic change。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:23:44", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:23:56", "cost": 11.105}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:27", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:23:54", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:23:43"}

But it was at the subcellular molecular biological level that we explored the pathophysiologic basis of classification of spleen deficiency in chronic gastritis by detecting the bioactive substances in gastric mucosa nuclei and mitochondria. Methods By means of optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and histochemical staining, we conducted histopathological, subcellular ultrastructural analysis and nuclei and mitochondrial ultrastructural analysis of gastric mucosa of 188 spleen deficiency patients and of 42 voluntary blood donors. At the same time, bioactive substances were measured by means of X-ray energy dispersive analysis system (EDAX) image analysis system, radioimmunoassay method and chemiluminescence method. Results The content of cAMP, superoxide dismutase (SOD), Zn and Cu in gastric mucosa, and the content of Zn and Cu in mitochondria decreased progressively in order of groups: healthy control (HC), spleen Qi deficiency without organic lesion (F-SQD), spleen Yang deficiency without organic lesion (F-SyangD), disease without symptoms group, spleen Qi deficiency with organic lesion (G-SQD), spleen Yang deficiency with organic lesion (G-SyangD), spleen Yin deficiency (SyinD) and spleen deficiency with Qi stagnation (SDQS), chronic spleen deficiency gastritis (CSG) and chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG); decreased in order of HC, intestinal metaplasia (IM)Ⅰa, IMⅠb, IMⅡa and IMⅡb, P&lt;0.05.

Bone remodeling and its homeostasis are delicately maintained via bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> It is suggested that bone destruction caused by unbalanced osteoclastogenesis in the tumor bone microenvironment could be a major reason for CIBP.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8,9]</u> Besides the classic antiresorptive agent bisphosphonate, other therapies targeting osteoclasts are also under extensive investigation for alleviating tumor-induced bone remodeling. It is proven that the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) is the main driver of osteoclast formation, function, and survival.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u> Sequestration of RANKL with OPG attenuates CIBP, bone remodeling, and tumor growth within the bone.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Moreover, currently phase III trials have already been completed and have proven that denosumab, a humanized RANKL monoclonal antibody, can effectively reduce bone absorption and skeletal-related events, including CIBP.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,13]</u>\nCalpains are a family of calcium-dependent intracellular cysteine protease that catalyze the limited cleavage of specific proteins during regulatory signaling. They play a major role in various cellular processes, such as signal transduction, cell growth, differentiation and fusion, apoptosis, necrosis, etc.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Among them, μ-calpain is known to degrade various substrates, particularly IκBα, c-Jun, and c-Fos, all of which are essential molecular players in osteoclastogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14,15,16]</u> Our previous study has already shown that a calpain inhibitor can significantly attenuate RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in murine RAW264.7 cells in vitro.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Therefore, calpain might play a pivotal role in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. However, whether such an effect exists in an in vivo animal model and its mechanisms are yet to be tested. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a calpain inhibitor on bone resorption and behavioral responses to pain in vivo in intratibial tumor injected CIBP rats.\nAll experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Ethical Issues of the IASP and were approved by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences/Peking Union Medical College Hospital Committee on Animal Care.\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (240–270 g) used for the study were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle in a pathogen-free area with ad libitum access to water and food. Walker 256 breast cancer cells were kindly provided by the Department Pharmacology, Institute of Pharmacology of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The surgical procedure was the same as described previously.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> Briefly, anesthesia was induced and maintained via a nose cone with halothane (1.5–2.0%). The right hind leg was shaved and disinfected with 70% (v/v) ethanol. The medullary canal of the tibia was approached from a 1-cm long skin incision, by inserting a 23-gauge needle through a drilled hole. A 10-μl volume of Walker 256 cells (5 × 105 cells) was injected into the bone cavity. The hole was sealed using bone wax, and the wound was irrigated with Gentamicin saline and was closed with 1–0 silk threads. The procedure was identical for the sham group except for injection with saline alone. The rats were allowed unrestricted movement in their cages after recovery and carefully monitored.\nImmediately after the operation, calpain inhibitor III (MDL 28170, Calbiochem Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) dissolved in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DSMO) was given at 1 mg/kg (in a volume of 8 ml/kg body weight) intraperitoneally for the inhibitor group, and 0.1% DSMO solution only was given at 10 ml/kg to the vehicle group. Rats were divided into seven groups: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Sarcoma group (n = 9): Received intratibial injection of Walker 256 cells; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> sarcoma + inhibitor group (n = 9): Received intratibial injection of Walker 256 cells and intraperitoneal injection of calpain inhibitor III every day postoperatively; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> sarcoma + vehicle group (n = 9): Received intratibial injection of Walker 256 cells and intraperitoneal injection of 0.1% DSMO every day postoperatively; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> sham group (n = 9): Received intratibial injection of saline; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> sham + inhibitor group (n = 9): Received intratibial injection of saline and intraperitoneal injection of calpain inhibitor III every day postoperatively; 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> sham + vehicle group (n = 9): Received intratibial injection of saline and intraperitoneal injection of 0.1% DSMO every day postoperatively; 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> naïve group (n = 9): No inoculation and no treatment.\nAnimals were left to acclimatize to the area for 30 min before testing. Behavioral signs of mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia were assessed preoperatively and on postoperative days (PODs) 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed by application of four von Frey filaments with increasing bending forces of 1, 5, 9, and 15 g (electronic von Frey anesthesiometer; IITC, Woodland Hills, CA, USA). The nociceptive stimulus was applied perpendicularly to the medial surface of the hind paw with increasing forces. The endpoint was taken as nocifensive paw withdrawal accompanied by head turning, biting and/or licking, and the required pressure was considered the mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) value. Bilateral hind paws of each rat were tested in triplicate at each time point, and the average for the three measurements was then calculated. Cold allodynia was assessed by five applications of 100 μl of acetone to the plantar surface of the hind paw. As with mechanical testing, this was carried out on bilateral hind paws, with each application separated by at least 5 min. The number of lifts observed of the maximum total of five was expressed as percentage response.\nBone powder was used to measure calpain activity using a calpain activity assay kit (Biovision, Mountain View, CA, USA). Tumor bone tissue was carefully ground into powder in liquid nitrogen. Then the bone powder was lysed with extraction buffer in the kit on ice for 30 min. Tissue lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min, and the supernatants were collected. After quantification of protein in the supernatant with the biobarcode assay kit (Qcbio S and T, Beijing, China), 100 μg of protein was used for the calpain activity assay with Ac-LLY-AFC, a fluorescent calpain substrate, in an all-dark fluorescent microplate at 37°C for 1 h. The samples were read in a fluorometer equipped with 400 nm excitation and 505 nm emission filters.\nFormalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor bone tissue was prepared. Tissue sections were then fixed with a solution of formaldehyde, acetone and citrate for 30 s, and incubated for 40 min at 37°C in a staining solution provided in the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TRAP-positive cells with three or more nuclei were counted as multinucleated osteoclasts under ×40 light microscope.\nThe extent of sarcoma induced bone destruction was examined by X-ray assessment of bilateral hind paws of anesthetized rats on POD 14. The conditions of X-ray exposure were 56 kV, 200 mA, and 20 ms. According to the bone destruction standard reported by Honore et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> radiographs of tumor-bearing tibia revealed loss of bone that was quantified on a 0–5 scale: 0 - normal bone; 1 - 1–3 spotted bone resorption sites; 2 - 4–6 spotted bone resorption sites with minor loss of bone in the medullary canal; 3 – substantial loss of bone in the medullary canal with some destruction of the distal cortical bone; 4 - total destruction and discontinuity of cortical bone; 5 - total destruction and discontinuity of cortical bone with displaced fractures. The scale of the bilateral tibia bone of each group was examined and recorded by the same investigator.\nData are presented as mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise stated. For quantitative data, differences between treated and control groups were analyzed with one-way ANOVA test using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software . For semi-quantitative data, statistical analyses were performed using the Kruskal–Wallis H-test. A P < 0.05 was set as the level of statistical significance.\nWhether calpain activity was inhibited after intraperitoneal injection of calpain inhibitor in the established CIBP model was essential to this study. Therefore, total protein of the tumor injected tibia was extracted, and calpain activity was measured in all groups. The results showed that the calpain activity in the sarcoma + inhibitor group and sham + inhibitor group were significantly decreased compared with the other groups (P < 0.05) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>, providing the foundation for further explaining the effect of calpain inhibition.\nSince activated osteoclastogenesis is one of the reasons for CIBP, the effect of calpain inhibitor on the pain behavioral level in vivo was tested. After establishing the rat CIBP model, the MWTs of both the tumor injected side and the contralateral side hind paws of all groups were recorded before surgery and on POD 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14. For the surgical side, after calpain inhibition, the MWT of the sarcoma + inhibitor group recovered and was significantly higher than that of the sarcoma + vehicle group on POD 5, 8 and 11 (P < 0.05), but it was not normalized to the level of the naïve group (P < 0.05) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2a]</u>. For the nonsurgical side, the result was surprisingly similar. The MWT of the sarcoma + inhibitor group was also increased compared with the sarcoma + vehicle group (P < 0.05) but was still lower than the naïve group on POD 8, 11 and 14 (P < 0.05) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2b]</u>. The behavioral score of cold allodynia was also examined on bilateral hind paws. However, there was no difference between the sarcoma + inhibitor group and the sarcoma + vehicle group from POD 2 to 14 (results not shown).\nTo determine whether the calpain inhibitor can suppress RANL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vivo, the tibia bone tissue of all groups were subjected to TRAP staining. The results of the Sarcoma group and sarcoma + vehicle group clearly showed more fused multi-nucleated cells, meaning the osteoclastogenesis process was activated after tumor injection 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3a]</u>. However, after calpain inhibition, the TRAP-positive cell count was significantly decreased in the sarcoma + inhibitor group comparing with the sarcoma + vehicle group (P < 0.05) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3b]</u>, indicating that the osteoclastogenesis process could be blocked with calpain inhibitor in vivo in the CIBP rats.\nOn POD 14, CIBP rats of all groups were subjected to the radiology assessment. As shown in the tibia X-ray radiographs in Figure 4a, the tibia bones of the \"sarcoma groups,\" including the Sarcoma, sarcoma + inhibitor and sarcoma + vehicle groups, exhibited pathological bone characteristics such as high density mass or low density defects in the bone and cortical bone discontinuity. On the contrary, tibia bones of the sham group, naïve group, and nonsurgical side legs of all groups appeared normal. After examining the scale of the radiographs, the \"sarcoma groups\" had higher scores than the naïve group and a sham group (P < 0.01) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4b]</u>. However, there was no significant difference between the sarcoma + inhibitor group and sarcoma + vehicle group, indicating no anti-bone destruction effect of calpain inhibition in CIBP rats in vivo.\nThis study shows that the calpain inhibitor can alleviate mechanical hyperalgesia of bilateral hind paws determined by MWT testing in CIBP rats in vivo. This might be mainly due to the suppression of the osteoclastogenesis process in the tumor bone microenvironment proved by the significant decrease of the TRAP-positive cell count. Since IκBα is one of calpain’s hydrolysis substrates and also the inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), the suppressed osteoclastogenesis after calpain inhibition could be due to the reduction of IκBα hydrolysis, leading to the inhibition of RANKL-induced NF-κB activation, as proved by Lee et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>\nSimilar with our previous in vitro study, TRAP-positive cells in the tibia were significantly decreased after calpain inhibition, indicating that the osteoclastogenesis process can also be interfered with by a calpain inhibitor in vivo. However, after the radiology assessment, there was no statistical significance demonstrated of the bone resorption between the calpain inhibitor group and the control group, which was contrary to the existing evidence. The reason for metastatic bone resorption is that tumor cells destroy the balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts by alteration of the microenvironment.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Several human clinical trials have already proven that anti-RANKL antibody can reduce metastatic cancer induced bone resorption through inhibition of the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway.通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14,15]</u> The result of this study could be attributable to the fact that tumor bone destruction was too serious for the amount of calpain inhibitor we used to take effect, or that the X-ray radiology measurement was not sensitive enough to detect the already decreased bone resorption. The dosage of calpain inhibitor III, 1 mg/kg, administered in the present study was set according to the previous research by Yu and Geddes,通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> who investigated the same agent in a rat spinal cord injury model. Unfortunately, this is among the very few studies that have ever explored the effect of a calpain inhibitor in pain studies in vivo.通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u> Until date, there has not been any study that reported focusing on the CIBP model and osteoclastogenesis, therefore, we had very few references to consult. Whether an increased dosage of calpain inhibitor or a more sensitive method, such as MRI analysis, is effective can be addressed in future studies.\nOur study also showed that the MWTs of not only the surgical side but also the nonsurgical side hind paws were decreased after bone cancer induction in the sarcoma groups. Since the nonsurgical side hind paws did not exhibit signs of bone resorption under radiology testing, bone cancer metastasis was not the reason. Therefore, bilateral hyperalgesia, or \"mirror-image pain,\" was revealed in CIBP rats. Koltzenburg et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> suggested that trans-median sprouting of the commissural interneurons present in the spinal cord and brainstem could be the reason, whereas Milligan et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> believed that mirror-image allodynia is created through glial and proinflammatory cytokine actions. Aside from the CIBP models, mirror-image pain can be seen in many types of neuropathic pain models.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> Several classic neuropathic pain indicators, such as spinal microglial cell activation and up-regulation of postsynaptic receptor proteins in dorsal root (DR) ganglion, were proven to exist in CIBP models.通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u> Moreover, Donovan-Rodriguez et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> reported that Gabapentin, the well-accepted neuropathic pain inhibitor, can normalize CIBP induced dorsal horn neuronal changes and attenuated pain behavior. Therefore, it is consistent with the fact that CIBP has a neuropathic pain component.\nInterestingly, our study demonstrates that a calpain inhibitor can also ameliorate mirror-image pain through increase of MWT of the nonsurgical side hind paws in CIBP rats, suggesting that calpain might somehow be involved in the neuropathic pain mechanism. Xie et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> reported that a calpain inhibitor significantly blocked nerve injury-induced myelin-associated glycoprotein down-regulation in spinal DR and lysophosphatidic acid-induced neuropathic pain. However, there are still very few studies focused on the mechanism of calpain and neuropathic pain.

Random forest has received much attention recently; its primary characteristic is that it can form a classification model from the data with high dimensionality. However, optimal results can not be obtained for gene selection since it is still affected by undifferentiated genes. We proposed recursive random forest analysis and applied it to gene selection. Methods Recursive random forest, which is an improvement of random forest, obtains optimal differentiated genes after step by step dropping of genes which, according to a certain algorithm, have no effects on classification. The method has the advantage of random forest and provides a gene importance scale as well. The value of the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which synthesizes the information of sensitivity and specificity, is adopted as the key standard for evaluating the performance of this method. The focus of the paper is to validate the effectiveness of gene selection using recursive random forest through the analysis of five microarray datasets; colon, prostate, leukemia, breast and skin data. Results Five microarray datasets were analyzed and better classification results have been attained using only a fewgenes after gene selection. The biological information of the selected genes from breast and skin data was confirmed according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The results prove that the genes associated with diseases can be effectively retained by recursive random forest.

Compared with intermittent feeding, CF is thought to be better tolerated by critically ill patients, providing better control of blood glucose and a lower incidence of feeding complications such as diarrhea, vomiting, and aspiration.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> However, in recent years, according to relevant literature reports, continuous enteral nutrition feeding methods have been found to have problems, such as disturbing biological, protein synthesis, gastric volume, and physiological functions, since CF does not conform to the physiological state of the human body and violates the natural biological rhythms.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> Moreover, with the deepening of research and an increase in the number of included cases, an increasing number of studies have shown that the benefits of enteral feeding and the complications of CF are the same as those of intermittent feeding.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,5]</u> A randomized three-way crossover pilot study of healthy volunteers showed no difference in gastric reflux between intermittent and CF.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> For critically ill patients, CF and intermittent feeding have no differences in enteral feeding complications such as diarrhea, bloating, and vomiting.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> No clinically relevant differences in glycemic variability (GV) or insulin use were found between bolus tube feeding and continuous tube feeding.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>\nUnder normal physiological conditions, the circadian system readies the body for daytime feeding. The rate of gastric emptying and gastrointestinal motility is faster in the daytime than at night, with rates peaking in the morning, and gastric acid secretion also has an internal circadian rhythm.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7,8]</u> Aligning feeding/fasting cycles with clock-regulated metabolic changes optimizes the metabolism, and animal studies have suggested that feeding at inappropriate times disrupts the circadian system organization and thereby contributes to adverse metabolic consequences and chronic disease development.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Here, we propose a new feeding method called sequential feeding (SF). In this SF, after the patients achieved 80% of the nutrition target calories (25 kcal·kg-1·day-1) through CF, then the feeding/fasting time is reasonably determined according to the circadian rhythm of the human body and the physiological movement of the digestive organs as laid out in traditional Chinese medicine theory. In traditional Chinese medicine theory, each human organ works regularly at different times throughout the day, and the best feeding times are 7 to 9 o’clock, 11 to 13 o’clock, and 17 to 19 o’clock. Therefore, this SF consists of an initial CF and subsequent intermittent feeding. We think this feeding method is more consistent with human physiological activities and is more suitable for critically ill patients.\nGlucose is recognized as a proinflammatory mediator and can generate reactive oxygen species.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> It can impair the immune system and increase the risk of infection.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> High glucose levels and high GV, as well as hypoglycemia,通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> are also independent conditions associated with an increased risk of mortality in critical illness.通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14]</u> Therefore, glucose control is an important aspect in managing critically ill patients. As a physiological feeding mode, we hypothesized that SF will not increase the difficulty of glucose control. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to determine if the average glucose in SF would not be higher than that in CF among critically ill patients.\nWe performed a prospective, single-blinded, and non-inferiority randomized controlled trial in ICU at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. The trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. QYFYKYLL 2018-16)</u>. This study is a part of a randomized controlled trial. All of the patients or their legally authorized representatives provided written informed consent.\nThis study was conducted on patients who were admitted to the ICU from May to December 2018. Patients newly admitted to the ICU and fed through gastric tubes were enrolled. Moreover, these patients needed to be able to tolerate ≥80% of the nutrition target calories (25-30 kcal·kg-1·day-1) with enteral feeding. The required feeding time had to be >7 days. Patients with the ability to eat orally at admission and those with diabetes, gastrointestinal disease, or recent gastrointestinal surgery were excluded.\nInitially, all patients underwent CF. After achieving ≥80% of the nutrition target calories (25-30 kcal·kg-1·day-1) through CF, the patients were randomly assigned into the SF group or the CF group by opening an opaque, sealed envelope containing the patient’s randomization assignment. The bottle containing enteral nutrients was covered with an opaque bag so the patients were unaware of their intervention. However, the investigators knew the group assignment. For patients in the SF group, the feeding/fasting time was reasonably determined according to the circadian rhythm of the human body and the physiological movement of digestive organs as laid out in traditional Chinese medicine theory. The total daily dosage of enteral nutrition was equally distributed to three time periods of 7 to 9 o’clock, 11 to 13 o’clock, and 17 to 19 o’clock. Enteral nutritional suspension in each time period was pumped at a uniform rate within 2 h by an enteral feeding pump. Patients in the CF group received CF at a constant velocity by an enteral feeding pump. Fingertip blood glucose values at five time points (6:00/11:00/15.00/21:00/1:00) were monitored and recorded for seven consecutive days after randomization. Meanwhile, enteral feeding intolerance was recorded by a researcher-made checklist including the data on diarrhea, abdominal distension, constipation, and gastric residual volume (GRV).\nBaseline characteristics of the patients were recorded on a researcher-made checklist, including age, sex, weight, body mass index, major diagnosis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores at the beginning, mechanical ventilation support, average target calories, total glucose infusion, and insulin therapy.\nThe primary outcome was the average blood glucose (GluAve) value over 7 days. GV was the secondary outcome. GV was assessed by three indices: standard deviation of glucose (GluSD), coefficient of glucose variation (GluCV), and Glucosemax-Glucosemin. GluCV is GluSD divided by GluAve. In addition, the events of hypoglycemia (glucose <3.9 mmol/L) and hyperglycemia (glucose >11.1 mmol/L) were also recorded.\nEnteral feeding intolerance was another secondary outcome. The researcher-made checklist was used to evaluate enteral feeding intolerance, including the incidents of diarrhea, abdominal distension, constipation, and GRV. If these events occurred, enteral feeding intolerance was confirmed: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Diarrhea: the patient had three or more loose stools or continued to have loose stools within 24 h.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Abdominal distension: obvious abdominal distension or intra-abdominal pressure ≥12 mmHg.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Constipation: fewer than three bowel movements per week or exertion during defecation and hard stools.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> GRV ≥200 mL by ultrasonic monitoring was a sign of intolerance.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> In the SF group, GRV was assessed 2 h after stopping the feeding pump (at 11:00/15:00/21:00). In the CF group, GRV was also assessed at these three time points (11:00/15:00/21:00). The duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU, and ICU mortality rate were also recorded.\nNon-inferiority testing was adopted in this study. In CF, the blood glucose value was approximately 9 mmol/L, and the standard deviation was approximately 3. We specu-lated that the blood glucose value was also 9 mmol/L. Then, α was set at 0.05, 1-β was set at 0.8, the non-inferiority value was set to 2, and the sample size calculated by PASS 11.0 software (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT, USA) was 28 in each group. Another six patients were needed to correct for an expected 10% drop out. For the primary parameter, average glucose value, we used a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test with P < 0.050 considered significant for non-inferiority statistics.\nOther statistical analyses were performed by SPSS software version 22.0 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). The results are expressed as the median (interquartile range). The chisquare test or Fisher test was used for qualitative data, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for quantitative data to determine differences between groups. In particular, a repeated measure one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify whether changes in glucose value variables across the time points were different between the two groups. These results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Bonferroni post hoc tests were performed to determine significant differences in glucose in the repeated measures ANOVA. P values < 0.050 were considered statistically significant.\nA total of 903 patients were assessed for eligibility in the study from March to December 2018, and 62 patients were finally enrolled 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. Thirty-two patients were randomized to the SF group, and 30 patients were randomized to the CF group.\nThe baseline characteristics of the patients in the two groups are presented in Table 1, and there were no significant differences between the two groups (P > 0.050).\nComparison of general and clinical characteristics of the patients between the SF and CF groups.\n删除重复语句：<u>Comparison of general and clinical characteristics of the patients between the SF and CF groups.</u>\nData are presented as median (interquartile range) or n/N.

There were differences in the GluCV between the two groups (24.5 [22.2-27.6]% vs. 18.9 [13.7-25.3]%, Z=-2.480, P = 0.013). However, there were no significant differences in glucose standard deviations or Glucosemax-Glucosemin between the two groups (2.2 [1.6-3.1] vs. 2.3 [0.9-2.6] mmol/L, Z= -0.691, P= 0.489; 7.5 [6.1-10.9] vs. 8.7 [3.9-10.4] mmol/L, Z = 0.000, P = 0.999) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>. The results of the repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that there was a significant effect of time on glucose levels (F = 22.302, P < 0.001), and there was an interaction between time and intervention for glucose levels (F= 5.638, P= 0.001). At the 9:00, 15:00, and 21:00 time points, there were no significant differences in glucose between the two groups (P > 0.050). At the 6:00 and 1:00 time points, the average glucose value in the SF group was lower than that in the CF group (6.7 ± 2.3 vs. 8.1 ± 2.8 mmol/L, t=-3.436, P= 0.001; 8.1 ± 1.5 vs. 10.5 ± 2.7 mmol/L, t=-4.331, P < 0.001) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>. Moreover, hypoglycemia (glucose <3.9 mmol/L) was not found in either group. However, hyperglycemia incidence of each patient was more common in the CF group than that in the SF group (38.4 [19.1-63.7]% vs. 11.8 [3.0-36.7]%, Z = -2.213, P = 0.027).

Moreover, no significant differences in the incidence of feeding intolerance during the 7 days, the length of stay in the ICU or mortality in the ICU were found (P > 0.050).\nIn the present study, the average glucose level in SF was not higher than that in CF. In addition, hyperglycemia incidence was higher in the CF group than that in the SF group. There was no increase in feeding intolerance in SF.\nA consensus has been reached on the importance of nutritional support for critically ill patients. However, the choice of enteral nutrition feeding method for ICU patients is still controversial. CF was thought to be better tolerated by critically ill patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction, allowing for easy insulin control and controlling for a limited absorptive gut surface area.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> However, when patients achieve 80% of the nutrition target volume, their gastrointestinal function is almost restored. At this time point, it is unclear whether CF is necessary. Moreover, continuous nutritional delivery alters circadian rhythms of intestinal hormones and post-prandial rhythms of ghrelin and insulin release in response to nutrition.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Circadian misalignment is detrimental to metabolism.通用删除6(英):<u>[21,22]</u> The selection of the time points in SF is based on the theory of the human body clock in traditional Chinese medicine, and we thought this SF was also beneficial for ICU patients.\nAs a new feeding mode, the safety of SF should be concerned. Critically ill patients usually develop high glucose values, which are associated with adverse outcomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> This study showed that the average glucose level of the SF group was not higher than that of the CF group. Blood glucose levels in subjects in the SF group at 6:00 and 1:00 were lower than those in the CF group. In addition, the incidence of hyperglycemia in the SF group was less than that in the CF group, and no cases of hypoglycemia occurred in the SF group.\nThe avoidance of glucose variability causing negative outcomes is a priority for patients in the ICU.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> It is the belief of many clinicians that continuous rather than intermittent feeding helps to reduce this variability. However, in a recent study of 50 critically ill patients comparing bolus feeding given via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with CF, no difference in glucose variability or insulin utilization was found.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Our study also suggested that there were no significant differences in glucose standard deviations and Glucosemax-Glucosemin between the two groups. However, we also found that the GluCV in the SF group was higher than that in the CF group. Previous studies have shown that glucose variability affects the prognosis of critically ill patients,通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> but when patients can tolerate 80% enteral nutrition, this often indicates that their condition has stabilized, and a reasonable fluctuation of blood glucose may be beneficial to patients since it was shown that reasonable glucose variability causes infusion fluctuation, which is beneficial for protein synthesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> In addition, previous studies on glucose variability all used CF, and the influence of glucose variability in CF and SF may be different. In this study, a difference in mortality was not found. Additional studies are needed to confirm the effects of glucose variability in SF.\nFeeding intolerance is very common in patients in the ICU, especially in terms of delayed gastric emptying. It has been shown that both the rate and extent of nutrient absorption are impaired, even during post-pyloric feeding.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> A study has yet to be performed in critically ill patients, and intermittent feeding may increase gut motility by increasing superior mesenteric artery blood flow and enhancing cholecystokinin and peptide YY concentrations.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Similar to other studies,通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u> our study also suggested no significant differences in the incidence of feeding intolerance between the two feeding modes.\nCF may have the following advantages通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>: better GRV management in some populations, better blood sugar control in early stages of a critical illness, it is less laborintensive for nursing staff and there is a wider choice of enteral feeds. On the other hand, intermittent feeding has the following advantages通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>: enhancing muscle protein synthesis, ability to \"catch up\" on missed feeds, a reduction in diarrhea, and freedom from the pump during rehabilitation and other procedures. SF as applied in this study may integrate the advantages of CF and intermittent feeding. CF is used at the initial stage when the gastrointestinal function is impaired, and intermittent feeding, which supports the circadian rhythm of the human body, is used after almost complete recovery of gastrointestinal function. This study demonstrated that the average glucose and enteral feeding intolerance of patients in the ICU were similar in both SF and CF. So, SF may be as safe as CF for patients in the ICU.\nThere were some limitations to this study. First, many patients were excluded for various reasons, such as diabetes and gastrointestinal diseases, and further studies are needed to determine whether the results of this study are suitable for such patients. Second, the observation period is over 7 days, and whether the same conclusion can be reached in a shorter period, such as 3 days, requires further study.\nIn this non-inferiority study, the GluAve value of critically ill patients with SF was not higher than that of critically ill patients with CF. Compared with CF, hyperglycemia was less frequent in SF. There was no significant difference in the incidence of feeding intolerance between SF and CF. Therefore, SF may be as safe as CF for critically ill patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:48:44", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:49:15", "cost": 30.803}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:27", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:49:15", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:48:44"}

This study assessed whether the TNF2 (A) allele at position -308 plays a role in the alteration of blood pressure (BP) and urinary protein excretion during pregnancy.Methods The original prospective cohort study comprised 1623 pregnant women from January 2000 to October 2001. The G/A polymorphism was done by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with Nco I enzyme.Results The distributions of the G/A polymorphism of TNF-α in the promoter region at position -308 were wild-type 72.4% and variant 27.6%, respectively. The frequency of TNF2 (A) allele was approximately 0.15 for Caucasian pregnant women in the study. It was not significantly different in the distributions of genotypes and G/A allele frequencies among the three groups of pregnant women with gestational hypertension, preexisting hypertension and normal blood pressure (P＞0.05). The maternal blood pressure in the third trimester was significantly higher in the group of women possessing the TNF2 (A) allele compared to homozygous for the TNF1 (G) allele (systolic BP, P＜0.01 and diastolic BP, P＜0.05). The elevated blood pressure in the TNF2 (A)group was accompanied by higher urinary protein excretion in the third trimester (P＜0.05). The blood pressure and urinary protein excretion did not change apparently between the two groups in the first and second trimesters (P＞0.05).Conclusions Maternal TNF2 (A) allele of TNF-α promoter region at position -308 could play a role in the alteration of blood pressures and/or enhancement of urinary protein excretion during pregnancy, and might play an important role in the development of both gestational hypertension and preeclampsia。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:33:35", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:33:51", "cost": 15.763}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:27", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:33:50", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:33:34"}

It was assumed that the split fracture is oriented in the sagittal plane, which require buttress from the lateral side with lag screws or plate. However, in the last decade column theory2,3 has led to routine use of CT scan in management of tibial plateau fracture, which has revealed multiple patho-anatomical variants of tibial plateau fracture.删除4：<u>4,5</u> To overcome the initial limitation and to incorporate such variants, the detailed fracture description revisiting the Schatzker classification based on CT scan published.删除4：<u>6</u>\nDespite the evolution in the available classification, some of the injury patterns do not match with the given description of the injury. We reported 2 encountered patients, hoping to reveal one of variant of split type of lateral tibial plateau fracture. The written informed consent from both the patients were obtained and the study was approved by institute ethics committee.\nA 20-year-old male victim of a road traffic accident was initially managed by emergency medical services, thereafter referred to a level-1 trauma center. After advanced trauma life support protocol, the patient was shifted under orthopaedics care, with the chief complaints of pain, in-ability to move and severe soft tissue swelling in and around the left knee. Clinical sign and symptoms of compartment was absent and neurological status was normal. Knee was put in a splint and advised for trauma series along with anterior-posterior and lateral radiograph of the left knee.\nThe antero-posterior (AP) radiographs confirmed the diagnosis of split and depression type of lateral tibial plateau fracture, and lateral plateau revealed unusual posterior displacement of a part of lateral tibial plateau . CT scan was ordered for more clarity, which identified split type of lateral tibial plateau fracture in coronal and sagittal plane without any area of articular depression, furthermore the posterolateral column rotated along its sagittal axis and dislocated posteriorly .\nCorrelating the history, clinical presentation and radiology confirmed the high velocity valgus impaction injury of knee. An emergency trans-articular external fixator was applied due to swelling at the time of presentation and to dis-impact the severely displaced fracture fragment.\nOn the post-operative day 5, the swelling subsided significantly and wrinkling sign was positive, so a call for definitive fixation of the fracture was taken. In view of 2 column fracture involving the anterolateral and shear fracture of the posterolateral column, buttressing of each column was planned. The posterolateral fragment was more severely displaced and bigger fragment, so we used the gastrocnemius raphe splitting approach in the prone position to manage it first. The posterolateral fragment was found lying extruded posteriorly out of the knee joint  which was reduced and stabilized with buttress principle using the fixed reconstruction plate. Keeping the patient in the same position, anterolateral fragment was lagged with two 6.5 mm partially threaded cannulated screws and washer.\nAfter completing the osteosynthesis, the knee was examined for instability, stress radiography confirmed Garde III medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury . The medial approach was performed to further confirmed complete MCL at tibial attachment . MCL was repaired with fiber wire and fixed to the suture post .\nIn postoperative period, a hinged knee brace was applied for early knee range of motion and non-weight bearing walking started immediately. The patient was followed clinic-radiologically at 1st, 3rd and 6th months. At 3 months of follow-up, the patient was able to walk pain-free without any aid, no varus-valgus instability and complete radiological healing of fracture . He resumed routine activity of daily life and job at 6 months of follow-up with knee society score of 100 .\nA 32-year-old motorcyclist crashed into a car and suffered a blow over the right knee. The patient was referred to a level-1 trauma center. Following the advanced trauma life support protocol, the patient was advised routine radiograph and CT scan.\nThe AP radiograph showed a type-II Schaztker fracture i.e. split and depression . CT scan clearly depicted a dual plane split i.e. coronal and saggital of lateral tibial condyle with severe displacement of posterolateral column as in the case 1 . Furthermore, osteochondral rim avulsion of the medial tibial plateau with suspicion of MCL injury seen over the 3 dimensional computed tomography .\nIn agreement to the principles of damage control orthopaedics, a knee spanning external fixator was applied on post-operative day 1. A similar strategy as first case was followed. Firstly the patient was placed in a prone position and the posterolateral fragment was buttressed with a proximal tibia periarticular plate through gastrocnemius splitting approach. Subsequently the patient was placed in supine position and anterolateral column was buttressed with anatomical lateral column plate. Intraoperative finding confirmed the rim avulsion from medial tibial plateau with grade-III MCL injury. A direct medial approach was used and showed the rupture of MCL from tibial attachment . All-suture type of suture anchors were used at joint level and under surface of osteochondral fragment . The suture bridge type of repair with knotless anchor at 5 cm below the joint line were performed in the end .\nThe rehabilitation protocol was complied the same as the earlier, a hinged knee brace for early knee range of motion and to prevent joint stiffness. At 4 months follow-up the patient was pain free and ambulatory; fracture united radiologically; and knee was stable on clinical examination. He resumed routine activity of daily life and job at 6 months of follow-up with knee society score of 92 .\nFractures involving the lateral tibial plateau are believed to happen with low velocity of trauma.删除4：<u>1</u> Increasing rate of road traffic accidents and improved understanding of fractures stretched the confines of the Schatzker classification, which directly affected the reliability and prognosis of injury. Both of our patients fall in such a grey zone, as the fracture type does not match to the severity of injury, the pattern of fracture and displacement .\nDescription of clinical presentation and management of the 2 cases.\n删除重复语句：<u>Description of clinical presentation and management of the 2 cases.</u>\nRTA: road traffic accident; MCL: medial knee ligament.\nInitially based on AP radiograph, both the cases were labelled as split and depression type of lateral tibial plateau fracture. Afterward careful evaluation with the multiplanar CT scan revealed the details of fracture pattern which we found important in surgical planning. 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> There was a visible split of the lateral tibia plateau in the coronal plane and the sagittal plane, which split apart the lateral tibial condyle into the anterolateral and posterolateral column. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> No part of the articular surface was found depressed, which was appreciated on the radiograph. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> The posterolateral column was displaced posteriorly and rotated along the sagittal plane. It was only the part of the lateral tibial plateau dislocated posteriorly which gave impression of articular depression on the AP radiograph. In presence of above mentioned findings, we coined the term \"dual split and dislocation\" for this peculiar fracture of lateral tibial plateau to match the morphology of fracture and severity of injury.\nBoth patients in our report had injury subsequent to road traffic accident and presented with severe soft tissue swelling, which mandated emergency extern fixator and period of latency before definitive fixation. Subsequently because of the dual plane of split, involving the 2 columns of the lateral tibial plateau, each column was buttressed using the fracture/fragment specific approach.删除4：<u>7</u> The posterolateral fragment was identified as the bigger chunk of plateau,8 so it was stabilized first with buttress principle using the Gastrocnemius raphe splitting approach.删除4：<u>9</u> After completing the osteosynthesis, the knee was examined for the associated injury to ligament, which confirmed the diagnosis of grade-III MCL injury. Association of MCL injury with severely displaced fracture of lateral tibial plateau has been reported by Kolb et al.10 and they proposed preoperative MRI or appropriate radiology. However, getting MRI was not possible in our case because of severity of soft tissue swelling.\nWe could not find description of such cases in the literature. So, we find it worth reporting to raise the level of awareness and a guide for management in such unusual injury. However, consistency of the injury pattern, establishing the treatment guideline and prognosis would require longer series to establish the protocol.\nAn unusual fracture pattern does not fit to the available classification and should be evaluated in detailed. CT scan is always an essential tool to understand the fracture morphology and definitive surgical planning.

The hHR21sp gene is its human homologue. In an attempt to investigate the role of hHR21sp in DNA repair, we studied the effects of UV and γ-ray irradiation on hHR21sp gene expression in normal human peripheral blood cells, and non-iradiated peripheral and bone marrow cells from Fanconi anemia (FA) patients who have shown DNA repair deficiency.\n\n【1】Methods\nTotal steady state RNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells and bone marrow.

The pericardium is the most frequently involved site and myocardial involvement is less common. In this report, we present the case of a patient with a metastatic tumor on the left ventricular wall secondary to the lung cancer with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).\nIn July 2015, a 49-year-old female was admitted to Beijing Hospital complaining of palpitation and dyspnea. She had been diagnosed with pulmonary adenosquamous carcinoma in April 2014 and had undergone tumor resection, radiation, and chemotherapy with four cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine. In February 2015, she developed dyspnea gradually and underwent an echocardiogram which revealed moderate-to-large pericardial effusion and a new mass at the apex of the left ventricle with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55%. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a 5.79 cm × 2.79 cm sessile mass at the apex and free wall of the left ventricle with large pericardial effusion 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. The bloody pericardial effusion was drained out for symptom relief. She was then given gefitinib, and drainage tube was removed. She stayed free of symptoms for 4 months. However, the follow-up imaging showed the enlargement of the heart mass and multiple pulmonary nodules.\nOn the July 2015 admission, physical examination was unremarkable except distant heart sound and tachycardia. Hemoglobin, serum electrolytes, creatinine, and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. NT-proBNP level was 338 pg/ml. An electrocardiogram (ECG) on presentation revealed sinus tachycardia with poor R wave progression in precordial leads and ST-segment elevation in leads V4 through V6, mimicking acute myocardial infarction 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. An echocardiogram revealed the fixed mass at the apex and free wall of the left ventricle with moderate-sized pericardial effusion and a LVEF of 60%. On the 5th day during hospitalization, she developed sustained wide QRS complex tachycardia on telemetry monitoring. Her blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and she complained of palpitation. The 12-lead ECG revealed VT with a cycle length of 360 ms and right bundle branch block morphology with a left axis, consistent with origination from the anatomic location of the cardiac tumor. The VT episode sustained despite intravenous lidocaine and amiodarone therapy. The patient remained alert but her blood pressure decreased to 90/60 mmHg, and she got electrical cardioversion successfully. The intravenous amiodarone suppressed further episodes of VT and then oral amiodarone was given to prevent further ventricular arrhythmia. Defibrillator implantation and catheter ablation were considered; however, because of the patient’s poor overall prognosis, these therapies were thought to be inappropriate. Since gefitinib treatment is not effective in this patient, she resumed chemotherapy and was treated with osimertinib. During 11 months of follow-up, she had no recurrences of VT on oral amiodarone. In May 2016, she suffered from another episode of amiodarone-refractory sustained VT at a rate of 160 beats/min with the same morphology as the previous VT, which was terminated by intravenous lidocaine. No more VT was recorded since then. However, the malignant tumor progressed, and the patient was repeatedly hospitalized for symptom relief and supportive care. On the last admission, the echocardiography showed very large fixed heart mass adhered to adjacent tissue and protruding into the left ventricular cavity with significantly reduced LVEF and mild pericardial effusion. The patient died due to disease progression and ventricular fibrillation in December 2016.\nThe survival rates of cancer have increased dramatically over the past decades. With increasing life expectancy, more patients are being seen with both cancer and heart disease. Cardiovascular complications, including cardiac metastases, are not uncommon in cancer patients with potentially profound impact on morbidity and mortality. A new discipline termed cardio-oncology has evolved to address the cardiovascular needs of cancer patients and optimize their care in a multidisciplinary approach. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can induce cardiovascular complications including heart failure and arrhythmia. The symptoms of this patient might attribute to the cancer treatment partially. Radiation therapy can affect the heart, and pericarditis is the most frequent complication. The reported cardiotoxicities due to cisplatin and gemcitabine, which were used by this patient, include cardiomyopathy, supraventricular tachycardia, and bradycardia. Moreover, gefitinib might have a small risk of QT prolongation, which may trigger torsades de pointes. Thus, the sustained monomorphic VT episodes had little relationship with these cancer therapies, but more related to the metastatic mass, because the origin of VT was consistent with anatomic locations of cardiac metastasis. The most frequently reported malignant tumors with myocardium metastasis include lymphoma, melanoma, and lung cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3]</u> Myocardium metastases associated with ventricular arrhythmia are very rare. The ECG before and after VT episodes of this patient revealed ST-segment elevation in leads V4 through V6, mimicking acute myocardial infarction. However, the absence of cardiovascular risk factors and the normal cardiac enzymes indicated that the ECG abnormalities were not associated with acute myocardial infarction. Cates et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> suggested that ECG findings of myocardial ischemia or injury, particularly localized and prolonged ST elevation, in the absence of ischemic symptoms have a high specificity for cardiac metastasis in patients with malignancy. Evidence of cardiac involvement indicates a poor prognosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Most of the reported cases with VT associated with cardiac metastases ended up in death shortly after the VT episodes. With the progression of cardiac metastasis in this patient, cardiac function was reduced, and multiple drug-refractory VT episodes recurred, and she died 1½ year later.\nCancer patients can present with a variety of cardiovascular problems not all of which are directly related to cancer therapy. Optimal treatment requires close collaboration between cardiology and oncology specialists.\nThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

Sunitinib, a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been reported to exert potent immunoregulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects. We investigated whether sunitinib could suppress the progression of airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and airway remodeling in a murine model of chronic asthma. Methods Ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice were chronically challenged with aerosolized OVA for 8 weeks. Some mice were intragastrically administered with sunitinib (40 mg/kg) daily during the period of OVA challenge. Twelve hours after the last OVA challenge, mice were evaluated for the development of airway inflammation, AHR and airway remodeling. The levels of total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and Th2 cytokines (interieukin (IL)-4 and IL-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured by ELISA. The expression of phosphorylated c-kit protein in the lungs was detected by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting (IP/WB) analysis.Results Sunitinib significantly inhibited eosinophilic airway inflammation, persistent AHR and airway remodeling in chronic experimental asthma. It reduced levels of total serum IgE and BALF Th2 cytokines and also lowered the expression of phosphorylated c-kit protein in remodelled airways.Conclusions Sunitinib may inhibit the development of airway inflammation, AHR and airway remodeling.

Of those patients, 198 patients were excluded: 89 not confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive examination (between February 12, 2020 and February 13, 2020), and 109 with incomplete medical records. Finally, 821 patients were included in this retrospective cohort study and assigned to the development group (n = 411, between January 14, 2020 and February 11, 2020) or validation group (n = 410, between February 14,2020 and March 13, 2020) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Figure 1, http://links.lww.com/CD9/A18]</u>. COVID-19 was defined according to the 6th version of interim guidelines by The National Health Commission of China.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> The study protocol was approved by the Ethic Committees of all 3 hospitals. No informed consent was required for this retrospective cohort analysis.\nAll epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardized data collection form. The raw data were carefully checked by 2 staff members. Any difference in definition was adjudicated by 1 person who was unaware of the study design. Clinical outcomes after discharge from these 3 hospitals were not recorded. Three typical computed tomography (CT) findings (ground glass opacities, consolidation, and bilateral pulmonary infiltration with a reticular pattern or crazy paving pattern) were collected from COVID-19 patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u>\nRoutine blood tests on admission included blood cell counts, cytokines, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), hepatic and renal function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high-sensitivity C reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Repeat measurements were done at 48 and 72 hours (second measurement) after admission and 24 hours before discharge (third measurement).\nAt 3 to 6 hours after admission, routine throat or nose swabs were recommended for all patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs were done for 12 patients in March 2020. The PCR procedure has been described elsewhere.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,11]</u> Briefly, all swabs were delivered to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for testing until January 18, 2020. Since then, our 3 hospitals were able to perform real time-PCR. A PCR re-examination was done every 3 days until to discharge.\nThe discharge criteria for all patients were the absence of a fever for at least 72 hours, substantial improvement in lung CT, significant clinical improvement of symptoms, and negative PCR tests from at least 2 samples taken at least 24 hours apart.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>\nEach of the possible explanatory variables in the developmental group was independently evaluated for its association with in-hospital mortality using bivariate logistic regression. Each statistically significant continuous variable was categorized according to its distribution of centiles (<25% centile, 25%-50% centile, >50%-75% centile, >75%-95% centile, and >95% centile, respectively) by means of exploratory analysis. Then each categorized continuous variable was put into a bivariate regression model to evaluate its association with in-hospital death.\nFinally, all variables (non-continuous and categorized continuous) that were significantly correlated with the mortality during hospitalization were analyzed in a multiple logistic regression model. The resulting coefficients (Wald statistic) of this analysis were used to assign points to variables after rounding off to the nearest integer. Once the CORE-G score was calculated for each patient, it was used in a multiple logistic regression equation designed to convert this score to a probability of in-hospital mortality.\nTo assess CORE-G score performance, formal goodness-of-fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow) tests were performed on both the developmental and validation datasets to evaluate its calibration.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Then the probability interval for mortality was determined. The expected outcomes within each decile of the population were compared with the observed outcomes for each decile. Finally, an H value (compared with the χ2 distribution (df= 8)) to evaluate the overall fit of the model to dataset and the corresponding P value were reported. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve,通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> along with sensitivity, specificity, cutoff scores, and a corresponding P value, were used to evaluate discrimination in both datasets. Based on the cutoff value of CORE-G score, the rate of in-hospital death was compared between low- and high-risk patients.\nCategorical variables are reported as numbers and percentages and were compared using the χ2 test or Fisher exact test.\nContinuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range (Q1, Q3)). The Student’s t test or Wilcoxon rank sum scores for non-normally distributed data were used to compare continuous variables. Time-to-first event (in-hospital death) curves were generated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using log-rank tests. Hospital duration (since admission to discharge or death, Y-axis) was plotted then against the CORE-G scores (X-axis) and the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) function was used to analyze the difference between survivors and deceased patients.\nAll statistical tests were two-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Four risk stratification systems通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16,17]</u> were recently developed, and data confirmed their individual performances in predicting progression from mild to critical illness or death. However, some studies had high risks of bias and model overfitting, and reporting quality varied substantially, such as different study population sizes and only rare calibration of predictions. Therefore, extensive studies must be performed and models should be adjusted as necessary before these systems can provide accurate estimates of the probability of in-hospital mortality.\nThe selection of variables and the points assigned for each was weighted with a logistic regression modeling approach,通用删除6(英):<u>[12,18]</u> which strictly complied with the methodology reported by Le Gall et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> For a given risk model, a goodness-of-fit test and discrimination assessment are critical to evaluate its performance. In the CORE-G scoring system, the H and P values were 3.210 and 0.880, respectively, in the developmental group, which indicated that the model very closely reflected the true mortality. This excellent performance was confirmed in the validation group (H = 6.948, P = 0.542). Furthermore, discrimination of the CORE-G model was evaluated using an ROC curve. Interestingly, the same cutoff score was calculated for the development and validation groups. The area under the ROC curve confirmed good performance of this model for the probability of in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients. A direct comparison between the CORE-G score and other scoring models is required to clarify the advantages of this model.\nRegarding the variables used in our models and previous ones,通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16,17]</u> male sex was included in the CORE-G score. The Chinese health authority has announced that the total number of confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland has reached 77,042, and 2445 people had died of the disease as of February 23, 2020. Among the 2445 deceased patients, most were elderly and two-thirds were male, although detailed data has not been reported.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> While both sexes had the same prevalence of COVID-19 in this study and others,通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10]</u> males are at greater risk for worse outcomes and death, independent of age.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> One study of 425 patients with COVID-19 reported that 56% were males,通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> while another study of 140 patients found that 50.7% were males,通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> similar to our results. We also had more males in the validation group compared to the developmental group, suggesting a trend in sex difference over time during the pandemic. In previous studies, NT-proBNP was not associated with in-hospital mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13,14,15,16,17]</u> This may be due to the fact that NT-proBNP was not routinely measured in most published studies. Inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, were reported to be independent biomarkers of in-hospital death.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,23]</u> A meta-analysis including 3377 patients and 33 laboratory parameters from 21 published studies demonstrated that among hospitalized patients with respiratory distress, WBC count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, IL-6, and serum ferritin were markers for potential progression to critical illness.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>\nAnother striking finding was the ability of the CORE-G score to predict hospital stay duration among survivors and deceased patients. Zhou et al通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> first reported that survivors were discharged from the hospital 3 days later than non-survivors, which was significantly shorter than the 6 and 13 days in the developmental and validation groups from our analysis, respectively. On one hand, the agreement between our results and those published by Zhou et al通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> was that critical patients died earlier after admission. On the other hand, recovery of medical resources and gradual adoption of modified treatments over time may explain the significantly longer hospital duration. There is a lack of specific anti-viral treatments recommended for COVID-19. However, mechanical ventilation was recommended for most deceased patients,通用删除6(英):<u>[8,19]</u> and this rate was particularly higher in the validation group. Nevertheless, the fact that the CORE-G score could enhance the association of scores with hospital duration further supports the strength of this model for predicting in-hospital mortality.\nThe study findings should be considered in the context of several limitations. First, the retrospective design led to 198 patients being excluded from the model, which may have introduced selection bias. Accordingly, further prospective studies with larger sample sizes are warranted. Second, each co-existing cardiovascular disease was individually analyzed in the model, resulting in coronary heart disease being excluded from the scoring system. This may be due to our inclusion of fewer patients with coronary heart disease, as well as diabetes. Third, it is unclear whether uncontrolled hypertension is a risk factor for acquiring COVID-19, or whether controlled blood pressure among hypertensive patients is less of a risk factor.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> However, our model showed an independent effect of hypertension on mortality among COVID-19 patients. Fourth, the CORE-G score may not be applicable to COVID-19 mutant strains, which is now a serious concern in many countries. Fifth, the inclusion of variables such as IL-6 that are rarely collected during the course of routine clinical care greatly limits the usefulness of the CORE-G score. Finally, the goodness-of-fit and discrimination of the CORE-G model for hospital duration were not evaluated. However, reliable LOWESS tests confirmed the strong correlation of CORE-G score with early death among COVID-19 patients.\nThe present study introduced the new CORE-G model for predicting in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients.

Of those patients, 198 patients were excluded: 89 not confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive examination (between February 12, 2020 and February 13, 2020), and 109 with incomplete medical records. Finally, 821 patients were included in this retrospective cohort study and assigned to the development group (n = 411, between January 14, 2020 and February 11, 2020) or validation group (n = 410, between February 14,2020 and March 13, 2020) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Figure 1, http://links.lww.com/CD9/A18]</u>. COVID-19 was defined according to the 6th version of interim guidelines by The National Health Commission of China.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> The study protocol was approved by the Ethic Committees of all 3 hospitals. No informed consent was required for this retrospective cohort analysis.\nAll epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardized data collection form. The raw data were carefully checked by 2 staff members. Any difference in definition was adjudicated by 1 person who was unaware of the study design. Clinical outcomes after discharge from these 3 hospitals were not recorded. Three typical computed tomography (CT) findings (ground glass opacities, consolidation, and bilateral pulmonary infiltration with a reticular pattern or crazy paving pattern) were collected from COVID-19 patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u>\nRoutine blood tests on admission included blood cell counts, cytokines, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), hepatic and renal function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high-sensitivity C reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Repeat measurements were done at 48 and 72 hours (second measurement) after admission and 24 hours before discharge (third measurement).\nAt 3 to 6 hours after admission, routine throat or nose swabs were recommended for all patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs were done for 12 patients in March 2020. The PCR procedure has been described elsewhere.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,11]</u> Briefly, all swabs were delivered to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for testing until January 18, 2020. Since then, our 3 hospitals were able to perform real time-PCR. A PCR re-examination was done every 3 days until to discharge.\nThe discharge criteria for all patients were the absence of a fever for at least 72 hours, substantial improvement in lung CT, significant clinical improvement of symptoms, and negative PCR tests from at least 2 samples taken at least 24 hours apart.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>\nEach of the possible explanatory variables in the developmental group was independently evaluated for its association with in-hospital mortality using bivariate logistic regression. Each statistically significant continuous variable was categorized according to its distribution of centiles (<25% centile, 25%-50% centile, >50%-75% centile, >75%-95% centile, and >95% centile, respectively) by means of exploratory analysis. Then each categorized continuous variable was put into a bivariate regression model to evaluate its association with in-hospital death.\nFinally, all variables (non-continuous and categorized continuous) that were significantly correlated with the mortality during hospitalization were analyzed in a multiple logistic regression model. The resulting coefficients (Wald statistic) of this analysis were used to assign points to variables after rounding off to the nearest integer. Once the CORE-G score was calculated for each patient, it was used in a multiple logistic regression equation designed to convert this score to a probability of in-hospital mortality.\nTo assess CORE-G score performance, formal goodness-of-fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow) tests were performed on both the developmental and validation datasets to evaluate its calibration.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Then the probability interval for mortality was determined. The expected outcomes within each decile of the population were compared with the observed outcomes for each decile. Finally, an H value (compared with the χ2 distribution (df= 8)) to evaluate the overall fit of the model to dataset and the corresponding P value were reported. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve,通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> along with sensitivity, specificity, cutoff scores, and a corresponding P value, were used to evaluate discrimination in both datasets. Based on the cutoff value of CORE-G score, the rate of in-hospital death was compared between low- and high-risk patients.\nCategorical variables are reported as numbers and percentages and were compared using the χ2 test or Fisher exact test.\nContinuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range (Q1, Q3)). The Student’s t test or Wilcoxon rank sum scores for non-normally distributed data were used to compare continuous variables. Time-to-first event (in-hospital death) curves were generated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using log-rank tests. Hospital duration (since admission to discharge or death, Y-axis) was plotted then against the CORE-G scores (X-axis) and the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) function was used to analyze the difference between survivors and deceased patients.\nAll statistical tests were two-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 24.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, New York, USA).\nA total of 81 variables were collected for all patients consisting of 17 demographics, 6 presentations, 3 CT findings 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>, 15 laboratory measurements 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>, 18 treatment variables 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table 1, http://links.lww.com/CD9/A19]</u>, and 22 other unnecessary variables for mortality (eg, time arriving at hospital, data not shown).

Routine blood count tests demonstrated fewer lymphocytes and platelets in the validation group.

The present study developed a new Coronavirus estimation global (CORE-G) score for predicting in-hospital death using a developmental group and evaluated its performance in a validation group.\nWHAT IS NEW?\n<mark>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic, leading to >300,000 deaths.Unfortunately, there is a lack of risk stratification model for predicting in-hospital mortality.</mark>\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic, leading to >300,000 deaths.\nUnfortunately, there is a lack of risk stratification model for predicting in-hospital mortality.\nWHAT ARE THE CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS?\nA risk scoring system, Coronavirus estimation global (CORE-G) score, is built from developmental population and tested in another validation group in this study consisting of 821 COVID-19 patients.The CORE-G score will be helpful in identifying COVID-19 patients at high risk.\nA risk scoring system, Coronavirus estimation global (CORE-G) score, is built from developmental population and tested in another validation group in this study consisting of 821 COVID-19 patients.\nThe CORE-G score will be helpful in identifying COVID-19 patients at high risk.\nBetween January 14, 2020, and March 13, 2020, we screened 1019 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections from 3 hospitals (Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei; Wuhan First Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei; Tianyou Hospital, Wuhan University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, Hubei). Of those patients, 198 patients were excluded: 89 not confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive examination (between February 12, 2020 and February 13, 2020), and 109 with incomplete medical records. Finally, 821 patients were included in this retrospective cohort study and assigned to the development group (n = 411, between January 14, 2020 and February 11, 2020) or validation group (n = 410, between February 14,2020 and March 13, 2020) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Figure 1, http://links.lww.com/CD9/A18]</u>. COVID-19 was defined according to the 6th version of interim guidelines by The National Health Commission of China.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> The study protocol was approved by the Ethic Committees of all 3 hospitals. No informed consent was required for this retrospective cohort analysis.\nAll epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardized data collection form. The raw data were carefully checked by 2 staff members. Any difference in definition was adjudicated by 1 person who was unaware of the study design. Clinical outcomes after discharge from these 3 hospitals were not recorded. Three typical computed tomography (CT) findings (ground glass opacities, consolidation, and bilateral pulmonary infiltration with a reticular pattern or crazy paving pattern) were collected from COVID-19 patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u>\nRoutine blood tests on admission included blood cell counts, cytokines, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), hepatic and renal function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high-sensitivity C reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Repeat measurements were done at 48 and 72 hours (second measurement) after admission and 24 hours before discharge (third measurement).\nAt 3 to 6 hours after admission, routine throat or nose swabs were recommended for all patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs were done for 12 patients in March 2020. The PCR procedure has been described elsewhere.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,11]</u> Briefly, all swabs were delivered to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for testing until January 18, 2020. Since then, our 3 hospitals were able to perform real time-PCR. A PCR re-examination was done every 3 days until to discharge.\nThe discharge criteria for all patients were the absence of a fever for at least 72 hours, substantial improvement in lung CT, significant clinical improvement of symptoms, and negative PCR tests from at least 2 samples taken at least 24 hours apart.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>\nEach of the possible explanatory variables in the developmental group was independently evaluated for its association with in-hospital mortality using bivariate logistic regression. Each statistically significant continuous variable was categorized according to its distribution of centiles (<25% centile, 25%-50% centile, >50%-75% centile, >75%-95% centile, and >95% centile, respectively) by means of exploratory analysis. Then each categorized continuous variable was put into a bivariate regression model to evaluate its association with in-hospital death.\nFinally, all variables (non-continuous and categorized continuous) that were significantly correlated with the mortality during hospitalization were analyzed in a multiple logistic regression model. The resulting coefficients (Wald statistic) of this analysis were used to assign points to variables after rounding off to the nearest integer. Once the CORE-G score was calculated for each patient, it was used in a multiple logistic regression equation designed to convert this score to a probability of in-hospital mortality.\nTo assess CORE-G score performance, formal goodness-of-fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow) tests were performed on both the developmental and validation datasets to evaluate its calibration.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> Then the probability interval for mortality was determined. The expected outcomes within each decile of the population were compared with the observed outcomes for each decile. Finally, an H value (compared with the χ2 distribution (df= 8)) to evaluate the overall fit of the model to dataset and the corresponding P value were reported. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve,通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> along with sensitivity, specificity, cutoff scores, and a corresponding P value, were used to evaluate discrimination in both datasets. Based on the cutoff value of CORE-G score, the rate of in-hospital death was compared between low- and high-risk patients.\nCategorical variables are reported as numbers and percentages and were compared using the χ2 test or Fisher exact test.\nContinuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range (Q1, Q3)). The Student’s t test or Wilcoxon rank sum scores for non-normally distributed data were used to compare continuous variables. Time-to-first event (in-hospital death) curves were generated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using log-rank tests. Hospital duration (since admission to discharge or death, Y-axis) was plotted then against the CORE-G scores (X-axis) and the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) function was used to analyze the difference between survivors and deceased patients.\nAll statistical tests were two-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 24.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, New York, USA).\nA total of 81 variables were collected for all patients consisting of 17 demographics, 6 presentations, 3 CT findings 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>, 15 laboratory measurements 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>, 18 treatment variables 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table 1, http://links.lww.com/CD9/A19]</u>, and 22 other unnecessary variables for mortality (eg, time arriving at hospital, data not shown). As reflected by the aims of this study, 18 treatment variables (including mechanical device and medications) were excluded from the analysis. Finally, 41 remaining variables were included in the analyses 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1 and Table 2]</u>.\nBaseline clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in the developmental and validation groups\n删除重复语句：<u>Baseline clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in the developmental and validation groups</u>\nCOPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CT: Computed tomography; PCI: Percutaneous coronary intervention; SD: Standard deviation.\nLaboratory measurements of patients with COVID-19 in the developmental and validation groups\n删除重复语句：<u>Laboratory measurements of patients with COVID-19 in the developmental and validation groups</u>\nALT: Alanine aminotransferase transaminase; AST: Aspartate transaminase; eGFR: Estimated glomerular filter rate; hs-cTnI: High-sensitivity cardiac troponin; NT-proBNP: N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide; SD: Standard deviation.\nNearly one-third of the patients had hypertension, and most patients presented with fever, had ground glass opacity on CT scans 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>, exhibited a severe inflammatory storm, and frequently had multiple organ dysfunction 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>.\nBaseline clinical characteristics were comparable between the development and validation groups, except for male sex (49.6% vs. 56.0%, P = 0.043), the time interval from symptom onset to admission ((12.5 ± 7.8) days vs. (13.5 ± 9.7) days, P = 0.027), fever (75.7% vs. 88.3%, P < 0.001), dyspnea (20.4% vs. 31.0%, P = 0.001), muscle soreness (12.4% vs. 17.8%, P = 0.032), and CT findings. Routine blood count tests demonstrated fewer lymphocytes and platelets in the validation group. Patients in the validation group had higher plasma concentrations of hs-cTnI (leading to more myocardial injury), NT-proBNP, CRP, and IL-6, but lower values for albumin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and oxygen saturation compared to those in the developmental group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>. These differences may reflect the progression in disease severity.\nTable 3 shows the 18 variables significantly associated with mortality during hospitalization, including 5 demographics, 2 symptoms, and 11 laboratory measurements (including pulmonary consolidation on CT scans).\nCORE-G scores of variables that significantly correlated with in-hospital death\n删除重复语句：<u>CORE-G scores of variables that significantly correlated with in-hospital death</u>\nCORE-G: Coronavirus estimation global; CT: Computed tomography; eGFR: Estimated glomerular filter rate; hs-cTnI: High-sensitivity cardiac troponin; IL: Interleukin; NT-BNP: N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide.\nPoints assigned for each variable varied from 0.7 to 14.0, with highest scores for NT-proBNP >500 pg/mL (14.0 points), followed by oxygen saturation <90% (12.0 points), IL-6 ≥8 pg/mL (9.0 points), and myocardial injury (5.0 points). Among continuous variables significantly related to mortality, white blood cell (WBC) count <4 × 109/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) <41 g/L had a point = 0 in multiple regression analysis and therefore were excluded from the Table 3 and Supplementary Table 2, http://links.lww.com/CD9/A19.\nOnce the CORE-G score was calculated from 411 patients in the developmental group, we converted the CORE-G score to the probability of in-hospital mortality. Patients were then assigned to 10 subgroups according to their mortality probability 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>, and a goodness-of-fit test was performed. The result showed an H value = 3.210, df= 8, and P = 0.880. The ROC curve demonstrated that the cutoff score for mortality was 24.4 points, with a sensitivity of 94.1% and a specificity of 83.4% (P < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.937-0.973) 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. This was used to categorize patients as low risk (CORE-G score <24.4 points) or high risk (≥24.4 points), and a Kaplan-Meier survival curve revealed a significant difference in in-hospital death (1.8% vs. 59.7%, P < 0.001) between the 2 groups 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>.\nGoodness-of-fit test for the CORE-G score in the developmental and validation groups\n删除重复语句：<u>Goodness-of-fit test for the CORE-G score in the developmental and validation groups</u>\nCORE-G: Coronavirus estimation global.\nThe same process was performed in the validation group.

Finally, patients were classified as low risk (CORE-G score <24.4 points) or high risk (≥24.4 points), and a Kaplan-Meier survival curve revealed a significant difference for in-hospital death (4.3% vs. 62.1%, P < 0.001) between the 2 groups 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2B]</u>.\nWhen scores and hospital duration were plotted on the X- and Y-axes, respectively, LOWESS analysis 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u> showed that deceased patients had a shorter hospital duration compared to survivors in the developmental ((11.87 ± 7.00) days vs. (17.31 ± 9.20)) days and validation groups ((10.81 ± 7.48) days vs. (23.65 ± 8.54)) days (both P < 0.001).\nThe present study introduced a new CORE-G score for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. The major findings are: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the mechanisms correlated with the in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients are complex and multifactorial, reflected by 18 variables in this CORE-G score and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the CORE-G score model closely reflects the true mortality experience in the developmental and validation groups.\nMany variables can predict COVID-19 progression and in-hospital mortality,通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,4,5,6,7]</u> including symptoms,通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> older age,通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> comorbidities,通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u> abnormal leukocytes and lymphocytopenia,通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,5,6]</u> and inflammatory cytokine levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Some cases classified as mild on admission can transform to critical illness within a short period.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u> Thus, a practical and effective risk model for identifying the probability of worsening or death is urgently required for COVID-19 patients. Four risk stratification systems通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16,17]</u> were recently developed, and data confirmed their individual performances in predicting progression from mild to critical illness or death. However, some studies had high risks of bias and model overfitting, and reporting quality varied substantially, such as different study population sizes and only rare calibration of predictions. Therefore, extensive studies must be performed and models should be adjusted as necessary before these systems can provide accurate estimates of the probability of in-hospital mortality.\nThe selection of variables and the points assigned for each was weighted with a logistic regression modeling approach,通用删除6(英):<u>[12,18]</u> which strictly complied with the methodology reported by Le Gall et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> For a given risk model, a goodness-of-fit test and discrimination assessment are critical to evaluate its performance. In the CORE-G scoring system, the H and P values were 3.210 and 0.880, respectively, in the developmental group, which indicated that the model very closely reflected the true mortality. This excellent performance was confirmed in the validation group (H = 6.948, P = 0.542). Furthermore, discrimination of the CORE-G model was evaluated using an ROC curve. Interestingly, the same cutoff score was calculated for the development and validation groups. The area under the ROC curve confirmed good performance of this model for the probability of in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients. A direct comparison between the CORE-G score and other scoring models is required to clarify the advantages of this model.\nRegarding the variables used in our models and previous ones,通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15,16,17]</u> male sex was included in the CORE-G score. The Chinese health authority has announced that the total number of confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland has reached 77,042, and 2445 people had died of the disease as of February 23, 2020. Among the 2445 deceased patients, most were elderly and two-thirds were male, although detailed data has not been reported.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> While both sexes had the same prevalence of COVID-19 in this study and others,通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10]</u> males are at greater risk for worse outcomes and death, independent of age.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> One study of 425 patients with COVID-19 reported that 56% were males,通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> while another study of 140 patients found that 50.7% were males,通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> similar to our results. We also had more males in the validation group compared to the developmental group, suggesting a trend in sex difference over time during the pandemic. In previous studies, NT-proBNP was not associated with in-hospital mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13,14,15,16,17]</u> This may be due to the fact that NT-proBNP was not routinely measured in most published studies. Inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, were reported to be independent biomarkers of in-hospital death.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,23]</u> A meta-analysis including 3377 patients and 33 laboratory parameters from 21 published studies demonstrated that among hospitalized patients with respiratory distress, WBC count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, IL-6, and serum ferritin were markers for potential progression to critical illness.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>\nAnother striking finding was the ability of the CORE-G score to predict hospital stay duration among survivors and deceased patients. Zhou et al通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> first reported that survivors were discharged from the hospital 3 days later than non-survivors, which was significantly shorter than the 6 and 13 days in the developmental and validation groups from our analysis, respectively. On one hand, the agreement between our results and those published by Zhou et al通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> was that critical patients died earlier after admission. On the other hand, recovery of medical resources and gradual adoption of modified treatments over time may explain the significantly longer hospital duration. There is a lack of specific anti-viral treatments recommended for COVID-19. However, mechanical ventilation was recommended for most deceased patients,通用删除6(英):<u>[8,19]</u> and this rate was particularly higher in the validation group. Nevertheless, the fact that the CORE-G score could enhance the association of scores with hospital duration further supports the strength of this model for predicting in-hospital mortality.\nThe study findings should be considered in the context of several limitations. First, the retrospective design led to 198 patients being excluded from the model, which may have introduced selection bias. Accordingly, further prospective studies with larger sample sizes are warranted. Second, each co-existing cardiovascular disease was individually analyzed in the model, resulting in coronary heart disease being excluded from the scoring system. This may be due to our inclusion of fewer patients with coronary heart disease, as well as diabetes. Third, it is unclear whether uncontrolled hypertension is a risk factor for acquiring COVID-19, or whether controlled blood pressure among hypertensive patients is less of a risk factor.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> However, our model showed an independent effect of hypertension on mortality among COVID-19 patients. Fourth, the CORE-G score may not be applicable to COVID-19 mutant strains, which is now a serious concern in many countries. Fifth, the inclusion of variables such as IL-6 that are rarely collected during the course of routine clinical care greatly limits the usefulness of the CORE-G score. Finally, the goodness-of-fit and discrimination of the CORE-G model for hospital duration were not evaluated. However, reliable LOWESS tests confirmed the strong correlation of CORE-G score with early death among COVID-19 patients.\nThe present study introduced the new CORE-G model for predicting in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients. Its excellent performance was confirmed in both the developmental and validation groups. This work will serve as the starting point to identify the utility of the CORE-G model in future work.", "index": 2078, "show": true, "start": 2065, "end": 2341, "province": ["语义有效性", "语句/字词重复"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:16:40", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:18:30", "cost": 110.239}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:27", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:18:30", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:16:39"}

The chorda tympani nerve is the sensory branch of the facial nerve and carries taste information and general sensation (e.g. pain and temperature) from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. It supplies efferent vasodilator fibers to the tongue and secretomotor fibers to the salivary glands in the floor of the mouth and parotid gland.\nThe chorda tympani nerve is the largest branch of the facial nerve in the intrapetrous compartment; it splits from the facial nerve just before it exits via the stylomastoid foramen. It arises below the nerve to the stapedius and traverses anterosuperiorly via the posterior canaliculus, usually accompanied by the posterior tympanic branch of the stylomastoid artery. This canaliculus opens into the middle ear cavity through an aperture situated at the junction of the posterior and lateral walls of the tympanic cavity. This opening lies just medial to the fibrocartilaginous annulus, and the posterior canaliculus is roughly 0.5 mm in diameter.\nThe chorda tympani nerve courses through the middle ear and is thus susceptible to damage during ear surgeries, such as stapedectomy通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> and cochlear implantation.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Following chorda tympani nerve damage, taste buds disappear from the denervated side of the tongue通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> and taste loss or distortion can occur. Although the peripherally injured chorda tympani nerve usually regenerates to successfully reinnervate taste buds within several weeks,通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> persistent dysgeusia (i.e. taste alteration) can last for months or years通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> and may indicate alterations in central nervous system (CNS) function.\nLoundon et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> reported that facial and chorda tympani nerve injury occurred in 1 of 434 (0.23%) cochlear implantation surgeries. Of the 1402 cases from Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery of Beijing Friendship Hospital, temporary facial nerve injury was noted in 4 (0.28%) cases, and injury to the posterior wall of the external auditory canal was reported in 14 (0.99%) cases.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Here, we described our experience regarding performing cochlear implantation surgery in 180 patients with a profound sensorineural hearing loss by affixing the facial and chorda tympani nerves to the bony wall to maintain their integrity.\nFrom February 2013 to April 2014, 180 patients (180 ears, 116 males and 64 females) with profound sensorineural hearing loss underwent successful cochlear implantation with no damage to the chorda tympani nerve in Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery of Beijing Friendship Hospital. All the patients in this study provided the written informed consent. The study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Beijing Friendship Hospital (BJFH-EC/2013-075). The age range was from 3 to 21 years, and the average age was 13.8 years. All patients presented with hearing loss, including five patients who previously suffered from common cold and high fever, and three patients with a history of umbilical cord around the neck in the 35th week of gestation who were delivered via cesarean due to placenta previa. None of the patients had residual hearing with type A tympanogram, a stapedius muscle reflex in tympanometry, or otoacoustic emissions. All patients had worn hearing aids for at least 6 months but did not obtain any benefit. Twenty-six patients were implanted with Cochlear CI24R CA implants (COCHLEAR, Australia), and the other 154 patients receiving MED-EL Pulsar implants (MED-EL, Austria). All patients underwent temporal bone computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)scans before surgery.\nRoutine mastoidectomy was performed to expose the eminence of the horizontal semicircular canal and the short crus of the incus. As a marker of the short crus tip of incus, the beginning of the chorda tympani was identified 1 mm behind the tympanomastoid fissure, which was 8 mm away from the short crus sharp of incus. Then, the full length of the chorda tympani was revealed with approximately 1 mm of bony wall below the short crus tip. The vertical part of the facial nerve was revealed in the same step 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>. If the facial recess width was <1 mm at the plane of the round window, the chorda tympani nerve was separated with a 1-mm diameter diamond burr and then suspended 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2a]</u>. Next, the chorda tympani nerve was anteplaced and adhered to the posterior wall of the external auditory canal with medical glue 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2b]</u>. The width of the facial recess was enlarged at the level of the round window 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2c]</u>. Then the facial recess was opened, and the round window niche was exposed. The niche was removed, and the round window membrane was observed. The cochleostomy was drilled in the promontory, anteroinferiorly to the membrane of round window to enter the scala tympani where the electrode was inserted. Small pieces of temporalis muscle were used to seal the cochleostomy port. Finally, neural response telemetry and electrode impedance were assessed.\nThe taste sensation scores were divided into five grades, from 0 to 4, for evaluating the change of four taste sensations (sweet, sour, salty and bitter): 0 means no taste sensation; 1 means only 30% of the taste sensations; 2 means 60% of the taste sensations; 3 means 90% of the taste sensations; and 4 means all four taste sensations are normal. All patients completed taste tests (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) before surgery, 1 day, and 4 weeks to 1 year after cochlear implantation. The scores of the taste sensation were compared pre- and post-operatively.\nThe scores of the taste sensation were shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The paired rank sum test was used to compare the average pre- and post-operative taste sensation scores in 180 cases. A P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).\nIn the 32 patients with narrow facial recesses, the average width at the level of the round window was 0.85 mm. The main reason for the narrow facial recess was chorda tympani nerve retropositioning. The chorda tympani nerve was separated, anteplaced, and adhered to the posterior wall of the external auditory canal with medical glue to maintain its integrity. The facial and chorda tympani nerves were revealed with approximately 1 mm of bony wall below the short crus tip, which allowed the chorda tympani nerve to be kept intact in 148 patients with normal-width facial recesses.\nNone of the 180 patients experienced postoperative complications including injury of the facial or chorda tympani nerve or damage to the posterior wall of the external auditory canal during the 1-year follow-up period.\nThe average pre- and post-operative taste sensation scores in 180 cases was 3.98 ± 0.15 and 3.96 ± 0.19, respectively, without significant difference (P = 0.083).\nHamamoto et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> suggested that the line connecting the CT nerve with the round window passed through the posterior wall of the external auditory canal in 92.3% of individuals, and this characteristic could be useful for preventing CT nerve injury during surgery. But there are a large number of CT nerve variations. In some patients, it may arise from more proximal portion of facial nerve, even close to the geniculate ganglion. The length of the posterior canaliculus is also highly variable, ranging from 3 to 14 mm. In 10% of individuals, there may not be a posterior canaliculus at all in approximately 10% of individuals; rather, it could be replaced by a groove.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> In our study, the facial recesses narrowed for chorda tympani nerve retropositioning in 32 patients.\nTaste is mediated by three cranial nerves: The sensory component of the facial nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, and vagus nerve. The chorda tympani nerve is one of the three cranial nerves involved in transmitting taste fibers from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The mechanism of taste sensation is rather unique in that it involves a complicated feedback loop, with each nerve acting to inhibit signals from other nerves. The chorda tympani nerve exerts a strong inhibitory influence on other taste and pain fibers from the tongue. When the chorda tympani nerve is damaged, its inhibitory function is disrupted, disinhibiting the other taste fibers.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> chorda tympani nerve injury may induce glial responses at primary nerve terminals in the CNS.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Usually, microglial cells respond first, which in turn induce astrocytic responses.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> As the resident immune cells of the CNS, microglia continually surveys the environment with highly mobile processes and quickly detects and responds to disturbances.通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14,15]</u> Damage to the chorda tympani nerve results in central glial responses, which may influence long-lasting taste alterations following chorda tympani nerve lesion.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> This glial activity might also affect nearby trigeminal fibers, which could explain the tingling or burning sensations reported following chorda tympani nerve damage.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>\nMichael and Raut通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> reported that taste disturbance is more likely when the chorda tympani nerve is stretched rather than divided. Division of the chorda tympani nerve seems to have minimal effect on taste perception. Taste sensation from the taste buds is also supplied by the greater petrosal, vagus, and glossopharyngeal nerves, and it has been reported that cutting the chorda tympani nerve may abolish some inhibition of the glossopharyngeal nerve.通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u> Taste disorders after middle ear surgery are mostly transient, even when the chorda tympani nerves are bilaterally sectioned. In contrast, bilateral chorda tympani nerve lesions may lead to severe, persistent, and distressing xerostomia. Based on this neglected aspect of chorda tympani nerve function, Guinand et al.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> emphasized the importance of preserving the chorda tympani nerve whenever possible. In our study, the CT nerve was suspended, anteplaced, and adhered to the posterior wall of the auditory canal to enlarge the facial recess in 32 patients with narrow recesses. The full length of the chorda tympani nerve was revealed with approximately 1 mm of bony wall below the short crus tip, which allowed us to keep the chorda tympani nerve intact in 148 patients with normal-width facial recesses. No change in taste sensation was identified compared with preoperative evaluation results.\nIn conclusion, our identification method successfully preserved chorda tympani nerve structure and function and did not lead to taste loss during cochlear implantation surgery. The chorda tympani nerve may be a useful marker for positioning the facial nerve and keeping the posterior wall of the external auditory canal intact.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 09:55:42", "endTime": "2024/10/09 09:58:53", "cost": 191.309}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:27", "update_time": "2024-10-08 17:58:52", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 17:55:40"}

In 2021, most TB cases occurred in the 30 high-burden countries (87%), in which 8 countries account for two-thirds, with China (7.4%) ranking after India (28%) and Indonesia (9.2%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. China is also on the three lists of high-burden countries for TB, HIV-associated TB, and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) of the World Health Organization (WHO). Despite the difficulties that remain, such as the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and the coinfection of TB with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the global incidence of tuberculosis is estimated to slowly decline by 1.6% per year, far from the 4–5% estimated to be required to reach the objectives of the WHO’s End TB Strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a large global drop in people newly diagnosed with TB and reported in 2020, compared to 2019通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\nIn China 2021, the number of reported TB cases is ranked second highest after viral hepatitis, and in terms of death is the second highest after AIDS 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. There are about 250 million students in China (about 20% of the population). The reported TB cases in students account for about 4–6% of the total reported TB cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. TB cases in the 15–24-year age group accounted for about 85% of the total reported TB cases in students, which means the number of TB cases in high school and college students is higher, especially in the 18-year-old age group 通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7,8]</u>. When MTB spreads in schools, it can be transmitted rapidly and have a major impact on young people simply because of cluster. Therefore, it is one of the reasons why school TB outbreaks have been reported frequently in China, despite the steady global decline of the TB incidence trend 通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,11,12,13]</u>. Moreover, MDR-TB outbreaks have also been reported in schools, making TB control in schools much more difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15]</u>.\nTheoretical epidemiology, also known as the mathematical model of epidemiology, uses mathematical formulas to express the law of disease prevalence explicitly and quantitatively between cause, host and environment, and to theoretically explore the effects of different control measures. Mathematical modelling has become a powerful tool for analysing epidemiological characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>, which is used to reveal the characteristics of the internal spread of infectious diseases. Transmission dynamic models are commonly used in infectious disease models, including Susceptible-infectious-recovered model, Susceptible-exposed-symptomatic-recovered (SEIR) model, and Autoregressive integrated moving average model. Some studies use models to analyse TB, such as TB intervention assessments 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>, analysis of vaccine control effectiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u>, and TB treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21,22,23]</u>. Different models have been developed to treat latent TB infections (LTBI) that incorporate certain factors such as drug-resistant strains 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>, coinfection with HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>, and TB reinfection 通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>, and to study the epidemiology of TB 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>. Specific targeted sub-populations have been defined, including age-specific subgroups 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>, adults and children 通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>, and smokers and non-smokers 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>. However, only a few studies have used occupational mathematical models to study TB transmission in China. The construction of TB models which are used to explore the dynamics of TB transmission between students and non-students is unclear.\nThe prevention and control of TB in schools has been improved with the efforts of medical personnel staff at all levels. In the past 10 years, control measures have been continuously strengthened and improved, but the transmission characteristics of TB in schools are still unclear. The aim of this study is to establish a mathematical model of TB between students and non-students, to analyse and explore the transmissibility of MTB in schools, and then to take reasonable and effective measures to control TB in schools.\nIn this study, based on the reported and observed morbidity characteristics, we developed a SEIR model with two occupational groups (students and non-students). We investigated the role of occupation in the transmission process and evaluated feasible control strategies to achieve the objectives outlined in the WHO End TB Strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Furthermore, this study classified active TB patients into high or low transmissibility groups according to their pathogenic status 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>.\nFirstly, in this study, a dataset was constructed, including basic information (sex, age, occupation, and location) and case classification (positive and negative cases of pathogen). Demographic data was obtained from the Chinese Statistical Yearbook 通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33,34,35]</u>, including the total population, the total student population, birth rate, and the death rate for each city 通用删除1(英):<u></u>.\nSecondly, two mathematical models (Models A and B refer to non-seasonal and seasonal models, respectively) were constructed to simulate the reported TB cases of the four regions in China, based on the natural history and seasonality of TB. In each model, we divided the collected data into four subpopulations of active diseases in two dimensions. The first dimension for all calculations and outputs was the occupation of students (1 subscript) or non-students (2 subscript), while the second dimension was the pathogenic status, including pathogen positive (p subscript) and pathogen negative (n subscript) pulmonary disease. In addition, goodness-of-fit was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of model fitting.\nFinally, we simulated the sub-population-to-sub-population transmission process, to determine the combination with the most distinctive impact, via calculating effective reproduction number (Reff) and performing knock-out analysis. This enabled the formulation of effective and targeted control measures for TB transmission in China, in accordance with occupation-specific prevention and control .\nWe collected year-based TB incidence data from the China Public Health Science Data Center 删除6：<u></u> from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017 for each province in China (not included Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>. After we calculated the average annual incidence rate and plotted the incidence map , we found an inequality in the disease burden.\nConsidering the geographic position, the TB incidences in four regions (located in the north, south, southwest, and middle of China) are average incidences compared to those of the other regions in China, which is consistent with the population distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>, which means that the selection can better reflect the TB epidemiological characteristics in geographical differences.\nThis study collected data on reported TB cases, populations, and areas in four regions [Jilin Province, Wuhan City in Hubei Province, Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture (Chuxiong Prefecture) in Yunnan Province, and Xiamen City in Fujian Province] 通用删除1(英):<u></u>, which are from the Health Commission of each region, the Statistics Bureau of each region and data mentioned in some researches 通用删除6(英):<u>[38,39]</u>, etc. Therefore, the TB results from these four regional analyses are effectively representative of TB epidemiological characteristics in China.\nReported TB cases included in this study consisted of laboratory confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and clinical diagnostic PTB. Since the Chinese government implemented the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) for infectious diseases in 2004, the diagnostic criteria for TB has changed several times ( \"WS288–2008 Diagnosis of tuberculosis\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> with the adjusted notice in 2017 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>, and the \"WS 288–2017 Diagnosis of Tuberculosis\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> and the \"WS 196–2017 Classification of Tuberculosis\" standards 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>, with the adjusted notice in 2018 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>). All TB cases were classified on the base of the following criteria. The confirmed PTB cases were denoted as people with possible PTB symptoms, such as a continuous cough for more than 2 weeks, hemoptysis, and night sweat, and confirmed by a sputum smear and/or a sputum culture with the result of detectable acid-fast bacilli or positive result from a rapid molecular diagnostic instrument (e.g. GeneXpert). The clinical diagnosis of PTB was defined as people with obviously abnormal chest radiography along with no curative effect from anti-inflammatory treatment under the circumstance of negative results from laboratory tests or absence of related results 通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45,46]</u>.\nThe PTB cases are classified as follows, based on pathogenic findings: sputum smear positive, sputum smear negative, sputum culture positive, sputum culture negative, molecular biology positive, and without sputum PTB 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>. In the latest notice published in 2018, the classification of TB cases, which must be reported in the NNDSS, was adjusted to \"pathogen positive (including sputum smear positive and only sputum culture positive PTB)\" , \"pathogen negative (including sputum smear negative PTB)\" , \"rifampicin resistant\" , \"no pathogenic findings (including without sputum PTB and tuberculous pleurisy\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. We have reclassified all historical data according to the new classification notice for consistency .\nThe diagnosis of PTB is based on a pathogenic examination (including bacteriology and molecular biology), combined with epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, chest imaging, relevant auxiliary examinations, differential diagnosis, and other comprehensive analyses 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>. Pathogenic and pathological results were used as the basis for diagnosis. Therefore, the following inclusion criteria were TB cases with pathogen positive [ \"positive cases with MTB detected by sputum smear, culture-confirmed or molecular biology (nucleic acid of MTB)\" ] and negative [ \"TB cases without MTB detected (including patients with negative sputum smear and without sputum)\" ]. The rifampicin resistance category was officially reported in 2019 and represented a small percentage (< 5%) of the total data collected. Therefore, to maintain the consistency of the overall data, we excluded these data from the analysis.\nBased on the model, the total population (N) was divided into the following five compartments: susceptible population (S), exposed population (or low-risk latent tuberculosis infection, LTBI) (E), pathogen positive tuberculosis population (Ip), pathogen negative tuberculosis population (In), and recovered or removed population (R).\nSusceptible population (S): people who have not been exposed to MTB or those who experienced self-clearance by their own immune system. The latter is a state in which the bacteria in the body cannot replicate to the extent that self-clearance occurs due to the strong immunity of the body after exposure, a state in which the body has a sustained immune response to MTB antigen stimulation.Exposed population (or low-risk LTBI) (E): A susceptible population is exposed to MTB through contact with a highly infectious or less infectious population and is in an MTB carrier state but is temporarily noninfectious.Pathogen positive TB population (Ip): positive cases with MTB detected by sputum smear, culture-confirmed, or molecular biology (nucleic acid of MTB).Pathogen negative TB population (In): TB cases without MTB detected (including patients with negative sputum smear and no sputum), with low infectiousness.Recovered or removed population (R): This is a state of cure or recovery, noninfectious and asymptomatic, referring to the population undergoing successful treatment, including the treatment success for the \"pathogen negative\" population and the \"pathogen positive\" population (both the cured and the treatment success population).\nSusceptible population (S): people who have not been exposed to MTB or those who experienced self-clearance by their own immune system. The latter is a state in which the bacteria in the body cannot replicate to the extent that self-clearance occurs due to the strong immunity of the body after exposure, a state in which the body has a sustained immune response to MTB antigen stimulation.\nExposed population (or low-risk LTBI) (E): A susceptible population is exposed to MTB through contact with a highly infectious or less infectious population and is in an MTB carrier state but is temporarily noninfectious.\nPathogen positive TB population (Ip): positive cases with MTB detected by sputum smear, culture-confirmed, or molecular biology (nucleic acid of MTB).\nPathogen negative TB population (In): TB cases without MTB detected (including patients with negative sputum smear and no sputum), with low infectiousness.\nRecovered or removed population (R): This is a state of cure or recovery, noninfectious and asymptomatic, referring to the population undergoing successful treatment, including the treatment success for the \"pathogen negative\" population and the \"pathogen positive\" population (both the cured and the treatment success population).\nBased on the natural history of TB, we developed a mathematical model Susceptible-exposed-symptomatic (pathogen positive)-symptomatic (pathogen negative)-recovered (SEIpInR) model to investigate the transmission process of TB. The proposed SEIpInR model is based on the following facts and assumptions:\nBirths and natural deaths change the total population (N); the birth rate and the death rate are br and dr, respectively. The entire birth population enters group 2(the non-student group).This population is generally susceptible to MTB infection. When an infected individual is exposed, the exposed population (E) progresses to the active TB-infected population (I) at a rate of β. Since the transmissibility of the pathogen positive TB population (Ip) is higher than the pathogen negative TB population (In), the transmissibility of In is set to be a к times (к < 1) compared to Ip.Approximately 5–10% of the exposed population (E) infected with MTB will develop symptoms and become Ip or In; both belong to the active TB-infected population and will receive treatment. Most exposed people do not develop symptoms, but undergo a process of self-clearance and become a susceptible population (S). If E progresses to Ip at a rate of ω1 (incubation period coefficient) with a scale factor of q, and E progresses to In at a rate of ω2 (latent period coefficient) with a scale factor of (1-q). The progression from E to S occurs at a rate of θ (early self-clearance rate) on a scale factor of m. At time t, the progression from E to Ip, from E to In and from E to S is proportional to the number of exposed populations, which is qω1E, (1-q)ω2E, and mθE, respectively.Studies have shown that the proportion of patients with TB cured by the directly observed treatment and short course chemotherapy (DOTS) who require retreatment in the next 1–2 years is 2 to 7% 通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49]</u>. Patients who are retreated can be broadly divided into two categories: those who were not successfully cured following treatment, and those who relapsed after being cured.There were two outcomes for the Ip compartment: First, a certain proportion of treatment success individuals (1-λ) transform into a recovered or removed population (R), while another proportion of treatment failure individuals (λ) transform into an exposed population (E). At time t, the rate of development from Ip to R, which is proportional to the Ip population, is given as (1-λ)γ1Ip, while the rate of development from Ip to E, which is proportional to the E population, is given as λμ1Ip. γ1 is the removal coefficient, whereas μ1 is the coefficient of development from Ip to E. Similarly, the rate of development to R in the In compartment is given as (1-λ)γ2In, while the rate of development to E is given as λμ2In. γ2 is the removal coefficient and μ2 is the coefficient of development of In to E.The people in the Ip and In compartments recover or are removed (R) after successful treatment (completion of treatment for In and Ip 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>). Reinfection occurs after the completion of treatment or cured, that is, the active TB-infected population (Ip, In) returns to the exposed population (E).Reactivation (or relapse) is often associated with immunodeficiency, such as the onset of disease due to HIV/TB coinfection or low resistance, such as severe cold. If people in the R compartment develop into E with a relapse ratio a where τ represents the relapse coefficient, the rate of development from R to E at time t is proportional to R, which is aτR.The pathogen positive TB population (Ip) and the pathogen negative TB population (In) die of disease, in addition to natural deaths. Suppose the fatality rates for Ip were f1 and that for In were f2; then, at time t, the death rates for Ip and In are f1Ip and f2In, respectively.The student population was set as S1, E1, Ip1, In1, and R1, whereas the non-student population was set as S2, E2, Ip2, In2, and R2. Interactions were observed between students and non-students. We defined the relative transmission rate of student-to-student as β11, non-student-to-non-student as β22, student-to-non-student as β12, and non-student-to-student as β21. Therefore, the number of newly emerging infections was β11S1(Ip1 + кIn1) from the student-to-student population, β22S2(Ip2 + кIn2) from the non-student-to-non-student population, β12S2(Ip1 + кIn1) from the student-to-non-student population, and β21S1(Ip2 + кIn2) from the non-student-to-student population.\nBirths and natural deaths change the total population (N); the birth rate and the death rate are br and dr, respectively. The entire birth population enters group 2(the non-student group).\nThis population is generally susceptible to MTB infection. When an infected individual is exposed, the exposed population (E) progresses to the active TB-infected population (I) at a rate of β. Since the transmissibility of the pathogen positive TB population (Ip) is higher than the pathogen negative TB population (In), the transmissibility of In is set to be a к times (к < 1) compared to Ip.\nApproximately 5–10% of the exposed population (E) infected with MTB will develop symptoms and become Ip or In; both belong to the active TB-infected population and will receive treatment. Most exposed people do not develop symptoms, but undergo a process of self-clearance and become a susceptible population (S). If E progresses to Ip at a rate of ω1 (incubation period coefficient) with a scale factor of q, and E progresses to In at a rate of ω2 (latent period coefficient) with a scale factor of (1-q). The progression from E to S occurs at a rate of θ (early self-clearance rate) on a scale factor of m. At time t, the progression from E to Ip, from E to In and from E to S is proportional to the number of exposed populations, which is qω1E, (1-q)ω2E, and mθE, respectively.\nStudies have shown that the proportion of patients with TB cured by the directly observed treatment and short course chemotherapy (DOTS) who require retreatment in the next 1–2 years is 2 to 7% 通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49]</u>. Patients who are retreated can be broadly divided into two categories: those who were not successfully cured following treatment, and those who relapsed after being cured.\nThere were two outcomes for the Ip compartment: First, a certain proportion of treatment success individuals (1-λ) transform into a recovered or removed population (R), while another proportion of treatment failure individuals (λ) transform into an exposed population (E). At time t, the rate of development from Ip to R, which is proportional to the Ip population, is given as (1-λ)γ1Ip, while the rate of development from Ip to E, which is proportional to the E population, is given as λμ1Ip. γ1 is the removal coefficient, whereas μ1 is the coefficient of development from Ip to E. Similarly, the rate of development to R in the In compartment is given as (1-λ)γ2In, while the rate of development to E is given as λμ2In. γ2 is the removal coefficient and μ2 is the coefficient of development of In to E.\nThe people in the Ip and In compartments recover or are removed (R) after successful treatment (completion of treatment for In and Ip 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>). Reinfection occurs after the completion of treatment or cured, that is, the active TB-infected population (Ip, In) returns to the exposed population (E).\nReactivation (or relapse) is often associated with immunodeficiency, such as the onset of disease due to HIV/TB coinfection or low resistance, such as severe cold. If people in the R compartment develop into E with a relapse ratio a where τ represents the relapse coefficient, the rate of development from R to E at time t is proportional to R, which is aτR.\nThe pathogen positive TB population (Ip) and the pathogen negative TB population (In) die of disease, in addition to natural deaths. Suppose the fatality rates for Ip were f1 and that for In were f2; then, at time t, the death rates for Ip and In are f1Ip and f2In, respectively.\nThe student population was set as S1, E1, Ip1, In1, and R1, whereas the non-student population was set as S2, E2, Ip2, In2, and R2. Interactions were observed between students and non-students. We defined the relative transmission rate of student-to-student as β11, non-student-to-non-student as β22, student-to-non-student as β12, and non-student-to-student as β21. Therefore, the number of newly emerging infections was β11S1(Ip1 + кIn1) from the student-to-student population, β22S2(Ip2 + кIn2) from the non-student-to-non-student population, β12S2(Ip1 + кIn1) from the student-to-non-student population, and β21S1(Ip2 + кIn2) from the non-student-to-student population.\nA framework diagram of the SEIpInR model is shown in Fig. 3. The mathematical expression of the differential equation of the SEIpInR model are as follows:\nFourteen parameters were obtained from references or actual data in this model: birth rate (br), death rate (dr), transmission relative rate (β), proportion of early clearance (m), rate of early clearance (θ), transmission relative rate between pathogen negative and positive TB population (к), proportion of exposed to TB population (q), rate of exposed to TB population (ω), proportion of treatment failure (λ), rate from TB population to exposed population (μ), TB population removal coefficient (γ), Case fatality rate of TB population (f), recurrence ratio-proportion of recovered or removed population developing into exposed population (a), and reciprocal of time to recurrence rate at which recovered or removed population progresses to exposed population (τ).\nParameter β was derived from the curve-fitting results. Some parameters (br, dr, and q) were obtained from actual data, while other parameters were obtained from the literature. The description of each variable and parameter in this model is detailed in Table 1.\nThe description and features of estimated parameters\n删除重复语句：<u>The description and features of estimated parameters</u>\nE for the exposed population (or low-risk latent tuberculosis infection, LTBI), Ip for pathogen positive tuberculosis population, In for pathogen negative tuberculosis population, I1 for student tuberculosis population, I2 for non-student tuberculosis population, and R for recovered or removed population\nEarly self-clearance (early clear) was defined as a persistent negative interferon-gamma release test (IGRA) (patients with pathogenically positive TB were tested at baseline and after 14 weeks). Studies in Indonesia have shown that early self-clearance is 25% 通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u>. The time to self-clearance was set at 14 weeks, which is the interval between the two IGRA tests; thus θ = 1/ (14/4) = 0.286.Treatment failure: The WHO 2021 TB report 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> showed the treatment success rate was 95.9% in 2019 and 95.7% in 2020. Previous reports revealed that this value did not change much between 2000 and 2020. Therefore, we considered the treatment success rate as 95% and set the treatment failure rate (λ) to 5%, that is λ = 0.050. The conventional treatment course was 6 months. Therefore, the time to complete the treatment was set as 6 months, that is, μ1 = μ2 = 1/6 = 0.167 通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>.Relapse: Studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[53,54,55]</u> in China showed the relapse rate was 5.3–6.9%. Therefore, the median was chosen and the relapse proportion was set at a = 0.062 (recurrence ratio). A domestic study 通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> showed that the median time from the first attack to relapse in TB patients was 1.3 years [interquartile range (IQR) 0.6–2.8 years]. Therefore, the relapse rate was established at 1/(1.3*12), i.e. τ = 0.064 (reciprocal of time to recurrence).The transmissibility coefficient of In relative to Ip was set as κ to 0.2 通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u> with reference to the actual data and the relevant literature.After approximately two weeks of effective treatment, TB cases with a nondrug-resistant active infection usually do not remain infectious to others and become low in infection status 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>. Short-course (3-to 4-month) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over longer-course (6 to 9 months) isoniazid monotherapy for the treatment of low-infection cases of TB 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Therefore, we set the duration of the illness at 14 weeks (average value 3–4 month), γ1 = γ2 = 1/(14/4) = 0.286.The birth rate (br) and the death rate (dr) for each year in each region were obtained from the statistical offices of each study area.\nEarly self-clearance (early clear) was defined as a persistent negative interferon-gamma release test (IGRA) (patients with pathogenically positive TB were tested at baseline and after 14 weeks).

R0 refers to the number of new cases expected from an infected case in a susceptible population during an average infectious period. We set Reff as the evaluation index, which denotes R0 after intervention measures were taken, to evaluate the impact of intervention measures on the relative transmissibility of MTB in the population.\nIn this study, Reff was calculated using the next-generation matrix method, and all source codes are accessible at GitHub 删除6：<u></u>. In this study, Reff1 represents the transmissibility of the population of students with active TB [sum of transmissibility from student cases to student cases (Reff11) and from student cases to non-student cases (Reff12)], while Reff2 represents the transmissibility of the population of non-student active TB cases [sum of transmissibility from non-student cases to non-student cases (Reff22) and from non-student cases to student cases (Reff21)].\nBerkeley Madonna 8.3.18 (developed by Robert Macey and George Oster of the University of California in Berkeley. Copyright ©1993–2001 Robert I. Macey & George F. Oster) was used to fit the curves of the incidence data. The estimated model coefficients and the simulation of the intervention effects were also generated using this software. The curving fit was performed using the fourth order Runge–Kutta method to obtain the key parameter values: student-to-student (β11), non-student-to-non-student (β22), student-to-non-student (β12), and non-student-to-student (β21) transmission rates.\nTo consider the potential seasonality transmission of TB, although seasonality remains unclear, we developed two models in this study, which are described as follows:\nModel A: seasonality excluded.\nIn Model A, the epidemic curve for each year was divided into ascending and descending periods according to the characteristics of the reported number of TB cases . The SEIpInR model without seasonality was adopted to fit the data in each period, and the corresponding transmission relative rates (β, β11, β12, β22, and β21), the ascending and descending Reff (Reff(asc) and Reff(des), respectively) were calculated.\nModel B: seasonality included.\nIn Model B, we used a seasonality function in the SEIp-InR model to fit the reported TB epidemic curve , which is shown as follows:\nIn this equation, βt, β0, c, and T refer to the transmission rate at time t, the transmission rate at time = 0, the correcting value of time (month) and the potential seasonality cycle, respectively.\nThe goodness-of-fit test was performed between the fitted results and the collected data by calculating the R2 and P values. Key parameters (β11, β12, β22, β21) were knocked out, and the cumulative number of cases was calculated to assess the main parameter affecting transmissibility. SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Ill, USA) was used to perform statistical analyses. The coefficient of determination (R2) was used to evaluate the curve fitness.\nThe age range of the TB patients was between 15 and 90 years, with two peaks in the incidence of TB: a large and a small peak in the age groups 35–90 and 15–35, respectively. In Wuhan City, Jilin Province and Chuxiong Prefecture, there were two age distribution peaks of non-student TB patients (15–35 and 45–60 years group), while in Xiamen City, there was only one peak (15–35 years group). Student patients with TB were among 15–25 year group . Most patients with TB in the four regions were male, with a male-to-female ratio of 7∶3 . The Chinese Infectious Disease Report Card categorises cases into 18 categories, and the top six occupations (88.4% of the total cases) in the four regions were: farmers, housework and unemployment, others, workers, students, and retirees. Among these four regions, the top three occupations of TB patients in Wuhan were domestic and unemployed (23.2%), farmers (22.2%), and retirees (12.1%). The top three occupations of TB patients were farmers (50.3%), domestic and unemployed (18.6%), and others (8.0%) in Jilin Province; workers (22.5%), farmers (15.3%), and others (10.6%) in Xiamen; farmers (87.2%), retirees (4.5%), and students (2.2%) in Chuxiong Prefecture . The ranking of students with TB was sixth, sixth, eighth and third in Wuhan, Jilin, Xiamen, and Chuxiong Prefecture, respectively.\nThe number of reported TB cases in Wuhan City and Jilin Province showed a decreasing annual trend, while the number of reported TB cases in Xiamen City and Chuxiong Prefecture showed a slight fluctuation trend . The incidence in the student population was distinctly low during the winter holidays (January–February, approximately 30 days) and summer vacation (July–August, approximately 60 days), with one or two distinct peaks after returning to school (the remaining months of the year). There were slight differences between regions in the time of occurrence of these peaks: Wuhan (March and September–October), Xiamen (March and October), Jilin (April and September), and Chuxiong (April and October). However, for the non-student population, there were no clear lows or peaks.\nMost cases had either positive or negative pathogen results (87.3%), and the ratio was 1∶1.13. The proportion of cases without pathogenic findings was 12.6%; rifampicin resistant results accounted for 0.1%. The number of pathogen positive and negative cases was essentially the same in Jilin Province, while the other three regions reported more pathogen negative cases than positive. The proportion of patients without pathogenic findings was the lowest in Xiamen City and the highest in Chuxiong Prefecture. Very few cases of resistance to rifampicin were reported in any region .\nWe conducted goodness-of-fit tests for the two models based on the case datasets from the four regions (Wuhan City, Jilin Province, Chuxiong Prefecture, and Xiamen City) . R2 values were calculated for the four model groups (pathogen positive cases in the student group, Ip1; pathogen negative cases in the student group, In1; pathogen positive cases in the non-student group, Ip2; and pathogen negative cases in the non-student group, In2). The values showed that, although the two established TB models fitted well with the trend of TB incidence rates , Model A had better fitting results than Model B.\nGoodness-of-fit test results of the two models (Models A and B) in the study areas\n删除重复语句：<u>Goodness-of-fit test results of the two models (Models A and B) in the study areas</u>\nCorrelation between the simulated and observed data was tested using R2 and p values. We divided all the compartments representing active diseases (I) into four occupational compartments: pathogen positive students (Ip1 subscript), pathogen positive non-students (Ip2 subscript), pathogen negative students (In1 subscript) and pathogen negative non-students (In2 subscript)\nThe results of Reff among and between the different populations in each region are shown in Fig. 9.\nIn Wuhan City, the median Reff for TB among the mixed population was 1.79 (IQR: 1.56–2.02). Most TB transmissions occurred due to the high transmission in non-student populations, including among non-student populations [median Reff22 was 1.57 (IQR: 1.41–1.72)] and non-student-to-student populations [median Reff21 was 0.14 (IQR: 0.11–0.15)], with a median Reff2 of 1.71(IQR: 1.54–1.87). The values of Reff22 and Reff21 slowly descended from 2005 to 2018.

However, the model revealed exceedingly high values of Reff over many years in the four regions, which indicates that the findings of Model B may be unsuitable to show the characteristics of TB. Additional details of the results are provided in 通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 3: Tables S3, Additional file 4: Table S4, Additional file 5: Table S5, Additional file 6: Table S6.</u>\nAccording to the knock-out results , the number of TB cases among students was significantly reduced by more than half (60–70%) when the transmissibility of non-student-to-student populations (β21) was knocked out. When TB transmission among non-students (β22) was blocked, the number of TB cases was reduced by approximately 67% (65–70%) among non-students and by approximately 28% (25–30%) among students. There was only a 5% reduction (2–12%) among students when TB transmission among students (β11) was blocked, and TB reported cases had barely changed (less than 1%) while TB transmission from non-student-to-students (β12) was blocked.\nThis study is the first to address the occupational-specific transmission dynamics of TB and emphasise the importance of control between student groups, which can increase our understanding of the characteristics of TB transmission in different occupational groups.\nThe incidence rate of TB decreased in the study regions, which is in good agreement with previous global reports 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>, but was unevenly distributed between these four regions. This phenomenon may be attributed to several reasons. First, the inclusion of previously untreated patients in the management after several years of continuous active screening led to a certain decline in the number of subsequent patient detection cases. Second, since 2017, a nationwide survey of underreporting and under-registration of TB 通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u> and a diagnostic review 通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> were carried out, which improved the quality of TB reporting and diagnosis in each region. However, the reported incidence rate of TB is still higher in areas less economically developed than in the west, such as Chuxiong Prefecture, although the attention and support of governments and health administrations, as well as the support for precise health poverty alleviation have been undertaken at all levels 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\nRemarkably, the reported incidence of TB in the student population has increased. The reported data also confirmed that the proportion of student patients has increased from 4.0% in 2015 to 6.2% in 2019, with a difference of 2.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. This is mainly due to the fact that early warning of individual cases of TB in schools has been included in the National Automatic Early Warning System for Infectious Diseases since July 2018 通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u>. Furthermore, disease control agencies at all levels have strengthened the information verification process of school-age patients and improved the sensitivity of the surveillance of student patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u>. Schools have also strengthened medical examinations and handled clusters of TB outbreaks 通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u>. Our results highlight an obvious incidence peak among students at the beginning of the semester. There are several explanations for this observation. Students are in close contact with social residents and are exposed to TB patients in the community during holidays. Considering LTBI 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,63]</u>, students infected with MTB on vacation do not become ill immediately, but become ill after returning to school when they are exposed to several inducements, including high pressure and cold, among others. Farmers always had the highest reported incidence rates. However, this is not surprising if we consider that the rural population represents most of the total population of China, and the allocation of medical and health resources in rural areas is inadequate, resulting in unequal access to medical resources for urban and rural residents 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Furthermore, it may be related to the lower level of education of farmers, poorer living conditions, and lack of awareness of health protection 通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u>.\nThe diagnosis results in the study areas, which had a low pathogen positive rate of less than 50%. A previous report showed the pathogen positive rate for PTB reported in China in 2020 was 57%, up from 45.03% in 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. However, a gap still exists when this is compared with surveillance results based on laboratory pathogenic diagnostic evidence in other countries worldwide. Both the TB laboratory diagnostic and the TB imaging detection capacity need to be improved in primary care institutions in China, which is consistent with the outcomes of one diagnostic and therapeutic survey on TB sentinel medical institutions 通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> and on the current status of TB diagnostic capacity at county-level TB sentinel medical institutions in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u>. To achieve the goal of \"reaching a pathogenic positivity rate of more than 50% by 2022\" as required by the Action Plan to Stop TB 通用删除7(英):<u>(2019–2022)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u>, it is still necessary to continue to strengthen the quality of laboratory work 通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u>.\nIn this study, two mathematical models of TB were constructed according to the transmission characteristics of TB: Models A and B. Although there may be seasonal fluctuations in the actual incidence of TB in some areas, Model A fitted better than Model B. Therefore, we believe that the analysis results of Model A can better reflect the real situation of TB incidence.\nTherefore, the following interpretations were made according to the results of the Reff calculation of Model A and results of a knock-out analysis:\nA) Overall, the average values of Reff in the four regions showed that a single TB case could effectively spread to one or two people. TB transmissibility among non-students (Reff2) was 23.30 times (IQR: 1.94–7.24) higher than among students (Reff1). TB transmission remained dominant in the non-student population. This finding also existed in the knock-out analysis. Transmission among non-students increased the number of reported TB cases in all four groups (67% in non-students and 28% in students). The non-student population was large, and included 17 occupations, different locations with active cases, and a wide range of age groups. In high-burden areas, such as China, most TB transmission occurs outside the home (< 20% of household transmission) which is not necessarily attributable to known close contacts 通用删除6(英):<u>[69,70]</u>. The probability of TB transmission to others by a TB patient is determined by many factors, including socioeconomic, environmental, high or low regional disease burden, infectiousness of the case, MTB strain, and host susceptibility. Determining the specific site of TB transmission outside the home is difficult. The potential for airborne transmission even during brief contact, combined with variable incubation periods, makes it exceptionally difficult to establish a specific TB transmission link. Despite these challenges, certain specific settings have been identified as important contributors to TB risk, such as nasal transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>[71,72,73,74]</u>, hospital-associated transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u>, homeless shelters 通用删除6(英):<u>[76]</u>, prisons 通用删除6(英):<u>[77,78]</u>, public transportation 通用删除6(英):<u>[79]</u>, churches 通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u>, schools 通用删除6(英):<u>[69,81]</u> and slums 通用删除6(英):<u>[82,83,84]</u>. This is precisely because the places where students study and live are close, providing good conditions for the spread of TB; therefore, the implementation of TB control policies in schools is especially important. The presence of these factors has contributed to the high rates of acquired TB in this group over the years.\nFurthermore, the concentration of TB transmission in certain settings and subpopulations also leads to heterogeneity of transmission, which can serve to increase Reff and may make it more difficult to control transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>[85]</u>. Moreover, adults in their most active age groups are more likely to be infected with TB due to their close contact with each other 通用删除6(英):<u>[86]</u>. To explain why transmission among the non-student populations increased the number of infected patients among non-students, it may be assumed that household and unnoticed transmissions in the community contribute simultaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>[87]</u>.\nB) The results from knock-out analysis indicated that non-student-to-student transmission increased the number of reported TB cases in the student group (either pathogen positive or negative), and transmission among non-students increased the number of reported TB cases in all the four groups. There may be several reasons for this. First, the home–school transmission route may be one of the reasons. TB is actively transmitted by household exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>[88]</u>, and a prospective case–control study found that previous exposure to TB in a household could cause an infected student to spread TB to their classmates 通用删除6(英):<u>[89]</u>. Second, we believe that the school community transmission route is important due to increased exposure to other occupations during vacations.\nC) Although TB transmission is spread mainly by non-students, the transmissibility of student-to-non-students in some years and in some regions, is particularly high, such as the Reff12 of Chuxiong Prefecture in 2016 (Reff12: 0.13), 2017 (Reff12: 0.16), and that of Wuhan City in 2006 (Reff12: 0.36), etc. This could be due to TB outbreaks in schools 通用删除6(英):<u>[90]</u>. Once TB transmission occurs in schools, the spread of TB will exceed beyond the public due to the frequent contact between students and cause widespread TB in schools. Due to this particularity of TB school transmission, the TB reporting system of China is more sensitive to the population of student occupation. A national single-case warning system is used to identify the student tuberculosis patients. When a student is diagnosed, close contacts screening, isolation and treatment of the TB patients are implemented in the shortest time. These measures make the control of student TB outbreaks much more effective, and then reduce the tuberculosis cases of this outbreak. But in the real world, if the epidemic was not dealt with promptly, a widespread TB outbreak in schools will be inevitable.\nThe relevant authorities must continue to strengthen the prevention and control of TB in student populations in the future 通用删除6(英):<u>[91]</u>. There are shortcomings at all levels, including schools, medical institutions and TB control institutions, and improvements are needed. For schools, the implementation of a system to trace the causes of absence from school to detect patients in a timely and proactive manner is effective. Medical institutions should keep the epidemic information channels open with schools and TB control institutions, and provide timely information about confirmed students to schools and TB control institutions. TB prevention and control institutions should perform timely information verification and close contact follow-up after the detection of the infected student.\nIn addition, we suggest that more attention should be paid to men, farmers, and young and middle-aged people; and the bacteriological diagnosis of TB should be strengthened. More data collection from social contact surveys is required to provide information on how individual behaviors drive disease dynamics at the population level.\nIn particularly, several limitations may have influenced the results obtained. The first is selection bias due to inconsistency at the administrative levels in our study areas, which includes three cities and one province. The second is that we only included cases that were diagnosed as \"bacteriologically confirmed positive or negative\" and excluded those that were diagnosed as \"rifampicin resistant\" when processing the initial data. The latter could also contribute to TB transmission. Furthermore, complete immunity does not occur in patients with TB after recovery. However, partial immunity has been observed in previously infected individuals, which can prevent reinfection (risk ratio = 0.5) 通用删除6(英):<u>[92]</u>. The last limitation of our methodology is that it was not possible to subdivide the 17 non-student occupations to better articulate the mechanisms of transmission between different occupations and quantify the impact of different non-student occupations on the student population.\nThis study has the potential to improve our understanding of the features of TB transmission in different occupational groups. The transmission of MTB was high in non-student populations, and that in the non-student population was 23.30 times higher than in the student population. It had the strongest influence among non-student groups. It not only increases the incidence of TB among non-students, but also among students. The incidence of TB among students has been on the rise and is the fourth highest in occupational distribution (especially in economically developed areas with a high number of students), despite the incidence of TB in China showing a downward trend annually. The TB outbreak among students can rapidly improve the transmissibility of TB in a short time, which will affect the prevalence of TB in other groups. TB screening should be performed rigorously at the beginning of the school semesters, when returning to school, to detect patients with LTBI. This implies the need for the implementation of more control measures such as strengthening the school TB management efforts and timely management of identified TB-infected students, after the academic year begins.\nTable S1.

In 2021, most TB cases occurred in the 30 high-burden countries (87%), in which 8 countries account for two-thirds, with China (7.4%) ranking after India (28%) and Indonesia (9.2%) 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. China is also on the three lists of high-burden countries for TB, HIV-associated TB, and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) of the World Health Organization (WHO). Despite the difficulties that remain, such as the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and the coinfection of TB with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the global incidence of tuberculosis is estimated to slowly decline by 1.6% per year, far from the 4–5% estimated to be required to reach the objectives of the WHO’s End TB Strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a large global drop in people newly diagnosed with TB and reported in 2020, compared to 2019通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\nIn China 2021, the number of reported TB cases is ranked second highest after viral hepatitis, and in terms of death is the second highest after AIDS 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. There are about 250 million students in China (about 20% of the population). The reported TB cases in students account for about 4–6% of the total reported TB cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. TB cases in the 15–24-year age group accounted for about 85% of the total reported TB cases in students, which means the number of TB cases in high school and college students is higher, especially in the 18-year-old age group 通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7,8]</u>. When MTB spreads in schools, it can be transmitted rapidly and have a major impact on young people simply because of cluster. Therefore, it is one of the reasons why school TB outbreaks have been reported frequently in China, despite the steady global decline of the TB incidence trend 通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,11,12,13]</u>. Moreover, MDR-TB outbreaks have also been reported in schools, making TB control in schools much more difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15]</u>.\nTheoretical epidemiology, also known as the mathematical model of epidemiology, uses mathematical formulas to express the law of disease prevalence explicitly and quantitatively between cause, host and environment, and to theoretically explore the effects of different control measures. Mathematical modelling has become a powerful tool for analysing epidemiological characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>, which is used to reveal the characteristics of the internal spread of infectious diseases. Transmission dynamic models are commonly used in infectious disease models, including Susceptible-infectious-recovered model, Susceptible-exposed-symptomatic-recovered (SEIR) model, and Autoregressive integrated moving average model.

However, only a few studies have used occupational mathematical models to study TB transmission in China. The construction of TB models which are used to explore the dynamics of TB transmission between students and non-students is unclear.\nThe prevention and control of TB in schools has been improved with the efforts of medical personnel staff at all levels. In the past 10 years, control measures have been continuously strengthened and improved, but the transmission characteristics of TB in schools are still unclear. The aim of this study is to establish a mathematical model of TB between students and non-students, to analyse and explore the transmissibility of MTB in schools, and then to take reasonable and effective measures to control TB in schools.\nIn this study, based on the reported and observed morbidity characteristics, we developed a SEIR model with two occupational groups (students and non-students). We investigated the role of occupation in the transmission process and evaluated feasible control strategies to achieve the objectives outlined in the WHO End TB Strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. Furthermore, this study classified active TB patients into high or low transmissibility groups according to their pathogenic status 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>.\nFirstly, in this study, a dataset was constructed, including basic information (sex, age, occupation, and location) and case classification (positive and negative cases of pathogen). Demographic data was obtained from the Chinese Statistical Yearbook 通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33,34,35]</u>, including the total population, the total student population, birth rate, and the death rate for each city 通用删除1(英):<u></u>.\nSecondly, two mathematical models (Models A and B refer to non-seasonal and seasonal models, respectively) were constructed to simulate the reported TB cases of the four regions in China, based on the natural history and seasonality of TB. In each model, we divided the collected data into four subpopulations of active diseases in two dimensions. The first dimension for all calculations and outputs was the occupation of students (1 subscript) or non-students (2 subscript), while the second dimension was the pathogenic status, including pathogen positive (p subscript) and pathogen negative (n subscript) pulmonary disease. In addition, goodness-of-fit was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of model fitting.\nFinally, we simulated the sub-population-to-sub-population transmission process, to determine the combination with the most distinctive impact, via calculating effective reproduction number (Reff) and performing knock-out analysis. This enabled the formulation of effective and targeted control measures for TB transmission in China, in accordance with occupation-specific prevention and control .\nWe collected year-based TB incidence data from the China Public Health Science Data Center 删除6：<u></u> from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017 for each province in China (not included Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) 通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>. After we calculated the average annual incidence rate and plotted the incidence map , we found an inequality in the disease burden.\nConsidering the geographic position, the TB incidences in four regions (located in the north, south, southwest, and middle of China) are average incidences compared to those of the other regions in China, which is consistent with the population distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u>, which means that the selection can better reflect the TB epidemiological characteristics in geographical differences.\nThis study collected data on reported TB cases, populations, and areas in four regions [Jilin Province, Wuhan City in Hubei Province, Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture (Chuxiong Prefecture) in Yunnan Province, and Xiamen City in Fujian Province] 通用删除1(英):<u></u>, which are from the Health Commission of each region, the Statistics Bureau of each region and data mentioned in some researches 通用删除6(英):<u>[38,39]</u>, etc. Therefore, the TB results from these four regional analyses are effectively representative of TB epidemiological characteristics in China.\nReported TB cases included in this study consisted of laboratory confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and clinical diagnostic PTB. Since the Chinese government implemented the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) for infectious diseases in 2004, the diagnostic criteria for TB has changed several times ( \"WS288–2008 Diagnosis of tuberculosis\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> with the adjusted notice in 2017 通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>, and the \"WS 288–2017 Diagnosis of Tuberculosis\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> and the \"WS 196–2017 Classification of Tuberculosis\" standards 通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>, with the adjusted notice in 2018 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>). All TB cases were classified on the base of the following criteria. The confirmed PTB cases were denoted as people with possible PTB symptoms, such as a continuous cough for more than 2 weeks, hemoptysis, and night sweat, and confirmed by a sputum smear and/or a sputum culture with the result of detectable acid-fast bacilli or positive result from a rapid molecular diagnostic instrument (e.g. GeneXpert). The clinical diagnosis of PTB was defined as people with obviously abnormal chest radiography along with no curative effect from anti-inflammatory treatment under the circumstance of negative results from laboratory tests or absence of related results 通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45,46]</u>.\nThe PTB cases are classified as follows, based on pathogenic findings: sputum smear positive, sputum smear negative, sputum culture positive, sputum culture negative, molecular biology positive, and without sputum PTB 通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u>. In the latest notice published in 2018, the classification of TB cases, which must be reported in the NNDSS, was adjusted to \"pathogen positive (including sputum smear positive and only sputum culture positive PTB)\" , \"pathogen negative (including sputum smear negative PTB)\" , \"rifampicin resistant\" , \"no pathogenic findings (including without sputum PTB and tuberculous pleurisy\" 通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>. We have reclassified all historical data according to the new classification notice for consistency .\nThe diagnosis of PTB is based on a pathogenic examination (including bacteriology and molecular biology), combined with epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, chest imaging, relevant auxiliary examinations, differential diagnosis, and other comprehensive analyses 通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>. Pathogenic and pathological results were used as the basis for diagnosis. Therefore, the following inclusion criteria were TB cases with pathogen positive [ \"positive cases with MTB detected by sputum smear, culture-confirmed or molecular biology (nucleic acid of MTB)\" ] and negative [ \"TB cases without MTB detected (including patients with negative sputum smear and without sputum)\" ]. The rifampicin resistance category was officially reported in 2019 and represented a small percentage (< 5%) of the total data collected. Therefore, to maintain the consistency of the overall data, we excluded these data from the analysis.\nBased on the model, the total population (N) was divided into the following five compartments: susceptible population (S), exposed population (or low-risk latent tuberculosis infection, LTBI) (E), pathogen positive tuberculosis population (Ip), pathogen negative tuberculosis population (In), and recovered or removed population (R).\nSusceptible population (S): people who have not been exposed to MTB or those who experienced self-clearance by their own immune system. The latter is a state in which the bacteria in the body cannot replicate to the extent that self-clearance occurs due to the strong immunity of the body after exposure, a state in which the body has a sustained immune response to MTB antigen stimulation.Exposed population (or low-risk LTBI) (E): A susceptible population is exposed to MTB through contact with a highly infectious or less infectious population and is in an MTB carrier state but is temporarily noninfectious.Pathogen positive TB population (Ip): positive cases with MTB detected by sputum smear, culture-confirmed, or molecular biology (nucleic acid of MTB).Pathogen negative TB population (In): TB cases without MTB detected (including patients with negative sputum smear and no sputum), with low infectiousness.Recovered or removed population (R): This is a state of cure or recovery, noninfectious and asymptomatic, referring to the population undergoing successful treatment, including the treatment success for the \"pathogen negative\" population and the \"pathogen positive\" population (both the cured and the treatment success population).\nSusceptible population (S): people who have not been exposed to MTB or those who experienced self-clearance by their own immune system. The latter is a state in which the bacteria in the body cannot replicate to the extent that self-clearance occurs due to the strong immunity of the body after exposure, a state in which the body has a sustained immune response to MTB antigen stimulation.\nExposed population (or low-risk LTBI) (E): A susceptible population is exposed to MTB through contact with a highly infectious or less infectious population and is in an MTB carrier state but is temporarily noninfectious.\nPathogen positive TB population (Ip): positive cases with MTB detected by sputum smear, culture-confirmed, or molecular biology (nucleic acid of MTB).\nPathogen negative TB population (In): TB cases without MTB detected (including patients with negative sputum smear and no sputum), with low infectiousness.\nRecovered or removed population (R): This is a state of cure or recovery, noninfectious and asymptomatic, referring to the population undergoing successful treatment, including the treatment success for the \"pathogen negative\" population and the \"pathogen positive\" population (both the cured and the treatment success population).\nBased on the natural history of TB, we developed a mathematical model Susceptible-exposed-symptomatic (pathogen positive)-symptomatic (pathogen negative)-recovered (SEIpInR) model to investigate the transmission process of TB. The proposed SEIpInR model is based on the following facts and assumptions:\nBirths and natural deaths change the total population (N); the birth rate and the death rate are br and dr, respectively. The entire birth population enters group 2(the non-student group).This population is generally susceptible to MTB infection. When an infected individual is exposed, the exposed population (E) progresses to the active TB-infected population (I) at a rate of β. Since the transmissibility of the pathogen positive TB population (Ip) is higher than the pathogen negative TB population (In), the transmissibility of In is set to be a к times (к < 1) compared to Ip.Approximately 5–10% of the exposed population (E) infected with MTB will develop symptoms and become Ip or In; both belong to the active TB-infected population and will receive treatment. Most exposed people do not develop symptoms, but undergo a process of self-clearance and become a susceptible population (S). If E progresses to Ip at a rate of ω1 (incubation period coefficient) with a scale factor of q, and E progresses to In at a rate of ω2 (latent period coefficient) with a scale factor of (1-q). The progression from E to S occurs at a rate of θ (early self-clearance rate) on a scale factor of m. At time t, the progression from E to Ip, from E to In and from E to S is proportional to the number of exposed populations, which is qω1E, (1-q)ω2E, and mθE, respectively.Studies have shown that the proportion of patients with TB cured by the directly observed treatment and short course chemotherapy (DOTS) who require retreatment in the next 1–2 years is 2 to 7% 通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49]</u>. Patients who are retreated can be broadly divided into two categories: those who were not successfully cured following treatment, and those who relapsed after being cured.There were two outcomes for the Ip compartment: First, a certain proportion of treatment success individuals (1-λ) transform into a recovered or removed population (R), while another proportion of treatment failure individuals (λ) transform into an exposed population (E). At time t, the rate of development from Ip to R, which is proportional to the Ip population, is given as (1-λ)γ1Ip, while the rate of development from Ip to E, which is proportional to the E population, is given as λμ1Ip. γ1 is the removal coefficient, whereas μ1 is the coefficient of development from Ip to E. Similarly, the rate of development to R in the In compartment is given as (1-λ)γ2In, while the rate of development to E is given as λμ2In. γ2 is the removal coefficient and μ2 is the coefficient of development of In to E.The people in the Ip and In compartments recover or are removed (R) after successful treatment (completion of treatment for In and Ip 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>). Reinfection occurs after the completion of treatment or cured, that is, the active TB-infected population (Ip, In) returns to the exposed population (E).Reactivation (or relapse) is often associated with immunodeficiency, such as the onset of disease due to HIV/TB coinfection or low resistance, such as severe cold. If people in the R compartment develop into E with a relapse ratio a where τ represents the relapse coefficient, the rate of development from R to E at time t is proportional to R, which is aτR.The pathogen positive TB population (Ip) and the pathogen negative TB population (In) die of disease, in addition to natural deaths. Suppose the fatality rates for Ip were f1 and that for In were f2; then, at time t, the death rates for Ip and In are f1Ip and f2In, respectively.The student population was set as S1, E1, Ip1, In1, and R1, whereas the non-student population was set as S2, E2, Ip2, In2, and R2. Interactions were observed between students and non-students. We defined the relative transmission rate of student-to-student as β11, non-student-to-non-student as β22, student-to-non-student as β12, and non-student-to-student as β21. Therefore, the number of newly emerging infections was β11S1(Ip1 + кIn1) from the student-to-student population, β22S2(Ip2 + кIn2) from the non-student-to-non-student population, β12S2(Ip1 + кIn1) from the student-to-non-student population, and β21S1(Ip2 + кIn2) from the non-student-to-student population.\nBirths and natural deaths change the total population (N); the birth rate and the death rate are br and dr, respectively. The entire birth population enters group 2(the non-student group).\nThis population is generally susceptible to MTB infection. When an infected individual is exposed, the exposed population (E) progresses to the active TB-infected population (I) at a rate of β. Since the transmissibility of the pathogen positive TB population (Ip) is higher than the pathogen negative TB population (In), the transmissibility of In is set to be a к times (к < 1) compared to Ip.\nApproximately 5–10% of the exposed population (E) infected with MTB will develop symptoms and become Ip or In; both belong to the active TB-infected population and will receive treatment. Most exposed people do not develop symptoms, but undergo a process of self-clearance and become a susceptible population (S). If E progresses to Ip at a rate of ω1 (incubation period coefficient) with a scale factor of q, and E progresses to In at a rate of ω2 (latent period coefficient) with a scale factor of (1-q). The progression from E to S occurs at a rate of θ (early self-clearance rate) on a scale factor of m. At time t, the progression from E to Ip, from E to In and from E to S is proportional to the number of exposed populations, which is qω1E, (1-q)ω2E, and mθE, respectively.\nStudies have shown that the proportion of patients with TB cured by the directly observed treatment and short course chemotherapy (DOTS) who require retreatment in the next 1–2 years is 2 to 7% 通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49]</u>. Patients who are retreated can be broadly divided into two categories: those who were not successfully cured following treatment, and those who relapsed after being cured.\nThere were two outcomes for the Ip compartment: First, a certain proportion of treatment success individuals (1-λ) transform into a recovered or removed population (R), while another proportion of treatment failure individuals (λ) transform into an exposed population (E). At time t, the rate of development from Ip to R, which is proportional to the Ip population, is given as (1-λ)γ1Ip, while the rate of development from Ip to E, which is proportional to the E population, is given as λμ1Ip. γ1 is the removal coefficient, whereas μ1 is the coefficient of development from Ip to E. Similarly, the rate of development to R in the In compartment is given as (1-λ)γ2In, while the rate of development to E is given as λμ2In. γ2 is the removal coefficient and μ2 is the coefficient of development of In to E.\nThe people in the Ip and In compartments recover or are removed (R) after successful treatment (completion of treatment for In and Ip 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>). Reinfection occurs after the completion of treatment or cured, that is, the active TB-infected population (Ip, In) returns to the exposed population (E).\nReactivation (or relapse) is often associated with immunodeficiency, such as the onset of disease due to HIV/TB coinfection or low resistance, such as severe cold. If people in the R compartment develop into E with a relapse ratio a where τ represents the relapse coefficient, the rate of development from R to E at time t is proportional to R, which is aτR.\nThe pathogen positive TB population (Ip) and the pathogen negative TB population (In) die of disease, in addition to natural deaths. Suppose the fatality rates for Ip were f1 and that for In were f2; then, at time t, the death rates for Ip and In are f1Ip and f2In, respectively.\nThe student population was set as S1, E1, Ip1, In1, and R1, whereas the non-student population was set as S2, E2, Ip2, In2, and R2. Interactions were observed between students and non-students. We defined the relative transmission rate of student-to-student as β11, non-student-to-non-student as β22, student-to-non-student as β12, and non-student-to-student as β21. Therefore, the number of newly emerging infections was β11S1(Ip1 + кIn1) from the student-to-student population, β22S2(Ip2 + кIn2) from the non-student-to-non-student population, β12S2(Ip1 + кIn1) from the student-to-non-student population, and β21S1(Ip2 + кIn2) from the non-student-to-student population.\nA framework diagram of the SEIpInR model is shown in Fig. 3. The mathematical expression of the differential equation of the SEIpInR model are as follows:\nFourteen parameters were obtained from references or actual data in this model: birth rate (br), death rate (dr), transmission relative rate (β), proportion of early clearance (m), rate of early clearance (θ), transmission relative rate between pathogen negative and positive TB population (к), proportion of exposed to TB population (q), rate of exposed to TB population (ω), proportion of treatment failure (λ), rate from TB population to exposed population (μ), TB population removal coefficient (γ), Case fatality rate of TB population (f), recurrence ratio-proportion of recovered or removed population developing into exposed population (a), and reciprocal of time to recurrence rate at which recovered or removed population progresses to exposed population (τ).\nParameter β was derived from the curve-fitting results. Some parameters (br, dr, and q) were obtained from actual data, while other parameters were obtained from the literature. The description of each variable and parameter in this model is detailed in Table 1.\nThe description and features of estimated parameters\n删除重复语句：<u>The description and features of estimated parameters</u>\nE for the exposed population (or low-risk latent tuberculosis infection, LTBI), Ip for pathogen positive tuberculosis population, In for pathogen negative tuberculosis population, I1 for student tuberculosis population, I2 for non-student tuberculosis population, and R for recovered or removed population\nEarly self-clearance (early clear) was defined as a persistent negative interferon-gamma release test (IGRA) (patients with pathogenically positive TB were tested at baseline and after 14 weeks). Studies in Indonesia have shown that early self-clearance is 25% 通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u>. The time to self-clearance was set at 14 weeks, which is the interval between the two IGRA tests; thus θ = 1/ (14/4) = 0.286.Treatment failure: The WHO 2021 TB report 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> showed the treatment success rate was 95.9% in 2019 and 95.7% in 2020. Previous reports revealed that this value did not change much between 2000 and 2020. Therefore, we considered the treatment success rate as 95% and set the treatment failure rate (λ) to 5%, that is λ = 0.050. The conventional treatment course was 6 months. Therefore, the time to complete the treatment was set as 6 months, that is, μ1 = μ2 = 1/6 = 0.167 通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>.Relapse: Studies 通用删除6(英):<u>[53,54,55]</u> in China showed the relapse rate was 5.3–6.9%. Therefore, the median was chosen and the relapse proportion was set at a = 0.062 (recurrence ratio). A domestic study 通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> showed that the median time from the first attack to relapse in TB patients was 1.3 years [interquartile range (IQR) 0.6–2.8 years]. Therefore, the relapse rate was established at 1/(1.3*12), i.e. τ = 0.064 (reciprocal of time to recurrence).The transmissibility coefficient of In relative to Ip was set as κ to 0.2 通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u> with reference to the actual data and the relevant literature.After approximately two weeks of effective treatment, TB cases with a nondrug-resistant active infection usually do not remain infectious to others and become low in infection status 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>. Short-course (3-to 4-month) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over longer-course (6 to 9 months) isoniazid monotherapy for the treatment of low-infection cases of TB 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. Therefore, we set the duration of the illness at 14 weeks (average value 3–4 month), γ1 = γ2 = 1/(14/4) = 0.286.The birth rate (br) and the death rate (dr) for each year in each region were obtained from the statistical offices of each study area.\nEarly self-clearance (early clear) was defined as a persistent negative interferon-gamma release test (IGRA) (patients with pathogenically positive TB were tested at baseline and after 14 weeks).

R0 refers to the number of new cases expected from an infected case in a susceptible population during an average infectious period. We set Reff as the evaluation index, which denotes R0 after intervention measures were taken, to evaluate the impact of intervention measures on the relative transmissibility of MTB in the population.\nIn this study, Reff was calculated using the next-generation matrix method, and all source codes are accessible at GitHub 删除6：<u></u>. In this study, Reff1 represents the transmissibility of the population of students with active TB [sum of transmissibility from student cases to student cases (Reff11) and from student cases to non-student cases (Reff12)], while Reff2 represents the transmissibility of the population of non-student active TB cases [sum of transmissibility from non-student cases to non-student cases (Reff22) and from non-student cases to student cases (Reff21)].\nBerkeley Madonna 8.3.18 (developed by Robert Macey and George Oster of the University of California in Berkeley. Copyright ©1993–2001 Robert I. Macey & George F. Oster) was used to fit the curves of the incidence data. The estimated model coefficients and the simulation of the intervention effects were also generated using this software. The curving fit was performed using the fourth order Runge–Kutta method to obtain the key parameter values: student-to-student (β11), non-student-to-non-student (β22), student-to-non-student (β12), and non-student-to-student (β21) transmission rates.\nTo consider the potential seasonality transmission of TB, although seasonality remains unclear, we developed two models in this study, which are described as follows:\nModel A: seasonality excluded.\nIn Model A, the epidemic curve for each year was divided into ascending and descending periods according to the characteristics of the reported number of TB cases . The SEIpInR model without seasonality was adopted to fit the data in each period, and the corresponding transmission relative rates (β, β11, β12, β22, and β21), the ascending and descending Reff (Reff(asc) and Reff(des), respectively) were calculated.\nModel B: seasonality included.\nIn Model B, we used a seasonality function in the SEIp-InR model to fit the reported TB epidemic curve , which is shown as follows:\nIn this equation, βt, β0, c, and T refer to the transmission rate at time t, the transmission rate at time = 0, the correcting value of time (month) and the potential seasonality cycle, respectively.\nThe goodness-of-fit test was performed between the fitted results and the collected data by calculating the R2 and P values. Key parameters (β11, β12, β22, β21) were knocked out, and the cumulative number of cases was calculated to assess the main parameter affecting transmissibility. SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Ill, USA) was used to perform statistical analyses. The coefficient of determination (R2) was used to evaluate the curve fitness.\nThe age range of the TB patients was between 15 and 90 years, with two peaks in the incidence of TB: a large and a small peak in the age groups 35–90 and 15–35, respectively. In Wuhan City, Jilin Province and Chuxiong Prefecture, there were two age distribution peaks of non-student TB patients (15–35 and 45–60 years group), while in Xiamen City, there was only one peak (15–35 years group). Student patients with TB were among 15–25 year group . Most patients with TB in the four regions were male, with a male-to-female ratio of 7∶3 . The Chinese Infectious Disease Report Card categorises cases into 18 categories, and the top six occupations (88.4% of the total cases) in the four regions were: farmers, housework and unemployment, others, workers, students, and retirees. Among these four regions, the top three occupations of TB patients in Wuhan were domestic and unemployed (23.2%), farmers (22.2%), and retirees (12.1%). The top three occupations of TB patients were farmers (50.3%), domestic and unemployed (18.6%), and others (8.0%) in Jilin Province; workers (22.5%), farmers (15.3%), and others (10.6%) in Xiamen; farmers (87.2%), retirees (4.5%), and students (2.2%) in Chuxiong Prefecture . The ranking of students with TB was sixth, sixth, eighth and third in Wuhan, Jilin, Xiamen, and Chuxiong Prefecture, respectively.\nThe number of reported TB cases in Wuhan City and Jilin Province showed a decreasing annual trend, while the number of reported TB cases in Xiamen City and Chuxiong Prefecture showed a slight fluctuation trend . The incidence in the student population was distinctly low during the winter holidays (January–February, approximately 30 days) and summer vacation (July–August, approximately 60 days), with one or two distinct peaks after returning to school (the remaining months of the year). There were slight differences between regions in the time of occurrence of these peaks: Wuhan (March and September–October), Xiamen (March and October), Jilin (April and September), and Chuxiong (April and October). However, for the non-student population, there were no clear lows or peaks.\nMost cases had either positive or negative pathogen results (87.3%), and the ratio was 1∶1.13. The proportion of cases without pathogenic findings was 12.6%; rifampicin resistant results accounted for 0.1%. The number of pathogen positive and negative cases was essentially the same in Jilin Province, while the other three regions reported more pathogen negative cases than positive. The proportion of patients without pathogenic findings was the lowest in Xiamen City and the highest in Chuxiong Prefecture. Very few cases of resistance to rifampicin were reported in any region .\nWe conducted goodness-of-fit tests for the two models based on the case datasets from the four regions (Wuhan City, Jilin Province, Chuxiong Prefecture, and Xiamen City) . R2 values were calculated for the four model groups (pathogen positive cases in the student group, Ip1; pathogen negative cases in the student group, In1; pathogen positive cases in the non-student group, Ip2; and pathogen negative cases in the non-student group, In2). The values showed that, although the two established TB models fitted well with the trend of TB incidence rates , Model A had better fitting results than Model B.\nGoodness-of-fit test results of the two models (Models A and B) in the study areas\n删除重复语句：<u>Goodness-of-fit test results of the two models (Models A and B) in the study areas</u>\nCorrelation between the simulated and observed data was tested using R2 and p values. We divided all the compartments representing active diseases (I) into four occupational compartments: pathogen positive students (Ip1 subscript), pathogen positive non-students (Ip2 subscript), pathogen negative students (In1 subscript) and pathogen negative non-students (In2 subscript)\nThe results of Reff among and between the different populations in each region are shown in Fig. 9.\nIn Wuhan City, the median Reff for TB among the mixed population was 1.79 (IQR: 1.56–2.02). Most TB transmissions occurred due to the high transmission in non-student populations, including among non-student populations [median Reff22 was 1.57 (IQR: 1.41–1.72)] and non-student-to-student populations [median Reff21 was 0.14 (IQR: 0.11–0.15)], with a median Reff2 of 1.71(IQR: 1.54–1.87). The values of Reff22 and Reff21 slowly descended from 2005 to 2018. The values of Reff12 and Reff11 were nearly zero excluding in 2006 (Reff12 was 6.39, Reff11 was 0.19) and 2013 (Reff11 was 0.58) .\nReff of Model A between students and non-students (Wuhan City)\n删除重复语句：<u>Reff of Model A between students and non-students (Wuhan City)</u>\nReff11 denotes the transmissibility of MTB from student cases to student cases.

The Reff21 and Reff12 values maintained stable fluctuations at values lower than 1 from 2007 to 2019.

However, the model revealed exceedingly high values of Reff over many years in the four regions, which indicates that the findings of Model B may be unsuitable to show the characteristics of TB. Additional details of the results are provided in 通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 3: Tables S3, Additional file 4: Table S4, Additional file 5: Table S5, Additional file 6: Table S6.</u>\nAccording to the knock-out results , the number of TB cases among students was significantly reduced by more than half (60–70%) when the transmissibility of non-student-to-student populations (β21) was knocked out. When TB transmission among non-students (β22) was blocked, the number of TB cases was reduced by approximately 67% (65–70%) among non-students and by approximately 28% (25–30%) among students. There was only a 5% reduction (2–12%) among students when TB transmission among students (β11) was blocked, and TB reported cases had barely changed (less than 1%) while TB transmission from non-student-to-students (β12) was blocked.\nThis study is the first to address the occupational-specific transmission dynamics of TB and emphasise the importance of control between student groups, which can increase our understanding of the characteristics of TB transmission in different occupational groups.\nThe incidence rate of TB decreased in the study regions, which is in good agreement with previous global reports 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>, but was unevenly distributed between these four regions. This phenomenon may be attributed to several reasons. First, the inclusion of previously untreated patients in the management after several years of continuous active screening led to a certain decline in the number of subsequent patient detection cases. Second, since 2017, a nationwide survey of underreporting and under-registration of TB 通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u> and a diagnostic review 通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> were carried out, which improved the quality of TB reporting and diagnosis in each region. However, the reported incidence rate of TB is still higher in areas less economically developed than in the west, such as Chuxiong Prefecture, although the attention and support of governments and health administrations, as well as the support for precise health poverty alleviation have been undertaken at all levels 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>.\nRemarkably, the reported incidence of TB in the student population has increased. The reported data also confirmed that the proportion of student patients has increased from 4.0% in 2015 to 6.2% in 2019, with a difference of 2.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>. This is mainly due to the fact that early warning of individual cases of TB in schools has been included in the National Automatic Early Warning System for Infectious Diseases since July 2018 通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u>. Furthermore, disease control agencies at all levels have strengthened the information verification process of school-age patients and improved the sensitivity of the surveillance of student patients 通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u>. Schools have also strengthened medical examinations and handled clusters of TB outbreaks 通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u>. Our results highlight an obvious incidence peak among students at the beginning of the semester. There are several explanations for this observation. Students are in close contact with social residents and are exposed to TB patients in the community during holidays. Considering LTBI 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,63]</u>, students infected with MTB on vacation do not become ill immediately, but become ill after returning to school when they are exposed to several inducements, including high pressure and cold, among others. Farmers always had the highest reported incidence rates. However, this is not surprising if we consider that the rural population represents most of the total population of China, and the allocation of medical and health resources in rural areas is inadequate, resulting in unequal access to medical resources for urban and rural residents 通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>. Furthermore, it may be related to the lower level of education of farmers, poorer living conditions, and lack of awareness of health protection 通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u>.\nThe diagnosis results in the study areas, which had a low pathogen positive rate of less than 50%. A previous report showed the pathogen positive rate for PTB reported in China in 2020 was 57%, up from 45.03% in 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. However, a gap still exists when this is compared with surveillance results based on laboratory pathogenic diagnostic evidence in other countries worldwide. Both the TB laboratory diagnostic and the TB imaging detection capacity need to be improved in primary care institutions in China, which is consistent with the outcomes of one diagnostic and therapeutic survey on TB sentinel medical institutions 通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> and on the current status of TB diagnostic capacity at county-level TB sentinel medical institutions in China 通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u>. To achieve the goal of \"reaching a pathogenic positivity rate of more than 50% by 2022\" as required by the Action Plan to Stop TB 通用删除7(英):<u>(2019–2022)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u>, it is still necessary to continue to strengthen the quality of laboratory work 通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u>.\nIn this study, two mathematical models of TB were constructed according to the transmission characteristics of TB: Models A and B. Although there may be seasonal fluctuations in the actual incidence of TB in some areas, Model A fitted better than Model B. Therefore, we believe that the analysis results of Model A can better reflect the real situation of TB incidence.\nTherefore, the following interpretations were made according to the results of the Reff calculation of Model A and results of a knock-out analysis:\nA) Overall, the average values of Reff in the four regions showed that a single TB case could effectively spread to one or two people. TB transmissibility among non-students (Reff2) was 23.30 times (IQR: 1.94–7.24) higher than among students (Reff1). TB transmission remained dominant in the non-student population. This finding also existed in the knock-out analysis. Transmission among non-students increased the number of reported TB cases in all four groups (67% in non-students and 28% in students). The non-student population was large, and included 17 occupations, different locations with active cases, and a wide range of age groups. In high-burden areas, such as China, most TB transmission occurs outside the home (< 20% of household transmission) which is not necessarily attributable to known close contacts 通用删除6(英):<u>[69,70]</u>. The probability of TB transmission to others by a TB patient is determined by many factors, including socioeconomic, environmental, high or low regional disease burden, infectiousness of the case, MTB strain, and host susceptibility. Determining the specific site of TB transmission outside the home is difficult. The potential for airborne transmission even during brief contact, combined with variable incubation periods, makes it exceptionally difficult to establish a specific TB transmission link. Despite these challenges, certain specific settings have been identified as important contributors to TB risk, such as nasal transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>[71,72,73,74]</u>, hospital-associated transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u>, homeless shelters 通用删除6(英):<u>[76]</u>, prisons 通用删除6(英):<u>[77,78]</u>, public transportation 通用删除6(英):<u>[79]</u>, churches 通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u>, schools 通用删除6(英):<u>[69,81]</u> and slums 通用删除6(英):<u>[82,83,84]</u>. This is precisely because the places where students study and live are close, providing good conditions for the spread of TB; therefore, the implementation of TB control policies in schools is especially important. The presence of these factors has contributed to the high rates of acquired TB in this group over the years.\nFurthermore, the concentration of TB transmission in certain settings and subpopulations also leads to heterogeneity of transmission, which can serve to increase Reff and may make it more difficult to control transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>[85]</u>. Moreover, adults in their most active age groups are more likely to be infected with TB due to their close contact with each other 通用删除6(英):<u>[86]</u>. To explain why transmission among the non-student populations increased the number of infected patients among non-students, it may be assumed that household and unnoticed transmissions in the community contribute simultaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>[87]</u>.\nB) The results from knock-out analysis indicated that non-student-to-student transmission increased the number of reported TB cases in the student group (either pathogen positive or negative), and transmission among non-students increased the number of reported TB cases in all the four groups. There may be several reasons for this. First, the home–school transmission route may be one of the reasons. TB is actively transmitted by household exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>[88]</u>, and a prospective case–control study found that previous exposure to TB in a household could cause an infected student to spread TB to their classmates 通用删除6(英):<u>[89]</u>. Second, we believe that the school community transmission route is important due to increased exposure to other occupations during vacations.\nC) Although TB transmission is spread mainly by non-students, the transmissibility of student-to-non-students in some years and in some regions, is particularly high, such as the Reff12 of Chuxiong Prefecture in 2016 (Reff12: 0.13), 2017 (Reff12: 0.16), and that of Wuhan City in 2006 (Reff12: 0.36), etc. This could be due to TB outbreaks in schools 通用删除6(英):<u>[90]</u>. Once TB transmission occurs in schools, the spread of TB will exceed beyond the public due to the frequent contact between students and cause widespread TB in schools. Due to this particularity of TB school transmission, the TB reporting system of China is more sensitive to the population of student occupation. A national single-case warning system is used to identify the student tuberculosis patients. When a student is diagnosed, close contacts screening, isolation and treatment of the TB patients are implemented in the shortest time. These measures make the control of student TB outbreaks much more effective, and then reduce the tuberculosis cases of this outbreak. But in the real world, if the epidemic was not dealt with promptly, a widespread TB outbreak in schools will be inevitable.\nThe relevant authorities must continue to strengthen the prevention and control of TB in student populations in the future 通用删除6(英):<u>[91]</u>. There are shortcomings at all levels, including schools, medical institutions and TB control institutions, and improvements are needed. For schools, the implementation of a system to trace the causes of absence from school to detect patients in a timely and proactive manner is effective. Medical institutions should keep the epidemic information channels open with schools and TB control institutions, and provide timely information about confirmed students to schools and TB control institutions. TB prevention and control institutions should perform timely information verification and close contact follow-up after the detection of the infected student.\nIn addition, we suggest that more attention should be paid to men, farmers, and young and middle-aged people; and the bacteriological diagnosis of TB should be strengthened. More data collection from social contact surveys is required to provide information on how individual behaviors drive disease dynamics at the population level.\nIn particularly, several limitations may have influenced the results obtained. The first is selection bias due to inconsistency at the administrative levels in our study areas, which includes three cities and one province. The second is that we only included cases that were diagnosed as \"bacteriologically confirmed positive or negative\" and excluded those that were diagnosed as \"rifampicin resistant\" when processing the initial data. The latter could also contribute to TB transmission. Furthermore, complete immunity does not occur in patients with TB after recovery. However, partial immunity has been observed in previously infected individuals, which can prevent reinfection (risk ratio = 0.5) 通用删除6(英):<u>[92]</u>. The last limitation of our methodology is that it was not possible to subdivide the 17 non-student occupations to better articulate the mechanisms of transmission between different occupations and quantify the impact of different non-student occupations on the student population.\nThis study has the potential to improve our understanding of the features of TB transmission in different occupational groups. The transmission of MTB was high in non-student populations, and that in the non-student population was 23.30 times higher than in the student population. It had the strongest influence among non-student groups. It not only increases the incidence of TB among non-students, but also among students. The incidence of TB among students has been on the rise and is the fourth highest in occupational distribution (especially in economically developed areas with a high number of students), despite the incidence of TB in China showing a downward trend annually. The TB outbreak among students can rapidly improve the transmissibility of TB in a short time, which will affect the prevalence of TB in other groups. TB screening should be performed rigorously at the beginning of the school semesters, when returning to school, to detect patients with LTBI. This implies the need for the implementation of more control measures such as strengthening the school TB management efforts and timely management of identified TB-infected students, after the academic year begins.\nTable S1.

Epidemiological studies have revealed that the consumption of green tea is associated with a reduced risk of various cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> The most abundant and active anticancer constituent in green tea is epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). The cancer preventive and inhibitory effects of EGCG have been extensively demonstrated in different tumor cell lines and animal models, and its mechanisms are involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and anti-oxidant activity.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood.\nNPC is one of the most common malignancies prevalent in South China and Southeast Asia.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u> The development of NPC involves cumulative genetic and epigenetic changes, among which oncogene activation and anti-oncogene inactivation play critical roles. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by binding to 3’-untranslated regions of their target miRNAs. The dysregulation of miRNAs has been closely correlated with the initiation and progression of various cancers, including NPC.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Moreover, there is evidence that the expression pattern of miRNAs in cancer cells was obviously influenced by anticancer agents, suggesting that some tumor-specific miRNAs may serve as the targets for cancer therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>\nEGCG has been shown to inhibit proliferation, clonogenicity, and invasiveness of NPC cells in vivo and in vitro.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u> It remains to be determined whether the cellular changes in NPC cells treated with EGCG are associated with the alternations in miRNA expression. Here, we used miRNA microarray analysis to characterize the effects of EGCG on miRNA expression profiles in CNE2 cells. The mRNA targets of the miRNAs regulated by EGCG may contribute to the identification of new molecular mechanisms for the action of EGCG in NPC.\nEGCG (≥95%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and stored at −20°C. CNE2 cells, a poorly differentiated NPC cell line, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).\nCNE2 cells were treated with 20 μmol/L or 40 μmol/L of EGCG dissolved in DMSO (final concentration in culture media, 0.1%) for 24 h. DMSO was also added to culture media as a vehicle control. Total RNA was isolated using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The miRNA expression profiles were determined at the Bioassay Laboratory of CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China) using Agilent Human miRNA 8*60K Microarray Release 16.0 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).\nTo verify the results obtained from the microarray analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out to detect the expression levels of differentially expressed miRNAs. Total RNA from cells was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then was subjected to reverse transcription reaction to synthesize cDNA using the MMLV reverse transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). qRT-PCR was performed with FS Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche, Foster City, CA, USA) in the ABI PRISM 7500 System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacture’s protocol. The bulge-loop miRNA qRT-PCR primer sets (one reverse transcription primer and a pair of quantitative PCR primers for each set) were designed and synthesized by RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). U6 small nuclear RNA was used as an endogenous control. The fold change of miRNA in log 2 scale was calculated by the equation 2−ΔΔCt, where ΔCt = CtmiRNA – CtU6 and ΔΔCt = ΔCttreated samples −ΔCtuntreated controls. Comparisons between groups were done by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s post hoc corrections for multiple comparisons. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). P < 0.05 was considered significant differences.\nThe differentially expressed miRNAs that either increased or decreased by more than 2-fold following EGCG treatment were chosen for target prediction in online databases. Two independent searches were performed using TargetScan 6.2 删除6：<u></u> and miRDB 删除6：<u></u>, and the results were compared. A common set of presumptive targets of each significant miRNA was identified and collected in a target pool. To determine the functions of the predicted target genes, the gene ontology (GO) of the target pool was analyzed using CapitalBio Molecule Annotation System 3.0 通用删除1(英):<u>(MAS, http://bioinfo.capitalbio.com/mas3/)</u>. This database enables the assignment of predicted target genes to functional groups based on biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. The pathways modified by EGCG through putative targets of specific miRNAs were further analyzed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. The significant GO terms and KEGG pathways were determined by P and Q < 0.001.\nPrevious studies have shown that EGCG inhibited the proliferation of CNE2 cells in time- and dose-dependent manners.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> As the concentration increased and action time was prolonged, EGCG also induced apoptosis in CNE2 cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> To examine whether miRNAs could be involved in cellular responses to EGCG treatment, we employed miRNA microarray analysis to compare EGCG-treated and untreated cells. The doses of EGCG used in this experiment were chosen by CCK-8 assay to evaluate dose-dependent cell viability (data not shown). Among the 1205 human miRNAs in the microarray, a total of 205 miRNAs (17.0%) exhibited differential expression between the EGCG-treated and untreated cells 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u>. We further identified the miRNAs that experienced >2-fold changes in expression. As shown in Table 1, 16 of the 205 miRNAs (7.8%) exhibited >2-fold expression changes in both 20 μmol/L and 40 μmol/L EGCG-treated groups compared with the control, and another 16 miRNAs (7.8%) showed >2-fold changes only in the 40 μmol/L EGCG-treated group. Among 32 miRNAs (>2-fold changes in 40 μmol/L EGCG-treated group), 29 miRNAs were upregulated and 1 miRNA was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1b and Table 2]</u>. One miRNA (hsa-miR-4281) was shown to be upregulated at similar levels in 20 μmol/L and 40 μmol/L EGCG-treated cells. Interestingly, although the expression of hsa-miR-29b-1-5p was upregulated at both concentrations of EGCG treatment, the fold change was decreased in the higher concentration group (4.82–2.61-fold). These data strongly indicated that EGCG is able to influence the expression of specific miRNAs in CNE2 cells.\nMiRNAs with >2-fold changes in CNE2 cells after EGCG treatment\n删除重复语句：<u>MiRNAs with >2-fold changes in CNE2 cells after EGCG treatment</u>\nEGCG: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate; miRNAs: microRNAs.\nExpression levels of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG\n删除重复语句：<u>Expression levels of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG</u>\nEGCG: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate; miRNAs: microRNAs.\nTo validate the microarray results, we performed qRT-PCR to detect the expression levels of six differentially expressed miRNAs (upregulated: hsa-miR-1246, hsa-miR-1973, hsa-miR-210, hsa-miR-1915, and hsa-miR-34a; downregulated: hsa-miR-205-3p) after EGCG treatment 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. The relative expression levels of these miRNAs between the EGCG-treated and untreated cells were shown to be comparable to those observed by microarray analysis. Overall, these results confirmed our findings of differential miRNAs expression by microarray.\nThe miRNAs that showed a dose-dependent response to EGCG treatment might be involved to EGCG-mediated anticancer properties. To elucidate the biological functions of EGCG-specific miRNAs, the putative targets of 14 differentially expressed miRNAs which exhibited >2-fold expression changes in a dose-dependent manner were identified using TargetScan and miRDB databases. We identified 1767 targets of EGCG-specific upregulated miRNAs and 648 targets of EGCG-specific downregulated miRNAs (hsa-miR-205-3p was only present in the miRDB database). Subsequently, the functions of these potential targets were determined using GO classification based on gene annotation and summary information. As shown in Table 3, a total of 43, 49, and 52 target genes from EGCG-specific miRNAs were associated with the apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and cell proliferation, respectively.\nFunctional analysis of the predicted targets of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG\n删除重复语句：<u>Functional analysis of the predicted targets of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG</u>\n*Predicted targets of miRNAs only come from miRDB database.

We identified the significantly regulated pathways with both P and Q < 0.001. A total of 66 pathways were statistically enriched by target genes of EGCG-specific miRNAs.\nThe top thirty of the most significant pathways are listed in Table 4. These pathways were primarily involved in tumor development and progression, lipid and glucose metabolism, inflammation, cytoskeleton and gap junction, and calcium signaling. Furthermore, we focused on the cancer-related pathways in KEGG system and observed that these targets were strongly associated with a wide variety of cancer pathways. The ten most significant pathways were mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, focal adhesion, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), Wnt signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, Adherens junction, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, p53 signaling pathway, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction.\nKEGG pathway associating with predicted targets of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG\n删除重复语句：<u>KEGG pathway associating with predicted targets of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG</u>\nEGCG: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate; miRNAs: microRNAs; MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase; CAMs: Cell adhesion molecules; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.\nNumerous miRNAs are known to function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, regulating tumor initiation and progression at all levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The knockdown or re-expression of specific miRNAs could inhibit cell proliferation and transformation, suppress cell invasion and metastasis, and induce drug sensitivity.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Recently, many studies have shown that natural agents, including curcumin, resveratrol, EGCG, etc. could cause the alterations of specific miRNAs expression, which may play critical roles in their chemoprotective and therapeutic effects against tumors.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> It is reasonable to believe that a specific or a cluster of miRNAs in NPC cells may serve as the targets for the anticancer agents. To date, the global impact of EGCG on the expression of miRNAs in NPC cells has seldomly been reported.\nIn the present study, we investigated the effects of EGCG on miRNA expression profiles in CNE2 cells using microarray analysis. Among the 1205 human miRNAs in the microarray, 16 miRNAs in the 20 μmol/L EGCG-treated group and 32 miRNAs in the 40 μmol/L EGCG-treated group exhibited >2-fold expression changes compared with the control. Most of these miRNAs responded to EGCG in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, the microarray results showed that the number of upregulated miRNAs was considerably higher than the number of downregulated miRNAs, indicating that the EGCG-mediated effects on CNE2 cells were associated more with miRNA upregulation. This result was contradicted to the EGCG-treated liver cancer HepG2 cells, in which the number of upregulated miRNAs was lower than that of downregulated miRNAs.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u> There was no overlap between the differentially expressed miRNAs in response to EGCG in HepG2 cells and those in CNE2 cells, suggesting that there may be different mechanisms of action in NPC, depending on differences in cellular contexts.\nHsa-miR-1246, the most significantly upregulated miRNA observed in the present study, was dramatically decreased in cervical cancer tissues and negatively correlated with clinical stage and HPV16E6-infected status.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> However, Piepoli et al. showed that the relative expression of miR-1246 was significantly higher in colorectal cancer compared with matched adjacent normal tissues.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> These data suggested a contradictory role of miR-1246 in different cancers with various cellular contexts. Hsa-miR-210 is one of the hypoxia-regulated miRNAs and functions as a tumor suppressor in regulating tumor cell growth, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> In NPC CNE cells, the overexpression of miR-210 disturbed mitotic progression and reduced tumor formation through targeting a group of mitosis-related genes.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Similar to the results in CNE2 cells, EGCG could increase the level of miR-210 in human and mouse lung cancer cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Hsa-miR-205-3p, which was downregulated to the greatest extent in the present study, was reported to be significantly upregulated in the tissues and serum of non- small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients compared with the control groups, indicating that miR-205-3p may be a valuable biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of NSCLC patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Overall, the modification of miRNA expression profiles may imply the potential roles of miRNAs in the anticancer effects of EGCG on NPC.\nMiRNAs function by engaging with their target miRNAs, resulting in either the degradation or the inhibition of transcription. A single miRNA can regulate the expression of multiple target miRNAs, and conversely, a single target miRNA may be modulated by several miRNAs. To assess the global impact of these EGCG-specific miRNAs, we conducted the bioinformatics analysis to identify putative target genes of differently expressed miRNAs, analyze their GO, and categorize them into cancer-related biological processes including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and cell proliferation. E2F2, a member of E2F transcription factor family, was identified as the target gene of hsa-miR-1915 and hsa-miR-2861. Interestingly, E2F2 has either positive or negative effects on tumor development depending on the experimental contexts. Chen and Wells’s studies indicated that E2F2 has strong oncogenic capacity in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and promotes cell cycle progression and malignant transformation.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> However, Opavsky et al. demonstrated that E2F2 inactivation in T-cells accelerated lymphomagenesis in transgenic mice expressing Myc.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Our data will provide useful clues to further explore the roles of E2F2 in the tumorigenesis of NPC. Hsa-miR-34a, a direct transcriptional target of p53, is downregulated in many types of cancers and acts as a tumor suppressor.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> It has been revealed that the hypofractionated radiotherapy increased the expression of p53/miR-34a and enhanced the apoptosis in NPC cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>In silico and experimental studies have validated that Notch1 is a direct and functional target of miR-34a.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> Notch1 signaling was aberrantly activated in NPC and its overexpression promoted NPC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> It is, therefore, hypothesized that p53/miRNA-34a/Notch1 signaling may play a critical role in EGCG-mediated inhibitory effect on CNE2 cells. Among those miRNAs upregulated by EGCG, some of their target genes are also known to have oncogenic activity, for example, Src, FGFR1, Met, and PDGFRA. These data suggested that the anti-cancerogenic activity of EGCG may be derived from the effects on the expression of miRNAs targeting important regulators of cell survival.\nIn the view of pathway analysis, the genes targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs are most significantly associated with cancer-related signal transduction involved in regulating cell survival, cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion, and migration. The pathway most preferentially targeted by EGCG-specific miRNAs is MAPK signaling pathway. MAPK pathway is crucial in numerous stimulated cellular processes, and its dysregulation was involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of NPC.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> EGCG exhibited strong inhibition on MAPKs activities in ras-transformed fibroblasts and lung cancer cells, without affecting the kinases in the normal cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u> Wnt signaling pathway, specifically enriched with target genes, controls a wide variety of cellular processes such as determination of cell fate, proliferation, migration, and polarity.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Although the roles of the Wnt signaling in NPC have not been fully explored, there is abundant evidence that the aberrant expression of Wnt pathway components, including CKIIβ, β-catenin, and CREB-binding protein, was associated with NPC development and progression.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> EGCG has been shown to suppress Wnt signaling in colon cancer and breast cancer cells by promoting β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation.通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31]</u> Our data suggested that MAPK and Wnt signaling pathways might play crucial roles in the anticancer activity of EGCG against NPC cells. In addition, pathway analysis revealed that EGCG was involved in the regulation of the lipid and glucose metabolism, including insulin signaling pathway, Type II diabetes mellitus, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and adipocytokine signaling pathway. Extensive investigations have demonstrated that EGCG has positive health effects on a variety of metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia.通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33]</u> However, the molecular mechanisms by which EGCG modulates these metabolic processes remain largely unknown. Nevertheless, the view of pathway analysis in the present study provides trustworthy data to elucidate the global impact of EGCG-specific miRNAs on NPC cells.\nOverall, we demonstrated that EGCG induces considerable miRNA changes in CNE2 cells. Putative targets and signaling pathways regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs were further elucidated. The characterization of EGCG-specific miRNA changes will provide mechanistic insight into the cellular responses and antitumor activity mediated by EGCG. Targeting miRNAs could be a novel strategy for cancer prevention and treatment. Further studies on the validation of putative miRNA targets and in vivo experiments are under consideration.\nThe present study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81502411)</u>, Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2014A020212560)</u>, and PhD Start-up Fund of Guangdong Medical University 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. B2014001)</u>.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "EGCG: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate; miRNAs: microRNAs.", "content": "【0】Green tea (Camellia sinensis) is widely consumed for its characteristic flavor and potential health benefits.

The cancer preventive and inhibitory effects of EGCG have been extensively demonstrated in different tumor cell lines and animal models, and its mechanisms are involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and anti-oxidant activity.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood.\nNPC is one of the most common malignancies prevalent in South China and Southeast Asia.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u> The development of NPC involves cumulative genetic and epigenetic changes, among which oncogene activation and anti-oncogene inactivation play critical roles. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by binding to 3’-untranslated regions of their target miRNAs. The dysregulation of miRNAs has been closely correlated with the initiation and progression of various cancers, including NPC.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> Moreover, there is evidence that the expression pattern of miRNAs in cancer cells was obviously influenced by anticancer agents, suggesting that some tumor-specific miRNAs may serve as the targets for cancer therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>\nEGCG has been shown to inhibit proliferation, clonogenicity, and invasiveness of NPC cells in vivo and in vitro.通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u> It remains to be determined whether the cellular changes in NPC cells treated with EGCG are associated with the alternations in miRNA expression. Here, we used miRNA microarray analysis to characterize the effects of EGCG on miRNA expression profiles in CNE2 cells. The mRNA targets of the miRNAs regulated by EGCG may contribute to the identification of new molecular mechanisms for the action of EGCG in NPC.\nEGCG (≥95%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and stored at −20°C. CNE2 cells, a poorly differentiated NPC cell line, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).\nCNE2 cells were treated with 20 μmol/L or 40 μmol/L of EGCG dissolved in DMSO (final concentration in culture media, 0.1%) for 24 h. DMSO was also added to culture media as a vehicle control. Total RNA was isolated using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The miRNA expression profiles were determined at the Bioassay Laboratory of CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China) using Agilent Human miRNA 8*60K Microarray Release 16.0 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).\nTo verify the results obtained from the microarray analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out to detect the expression levels of differentially expressed miRNAs. Total RNA from cells was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then was subjected to reverse transcription reaction to synthesize cDNA using the MMLV reverse transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). qRT-PCR was performed with FS Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche, Foster City, CA, USA) in the ABI PRISM 7500 System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacture’s protocol. The bulge-loop miRNA qRT-PCR primer sets (one reverse transcription primer and a pair of quantitative PCR primers for each set) were designed and synthesized by RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). U6 small nuclear RNA was used as an endogenous control. The fold change of miRNA in log 2 scale was calculated by the equation 2−ΔΔCt, where ΔCt = CtmiRNA – CtU6 and ΔΔCt = ΔCttreated samples −ΔCtuntreated controls. Comparisons between groups were done by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s post hoc corrections for multiple comparisons. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). P < 0.05 was considered significant differences.\nThe differentially expressed miRNAs that either increased or decreased by more than 2-fold following EGCG treatment were chosen for target prediction in online databases. Two independent searches were performed using TargetScan 6.2 删除6：<u></u> and miRDB 删除6：<u></u>, and the results were compared. A common set of presumptive targets of each significant miRNA was identified and collected in a target pool. To determine the functions of the predicted target genes, the gene ontology (GO) of the target pool was analyzed using CapitalBio Molecule Annotation System 3.0 通用删除1(英):<u>(MAS, http://bioinfo.capitalbio.com/mas3/)</u>. This database enables the assignment of predicted target genes to functional groups based on biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. The pathways modified by EGCG through putative targets of specific miRNAs were further analyzed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. The significant GO terms and KEGG pathways were determined by P and Q < 0.001.\nPrevious studies have shown that EGCG inhibited the proliferation of CNE2 cells in time- and dose-dependent manners.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> As the concentration increased and action time was prolonged, EGCG also induced apoptosis in CNE2 cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> To examine whether miRNAs could be involved in cellular responses to EGCG treatment, we employed miRNA microarray analysis to compare EGCG-treated and untreated cells. The doses of EGCG used in this experiment were chosen by CCK-8 assay to evaluate dose-dependent cell viability (data not shown). Among the 1205 human miRNAs in the microarray, a total of 205 miRNAs (17.0%) exhibited differential expression between the EGCG-treated and untreated cells 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u>. We further identified the miRNAs that experienced >2-fold changes in expression. As shown in Table 1, 16 of the 205 miRNAs (7.8%) exhibited >2-fold expression changes in both 20 μmol/L and 40 μmol/L EGCG-treated groups compared with the control, and another 16 miRNAs (7.8%) showed >2-fold changes only in the 40 μmol/L EGCG-treated group. Among 32 miRNAs (>2-fold changes in 40 μmol/L EGCG-treated group), 29 miRNAs were upregulated and 1 miRNA was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1b and Table 2]</u>. One miRNA (hsa-miR-4281) was shown to be upregulated at similar levels in 20 μmol/L and 40 μmol/L EGCG-treated cells. Interestingly, although the expression of hsa-miR-29b-1-5p was upregulated at both concentrations of EGCG treatment, the fold change was decreased in the higher concentration group (4.82–2.61-fold). These data strongly indicated that EGCG is able to influence the expression of specific miRNAs in CNE2 cells.\nMiRNAs with >2-fold changes in CNE2 cells after EGCG treatment\n删除重复语句：<u>MiRNAs with >2-fold changes in CNE2 cells after EGCG treatment</u>\nEGCG: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate; miRNAs: microRNAs.\nExpression levels of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG\n删除重复语句：<u>Expression levels of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG</u>\nEGCG: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate; miRNAs: microRNAs.\nTo validate the microarray results, we performed qRT-PCR to detect the expression levels of six differentially expressed miRNAs (upregulated: hsa-miR-1246, hsa-miR-1973, hsa-miR-210, hsa-miR-1915, and hsa-miR-34a; downregulated: hsa-miR-205-3p) after EGCG treatment 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>. The relative expression levels of these miRNAs between the EGCG-treated and untreated cells were shown to be comparable to those observed by microarray analysis. Overall, these results confirmed our findings of differential miRNAs expression by microarray.\nThe miRNAs that showed a dose-dependent response to EGCG treatment might be involved to EGCG-mediated anticancer properties. To elucidate the biological functions of EGCG-specific miRNAs, the putative targets of 14 differentially expressed miRNAs which exhibited >2-fold expression changes in a dose-dependent manner were identified using TargetScan and miRDB databases. We identified 1767 targets of EGCG-specific upregulated miRNAs and 648 targets of EGCG-specific downregulated miRNAs (hsa-miR-205-3p was only present in the miRDB database). Subsequently, the functions of these potential targets were determined using GO classification based on gene annotation and summary information. As shown in Table 3, a total of 43, 49, and 52 target genes from EGCG-specific miRNAs were associated with the apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and cell proliferation, respectively.\nFunctional analysis of the predicted targets of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG\n删除重复语句：<u>Functional analysis of the predicted targets of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG</u>\n*Predicted targets of miRNAs only come from miRDB database.

We identified the significantly regulated pathways with both P and Q < 0.001. A total of 66 pathways were statistically enriched by target genes of EGCG-specific miRNAs.\nThe top thirty of the most significant pathways are listed in Table 4. These pathways were primarily involved in tumor development and progression, lipid and glucose metabolism, inflammation, cytoskeleton and gap junction, and calcium signaling. Furthermore, we focused on the cancer-related pathways in KEGG system and observed that these targets were strongly associated with a wide variety of cancer pathways. The ten most significant pathways were mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, focal adhesion, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), Wnt signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, Adherens junction, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, p53 signaling pathway, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction.\nKEGG pathway associating with predicted targets of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG\n删除重复语句：<u>KEGG pathway associating with predicted targets of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG</u>\nEGCG: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate; miRNAs: microRNAs; MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase; CAMs: Cell adhesion molecules; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.\nNumerous miRNAs are known to function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, regulating tumor initiation and progression at all levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The knockdown or re-expression of specific miRNAs could inhibit cell proliferation and transformation, suppress cell invasion and metastasis, and induce drug sensitivity.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Recently, many studies have shown that natural agents, including curcumin, resveratrol, EGCG, etc. could cause the alterations of specific miRNAs expression, which may play critical roles in their chemoprotective and therapeutic effects against tumors.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> It is reasonable to believe that a specific or a cluster of miRNAs in NPC cells may serve as the targets for the anticancer agents. To date, the global impact of EGCG on the expression of miRNAs in NPC cells has seldomly been reported.\nIn the present study, we investigated the effects of EGCG on miRNA expression profiles in CNE2 cells using microarray analysis. Among the 1205 human miRNAs in the microarray, 16 miRNAs in the 20 μmol/L EGCG-treated group and 32 miRNAs in the 40 μmol/L EGCG-treated group exhibited >2-fold expression changes compared with the control. Most of these miRNAs responded to EGCG in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, the microarray results showed that the number of upregulated miRNAs was considerably higher than the number of downregulated miRNAs, indicating that the EGCG-mediated effects on CNE2 cells were associated more with miRNA upregulation. This result was contradicted to the EGCG-treated liver cancer HepG2 cells, in which the number of upregulated miRNAs was lower than that of downregulated miRNAs.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u> There was no overlap between the differentially expressed miRNAs in response to EGCG in HepG2 cells and those in CNE2 cells, suggesting that there may be different mechanisms of action in NPC, depending on differences in cellular contexts.\nHsa-miR-1246, the most significantly upregulated miRNA observed in the present study, was dramatically decreased in cervical cancer tissues and negatively correlated with clinical stage and HPV16E6-infected status.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> However, Piepoli et al. showed that the relative expression of miR-1246 was significantly higher in colorectal cancer compared with matched adjacent normal tissues.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> These data suggested a contradictory role of miR-1246 in different cancers with various cellular contexts. Hsa-miR-210 is one of the hypoxia-regulated miRNAs and functions as a tumor suppressor in regulating tumor cell growth, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> In NPC CNE cells, the overexpression of miR-210 disturbed mitotic progression and reduced tumor formation through targeting a group of mitosis-related genes.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Similar to the results in CNE2 cells, EGCG could increase the level of miR-210 in human and mouse lung cancer cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Hsa-miR-205-3p, which was downregulated to the greatest extent in the present study, was reported to be significantly upregulated in the tissues and serum of non- small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients compared with the control groups, indicating that miR-205-3p may be a valuable biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of NSCLC patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Overall, the modification of miRNA expression profiles may imply the potential roles of miRNAs in the anticancer effects of EGCG on NPC.\nMiRNAs function by engaging with their target miRNAs, resulting in either the degradation or the inhibition of transcription. A single miRNA can regulate the expression of multiple target miRNAs, and conversely, a single target miRNA may be modulated by several miRNAs. To assess the global impact of these EGCG-specific miRNAs, we conducted the bioinformatics analysis to identify putative target genes of differently expressed miRNAs, analyze their GO, and categorize them into cancer-related biological processes including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and cell proliferation. E2F2, a member of E2F transcription factor family, was identified as the target gene of hsa-miR-1915 and hsa-miR-2861. Interestingly, E2F2 has either positive or negative effects on tumor development depending on the experimental contexts.

We identified 1767 targets of EGCG-specific upregulated miRNAs and 648 targets of EGCG-specific downregulated miRNAs (hsa-miR-205-3p was only present in the miRDB database). Subsequently, the functions of these potential targets were determined using GO classification based on gene annotation and summary information. As shown in Table 3, a total of 43, 49, and 52 target genes from EGCG-specific miRNAs were associated with the apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and cell proliferation, respectively.\nFunctional analysis of the predicted targets of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG\n删除重复语句：<u>Functional analysis of the predicted targets of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG</u>\n*Predicted targets of miRNAs only come from miRDB database. EGCG: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate; miRNAs: microRNAs; –: Not applicable.\nKEGG pathway analysis was used to illustrate all available pathways containing these potential genes targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs. We identified the significantly regulated pathways with both P and Q < 0.001. A total of 66 pathways were statistically enriched by target genes of EGCG-specific miRNAs.\nThe top thirty of the most significant pathways are listed in Table 4. These pathways were primarily involved in tumor development and progression, lipid and glucose metabolism, inflammation, cytoskeleton and gap junction, and calcium signaling. Furthermore, we focused on the cancer-related pathways in KEGG system and observed that these targets were strongly associated with a wide variety of cancer pathways. The ten most significant pathways were mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, focal adhesion, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), Wnt signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, Adherens junction, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, p53 signaling pathway, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction.\nKEGG pathway associating with predicted targets of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG\n删除重复语句：<u>KEGG pathway associating with predicted targets of miRNAs exhibiting >2-fold changes in response to both concentrations of EGCG</u>\nEGCG: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate; miRNAs: microRNAs; MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase; CAMs: Cell adhesion molecules; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.\nNumerous miRNAs are known to function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, regulating tumor initiation and progression at all levels.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The knockdown or re-expression of specific miRNAs could inhibit cell proliferation and transformation, suppress cell invasion and metastasis, and induce drug sensitivity.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Recently, many studies have shown that natural agents, including curcumin, resveratrol, EGCG, etc. could cause the alterations of specific miRNAs expression, which may play critical roles in their chemoprotective and therapeutic effects against tumors.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> It is reasonable to believe that a specific or a cluster of miRNAs in NPC cells may serve as the targets for the anticancer agents. To date, the global impact of EGCG on the expression of miRNAs in NPC cells has seldomly been reported.\nIn the present study, we investigated the effects of EGCG on miRNA expression profiles in CNE2 cells using microarray analysis. Among the 1205 human miRNAs in the microarray, 16 miRNAs in the 20 μmol/L EGCG-treated group and 32 miRNAs in the 40 μmol/L EGCG-treated group exhibited >2-fold expression changes compared with the control. Most of these miRNAs responded to EGCG in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, the microarray results showed that the number of upregulated miRNAs was considerably higher than the number of downregulated miRNAs, indicating that the EGCG-mediated effects on CNE2 cells were associated more with miRNA upregulation. This result was contradicted to the EGCG-treated liver cancer HepG2 cells, in which the number of upregulated miRNAs was lower than that of downregulated miRNAs.通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u> There was no overlap between the differentially expressed miRNAs in response to EGCG in HepG2 cells and those in CNE2 cells, suggesting that there may be different mechanisms of action in NPC, depending on differences in cellular contexts.\nHsa-miR-1246, the most significantly upregulated miRNA observed in the present study, was dramatically decreased in cervical cancer tissues and negatively correlated with clinical stage and HPV16E6-infected status.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> However, Piepoli et al. showed that the relative expression of miR-1246 was significantly higher in colorectal cancer compared with matched adjacent normal tissues.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> These data suggested a contradictory role of miR-1246 in different cancers with various cellular contexts. Hsa-miR-210 is one of the hypoxia-regulated miRNAs and functions as a tumor suppressor in regulating tumor cell growth, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> In NPC CNE cells, the overexpression of miR-210 disturbed mitotic progression and reduced tumor formation through targeting a group of mitosis-related genes.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Similar to the results in CNE2 cells, EGCG could increase the level of miR-210 in human and mouse lung cancer cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Hsa-miR-205-3p, which was downregulated to the greatest extent in the present study, was reported to be significantly upregulated in the tissues and serum of non- small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients compared with the control groups, indicating that miR-205-3p may be a valuable biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of NSCLC patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> Overall, the modification of miRNA expression profiles may imply the potential roles of miRNAs in the anticancer effects of EGCG on NPC.\nMiRNAs function by engaging with their target miRNAs, resulting in either the degradation or the inhibition of transcription. A single miRNA can regulate the expression of multiple target miRNAs, and conversely, a single target miRNA may be modulated by several miRNAs. To assess the global impact of these EGCG-specific miRNAs, we conducted the bioinformatics analysis to identify putative target genes of differently expressed miRNAs, analyze their GO, and categorize them into cancer-related biological processes including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and cell proliferation. E2F2, a member of E2F transcription factor family, was identified as the target gene of hsa-miR-1915 and hsa-miR-2861. Interestingly, E2F2 has either positive or negative effects on tumor development depending on the experimental contexts. Chen and Wells’s studies indicated that E2F2 has strong oncogenic capacity in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and promotes cell cycle progression and malignant transformation.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> However, Opavsky et al. demonstrated that E2F2 inactivation in T-cells accelerated lymphomagenesis in transgenic mice expressing Myc.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> Our data will provide useful clues to further explore the roles of E2F2 in the tumorigenesis of NPC. Hsa-miR-34a, a direct transcriptional target of p53, is downregulated in many types of cancers and acts as a tumor suppressor.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> It has been revealed that the hypofractionated radiotherapy increased the expression of p53/miR-34a and enhanced the apoptosis in NPC cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>In silico and experimental studies have validated that Notch1 is a direct and functional target of miR-34a.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> Notch1 signaling was aberrantly activated in NPC and its overexpression promoted NPC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> It is, therefore, hypothesized that p53/miRNA-34a/Notch1 signaling may play a critical role in EGCG-mediated inhibitory effect on CNE2 cells. Among those miRNAs upregulated by EGCG, some of their target genes are also known to have oncogenic activity, for example, Src, FGFR1, Met, and PDGFRA. These data suggested that the anti-cancerogenic activity of EGCG may be derived from the effects on the expression of miRNAs targeting important regulators of cell survival.\nIn the view of pathway analysis, the genes targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs are most significantly associated with cancer-related signal transduction involved in regulating cell survival, cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion, and migration. The pathway most preferentially targeted by EGCG-specific miRNAs is MAPK signaling pathway. MAPK pathway is crucial in numerous stimulated cellular processes, and its dysregulation was involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of NPC.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> EGCG exhibited strong inhibition on MAPKs activities in ras-transformed fibroblasts and lung cancer cells, without affecting the kinases in the normal cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u> Wnt signaling pathway, specifically enriched with target genes, controls a wide variety of cellular processes such as determination of cell fate, proliferation, migration, and polarity.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Although the roles of the Wnt signaling in NPC have not been fully explored, there is abundant evidence that the aberrant expression of Wnt pathway components, including CKIIβ, β-catenin, and CREB-binding protein, was associated with NPC development and progression.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> EGCG has been shown to suppress Wnt signaling in colon cancer and breast cancer cells by promoting β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation.通用删除6(英):<u>[30,31]</u> Our data suggested that MAPK and Wnt signaling pathways might play crucial roles in the anticancer activity of EGCG against NPC cells. In addition, pathway analysis revealed that EGCG was involved in the regulation of the lipid and glucose metabolism, including insulin signaling pathway, Type II diabetes mellitus, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and adipocytokine signaling pathway. Extensive investigations have demonstrated that EGCG has positive health effects on a variety of metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia.通用删除6(英):<u>[32,33]</u> However, the molecular mechanisms by which EGCG modulates these metabolic processes remain largely unknown. Nevertheless, the view of pathway analysis in the present study provides trustworthy data to elucidate the global impact of EGCG-specific miRNAs on NPC cells.\nOverall, we demonstrated that EGCG induces considerable miRNA changes in CNE2 cells. Putative targets and signaling pathways regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs were further elucidated. The characterization of EGCG-specific miRNA changes will provide mechanistic insight into the cellular responses and antitumor activity mediated by EGCG. Targeting miRNAs could be a novel strategy for cancer prevention and treatment. Further studies on the validation of putative miRNA targets and in vivo experiments are under consideration.\nThe present study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81502411)</u>, Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 2014A020212560)</u>, and PhD Start-up Fund of Guangdong Medical University 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. B2014001)</u>.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u>", "index": 19382, "show": true, "start": 19369, "end": 19637, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:18:33", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:19:36", "cost": 63.787}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:27", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:19:36", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:18:32"}

Studies have shown that the mortality of patients with sepsis in the ICU is 10-40%.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> Sepsis affects at least 3 million people worldwide each year. Severe sepsis refers to patients with sepsis associated with organ dysfunction, hypotension, poor tissue perfusion and other conditions.\nIn 2016, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was listed as the diagnostic criterion for sepsis (Sepsis 3.0).通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> As the most commonly used critical disease scoring system in clinical practice, numerous large retrospective studies have demonstrated that the SOFA scoring system is effective in evaluating the prognosis of patients with sepsis.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5,6]</u>\nPrevious studies have also shown that patient age, SOFA score, and APACHE score are independent risk factors for prognosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8,9]</u> It has also been demonstrated that change in the difference between the SOFA scores at two time points predicts the 28-day prognosis of patients with sepsis.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Previous studies utilizing latent growth mixture modeling have investigated the impact of changes in SOFA score on the development of sepsis into persistent critical illness. The present study was based on a large critical illness database to achieve population clustering through the different laws of the longitudinal development of SOFA. This analysis was aimed at a more accurate identification of patients with sepsis at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes. Longitudinal change trajectory is used to describe the process of continuous and dynamic changes in the development of a certain object over time. This trajectory has been widely used in medicine, psychology, and other related fields.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> In 1999, Nagin.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> supported the use of group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) for the analysis of longitudinal data. As a special application of the finite mixed model, this method is used to analyze the similarity of certain behaviors or results over time or age, and subsequently divide individual subjects into groups.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> This model is used to explore the presence of heterogeneity in the whole population.\nIn this study, patients with sepsis in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, who had a record of SOFA scores at 72 h, were included as the research population. The trajectory model from GBTM was used to construct a traditional univariate trajectory model for the 72-h SOFA score. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to explore the relationship between each trajectory and the risk of adverse outcomes. This study aimed to determine the relationship between SOFA score trajectory and poor prognosis in patients with sepsis in the ICU.\nThe MIMIC-IV database通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> is an updated version of MIMIC-III.

Vital signs included the heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MBP), body temperature, and pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2). The first laboratory test parameters of patients with sepsis collected within 24 h after admission to the ICU were partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), white blood cell count (WBC), bicarbonate, chloride, hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine ratio (BCR), international normalized ratio (INR), red cell distribution width (RDW), anion gap, hemoglobin, and platelets. Data on the length of stay in the hospital and ICU were also extracted.\nThe primary endpoint was the survival status on days 7 and 28 in the hospital and ICU. The secondary endpoint was the occurrence of adverse prognostic events, such as septic shock and acute respiratory failure (ARF).\nGBTM is mainly used to track the data analysis of a heterogeneous population. The principle of this process is to explore the subgroups with different development trajectories in the population, and subsequently analyze the developmental trend of different subgroups.

Cumulative incidence function curves of different outcomes were plotted and compared using the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine significant differences in terms of survival status and adverse events following stratification of patients according to their different SOFA score trajectories.\nThree multivariate models were used to evaluate the prognostic value of the SOFA score trajectory for each study endpoint. In model I, covariates were only adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, insurance, and marital status. In model II, covariates of vital signs were only adjusted for model I plus SBP, DBP, MBP, respiratory rate, temperature, SPO2, PaCO2, and PaO2. In model III, covariates of laboratory parameters were adjusted for model II plus glucose, RRT, mechanical ventilation, administration of glucocorticoids, CCI, WBC, bicarbonate, chloride, hematocrit, BCR, INR, RDW, anion gap, hemoglobin, and platelets. The results were expressed as the hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).\nAll statistical analyses were performed with R software  and Stata . P-values <0.05 (two-sided) denoted statistically significant differences.\nA total of 16,743 patients with sepsis were included in the study.

Patients in group 1 exhibited the lowest SOFA score, showing a trend of initial increase, followed by reduction and subsequent increase within 72 h. Patients in group 2 had a higher SOFA score than those in group 1, showing a fluctuating trend of initial increase and subsequent stabilization. Patients in group 3 had SOFA scores ranging between those recorded in groups 1 and 2, showing an initial increase, followed by a sharp decline within 72 h, and finally continuing to rise.

The population included 9575 men (57.2%) and 7168 women (42.8%). The majority of patients was White (65.9%) and married (42.9%), and had received mechanical ventilation therapy (95.9%). The in-hospital mortality rates on days 7 and 28 were 6.0% (n = 934) and 17.6% (n = 2962), respectively. The mortality rates among patients in the ICU were 8.1% (n = 1372) and 19.1% (n = 3202), respectively. The incidence rates of septic shock and ARF were 11.5% (n = 1932) and 42.8% (n = 7178), respectively.\nA univariate censored normal (CNORM) trajectory model was fitted according to the 72-h SOFA score level of the longitudinal cohort population. The SOFA scores of patients in groups 1-5 were gradually increased, with overlapping SOFA trajectories for groups 2 and 3 at the time of admission 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1]</u>.

The coefficients of cubic functions in the five groups are shown in Supplementary Table S1.\nThe baseline characteristics of patients stratified based on the five trajectory groups are shown in Table 2. Compared with group 1, higher SOFA scores of patients in the trajectory groups 2-5 were linked to a greater proportion of males and more frequent use of RRT and mechanical ventilation. Overall, there were statistically significant differences in the baseline characteristics of patients across the five trajectory groups (P < 0.05).\nDescriptive characteristics of overall participants and by SOFA trajectory.\n删除重复语句：<u>Descriptive characteristics of overall participants and by SOFA trajectory.</u>\nContinuous data are presented as median (interquartile range), whereas categorical data are presented as n (%).\nBCR: Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine ratio; CCI: Charlson Comorbidity Index; DBP: Diastolic blood pressure; INR: International normalized ratio; MBP: Mean arterial pressure; PaCO2: Artial pressure of carbon dioxide; RRT: Renal replacement therapy; RDW: Red cell distribution width; SPO2: Oxygen saturation; SBP: Systolic blood pressure; SOFA: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment; WBC: White cell count.\nThe cumulative risk curve of adverse outcome according to the SOFA score of patients with sepsis is shown in Figure 3. For the 7- and 28-day survival outcomes, the risk curve of all trajectory groups exhibited a clear trend of gradual increase. In group 5, the high SOFA score group was associated with the highest cumulative risk. In group 1, the low SOFA score group was linked to the lowest cumulative risk. A statistically significant difference was found in the cumulative death risk for patients from all trajectory groups (P<0.001). For the outcome of septic shock, the risk curve of each trajectory group increased gradually from the third day after admission. The cumulative risks of groups 2-5 were gradually increased, while that of group 1 remained at a relatively low level. There were statistically significant differences in the cumulative risk of septic shock for patients in the trajectory groups (P<0.001). For the ARF outcome, the cumulative risk of all trajectory groups showed a similar increasing trend. Statistically significant differences were found in the cumulative risk of ARF among the patients classified in the trajectory groups (P<0.001).\nIn this study, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between SOFA trajectory and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. When fitting the model, group 1 was first used as the reference group to fit the univariate Cox model of the SOFA trajectory variables. Thereafter, the different covariables at baseline were adjusted in four different models. The results are shown in Table 3. In the univariate analysis, for the outcome of 7-day in-hospital mortality and using trajectory 1 as the reference group, the HR (95% CI) values for groups 2-5 were 1.893 (1.561-2.296), 1.803 (1.449-2.242), 3.786 (3.113-4.603), and 5.478 (4.387-6.841), respectively. The results showed that these groups were risk factors for 7-day in-hospital mortality (P < 0.001). After adjusting the multivariate model of different covariates, groups 2-5 demonstrated a similar survival status to that observed on day 7. The mortality were independently correlated with SOFA trajectory (P < 0.001).

Similarly, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses using trajectory group 1 as a reference also showed that groups 2-5 continued to be independently correlated with 28-day mortality (P < 0.001). Finally, univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between the occurrence of septic shock and the longitudinal trajectory of the SOFA score. The analysis showed that, using group 1 as the reference group, the HR (95% CI) values for groups 2-5 were 2.353 (2.006-2.760), 3.307 (2.813-3.888), 3.752 (3.195-4.407), and 4.649 (3.884-5.563), respectively. These results showed that these groups were independent risk factors. Adjustment for different covariates demonstrated that groups 2-5 continued to be independently related to the occurrence of septic shock and ARF (P < 0.001). Patients in group 5 were at the highest risk for septic shock and ARF (P < 0.001).\nWe selected the following as research variables for the stratified subgroup analysis: age, sex, use of RRT, use of mechanical ventilation, and administration of glucocorticoid therapy. In the age-stratified analysis, patients with sepsis aged <65 years were at a significantly higher risk of death according to the SOFA trajectory for the survival status in the hospital and ICU compared with those aged ≥65 years (P < 0.05). For the 28-day mortality in the ICU, patients who did not receive mechanical ventilation were at a significantly higher risk of death according to the SOFA trajectory compared with those who received mechanical ventilation. For the outcome of ARF, patients with sepsis aged <65 years were at a significantly higher risk of death according to the SOFA trajectory compared with those aged ≥65 years (P = 0.008). The results of the subgroup analysis are shown in detail in Figure 4.\nSepsis remains the leading cause of death in critically ill patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Early observation and monitoring of changes in the patient’s condition and active use of effective treatments are of great importance to the prognosis. This type of practice can assist in reducing mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> The SOFA score, proposed by the European Society of Critical Care Medicine,通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> is an objective system utilized to evaluate the severity of organ dysfunction or failure in patients with sepsis. This score is one of the necessary items for the diagnosis of patients with sepsis.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> Thus, dynamic monitoring of the change trajectory of the SOFA score in patients with sepsis is crucial.\nIn this study, we grouped patients with sepsis into trajectory groups according to their SOFA scores based on the univariate GBTM. GBTM was used to monitor changes in the SOFA score and determine the disease development trajectory in patients with sepsis. According to the fitting results of the model, we divided the SOFA scores of patients with sepsis into five trajectory groups. In the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, following analysis of adjusted and unadjusted covariates, a more uniform pattern was evident. Trajectory groups with higher SOFA scores were associated with an increased risk for various adverse outcomes. The SOFA score consists of six parts: breathing, coagulation, liver, circulation, nerves, and kidneys. The score for each of these parts ranges from 0 (no organ dysfunction) to 4 (severe organ dysfunction) points. The scores for each part are added, and the final total score 通用删除7(英):<u>(0-24)</u> is used to reflect the function of multiple organs throughout the body.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,27]</u>\nInitially, the SOFA score of group 1 ranged 0-4 points and showed a downward trend after 20 h. These results indicated limited organ damage and gradual improvement. Higher SOFA scores reflected greater initial damage to organ function in patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> Patients in groups 2-5 showed an upward trend in the early stage, reflecting the increase in organ damage and the number of damaged organs, indicating poor prognosis. We observed that the SOFA score of group 3 exhibited a relatively obvious downward trend; nevertheless, it remained higher than that observed for group 2. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that patients in group 3 were at lower risk of in-hospital death than those in group 2. However, the risk of death and septic shock in the ICU and the risk of ARF in this group remained higher than those noted in group 2.\nThe decrease in SOFA score reflected the effectiveness of early treatment in patients with sepsis. However, following a decrease to a certain level, it showed a trend toward stabilization. Possible reasons for this observation include inadequate control of the infection, disease recurrence, or damage to an organ that could not be promptly corrected.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Therefore, although patients in group 3 exhibited a significant downward trend, their prognosis remained relatively poor. A randomized controlled trial showed that changes in the SOFA score could reliably reflect the mortality of patients with sepsis.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> Another prospective cohort study showed that the SOFA score in the first few days of ICU admission was a good indicator of prognosis, while an increase in this score within the first 48 h of ICU admission could effectively predict death.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>\nThe present study was based on a GBTM analysis of the longitudinal trajectory changes in the SOFA scores of patients with sepsis. The results showed that groups 2-5 were independent risk factors for the occurrence of various adverse outcomes; specifically, higher SOFA scores were associated with poor prognosis in patients with sepsis. The severity of disease in patients with sepsis and related influencing factors can be identified by exploring the change trajectory in the SOFA score of patients with sepsis within 72 h after admission, analyzing the possible trajectory subgroup types, and determining the prognosis of different trajectory subgroups. This provides a basis and guidance to clinicians for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with sepsis.\nWe further performed a subgroup analysis based on covariates, such as age, sex, RRT, mechanical ventilation, and administration of glucocorticoids. Age remained a predictor of mortality and ARF incidence. The mortality of patients aged <65 years in each group of SOFA score was significantly higher than that of patients aged ≥65 years. Previous studies suggested that the risk of sepsis had a bimodal distribution: higher in infants; lower in young individuals; and higher in those aged >60 years.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> Our findings are not consistent with that observation. Older patients have more complications due to diabetes, hypertension,通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> aging of the immune通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> and neuroendocrine systems,通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> and stress. In addition, the compensatory ability of older patients to external stimuli (e.g. trauma通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> and inflammation通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>) is weaker than that of young individuals. For example, in the case of early sepsis in patients with renal dysfunction due to microcirculation or severe inflammation, younger patients demonstrated greater compensatory capacity, and the urine output may have not been markedly reduced.通用删除6(英):<u>[20,37,38]</u> However, due to their weak compensatory ability, the level of urine output in elderly patients was significantly decreased. In such cases, the scores of kidney function in older patients were higher than those in recorded in younger patients; however, patients in both groups suffered kidney damage.\nThe use of mechanical ventilation as a predictor of 28-day mortality通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> was also investigated. In all trajectory groups, the mortality rate among patients who did not receive mechanical ventilation was significantly higher than that noted in patients who received mechanical ventilation. Clinically, patients with sepsis are prone to complications with ARDS or severe lung inflammation.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u> Previous studies have revealed that timely treatment with a ventilator can relieve tissue hypoxia, lessen lung work, and reduce the occurrence of complications. This approach prolongs the life of patients and improves their survival rate in later stages.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>\nThis study is aiming to determine the relationship between the SOFA score trajectory and poor prognosis in patients with sepsis, which involves a GBTM analysis of data obtained from the MIMIC-IV database. We determined the SOFA score trajectory, admission characteristics, and results of five different groups of patients with sepsis. This study used GBTM to determine the different trajectory classifications of the SOFA scores of ICU patients with sepsis, cluster the populations to identify the trajectory populations at high risk of adverse outcomes, and identify the characteristic trajectories of poor SOFA development trends. The present evidence provides a reference basis for clinicians to pay attention to nursing care and implement early intervention measures for key populations in clinical practice.\nOur research also had some limitations. First, the present study was an observational investigation that only shows statistical associations with mortality and adverse outcomes.\nSecond, because this study only included patients in the USA, the relevance of extrapolating these results to ICU patients in other countries is uncertain.Finally, this was a retrospective observational study. Although the quality of the MIMIC-IV database is very high, data loss and input errors exist. Therefore, further studies are warranted to verify these results.\nWe used GBTM to longitudinally cluster SOFA score data of patients with sepsis. We found that higher SOFA scores were linked to greater risk of poor prognosis. The present findings may identify potential risks for various health outcomes in different patient groups, as well as guide future interventions with research and clinical application value.\nSupplementary information", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "删除2：(n = 5503, 32.8%), group 2 删除2：(n = 5004, 30.0%), group 3 删除2：(n = 2947, 17.6%), group 4 删除2：(n = 2342, 14.0%) ", "content": "【0】Sepsis is particularly common in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is a major cause of disability and death in critically ill patients. Studies have shown that the mortality of patients with sepsis in the ICU is 10-40%.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> Sepsis affects at least 3 million people worldwide each year. Severe sepsis refers to patients with sepsis associated with organ dysfunction, hypotension, poor tissue perfusion and other conditions.\nIn 2016, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was listed as the diagnostic criterion for sepsis (Sepsis 3.0).通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> As the most commonly used critical disease scoring system in clinical practice, numerous large retrospective studies have demonstrated that the SOFA scoring system is effective in evaluating the prognosis of patients with sepsis.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5,6]</u>\nPrevious studies have also shown that patient age, SOFA score, and APACHE score are independent risk factors for prognosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8,9]</u> It has also been demonstrated that change in the difference between the SOFA scores at two time points predicts the 28-day prognosis of patients with sepsis.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Previous studies utilizing latent growth mixture modeling have investigated the impact of changes in SOFA score on the development of sepsis into persistent critical illness. The present study was based on a large critical illness database to achieve population clustering through the different laws of the longitudinal development of SOFA. This analysis was aimed at a more accurate identification of patients with sepsis at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes. Longitudinal change trajectory is used to describe the process of continuous and dynamic changes in the development of a certain object over time. This trajectory has been widely used in medicine, psychology, and other related fields.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> In 1999, Nagin.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> supported the use of group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) for the analysis of longitudinal data. As a special application of the finite mixed model, this method is used to analyze the similarity of certain behaviors or results over time or age, and subsequently divide individual subjects into groups.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> This model is used to explore the presence of heterogeneity in the whole population.\nIn this study, patients with sepsis in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, who had a record of SOFA scores at 72 h, were included as the research population. The trajectory model from GBTM was used to construct a traditional univariate trajectory model for the 72-h SOFA score. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to explore the relationship between each trajectory and the risk of adverse outcomes. This study aimed to determine the relationship between SOFA score trajectory and poor prognosis in patients with sepsis in the ICU.\nThe MIMIC-IV database通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> is an updated version of MIMIC-III. This database currently contains comprehensive high-quality data of ICU patients at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2008 to 2019.通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u> According to the Sepsis-3 criteria, sepsis is a suspected infection combined with an acute increase in the SOFA score ≥2.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> According to the diagnostic criteria, we included patients aged >18 years, with ICU stay >24 h, and with complete SOFA score records per hour for the first 72 h after admission.\nThe following basic information of the patients with sepsis were extracted: age, sex, race, marital status, insurance status, use of mechanical ventilation, use of renal replacement therapy (RRT), administration of glucocorticoids, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Vital signs included the heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MBP), body temperature, and pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2). The first laboratory test parameters of patients with sepsis collected within 24 h after admission to the ICU were partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), white blood cell count (WBC), bicarbonate, chloride, hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine ratio (BCR), international normalized ratio (INR), red cell distribution width (RDW), anion gap, hemoglobin, and platelets. Data on the length of stay in the hospital and ICU were also extracted.\nThe primary endpoint was the survival status on days 7 and 28 in the hospital and ICU. The secondary endpoint was the occurrence of adverse prognostic events, such as septic shock and acute respiratory failure (ARF).\nGBTM is mainly used to track the data analysis of a heterogeneous population. The principle of this process is to explore the subgroups with different development trajectories in the population, and subsequently analyze the developmental trend of different subgroups. The level and shape of the trajectory are determined by the regression parameters of the model, which are estimated by the maximum likelihood ratio.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18]</u> GBTM can adapt to various data distributions, such as binary logistic regression, Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson, and normal distribution.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>\nIn our study, the fitting basis of SOFA trajectory grouping based on GBTM model is mainly determined by the following indicators:通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Bayesian information criterion (BIC), e.g. BIC values closer to 0 indicate a better fitting effect. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Average post-test grouping probability (Avepp), in which the index reflects the post-test probability of each individual being classified into the corresponding trajectory subgroup, with >0.7 typically used as the acceptance criterion. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Bayesian factor logarithmic value (2log e[B10]), which is approximately equal to twice the difference between the BIC values (2ΔBIC) of the two comparison models. A value >6 indicates that the fitting results of the two models are different, which is acceptable.

Continuous data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile). Categorical variables were described as percentages and compared using the χ2 test. Comparisons between the two groups were performed using Student’s t-test (normal distribution) or the Mann-Whitney U test (non-normal distribution). Cumulative incidence function curves of different outcomes were plotted and compared using the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine significant differences in terms of survival status and adverse events following stratification of patients according to their different SOFA score trajectories.\nThree multivariate models were used to evaluate the prognostic value of the SOFA score trajectory for each study endpoint. In model I, covariates were only adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, insurance, and marital status. In model II, covariates of vital signs were only adjusted for model I plus SBP, DBP, MBP, respiratory rate, temperature, SPO2, PaCO2, and PaO2. In model III, covariates of laboratory parameters were adjusted for model II plus glucose, RRT, mechanical ventilation, administration of glucocorticoids, CCI, WBC, bicarbonate, chloride, hematocrit, BCR, INR, RDW, anion gap, hemoglobin, and platelets. The results were expressed as the hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).\nAll statistical analyses were performed with R software  and Stata . P-values <0.05 (two-sided) denoted statistically significant differences.\nA total of 16,743 patients with sepsis were included in the study. The characteristics of the clinical groups are shown in detail in Table 1. Based on the comprehensive evaluation of model fitting effect, the trajectory grouping for the GBTM analysis of changes in the 72-h SOFA scores in patients with sepsis yielded five groups: group 1 删除2：<u>(n = 5503, 32.8%)</u>, group 2 删除2：<u>(n = 5004, 30.0%)</u>, group 3 删除2：<u>(n = 2947, 17.6%)</u>, group 4 删除2：<u>(n = 2342, 14.0%)</u> and group 5 (n = 947, 5.7%). Patients in group 1 exhibited the lowest SOFA score, showing a trend of initial increase, followed by reduction and subsequent increase within 72 h. Patients in group 2 had a higher SOFA score than those in group 1, showing a fluctuating trend of initial increase and subsequent stabilization. Patients in group 3 had SOFA scores ranging between those recorded in groups 1 and 2, showing an initial increase, followed by a sharp decline within 72 h, and finally continuing to rise. Patients in groups 4 and 5 exhibited relatively high SOFA scores, with similar trends of change.\nFit statistics for different number of trajectory groups.\n删除重复语句：<u>Fit statistics for different number of trajectory groups.</u>\nAIC: Akaike Information Criterion; AvePP: Average post-test grouping probability; BIC: Bayesian information criterion; NA: Not avalible; 2ΔBIC: Twice the difference between the BIC values.\nThe median survival age was 66 years (interquartile range: 54-76 years). The population included 9575 men (57.2%) and 7168 women (42.8%). The majority of patients was White (65.9%) and married (42.9%), and had received mechanical ventilation therapy (95.9%). The in-hospital mortality rates on days 7 and 28 were 6.0% (n = 934) and 17.6% (n = 2962), respectively. The mortality rates among patients in the ICU were 8.1% (n = 1372) and 19.1% (n = 3202), respectively. The incidence rates of septic shock and ARF were 11.5% (n = 1932) and 42.8% (n = 7178), respectively.\nA univariate censored normal (CNORM) trajectory model was fitted according to the 72-h SOFA score level of the longitudinal cohort population. The SOFA scores of patients in groups 1-5 were gradually increased, with overlapping SOFA trajectories for groups 2 and 3 at the time of admission 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1]</u>.

The coefficients of cubic functions in the five groups are shown in Supplementary Table S1.\nThe baseline characteristics of patients stratified based on the five trajectory groups are shown in Table 2. Compared with group 1, higher SOFA scores of patients in the trajectory groups 2-5 were linked to a greater proportion of males and more frequent use of RRT and mechanical ventilation. Overall, there were statistically significant differences in the baseline characteristics of patients across the five trajectory groups (P < 0.05).\nDescriptive characteristics of overall participants and by SOFA trajectory.\n删除重复语句：<u>Descriptive characteristics of overall participants and by SOFA trajectory.</u>\nContinuous data are presented as median (interquartile range), whereas categorical data are presented as n (%).\nBCR: Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine ratio; CCI: Charlson Comorbidity Index; DBP: Diastolic blood pressure; INR: International normalized ratio; MBP: Mean arterial pressure; PaCO2: Artial pressure of carbon dioxide; RRT: Renal replacement therapy; RDW: Red cell distribution width; SPO2: Oxygen saturation; SBP: Systolic blood pressure; SOFA: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment; WBC: White cell count.\nThe cumulative risk curve of adverse outcome according to the SOFA score of patients with sepsis is shown in Figure 3. For the 7- and 28-day survival outcomes, the risk curve of all trajectory groups exhibited a clear trend of gradual increase. In group 5, the high SOFA score group was associated with the highest cumulative risk. In group 1, the low SOFA score group was linked to the lowest cumulative risk. A statistically significant difference was found in the cumulative death risk for patients from all trajectory groups (P<0.001). For the outcome of septic shock, the risk curve of each trajectory group increased gradually from the third day after admission. The cumulative risks of groups 2-5 were gradually increased, while that of group 1 remained at a relatively low level. There were statistically significant differences in the cumulative risk of septic shock for patients in the trajectory groups (P<0.001). For the ARF outcome, the cumulative risk of all trajectory groups showed a similar increasing trend. Statistically significant differences were found in the cumulative risk of ARF among the patients classified in the trajectory groups (P<0.001).\nIn this study, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between SOFA trajectory and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. When fitting the model, group 1 was first used as the reference group to fit the univariate Cox model of the SOFA trajectory variables. Thereafter, the different covariables at baseline were adjusted in four different models. The results are shown in Table 3. In the univariate analysis, for the outcome of 7-day in-hospital mortality and using trajectory 1 as the reference group, the HR (95% CI) values for groups 2-5 were 1.893 (1.561-2.296), 1.803 (1.449-2.242), 3.786 (3.113-4.603), and 5.478 (4.387-6.841), respectively. The results showed that these groups were risk factors for 7-day in-hospital mortality (P < 0.001). After adjusting the multivariate model of different covariates, groups 2-5 demonstrated a similar survival status to that observed on day 7. The mortality were independently correlated with SOFA trajectory (P < 0.001).

Similarly, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses using trajectory group 1 as a reference also showed that groups 2-5 continued to be independently correlated with 28-day mortality (P < 0.001). Finally, univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between the occurrence of septic shock and the longitudinal trajectory of the SOFA score. The analysis showed that, using group 1 as the reference group, the HR (95% CI) values for groups 2-5 were 2.353 (2.006-2.760), 3.307 (2.813-3.888), 3.752 (3.195-4.407), and 4.649 (3.884-5.563), respectively.

Severe sepsis refers to patients with sepsis associated with organ dysfunction, hypotension, poor tissue perfusion and other conditions.\nIn 2016, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was listed as the diagnostic criterion for sepsis (Sepsis 3.0).通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> As the most commonly used critical disease scoring system in clinical practice, numerous large retrospective studies have demonstrated that the SOFA scoring system is effective in evaluating the prognosis of patients with sepsis.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5,6]</u>\nPrevious studies have also shown that patient age, SOFA score, and APACHE score are independent risk factors for prognosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8,9]</u> It has also been demonstrated that change in the difference between the SOFA scores at two time points predicts the 28-day prognosis of patients with sepsis.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Previous studies utilizing latent growth mixture modeling have investigated the impact of changes in SOFA score on the development of sepsis into persistent critical illness. The present study was based on a large critical illness database to achieve population clustering through the different laws of the longitudinal development of SOFA. This analysis was aimed at a more accurate identification of patients with sepsis at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes. Longitudinal change trajectory is used to describe the process of continuous and dynamic changes in the development of a certain object over time. This trajectory has been widely used in medicine, psychology, and other related fields.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> In 1999, Nagin.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u> supported the use of group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) for the analysis of longitudinal data. As a special application of the finite mixed model, this method is used to analyze the similarity of certain behaviors or results over time or age, and subsequently divide individual subjects into groups.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u> This model is used to explore the presence of heterogeneity in the whole population.\nIn this study, patients with sepsis in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database, who had a record of SOFA scores at 72 h, were included as the research population. The trajectory model from GBTM was used to construct a traditional univariate trajectory model for the 72-h SOFA score. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to explore the relationship between each trajectory and the risk of adverse outcomes. This study aimed to determine the relationship between SOFA score trajectory and poor prognosis in patients with sepsis in the ICU.\nThe MIMIC-IV database通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> is an updated version of MIMIC-III.

Vital signs included the heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MBP), body temperature, and pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2). The first laboratory test parameters of patients with sepsis collected within 24 h after admission to the ICU were partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), white blood cell count (WBC), bicarbonate, chloride, hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine ratio (BCR), international normalized ratio (INR), red cell distribution width (RDW), anion gap, hemoglobin, and platelets. Data on the length of stay in the hospital and ICU were also extracted.\nThe primary endpoint was the survival status on days 7 and 28 in the hospital and ICU. The secondary endpoint was the occurrence of adverse prognostic events, such as septic shock and acute respiratory failure (ARF).\nGBTM is mainly used to track the data analysis of a heterogeneous population. The principle of this process is to explore the subgroups with different development trajectories in the population, and subsequently analyze the developmental trend of different subgroups. The level and shape of the trajectory are determined by the regression parameters of the model, which are estimated by the maximum likelihood ratio.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18]</u> GBTM can adapt to various data distributions, such as binary logistic regression, Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson, and normal distribution.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>\nIn our study, the fitting basis of SOFA trajectory grouping based on GBTM model is mainly determined by the following indicators:通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Bayesian information criterion (BIC), e.g. BIC values closer to 0 indicate a better fitting effect. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Average post-test grouping probability (Avepp), in which the index reflects the post-test probability of each individual being classified into the corresponding trajectory subgroup, with >0.7 typically used as the acceptance criterion. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Bayesian factor logarithmic value (2log e[B10]), which is approximately equal to twice the difference between the BIC values (2ΔBIC) of the two comparison models.

Continuous data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile). Categorical variables were described as percentages and compared using the χ2 test. Comparisons between the two groups were performed using Student’s t-test (normal distribution) or the Mann-Whitney U test (non-normal distribution). Cumulative incidence function curves of different outcomes were plotted and compared using the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine significant differences in terms of survival status and adverse events following stratification of patients according to their different SOFA score trajectories.\nThree multivariate models were used to evaluate the prognostic value of the SOFA score trajectory for each study endpoint. In model I, covariates were only adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, insurance, and marital status. In model II, covariates of vital signs were only adjusted for model I plus SBP, DBP, MBP, respiratory rate, temperature, SPO2, PaCO2, and PaO2. In model III, covariates of laboratory parameters were adjusted for model II plus glucose, RRT, mechanical ventilation, administration of glucocorticoids, CCI, WBC, bicarbonate, chloride, hematocrit, BCR, INR, RDW, anion gap, hemoglobin, and platelets. The results were expressed as the hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).\nAll statistical analyses were performed with R software  and Stata . P-values <0.05 (two-sided) denoted statistically significant differences.\nA total of 16,743 patients with sepsis were included in the study.

Patients in group 2 had a higher SOFA score than those in group 1, showing a fluctuating trend of initial increase and subsequent stabilization. Patients in group 3 had SOFA scores ranging between those recorded in groups 1 and 2, showing an initial increase, followed by a sharp decline within 72 h, and finally continuing to rise. Patients in groups 4 and 5 exhibited relatively high SOFA scores, with similar trends of change.\nFit statistics for different number of trajectory groups.\n删除重复语句：<u>Fit statistics for different number of trajectory groups.</u>\nAIC: Akaike Information Criterion; AvePP: Average post-test grouping probability; BIC: Bayesian information criterion; NA: Not avalible; 2ΔBIC: Twice the difference between the BIC values.\nThe median survival age was 66 years (interquartile range: 54-76 years). The population included 9575 men (57.2%) and 7168 women (42.8%). The majority of patients was White (65.9%) and married (42.9%), and had received mechanical ventilation therapy (95.9%). The in-hospital mortality rates on days 7 and 28 were 6.0% (n = 934) and 17.6% (n = 2962), respectively. The mortality rates among patients in the ICU were 8.1% (n = 1372) and 19.1% (n = 3202), respectively. The incidence rates of septic shock and ARF were 11.5% (n = 1932) and 42.8% (n = 7178), respectively.\nA univariate censored normal (CNORM) trajectory model was fitted according to the 72-h SOFA score level of the longitudinal cohort population. The SOFA scores of patients in groups 1-5 were gradually increased, with overlapping SOFA trajectories for groups 2 and 3 at the time of admission 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1]</u>.

The coefficients of cubic functions in the five groups are shown in Supplementary Table S1.\nThe baseline characteristics of patients stratified based on the five trajectory groups are shown in Table 2. Compared with group 1, higher SOFA scores of patients in the trajectory groups 2-5 were linked to a greater proportion of males and more frequent use of RRT and mechanical ventilation. Overall, there were statistically significant differences in the baseline characteristics of patients across the five trajectory groups (P < 0.05).\nDescriptive characteristics of overall participants and by SOFA trajectory.\n删除重复语句：<u>Descriptive characteristics of overall participants and by SOFA trajectory.</u>\nContinuous data are presented as median (interquartile range), whereas categorical data are presented as n (%).\nBCR: Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine ratio; CCI: Charlson Comorbidity Index; DBP: Diastolic blood pressure; INR: International normalized ratio; MBP: Mean arterial pressure; PaCO2: Artial pressure of carbon dioxide; RRT: Renal replacement therapy; RDW: Red cell distribution width; SPO2: Oxygen saturation; SBP: Systolic blood pressure; SOFA: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment; WBC: White cell count.\nThe cumulative risk curve of adverse outcome according to the SOFA score of patients with sepsis is shown in Figure 3. For the 7- and 28-day survival outcomes, the risk curve of all trajectory groups exhibited a clear trend of gradual increase. In group 5, the high SOFA score group was associated with the highest cumulative risk. In group 1, the low SOFA score group was linked to the lowest cumulative risk. A statistically significant difference was found in the cumulative death risk for patients from all trajectory groups (P<0.001). For the outcome of septic shock, the risk curve of each trajectory group increased gradually from the third day after admission. The cumulative risks of groups 2-5 were gradually increased, while that of group 1 remained at a relatively low level. There were statistically significant differences in the cumulative risk of septic shock for patients in the trajectory groups (P<0.001). For the ARF outcome, the cumulative risk of all trajectory groups showed a similar increasing trend. Statistically significant differences were found in the cumulative risk of ARF among the patients classified in the trajectory groups (P<0.001).\nIn this study, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between SOFA trajectory and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. When fitting the model, group 1 was first used as the reference group to fit the univariate Cox model of the SOFA trajectory variables. Thereafter, the different covariables at baseline were adjusted in four different models. The results are shown in Table 3. In the univariate analysis, for the outcome of 7-day in-hospital mortality and using trajectory 1 as the reference group, the HR (95% CI) values for groups 2-5 were 1.893 (1.561-2.296), 1.803 (1.449-2.242), 3.786 (3.113-4.603), and 5.478 (4.387-6.841), respectively. The results showed that these groups were risk factors for 7-day in-hospital mortality (P < 0.001). After adjusting the multivariate model of different covariates, groups 2-5 demonstrated a similar survival status to that observed on day 7. The mortality were independently correlated with SOFA trajectory (P < 0.001). The findings suggested that patients with sepsis whose SOFA score gradually increased in the longitudinal change trajectory were at a higher risk of death within 7 days compared with those who did not exhibit such an increase.\nHR and 95% CI for predictors of trajectory group.\n删除重复语句：<u>HR and 95% CI for predictors of trajectory group.</u>\nModels were derived from Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Similarly, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses using trajectory group 1 as a reference also showed that groups 2-5 continued to be independently correlated with 28-day mortality (P < 0.001). Finally, univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between the occurrence of septic shock and the longitudinal trajectory of the SOFA score. The analysis showed that, using group 1 as the reference group, the HR (95% CI) values for groups 2-5 were 2.353 (2.006-2.760), 3.307 (2.813-3.888), 3.752 (3.195-4.407), and 4.649 (3.884-5.563), respectively. These results showed that these groups were independent risk factors. Adjustment for different covariates demonstrated that groups 2-5 continued to be independently related to the occurrence of septic shock and ARF (P < 0.001). Patients in group 5 were at the highest risk for septic shock and ARF (P < 0.001).\nWe selected the following as research variables for the stratified subgroup analysis: age, sex, use of RRT, use of mechanical ventilation, and administration of glucocorticoid therapy. In the age-stratified analysis, patients with sepsis aged <65 years were at a significantly higher risk of death according to the SOFA trajectory for the survival status in the hospital and ICU compared with those aged ≥65 years (P < 0.05). For the 28-day mortality in the ICU, patients who did not receive mechanical ventilation were at a significantly higher risk of death according to the SOFA trajectory compared with those who received mechanical ventilation. For the outcome of ARF, patients with sepsis aged <65 years were at a significantly higher risk of death according to the SOFA trajectory compared with those aged ≥65 years (P = 0.008). The results of the subgroup analysis are shown in detail in Figure 4.\nSepsis remains the leading cause of death in critically ill patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Early observation and monitoring of changes in the patient’s condition and active use of effective treatments are of great importance to the prognosis. This type of practice can assist in reducing mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u> The SOFA score, proposed by the European Society of Critical Care Medicine,通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> is an objective system utilized to evaluate the severity of organ dysfunction or failure in patients with sepsis. This score is one of the necessary items for the diagnosis of patients with sepsis.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> Thus, dynamic monitoring of the change trajectory of the SOFA score in patients with sepsis is crucial.\nIn this study, we grouped patients with sepsis into trajectory groups according to their SOFA scores based on the univariate GBTM. GBTM was used to monitor changes in the SOFA score and determine the disease development trajectory in patients with sepsis. According to the fitting results of the model, we divided the SOFA scores of patients with sepsis into five trajectory groups. In the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, following analysis of adjusted and unadjusted covariates, a more uniform pattern was evident. Trajectory groups with higher SOFA scores were associated with an increased risk for various adverse outcomes. The SOFA score consists of six parts: breathing, coagulation, liver, circulation, nerves, and kidneys. The score for each of these parts ranges from 0 (no organ dysfunction) to 4 (severe organ dysfunction) points. The scores for each part are added, and the final total score 通用删除7(英):<u>(0-24)</u> is used to reflect the function of multiple organs throughout the body.通用删除6(英):<u>[3,27]</u>\nInitially, the SOFA score of group 1 ranged 0-4 points and showed a downward trend after 20 h. These results indicated limited organ damage and gradual improvement. Higher SOFA scores reflected greater initial damage to organ function in patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> Patients in groups 2-5 showed an upward trend in the early stage, reflecting the increase in organ damage and the number of damaged organs, indicating poor prognosis. We observed that the SOFA score of group 3 exhibited a relatively obvious downward trend; nevertheless, it remained higher than that observed for group 2. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that patients in group 3 were at lower risk of in-hospital death than those in group 2. However, the risk of death and septic shock in the ICU and the risk of ARF in this group remained higher than those noted in group 2.\nThe decrease in SOFA score reflected the effectiveness of early treatment in patients with sepsis. However, following a decrease to a certain level, it showed a trend toward stabilization. Possible reasons for this observation include inadequate control of the infection, disease recurrence, or damage to an organ that could not be promptly corrected.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Therefore, although patients in group 3 exhibited a significant downward trend, their prognosis remained relatively poor. A randomized controlled trial showed that changes in the SOFA score could reliably reflect the mortality of patients with sepsis.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> Another prospective cohort study showed that the SOFA score in the first few days of ICU admission was a good indicator of prognosis, while an increase in this score within the first 48 h of ICU admission could effectively predict death.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>\nThe present study was based on a GBTM analysis of the longitudinal trajectory changes in the SOFA scores of patients with sepsis. The results showed that groups 2-5 were independent risk factors for the occurrence of various adverse outcomes; specifically, higher SOFA scores were associated with poor prognosis in patients with sepsis. The severity of disease in patients with sepsis and related influencing factors can be identified by exploring the change trajectory in the SOFA score of patients with sepsis within 72 h after admission, analyzing the possible trajectory subgroup types, and determining the prognosis of different trajectory subgroups. This provides a basis and guidance to clinicians for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with sepsis.\nWe further performed a subgroup analysis based on covariates, such as age, sex, RRT, mechanical ventilation, and administration of glucocorticoids. Age remained a predictor of mortality and ARF incidence. The mortality of patients aged <65 years in each group of SOFA score was significantly higher than that of patients aged ≥65 years. Previous studies suggested that the risk of sepsis had a bimodal distribution: higher in infants; lower in young individuals; and higher in those aged >60 years.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> Our findings are not consistent with that observation.

In addition, the compensatory ability of older patients to external stimuli (e.g. trauma通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> and inflammation通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u>) is weaker than that of young individuals. For example, in the case of early sepsis in patients with renal dysfunction due to microcirculation or severe inflammation, younger patients demonstrated greater compensatory capacity, and the urine output may have not been markedly reduced.通用删除6(英):<u>[20,37,38]</u> However, due to their weak compensatory ability, the level of urine output in elderly patients was significantly decreased.

During the fetal period, primordial germ cells migrate to the future gonads, mitosis occurs, and oocytes are produced. Before birth, oocytes in the ovaries proliferate and grow into primary oocytes. After birth, the follicles of the ovaries are all primary oocytes that have undergone the first meiosis and stagnated during the prophase of division. The primordial follicle consists of a primary oocyte with a single layer of flat GCs surrounding it. As primordial follicles grow and differentiate, the GCs around the oocyte become cuboids通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> and form primary follicles, initiating GC proliferation in preparation for secreting hormones.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> GCs then proliferate and form multilayer somatic cells surrounding the oocyte, forming secondary follicles. GCs then secrete fluid and accumulate between the cells, while the capillaries of the follicle membrane exude fluid, forming small and fluid-filled cavities within the follicles. These cavities coalesce to form early antral follicles.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Early in follicular development, GCs and oocytes deliver small molecules through gap junctions. As the follicle develops, GCs differentiate into mural GCs (MGCs) that connect the follicle wall and cumulus cells (CCs) that directly surround the oocyte. Despite the fact that both cell types differentiate from GCs, the functions of CCs and MGCs are different.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> CCs form a corona radiata surrounding the oocyte during ovulation and when entering the oviduct. MGCs are closely associated with steroid production.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) secreted by the pituitary gland stimulates further growth of secondary follicles, which later become preovulatory follicles. The follicular fluid consists of the exudate from the capillaries of the follicular membrane and the fluid secreted by GCs, containing nutrients and hormones that promote the continued development of the follicle. Follicle cells that stop growing and degenerate during development are called atretic follicles. Follicular atresia can occur at any stage of follicular development. GCs are closely associated with follicular atresia.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> It can be seen that the growth and development of the follicle is the result of the interaction of oocytes surrounding GCs and theca cells,通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> with GCs playing a vital role.\nAfter in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), the major criterion for embryo selection is the morphological appearance of the embryos, including cleavage rates, blastomere number, cytoplasmic appearance, and blastomere nuclear status;通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u> however, the morphological appearance of the oocytes and embryos cannot accurately predict embryo health. Up to 40% of embryos with normal morphology have abnormal chromosomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> Therefore, more accurate tests are needed to assess embryo quality and predict pregnancy outcomes. As GCs play an important role in the development of oocytes, they can reflect the characteristics of the corresponding oocyte to a certain degree. Appropriate biochemical markers of GCs will help to optimize the selection of oocytes and embryos, leading to successful pregnancy.\nGC apoptosis induces follicular atresia. The apoptosis of GCs has been proposed to be a predictor of ovarian reserves in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures. For example, apoptosis of GCs plays a critical role in sustaining the physiological functions of the ovary, including follicular growth and hormone synthesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Increased apoptosis of GCs from patients is closely related to low response,通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u> advanced age, and endometriosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Distinct biochemical and morphological changes were observed during GC apoptosis. Typical morphological changes include cytoplasmic and chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and apoptotic bodies.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> Biochemically, apoptosis is characterized by the activation of caspases, which are highly specific proteases.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Several molecular mechanisms have been reported to control GC apoptosis during follicle selection. For example, apoptosis of GCs can be induced by heat stress,通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> and increased reactive oxygen species levels can be found.通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u> Interactions between anti-apoptotic factors, including inhibitors of apoptosis proteins and B-cell leukemia 2通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u> and pro-apoptotic factors, such as P53,通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> determine the rate of GC apoptosis. Signaling pathways, such as p16/p19通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> and WNT2/β-catenin,通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> are reportedly involved in apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that certain microRNAs can also regulate GC apoptosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25]</u> Some studies have separately studied the effects of apoptosis of MGCs and CCs and their relationship with infertility.\nApoptosis of MGCs may have a negative impact on fertilization rate and embryo quality, and it is closely related to IVF outcome and ovarian reserve.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> However, another study showed that apoptosis of MGCs is not related to oocyte maturity and fertilization ability in ICSI patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Coincidentally, the study conducted by Jancar et al. also supports the fact that there were no differences in the characteristics of MGCs between the follicles with fertilized and non-fertilized oocytes in patients undergoing IVF.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> These different results may be due to the adoption of different methods to observe the apoptosis of MGCs. Therefore, the use of apoptosis of MGCs as a predictor of oocyte and embryo quality remains controversial.\nCCs are important for oocyte growth and the maintenance of meiotic arrest.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u> Apoptosis of CCs is closely related to pregnancy outcomes. The oocyte-cumulus complex (OCC) comprises an intimate relationship between a CC syncytium in conjunction with an oocyte involving large gap junctions.通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u> Therefore, apoptosis of CCs may be more accurate than that of MGCs in predicting oocyte and embryo quality.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> Apoptosis of CCs may influence the maturation of oocytes,通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> and increased apoptosis of CCs indicates low embryo quality. It has been hypothesized that a certain threshold of apoptotic CCs may have a negative impact on oocyte quality, but the threshold is still undefined, indicating that apoptosis of CCs is not a reliable quality marker of the corresponding oocyte.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u>\nPreovulatory follicles contain MGCs and CCs. Most studies collected GCs through the follicular fluid. Some of the conflicting results are due to the fact that the researchers did not use the same test standard when observing apoptosis. Different methods of IVF and ICSI will also lead to a difference, as CCs surrounding oocytes do not have to be removed during IVF treatment. Therefore, evidence regarding the influence of apoptosis of CCs during IVF is still lacking. Moreover, some researchers have not distinguished MGCs from CCs. All of these factors could contribute toward conflicting results.\nMost of the current studies indicate that apoptosis of MGCs and CCs is a potential predictor of oocyte and embryo quality, and CCs are a more accurate predictor than MGCs. However, for patients undergoing IVF, the process of obtaining CCs still needs to be optimized. Considering the obtained results as well as the applied procedures in clinical practice, apoptosis of GCs is not a reliable marker.\nTranscriptomic analysis of CCs/MGCs has also been regarded as a potential noninvasive tool for assessing oocyte quality and viability to determine the reproductive potential of embryos.通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u> Different gene expression in MGCs and CCs may correlate with morphological and physiological characteristics,通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> follicular competence, and fertility potential.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> Compared to MGCs, oocytes communicate with the surrounding CCs through paracrine and gap-junction signaling.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> Differences in the gene expression patterns of CCs may be more practical for use in the prediction of oocyte or embryo development and subsequent implantation. Furthermore, CCs may be collected while collecting MGCs from the follicular fluid. Therefore, many studies have attempted to analyze the genome-wide expression of genes in CCs instead of MGCs, and most patients analyzed in these studies were undergoing ICSI treatment.\nBy analyzing gene expression in CCs in early cleavage embryos using microarrays, it was found that numerous genes were differentially expressed and mainly involved in the cell cycle; angiogenesis; apoptosis; epidermal, fibroblast, and platelet-derived growth factor signaling; general vesicle transport; and chemokine and cytokine signaling.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> There is no consistent standard to evaluate embryo quality, and different genes play different roles in the development of oocytes. Therefore, differential gene expression in CCs may change according to the observed time and the choice of the main outcome measures 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>.\nGene expression as a predictor during ART\n删除重复语句：<u>Gene expression as a predictor during ART</u>\nART: Assisted reproductive technology; GJA1: Gap junction alpha-1 protein; HAS2: Hyaluronan synthase 2; GREM1: Gremlin1; ALCAM: Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule; VCAN: Versican; EFNB2: Ephrinb2; SDC4: Syndecan4.\nAlthough high heterogeneity remains a problem in current studies, some variables related to oocyte development show a significant association with gene expression, such as oocyte maturity (VCAN, GJA1, and SERPINE2),通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u> maturity of the nucleus (PTGS2), and oocyte fertilization ability (PRSS35).\nThe expression of some genes correlates with the morphological and physiological characteristics of the embryos. TRPM7 and ITPKA expression may predict better cleavage-stage embryos.通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u>GREM1 and ALCAM are related to embryo cleavage speed. RPS6KA2 is related to the percentage of fragmentation of embryos.通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u>PTGS2 cannot predict the morphology of the embryo on D5, but it is related to the ability of the embryo to develop to D5 or D6.通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> CCs with an increase in HAS2 and GREM1 expression are more likely to develop into high-quality embryos.通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u>\nThe difference in gene expression is related to its function during pregnancy 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>. Additional CC genes involved in homeostasis, signaling, and metabolism have been variably reported as upregulated or downregulated通用删除6(英):<u>[44,45]</u> with respect to pregnancy or live births. Increased expression of oxidative stress-related genes in CCs, including inducible nitric oxide synthase, heme oxygenase-1, and those regulating the nuclear factor kappa B pathway, are associated with reduced oocyte fertilization by ICSI.通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> A significant downregulation of 11 genes involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway in CCs has been observed in oocytes that produced a positive pregnancy.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>\nA selected set of genes may be more accurate than a single gene. Compared to randomly selected metaphase II oocytes, those with the expression of HAS2 and a group of FSH receptors, including FSH receptor, VCAN, PR, ALCAM, and NRP1, were shown to have a high live birth rate.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> Similarly, CC expression of 12 genes involved in glucose metabolism, transcription, gonadotropin regulation, and apoptosis appeared to have 78% accuracy in predicting pregnancy outcomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>\nLarge differences in gene expression between patients have been found in many studies, which may be due to the application of different treatment protocols, such as the choice of ovarian stimulation methods. Compared with patients who had been stimulated with HP-hMG, increased and decreased SPROUTY4 and SDC4 expression, respectively, was detected in patients who had been treated with recombinant FSH.通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u> The expression of VCAN, GREM1, and RPS6KA2 also varied considerably between the two treatment groups. Thus, CC gene expression analysis might also be a valuable tool for the further optimization of stimulation protocols.\nIn conclusion, the expression of a group of genes in CCs can effectively predict embryo development, implantation potential, and final pregnancy outcome. However, there are also many differences in the observation time points of the studies 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>, and the number of genes that needs to be screened is large. Because the selection of observation indicators is different, and the morphological score is a subjective judgment criterion, different studies have reached contradictory results, and it is not clear whether the differential expression of genes can predict the outcome of different stages of the embryo. The specific role of many genes in oocyte development remains presently unknown. Compared with morphological evaluation, the evaluation indexes of pregnancy outcome and live birth rate are more objective. According to the different predictors provided in different studies, it is of considerable importance to select a suitable gene or a group of genes to accurately predict pregnancy outcomes.\nKnown functions of the studied genes\n删除重复语句：<u>Known functions of the studied genes</u>\nVCAN: Versican; ALCAM: Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule; GJA1: Gap junction alpha-1 protein; HAS2: Hyaluronan synthase 2; GREM1: Gremlin1; BMP: Bone morphogenetic protein; SDC4: Syndecan4; EFNB2: Ephrinb2; PLAU: Plasminogen activator.\nMGCs are promising models for studying age-related ovarian dysfunction. The MGC micro-environment is similar to that of oocytes and is more conducive to analysis than that of CCs. Accumulating evidence shows that mitochondrial functions in MGCs are related to the fertility of women.通用删除6(英):<u>[50,51]</u> It has been reported that the age-related decline in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation function of MGCs elucidates ovary aging and reveals strategies to improve ART outcomes for aged women.通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u>\nOCC interactions mediate carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism to ensure the proper energy balance required for meiosis and fertilization of the oocyte and to support early embryogenesis. Mitochondria in CCs are vital for oocyte development and competence, helping to metabolize glucose into pyruvate, which is then transported into the oocyte to produce ATP.通用删除6(英):<u>[53]</u> Serving as central agents of the energetic metabolic pathways, CC mitochondria directly participate in the establishment of oocyte competence during oogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u> The mitochondrial function of CCs is also closely related to fertility.通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u>\nHowever, acquiring an accurate number of mitochondria in the cells is challenging. The number, mass, and shape of mitochondria vary considerably depending on the cell type and physiological state.通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u> The correct maintenance and expression of mtDNA are critical for cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis,通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u> and mitochondrial function is reflected in mtDNA quality and quantity.通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u> A suitable proxy measure for elucidating the function of mitochondria is mtDNA content. Thus, MGC and CC mitochondrial DNA may be a suitable predictor in ART procedures,通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u> as the quantification of mGC and CC mtDNA is linked to embryo quality.通用删除6(英):<u>[60]</u> The mtDNA copy numbers in CCs seem to be closely related to the chance of embryo implantation during ART procedures.通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u> Without freezing the embryos and postponing the transfer, this technique could be easily applied in clinical practice to select and transfer the embryos with the highest mtDNA content in CCs or MGCs during in vitro embryo development.\nHowever, there are still some limitations. In addition to varying between cells, mtDNA content is affected by patient specificity, making it highly difficult to acquire a universal threshold value for all patients. Before its use in clinical practice, larger and prospective studies are required to confirm these preliminary results because of the small size of the population in most studies.\nTelomeres are specialized protein-DNA chromatin structures located at the ends of all eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomerase is an enzyme complex that binds to chromosome ends (telomeres). The maintenance of telomere length and integrity is regulated by the active telomerase complex, including the telomerase holoenzyme and its associated proteins.通用删除6(英):<u>[62,63]</u> The telomerase activity varies in different cell types, such as germline cells, GCs, early embryos, stem cells, highly proliferative somatic cells, and many cancer cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u> It is linked to GC proliferation and differentiation status.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> Telomere DNA length abnormalities may disturb folliculogenesis.通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u> Both telomere length and telomerase activity in GCs are positively correlated with female infertility.通用删除6(英):<u>[67,68]</u> In conclusion, telomere dysfunction is associated with GC function, which can also be evaluated by telomere loss, telomere deletion, and the formation of telomere doublets. A recent study also found that certain proteins could be markers of telomere function, such as cohesins SA1/SA2 and NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1.通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u> The alteration of Tert, Terc, Trf2, and Pot1a gene expression may be associated with telomere shortening.通用删除6(英):<u>[70]</u> These could serve as new molecular signatures to assess oocyte quality, further explaining the dissatisfactory outcome of ART procedures.通用删除6(英):<u>[71]</u>\nDirect investigation of the relationship between telomere dysfunction and maturation or preimplantation development in human oocytes or embryos has several limitations. Low quantities of DNA make it difficult to obtain access to oocytes and embryos. An effective method to simultaneously quantify telomere DNA and thoroughly diagnose aneuploidy in the same oocyte or embryo biopsy is also needed. The expression of TERT at the protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels is a critical component that determines telomerase activity.通用删除6(英):<u>[72,73]</u> Detection of hTERT mRNA is an indicator of telomerase existence, and telomerase activity is determined using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay.通用删除6(英):<u>[74]</u> Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a highly sensitive detection technique. Using an ECL method, a new intracellular telomerase detection technique with high sensitivity and low cost is being devised.通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u> Telomere function in GCs is important for the development of oocytes. Detecting telomere function is an excellent method to predict ART procedure outcomes.\nAs mentioned above, these methods have certain limitations. There is limited consensus on the transcriptomic characteristics of MGCs and CCs, and some studies have reached contradictory conclusions. First, there are differences in laboratory environments, outcome measures, study population sizes, population characteristics, and the techniques used. Second, the use of different ovarian stimulation protocols can affect transcriptomic characteristics. All of these factors create difficulties in the clinical application of gene transcriptomes. Third, most of the studies have used subjective morphological appearance as a surrogate endpoint. The main purpose to find markers related to ART is to indicate embryos with the highest probability of implantation leading to pregnancy and live birth. Moreover, better endpoints need to be considered. In actual clinical applications, despite the accuracy of the results, it is also necessary to consider the simplicity and feasibility of the operation, and a large number of prospective experimental studies are still required after the selection of genes with discriminatory value.\nHowever, the limitations we described previously can be overcome by advancements in medical technology. For example, new sequencing techniques, such as RNA-Seq, are considered powerful tools for assessing transcript and gene expression levels. It would be worth studying whether other genes that can predict pregnancy outcomes and elucidate the function of these genes can be analyzed using new sequencing techniques. In addition to using the present experimental techniques, combining these methods may provide a more accurate prediction. Depending on the clinical circumstances, these methodologies may be appropriate as adjuncts to traditional approaches, such as morphological scores. Furthermore, current studies have shown that oocyte competence can be predicted more accurately using a set of genes. It is challenging to find a reliable group of genes to improve the accuracy of the test to predict embryo and oocyte competence.\nUnfortunately, most reproductive centers face the challenge that the results from most studies were from a single institution and the sample size was not large. However, in the future, large-scale, multi-center studies should be able to address this limitation.\nThe proliferation, differentiation, and function of GCs are highly correlated with oocyte capacity. Therefore, evaluating CCs or MGCs using their biomarkers is a potential measure to identify oocyte and embryo competence. Many studies have suggested promising biomarker candidates, including apoptosis rate, transcriptomics of CCs and MGCs, mitochondrial DNA copy number, and telomere length.\nAlthough there are still some limitations that require more in-depth research, a bright future for such applications in clinical settings can be foreseen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:36:04", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:36:41", "cost": 36.351}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:26", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:36:40", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:36:04"}

It possesses the function of protecting internal human body from external environment. Epidermis, as the outmost part of skin, consists mainly of keratinocytes (>90%) and is the first line of defense for host. Although keratinocytes are non-bone marrow-derived cells, they are proved to play a critical role in innate immune reactions and participate in the activation of adaptive immunity in the skin. Keratinocytes sense specific microbial components through several receptors and produce effector molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines to resist infection. They also attract immune cells such as neutrophils and T cells to the site of infection. We performed a search on PubMed using searching strategy \"(keratinocyt* [MeSH Major Topic]) AND (infection [MeSH Subheading] OR innate immun* [MeSH Subheading])\" from 2008.1 to 2019.9, to collect related articles for this review. In this review, we would like to illustrate how keratinocytes sense pathogenic microorganisms and initiate subsequent signals as well as how they participate in innate and adaptive immune response in the skin.\nIn the process of resisting infection, recognition of pathogenic microorganisms is crucial. Keratinocytes can sense pathogen molecules (pathogen-associated molecular patterns [PAMPs]) through particular receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the earliest phase of the response.\nPAMPs are a number of highly conserved molecules shared by several pathogens, such as viral nucleic acid, lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), peptidoglycan (PGN), lipoproteins, flagellin, and so on. PRRs are a series of membrane and intracellular receptors that can sense PAMPs and play a role in the early stage of innate immune response. Toll like receptors (TLRs), dectin-1, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are illustrated to be expressed in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>1,2</u> Many PRRs have synergistic effects (such as TLR cooperation, TLR cooperation with NOD-receptors) during the pathogen-recognition process.\nTLRs are the most important and well-studied PRRs in keratinocytes. They sense PAMPs or danger-associated molecular patterns of pathogenic microorganisms or cells. TLR1-7 and TLR9 are expressed in keratinocytes. TLR1, 2, 4-6 are located on keratinocyte cell membrane while TLR3, 7 and 9 express on the membrane of intracellular compartments such as endosomes and lysosomes. Most TLRs form homodimers while TLR2 forms a heterodimer with TLR1 or TLR6 in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>1,3</u>\nEach TLR has different recognition targets. TLR1, 2, and 6 recognize lipoproteins of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. TLR2 also recognizes PGN, LTA, fungal components zymosan, and phospholipomannan (PLM). Synthetic lipoprotein Pam3Cys is an important synthetic ligand for TLR1/TLR2 heterodimer while lipoprotein Pam2Cys is a ligand for TLR2/TLR6. TLR4 identifies lipopolysaccharide and O-linked mannosyl chains of Candida albicans (C. albicans) cell wall. TLR5 identifies bacterial protein flagellin. TLR3, located in cytoplasm, recognizes double-stranded viral RNA (dsRNA) and synthetic agonist poly(I:C). Cultured primary keratinocytes express TLR7 and it senses virus single-stranded RNA. In contrast, TLR7 expression was undetected in some experiments. TLR7 expression can be upregulated by keratinocyte differentiation, imiquimod and synthetic poly (I:C). Intracellular TLR9 binds CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide of bacterial and fungal double-stranded DNA.删除4：<u>2,4,5</u>\nWhen TLRs are activated, the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain of TLRs can act with an adaptor molecule owning the same TIR domain and then several proinflammatory cytokines are produced. There are five members in the TIR adaptor family. Myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88) is a main TIR adaptor involved in TLRs signaling, which recruits several kinases and lead to the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) translocation to the nucleus as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) activation, permitting transcription of the target genes. As a result, cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and chemokines such as IL-8 as well as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are secreted (known as the MyD88-dependent pathway). The other TLR signaling pathway is TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β-dependent pathway. Besides activating NF-κB as the former, the later pathway also activates interferon regulatory factor 3 and results in type I interferon (IFN) production, which is important to viral defense. In keratinocytes, TLRs except TLR3 initiate the MyD88-dependent pathway, while TLR3 and TLR4 activate TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β pathway.删除4：<u>1,3</u>\nTLRs play a critical role in anti-bacterial responses. TLR2 recognizes Staphylococcus aureus lipoproteins and LTA as well as promoting the expression of AMP β-defensin 3, IL-1 family cytokines, chemokines (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 1 and CXCL2. Mice lacking TLR2 is more easily to get infected with S. aureus. Phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) peptides from S. aureus mobilize lipoproteins to be recognized by TLR2.6,7 Besides, TLR2 heterodimerizes TLR2/1 and TLR2/6 recognize Propionibacterium acnes in human keratinocytes, inducing NF-κB and activator protein 1 activation.删除4：<u>8</u> Bacterial flagellin activated TLR5 induces expression of AMP S100A8/S100A9, S100A7, S100A15, and human β-defensin (HBD) 2 in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>9</u> TLR5 also recognizes Treponema pallidum flagellins and activates matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and MMP13 through MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.删除4：<u>10</u>\nIn addition to bacteria, TLRs act in skin’s defense against fungi and viruses. Upregulated expression of cytokines (such as IL-8) and HBD2 in keratinocytes interacted with Malassezia spp. is probably via TLRs.删除4：<u>11</u> TLR2 also identifies C. albicans component PLM, then activating NF-κB and p38MAPK signal transduction pathways to secrete IL-6 and IL-8 in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>12</u> PLM, present in the inner layer of C. albicans’ cell wall, owns the function of enhancing C. albicans cell wall homeostasis on β-glucans and chitin synthesis. It is of notable contribution to C. albicans’ pathogenicity and it deregulates yeast phagocytosis and activates inflammasome in macrophages.删除4：<u>13</u> TLR4 and TLR2 are important to avoiding Sporothrix spp. infection. They identify Sporothrix schenckii as well as trigger inflammatory response (upregulation of IL-6 and IL-8) in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>14</u> Viruses such as herpes simplex virus, Dengue virus, human papillomavirus are sensed and resisted via TLR recognition in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>5,15</u>\nAfter recognition, TLRs are engaged in initiating the expression of many cytokines, chemokines and other functional genes in innate immune responses to resist infection. TLRs also participate in regulating adaptive immune responses through cytokines secretion. TLR2 in keratinocytes initiates anti-infection reactions of immune cells through the secretion of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 20, CCL2, MMP9, and IL-8.16 TLR3 functions on epidermal barrier repairment by increasing structural-related gene expression (such as glucocerebrosidase) in epidermis and changing lipid composition, which may promote infection recovery and wound/UV damage repairment.删除4：<u>17</u> Recent findings show that TLRs may act on inflammation against microbe through upregulating the expression of Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) inhibitor Lympho-epithelial Kazal-type inhibitor in keratinocytes. KLKs are serine proteases which is necessary for desquamation, owning the function of degrading several adhesive proteins of corneodesmosomes. The expression of several KLKs can be induced by pathogen molecules like S. aureus and poly(I:C), which may lead to the decreased epidermis integrity and pathogenesis of the bacteria. Researchers find TLR1/2, 3, 5, and 2/6 upregulate the expression of Lymphoepithelial Kazal-type inhibitor and inhibit KLKs in microbial infected skin lesions, contributing to the defense against infection (such as varicella, pyoderma, and rosacea).删除4：<u>18</u>\nSeveral molecules in host and bacteria effect TLRs recognition. The structure of lipoproteins affects TLR2- mediated immune response. Diacylated lipoproteins existing in skin microbiota while deficient in S. aureus, induce immune suppression via TLR2 to help avoiding immune response towards skin normal bacterial flora. Unsaturated fatty acids from skin enhance the TLR2- dependent immune response to S. aureus lipoproteins. Meanwhile, S. aureus produce several molecules to avoid recognition. PSMs of S. aureus act as antagonists for TLR4, helping escape from hosts. Staphylococcal superantigen-like protein 3 from S. aureus avoid the recognition of lipoproteins by TLR2.6\nTLR-signaling is negative regulated by some molecules, such as splice variants for adaptors or their related proteins, ubiquitin ligases, deubiquitinases, transcriptional regulators (such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 [STAT1]) and microRNAs.删除4：<u>3</u> MicroRNA (miR)-146a, a kind of evolutionarily conserved small noncoding RNAs, is an inhibitive element in keratinocytes' TLR2 signal pathway. It is upregulated in TLR2-activated keratinocytes through the NF-κB and MAPK pathways and has a lasting suppression effect on inflammatory cytokines release (such as IL-8, CCL20, and TNF-α) as well as NF-κB target genes.删除4：<u>19</u> Normal human flora Staphylococcus epidermidis LTA can activate TLR2 to express miR-143, which inhibits TLR2 expression and thus decreases opportunistic pathogen P. acnes-induced proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>6</u> These negative regulators help to maintain the balance of inflammation and defense process in keratinocytes .\nC-type lectin receptor dectin-1 as one of the important PRRs, is mainly expressed in dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages. In dendritic cells, dectin-1 recognizes β-glucans (a cell wall components of bacteria and fungi) and activate spleen tyrosine kinase, leading to NF-κB and MAPK activation as well as cytokine production. In keratinocytes, dectin-1 is found to be located on the cell membrane as well as intracellular while it cannot activate spleen tyrosine kinase-signaling, which differs from other cells.删除4：<u>20,21</u> However, dectin-1 is also illustrated to be connected with β-glucan-induced MAPK pathway and IL- 8 cytokine production in normal human epidermal keratinocytes.删除4：<u>20</u> The activation of dectin-1 in keratinocytes by β-glucan may have the function of enhancing wound healing, for dectin-1 activation induces keratinocyte proliferation and migration.删除4：<u>21</u> The function of dectin-1 in the reaction to Mycobacterium ulcerans and Malassezia spp. have been studied. Dectin-1 recognizes and internalize M. ulcerans as well as lead to the release of intracellular reactive oxygen species, CXCL8, CCL2, and LL-37 in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>22</u> In antigen-presenting cells, dectin-1 is related to Malassezia spp. recognition and IL-1β secretion. While in keratinocytes, IL-1β cannot be induced by Malassezia spp.删除4：<u>23</u>\nSeveral factors participate in dectin-1 expression signals. IFNs and T helper 17 (Th17) cytokines enhance dectin-1 expression. Dectin-1 is upregulated in psoriasis as well.24 β-glucan stimulation attenuates dectin-1 expression in normal human epidermal keratinocytes while mycobacterium and zymosan induce dectin-1 mRNA and protein production in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>20,22</u> In conclusion, further studies should be made to explore the downstream of activated dectin-1 in keratinocytes.\nNLRs are cytosolic PRRs and recognize intracellular bacterial components. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 and 2 (NOD1 and NOD2), as two main NLRs, are found to be expressed in keratinocytes and mediate NF-κB activation. NOD1 senses bacteria PGN fragments while NOD2 recognizes bacterial components such as muramyl dipeptide, γ-D-glutamyl-mesodiaminopimelic acid, and PGN from Gram-positive bacteria.删除4：<u>25,26</u> Researches illustrate that keratinocytes’ NOD1 recognizes Pseudomonas aeruginosa and upregulate the secretion of CXCL8 (also known as IL-8).删除4：<u>26</u> NOD2 acts in defense against S. aureus through getting activated with the involvement of the first binding site of NF-κB, leading to the secretion of IL-17C cytokine and less survival rate of S. aureus in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>27</u> TLR2 ligands such as bacterial lipoproteins have a synergistic effect with NOD2 ligand PGN in initiating immune responses.删除4：<u>28</u>\nThe nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leu-cine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) as a member of NLRs, forms a complex named NLRP3 inflammasome with caspase-1 and an adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain) in the cytosol. Inflammasome plays an important role in anti-pathogen inflammation. It is also involved in various auto-immune and auto-inflammatory diseases. Recent findings show that in keratinocytes, NLRP3 inflammasome can function as a PRR. It is activated by dsRNA through dsRNA-induced protein kinase in keratinocytes. And the process can be enhanced by type I IFNs. Then the activation leads to caspase-1 cleavage as well as the subsequent formation of IL-1β and IL-18, which are crucial to hosts’ antimicrobial processes.删除4：<u>29</u> The two cytokines promote the secretion of TNF, IL- 6, and IFN-γ, respectively. NLRP3 inflammasome recognizes fungi in dendritic cells and monocytes, such as C. albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Malassezia spp.删除4：<u>23</u> Whether NLRP3 inflammasome in keratinocytes own the same function remains unknown. Absent in melanoma 2 inflammasome is found to detect cytosolic double-stranded DNA such as human papillomavirus 16 DNA and leads to caspase-1 activation in keratinocytes as well.删除4：<u>30</u>\nRIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) are two major RLRs exist in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes. They are important in defense against virus together with TLR3 and TLR7. RIG-I, as a DExH/D-box contained RNA helicase, identifies dsRNA in cytoplasm and lead to antiviral responses. MDA5 also belongs to the DExH/D-box contained RNA helicase and recognizes longer dsRNA than RIG-I. Both RIG-I and MDA5 activate NF-κB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) to induce subsequent gene expression including type I IFN.删除4：<u>2,15</u> In keratinocytes, the expression of RIG-I is upregulated by IFN-γ or TNF-α. RIG-I expression is dependent on IRF-1 protein. Recent studies have found UVB exposure can decrease IRF-1 expression, leading to localized skin immune suppression towards viruses.删除4：<u>31</u>\nWhen PRRs are activated, keratinocytes subsequently secrete several cytokines which are linked to anti-infection response, such as proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, TNF, and IFN), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 10), chemokines (IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL20), and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and so on.删除4：<u>4,16</u> Those cytokines are found to be induced by several pathogen molecules through PRRs and function on mediating immune responses in keratinocytes.\nProinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are mainly produced after PRRs activation in keratinocytes. They own the function of inducing AMPs production, and immune cells attraction to resist infection. Proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, both belonging to IL-1 family, are secreted primarily dependent on caspase-1 via the recognition of pathogen molecules by inflammasome.删除4：<u>29</u> IL-1α, as another member of IL-1 family, is upregulated dependent on TLR2 activation by S. aureus as well as the bacterial cell wall components LTA and PGN stimulation. IL-1α induces antimicrobial protein complex calprotectin (also known as S100A8/A9) expression in both epithelial cells and oral keratinocytes. IL-1α also upregulates the expression of neutrophil targeting chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and IL-8 in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>7,32</u> IL- 36, as a new cytokine related to inflammation, is secreted notably by keratinocytes. IL-36 contains three members (IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ) in IL-1 family and induces several chemokines and cytokines expression like CCL10, CCL20, CXCL-1, CXCL8 (IL-8), IL-1β.删除4：<u>33</u> IL-36γ is mostly upregulated when keratinocytes contacting with TLR ligands. Poly(I:C) induces the transcription of IL-36γ gene and caspase-3/7 activation dependent on caspase 1, which may indicate IL-36γ possesses anti-viral abilities.删除4：<u>34</u> Researches showed that under UVB exposure, mice lacking IL-1 receptor are vulnerable to develop epidermal cysts and have downregulated expression of IL-6 and TNF-α with less infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in dermal compartment.删除4：<u>35</u> Those findings exhibit the importance of IL-1 cytokine in inflammatory responses. Besides IL-1, TLRs activate pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α all through the MyD88-dependent pathway.删除4：<u>1</u>\nAnother cytokine TSLP, a T cell maturation activator, is also secreted by keratinocytes through TLRs activation with the presence of TLR ligands such as dsRNA, flagellin, diacylated lipopeptide or other S. aureus component. In keratinocytes, elevated TSLP promotes Th2-type inflammation and atopic dermatitis (AD) process, probably through suppressing the expression of antimicrobial proteins S100A7 (psoriasin) and HBD2 via Janus kinase signal transducers 2 and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3)-dependent pathways.删除4：<u>36</u>\nCytokines produced by keratinocytes can take part in adaptive immune responses, mainly by activating T cell responses. IL-18 of IL-1 family enhances Th1 adaptive immune responses. IL-1β together with IL-6 enhances Th17 cell differentiation. Th1 cells produce cytokines such as IFN-γ to activate other immune cells including macrophages. Th17 cells play a critical role in defense against pathogens through IL-17 cytokines secretion (which upregulate many inflammatory genes in several cell types including keratinocytes), neutrophils recruitment, and so on.删除4：<u>37</u> IL-17A is the first one to be discovered in IL-17 family and is secreted by T cells (such as αβ T cells, γδ T cells, iNKT cells, and LTi-like cells). In recent years, a new family member IL-17C is demonstrated to be secreted by keratinocytes and own the similar functions as IL-17A on inducing inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and AMPs. IL-17C is proved to be induced by pathogens through NOD2 mediated pathways in keratinocytes. It cooperates with TNF on upregulating keratinocytes’ HBD-2 expression. And it is related to reduced survival of S. aureus and decreased sensory neurons apoptosis under herpes simplex virus-2 infection in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>38</u> IL-17C also leads to psoriasis like skin lesions together with TNF-α. In addition, TLR2 and TLR5 activation as well as TNF and IL-1β induce IL-17C secretion in epithelial cells.删除4：<u>27,39</u>\nAnti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is secreted by keratinocytes as well. IL-10 secretion exists in other cells like Th2 lymphocytes and mast cells in skin and can regulate keratinocytes’ inflammatory response. Excessive expression of IL-10 suppresses proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IFN-γ. And the expression of HBD2 is inhibited by IL-10 in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>40</u>\nChemokines, as a family of small cytokines or signaling proteins, can be secreted by keratinocytes as mentioned above and initiate the activation of other immune cells like T cells to participate in the inflammatory response to defense against infection. For instance, TLR2 mediated secretion of chemokines CCL20, CCL2, and IL-8 contribute to the recruitment of lymphocytes, monocytes, memory T cells and other immune cells to the infection site.删除4：<u>16</u>\nAMPs are small cationic peptide antibiotics widely exist in animals and own the function of anti-pathogens, wound healing, immunomodulation, and so on. HBDs and cathelicidins are two major families of AMPs expressed in keratinocytes. Most AMPs are proved to resist bacterial infection by combining with bacterial membrane and disturbing its structure.删除4：<u>41</u> AMPs can inhibit the infection of fungi and several viruses in skin as well.\nHBD family has four members including HBD1-4. Among which, HBD1, 2, and 3 are testified to be expressed in keratinocytes. HBD2 and 3 inhibit cell surface bacteria such as S. aureus. Opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis stimulation upregulates HBD2 and 3 expression through TLR2 signaling.删除4：<u>41</u> HBD2 expression induced by IL-1β inhibits S. aureus V8 protease (also named as serine protease A), which is an extracellular protease of S. aureus and function on skin integrity impairment.删除4：<u>42</u> Fungi such as C. albicans and Malassezia furfur induce HBD2 expression via TLR2 in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>41</u>\nCathelicidin is another family of AMPs. Human cathelicidin hCAP18 (hCAP18/LL-37) consists of two domains: a conserved cathelin-like domain and LL-37. During activation, human cathelicidin hCAP18 is cleaved by proteinase 3 to generate the mature form: LL-37, which has synergistic functions against microbe with HBDs.删除4：<u>43</u> Both the two domains of cathelicidin own the prosperities of anti-microbial ability. Towards viruses, LL-37 enlarges dsRNA-induced IFN-β expression and anti-viral response in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>44</u> For bacteria such as S. aureus, LL-37 is proved to have eliminating effects towards both extra- and intracellular S. aureus.45C. albicans PLM induces keratinocytes to express LL-37, HBD2, and HBD3 via TLR2. Those AMPs may act in skin’s defense against C. albicans.删除4：<u>46</u> Recently, LL-37 is regarded as a potential treatment for polymicrobial infected wounds. Besides direct host defense to pathogens, LL-37 is found to upregulate IL-1 family cytokines (especially IL-36γ through p38 MAPK-signaling pathway), chemokines and TLRs expression in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>33</u>\nApart from cathlicidin and HBDs, other molecules expressed by keratinocytes are proved to own antimicrobial properties. Ribonuclease (RNase) 5 and RNase 7, as members of RNase family which catalyze the degradation of RNA, own anti-infection abilities against many pathogens.删除4：<u>43</u> For instance, RNase 7 protects skin against S. aureus and can be induced by IL-1β in human keratinocytes and ocular epithelial cells.6 S100A7 (psoriasin), S100A8 (calgranulin A), and S100A9 (calgranulin B) are AMPs belonging to S100 protein family. Psoriasin, also known as S100A7, mainly induced by flagellin of Escherichia coli and has bacteria-killing activities.删除4：<u>41</u> Psoriasin is also found to be connected with wound healing and benefits skin’s innate immunity.删除4：<u>47</u> In keratinocytes, S100A8 and S100A9 form an antimicrobial heterodimeric complex named as calprotectin (S100A8/A9), all of which are upregulated by bacterial flagellin through the activation of TLR5.9 S100A8/A9 in keratinocytes resists bacterial invasion and can be upregulated by IL-1α.删除4：<u>32</u> Several cytokines and chemokines such as IL- 6, IL-8, TNF-α, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CCL20 are induced by S100A8/A9 and those cytokines in turn enhanced S100A8/A9 production.48 S100A8/A9 also involves in keratinocytes’ proliferation as well as chronic inflammation. Neuroplastin-β and extracellular MMP inducer are found to form a heterodimer as a receptor for calprotectin (S100A8/A9).\nInterestingly, several bacteria can produce peptides with AMPs properties. For instance, Staphylococcus epidermidis produces PSMs γ and δ, which can act together or with IL-37 to inhibit other pathogens.删除4：<u>43</u> It makes sense in maintaining the balance of microorganisms on the skin.\nThe expression of AMPs is regulated by some molecules, most notably cytokines. Proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-17, IL-22, and so on, induce AMP expression in keratinocytes. IL-17A and IFN-γ upregulate RNase 7 through STAT3.49 IL-22, secreted by Th22 cells, acts with the IL-22 receptor on epidermal keratinocytes to activate STAT3 and enhance the expression of HBD2, HBD3, S100A7, S100A8, and S100A9. The effects of STAT3- mediated gene expression are probably through B-cell leukemia (Bcl)-3’s nuclear translocation in keratinocytes (the IL-22-STAT3-Bcl-3 pathway). IL-22 is proved to induce AMPs expression and enhance the thickness of epidermis. Deficiency of IL-22 in keratinocytes may be responsible for chronic inflammatory diseases like hidradenitis suppurativa.删除4：<u>50</u> Moreover, IL-22 level is upregulated in skin suffered from inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and AD, indicating that IL-22 as well as its downstream Bcl-3 may involve in the pathogenesis of those skin diseases.51 es such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-released growth factors enhance AMPs production. EGF are demonstrated to increase AMPs expression with the presence of S. aureus and participate in the expression of RNase 7 and HBD3 in defense against Trichophyton rubrum.删除4：<u>49</u> Platelet-released growth factors upregulate keratinocytes’ psoriasin expression through EGF receptor and IL-6 receptor, may promoting wound healing.47 S100 calcium-binding protein A11 (S100/A11), as a protein in Ca2+-binding family, upregulates the expression of HBD3 and filaggrin (a protein that is important to the integrity of skin barrier) in keratinocytes.删除4：<u>52</u>\nBy contrast, Th2 cytokines inhibit AMP expression in AD patients. Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 in AD skin decrease S100/A11 production.删除4：<u>52</u> IL-4 and IL-13 also induce Bcl-3 expression in keratinocytes and the latter downregulates AMPs (including HBD3 and cathelicidin) functions, showing an opposite effect of Bcl-3 in the IL-22- STAT3-Bcl-3 pathway towards AMPs modulation.删除4：<u>53</u> These findings may partly explain why AD patients have weakened skin immune and tend to develop skin infections.\nThe immune responses of keratinocytes protect human skin from harmful viruses, bacteria, and fungi. As the first line of defense in human immune system, keratinocytes are receiving wider attention than ever. They function through various mechanisms including recognition of harmful microbes, production of AMPs as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines (for activating relative signal transduction pathways to induce the expression of effective genes) and regulate the function of other immune cells. At the same time, keratinocytes are the major cell type in epidermis and involved in various skin diseases. Pathogen especially the virus, as a viable cell-demand creature, the replication and invasion of which are largely dependent on keratinocytes. So keratinocytes’ anti-infection function is crucial to internal environment of the human body. Both loss-of-function and gain-of-function of keratinocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of dermatosis.\nThere are several physical and chemical factors that influence keratinocytes’ function, and can be used in clinical practice. Q-switched Nd:YAG laser can help to treat C. albicans infection by reducing fungus invasiveness. It inhibits proinflammatory cytokines expression (such as TNF-α and IL-8) as well as induce AMP HBD2 and HSP70B gene expression in HaCaT cells.删除4：<u>54</u> High calcium is demonstrated to induce the dsRNA sensors expression, including TLR3, MDA5, and RIG-I of keratinocytes. They also enhance expression of S100/A11 as well as the induction of HBD2 and HBD3 in defense against pathogens.删除4：<u>15,52</u> So anti-infection function may be strengthened by regulating calcium concentration in signal pathways of keratinocytes. Other influence factors like injury, as a dangerous condition for skin infection, induce AMP expression and neutrophil chemotactic cytokine IL-8 expression in epidermis, dependent on EGF receptor activation. CCL20, IL-15, and IL-23A are proved to be upregulated in early stage of injury in keratinocytes and may facilitate adaptive immune.删除4：<u>55</u>\nThis review has potential limitations. It mainly focuses on keratinocytes immune responses against bacteria and fungi. Defenses to viruses in keratinocytes remain to be discussed further. In the recognition part, PRRs expressed by keratinocytes and their ligands are introduced, while the detailed immune signaling are discussed briefly. In the following part, effector molecules including cytokines, chemokines and AMPs expressed by keratinocytes are listed. And the immune function of keratinocytes towards several pathogens are elaborated in this review. Keratinocytes may secrete different cytokines towards different pathogens. The inner connection of cytokines, chemokines and the mechanism of AMPs secretion are not very clearly described in this review, which need to be explored and perfected in the future.\nBesides keratinocytes, other nonmyeloid cells in the skin like dermal adipocytes, fibroblasts, melanocytes, and sebocytes are proved to participate in innate immune responses against pathogens.删除4：<u>43,56,57</u> Recently, adipocytes are illustrated to produce cathelicidin AMP against S. aureus and dermal fibroblasts have the proficiency to locally differentiate into adipocytes to defend against S. aureus.删除4：<u>56</u> Melanocytes in epidermis express melanin against C. albicans.删除4：<u>57</u> In light of these observations, the skin as an important protective barrier for human body, keratinocytes and many other component cells of which are shown to participate in this anti-infection process.

Individualized surgical approach was adopted according to the location of hematoma and the rupture. Lateral ventricle frontal angle approach was used for the anteromedial group, and the lateral ventricle triangle approach was used for the posterolateral group. After anesthesia in the operating room, the patient lay in supine position. The patient's head was positioned in the middle or tilted to the opposite side for anteromedial and posterolateral THBIVs, respectively. Then, we made a 5-cm straight scalp incision, developed a bone window (approximately 3 cm in diameter), and incised the dura mater in a cross shape. A transparent endoscopic sheath (Goldbov Optoelectronic Technology Co.

Then, under direct vision, the lateral ventricular hematoma was identified and cleared, the hematoma rupture of ventricular wall where the thalamic hematoma entered was found, and the thalamic hematoma was removed through this rupture . If active bleeding occurred, we obtained complete hemostasis using bipolar electrocoagulation and hemostatic materials. One ventricular drainage tube was retained before closing the incision. Posterolateral THBIV cases were routinely treated with combined ES and EVD through the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle.\nPostoperative CT was performed to confirm the drainage tube position and evaluate the residual hematoma in all cases. Residual hematomas were liquified using a fibrinolysis agent (20,000 urokinase/5 mL saline solution) injected into the lateral ventricle, the hematoma cavity, or both every 12 h. Urokinase injections were discontinued when the hematoma was eliminated or could no longer be reduced based on the CT scan.

CT images of 3 typical cases of posterolateral THBIV is shown in Fig. 4.\nIn this study, we proposed an individualized ES strategy for minimally invasive treatment of THBIV. To our knowledge, no definite ES strategy for THBIV based on the classification of thalamic hematoma has been reported in the current literature. Furthermore, we compared the efficacy and safety of ES with conventional HPD and EVD and found that the effect of ES with individualized strategies was better than that of HPD and EVD.\nThe purpose of ICH surgery is to relieve pathological damage caused by hematoma and improve the prognosis of patients. THBIV has two important pathological effects. Firstly, because the thalamus is inside the internal capsule separated from the lateral and third ventricles only by the ventricular wall, the hematoma usually extends into the ventricular system, damages the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and compresses the midbrain and cerebral aqueduct, which can lead to acute obstructive hydrocephalus, paralysis, or even death. Secondly, the effects of the thalamic hematoma (especially of those over 10 mL) and its associated edema progress over time, resulting in secondary injury and neurological deterioration after the first day.删除4：<u>21,22</u> Examples include the occurrence of chronic hydrocephalus caused by long periods of poor cerebrospinal fluid circulation and the toxic effects of blood decomposition products on the ventricular wall.删除4：<u>6</u> Therefore, managing both ventricular and thalamic hematomas at the same time relieves the cerebrospinal fluid circulation disorder caused by the hematoma and third ventrical compression, which substantially improves the prognosis of patients with THBIV.\nTherefore, we used the transventricular approach to remove intraventricular and thalamic hematomas. This approach is parallel to the nerve fibers to protect white matter fibers and thus can minimize nerve damage.删除4：<u>23</u> The procedures were also based on the location of the thalamic hematoma and the rupture. Lateral ventricle frontal angle approach was used for the anteromedial group, and the lateral ventricle triangle approach was used for the posterolateral group. First, the ventricular hematoma should be cleared, then the thalamic hematoma should be removed through the rupture of the hematoma, which would avoid new damage to the thalamic nucleus. In this way, not only the hematoma can be cleared to the maximum extent, but also the damage to brain tissue can be minimized. As the thalamus has complex nerve nuclei and is located in the medial part of the internal capsule, the transtemporal approach will damage the capsule, and thalamotomy through the corpus callosum to remove a hematoma also destroys the thalamic nuclei.\nDefinitive operative treatments for intracerebral hematomas have not been established until the present. In the past several decades craniotomy with hematoma evacuation was the treatment of choice.删除4：<u>24</u> However, several recent randomized trials that compared operative and conservative medical treatments failed to show that surgery led to a greater improvement in neurological outcomes.删除4：<u>3,4</u> The injury to brain tissue that accompanies a craniotomy may offset the benefit of surgical hematoma evacuation and intracranial pressure reduction. The lack of clear benefit after a craniotomy has led many surgeons to choose minimally invasive techniques for intracerebral hematoma evacuation. Three minimally invasive surgical procedures are commonly used to treat THBIV, i.e. EVD alone, HPD ＋EVD and ES ＋EVD.\nIn the present study, EVD alone successfully treated acute hydrocephalus. However, blood cleared slowly from the ventricles, so the effects of the blood clot mass and toxic blood breakdown products were not addressed.删除4：<u>6,7,25</u> Moreover, the mass effect of the thalamic hematoma and surrounding edema caused persistent compression of the third ventricle, resulting in chronic obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid circulation that required long-term (generally over a week) EVD, which increased the risk of complications and poor outcome.删除4：<u>26</u> HPD removes both ventricular and thalamic hematomas and alleviates hydrocephalus and the hematoma mass effect to some extent. In our study, the outcome after HPD was better than that after EVD, consistent with the findings of Liu et al.删除4：<u>10</u> However, HPD had low clearance efficiency, usually taking approximately 3-7 days, which increased the risk of secondary hematoma-related brain injury.\nES quickly and effectively removes a hematoma and stops the related bleeding under direct vision. Our research showed that ES could minimize hematoma-related brain tissue damage, thus reducing the incidence of CVD and improving the neurological outcome without increasing patient complications. Chen et al.16 also investigated endoscopic and EVD treatment in patients with a lateral THBIV and showed that ES reduces the occurrence of chronic hydrocephalus, similar to our findings. However, in their study, ES did not improve patient prognosis, which is not consistent with our results. This inconsistency may be related to the difference in case selection criteria between the studies. Chen et al.27 only required THBIV, while we included only patients with a thalamic hematoma volume greater than 10 mL because hematoma volume is a factor that influences the prognosis in patients with an ICH.\nOur preliminary study shows that, compared to EVD and HPD, ES can achieve faster hematoma clearance with less trauma, decrease ventricular drainage time and the incidence of CVD, and achieve better outcomes in patients with THBIV. Although there is still no high-quality, evidence-based medical evidence, we believe that with the development of science and technology, minimally invasive surgery and neuroendoscopy will be more widely used in the future.\nOur study has several limitations. It was a retrospective study and included a relatively small number of cases from a single center. Therefore, a well-designed prospective trial with a larger number of cases is essential to clarify these issues and provide more convincing results.\nNeuroendoscopy is a minimally invasive, rapid, and efficient technique for the treatment of THBIV. Our preliminary results showed that ES with individualized strategies should be performed in patients with THBIV and a thalamic hematoma volume of 10-30 mL to reduce the drainage time and probability of CVD and improve outcomes without increasing mortality, especially in anteromedial cases.\n删除3：<u>Nil.</u>\nThe hospital ethics committee approved the study protocol, and informed consent was obtained from all patients or the patient's family.\n删除7：<u>The authors declare that the article content was composed in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</u>\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2019.08.003.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2019.08.003</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": ".15,16", "content": "【0】Thalamic hemorrhage accounts for 10%-15% of cases of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and frequently extends into the ventricles, thus accompanying a high mortality and disability rate.删除4：<u>1,2</u> Because the thalamus is located deep within the brain, it is difficult to treat a thalamic hemorrhage successfully by traditional craniotomy or microsurgery, and attempts to do so are associated with serious side effects.删除4：<u>3,4</u> External ventricular drainage (EVD) is routinely performed for a thalamic hemorrhage breaking into ventricles (THBIV),5 but this approach alone is often not sufficiently effective in improving the poor prognosis of patients with severe intraventricular hemorrhage.删除4：<u>6,7</u> Minimally invasive surgery, including endoscopic surgery (ES) and hematoma puncture and drainage (HPD), has great potential for the treatment of deep cerebral hematomas and may improve patient prognosis.删除4：<u>8,9,10,11</u> The development of neuroendoscopy technology allows surgery in long and slender channels with good illumination and multi-angle vision, which facilitates the treatment of deep hematomas without increasing the complication rate.删除4：<u>12,13,14</u> Chen et al.15,16 used ES to remove ventricular & lateral thalamic hematomas and showed that the incidence of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus was significantly lower compared with EVD surgery.

A transparent endoscopic sheath (Goldbov Optoelectronic Technology Co.

Then, under direct vision, the lateral ventricular hematoma was identified and cleared, the hematoma rupture of ventricular wall where the thalamic hematoma entered was found, and the thalamic hematoma was removed through this rupture .

No significant differences were obtained in the rates of rebleeding, intracranial infection and mortality (p > 0.05). However mRS score was slightly different from anteromedial group. The data between ES and HPD subgroups showed no difference (both median 3), which were much better than those in EVD subgroup (median 3.75, p < 0.05) . CT images of 3 typical cases of posterolateral THBIV is shown in Fig. 4.\nIn this study, we proposed an individualized ES strategy for minimally invasive treatment of THBIV. To our knowledge, no definite ES strategy for THBIV based on the classification of thalamic hematoma has been reported in the current literature. Furthermore, we compared the efficacy and safety of ES with conventional HPD and EVD and found that the effect of ES with individualized strategies was better than that of HPD and EVD.\nThe purpose of ICH surgery is to relieve pathological damage caused by hematoma and improve the prognosis of patients. THBIV has two important pathological effects. Firstly, because the thalamus is inside the internal capsule separated from the lateral and third ventricles only by the ventricular wall, the hematoma usually extends into the ventricular system, damages the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and compresses the midbrain and cerebral aqueduct, which can lead to acute obstructive hydrocephalus, paralysis, or even death. Secondly, the effects of the thalamic hematoma (especially of those over 10 mL) and its associated edema progress over time, resulting in secondary injury and neurological deterioration after the first day.删除4：<u>21,22</u> Examples include the occurrence of chronic hydrocephalus caused by long periods of poor cerebrospinal fluid circulation and the toxic effects of blood decomposition products on the ventricular wall.删除4：<u>6</u> Therefore, managing both ventricular and thalamic hematomas at the same time relieves the cerebrospinal fluid circulation disorder caused by the hematoma and third ventrical compression, which substantially improves the prognosis of patients with THBIV.\nTherefore, we used the transventricular approach to remove intraventricular and thalamic hematomas. This approach is parallel to the nerve fibers to protect white matter fibers and thus can minimize nerve damage.删除4：<u>23</u> The procedures were also based on the location of the thalamic hematoma and the rupture. Lateral ventricle frontal angle approach was used for the anteromedial group, and the lateral ventricle triangle approach was used for the posterolateral group. First, the ventricular hematoma should be cleared, then the thalamic hematoma should be removed through the rupture of the hematoma, which would avoid new damage to the thalamic nucleus. In this way, not only the hematoma can be cleared to the maximum extent, but also the damage to brain tissue can be minimized. As the thalamus has complex nerve nuclei and is located in the medial part of the internal capsule, the transtemporal approach will damage the capsule, and thalamotomy through the corpus callosum to remove a hematoma also destroys the thalamic nuclei.\nDefinitive operative treatments for intracerebral hematomas have not been established until the present. In the past several decades craniotomy with hematoma evacuation was the treatment of choice.删除4：<u>24</u> However, several recent randomized trials that compared operative and conservative medical treatments failed to show that surgery led to a greater improvement in neurological outcomes.删除4：<u>3,4</u> The injury to brain tissue that accompanies a craniotomy may offset the benefit of surgical hematoma evacuation and intracranial pressure reduction. The lack of clear benefit after a craniotomy has led many surgeons to choose minimally invasive techniques for intracerebral hematoma evacuation. Three minimally invasive surgical procedures are commonly used to treat THBIV, i.e. EVD alone, HPD ＋EVD and ES ＋EVD.\nIn the present study, EVD alone successfully treated acute hydrocephalus. However, blood cleared slowly from the ventricles, so the effects of the blood clot mass and toxic blood breakdown products were not addressed.删除4：<u>6,7,25</u> Moreover, the mass effect of the thalamic hematoma and surrounding edema caused persistent compression of the third ventricle, resulting in chronic obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid circulation that required long-term (generally over a week) EVD, which increased the risk of complications and poor outcome.删除4：<u>26</u> HPD removes both ventricular and thalamic hematomas and alleviates hydrocephalus and the hematoma mass effect to some extent. In our study, the outcome after HPD was better than that after EVD, consistent with the findings of Liu et al.删除4：<u>10</u> However, HPD had low clearance efficiency, usually taking approximately 3-7 days, which increased the risk of secondary hematoma-related brain injury.\nES quickly and effectively removes a hematoma and stops the related bleeding under direct vision. Our research showed that ES could minimize hematoma-related brain tissue damage, thus reducing the incidence of CVD and improving the neurological outcome without increasing patient complications. Chen et al.16 also investigated endoscopic and EVD treatment in patients with a lateral THBIV and showed that ES reduces the occurrence of chronic hydrocephalus, similar to our findings. However, in their study, ES did not improve patient prognosis, which is not consistent with our results. This inconsistency may be related to the difference in case selection criteria between the studies. Chen et al.27 only required THBIV, while we included only patients with a thalamic hematoma volume greater than 10 mL because hematoma volume is a factor that influences the prognosis in patients with an ICH.\nOur preliminary study shows that, compared to EVD and HPD, ES can achieve faster hematoma clearance with less trauma, decrease ventricular drainage time and the incidence of CVD, and achieve better outcomes in patients with THBIV. Although there is still no high-quality, evidence-based medical evidence, we believe that with the development of science and technology, minimally invasive surgery and neuroendoscopy will be more widely used in the future.\nOur study has several limitations. It was a retrospective study and included a relatively small number of cases from a single center. Therefore, a well-designed prospective trial with a larger number of cases is essential to clarify these issues and provide more convincing results.\nNeuroendoscopy is a minimally invasive, rapid, and efficient technique for the treatment of THBIV. Our preliminary results showed that ES with individualized strategies should be performed in patients with THBIV and a thalamic hematoma volume of 10-30 mL to reduce the drainage time and probability of CVD and improve outcomes without increasing mortality, especially in anteromedial cases.\n删除3：<u>Nil.</u>\nThe hospital ethics committee approved the study protocol, and informed consent was obtained from all patients or the patient's family.\n删除7：<u>The authors declare that the article content was composed in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</u>\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2019.08.003.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2019.08.003</u>", "index": 0, "show": true, "start": 0, "end": 135, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2019.08.003.\n\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2019.08.003", "content": "<mark>The hospital ethics committee approved the study protocol, and informed consent was obtained from all patients or the patient’s family.</mark> accompanying a high mortality and disability rate.删除4：<u>1,2</u> Because the thalamus is located deep within the brain, it is difficult to treat a thalamic hemorrhage successfully by traditional craniotomy or microsurgery, and attempts to do so are associated with serious side effects.删除4：<u>3,4</u> External ventricular drainage (EVD) is routinely performed for a thalamic hemorrhage breaking into ventricles (THBIV),5 but this approach alone is often not sufficiently effective in improving the poor prognosis of patients with severe intraventricular hemorrhage.删除4：<u>6,7</u> Minimally invasive surgery, including endoscopic surgery (ES) and hematoma puncture and drainage (HPD), has great potential for the treatment of deep cerebral hematomas and may improve patient prognosis.删除4：<u>8,9,10,11</u> The development of neuroendoscopy technology allows surgery in long and slender channels with good illumination and multi-angle vision, which facilitates the treatment of deep hematomas without increasing the complication rate.删除4：<u>12,13,14</u> Chen et al<mark>.15,16</mark> used ES to remove ventricular & lateral thalamic hematomas and showed that the incidence of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus was significantly lower compared with EVD surgery.

Usually, the operation was performed when the patient had decreased consciousness and acute hydrocephalus caused by intraventricular hemorrhage or thalamic hemorrhage.\nWe categorized the patients into the anteromedial and posterolateral groups based on THBIV location. Then the two groups were further divided into the ES, HPD, and EVD subgroups based on the surgery approaches. We recorded baseline characteristics upon admission for each patient, including sex; age; systolic blood pressure (SBP); THV; Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score and Graeb score; history of hypertension, diabetes or aspirin intake; and time to surgery after ictus.\nTraditional EVDs were performed in an operating room with the patient in the supine position under general anesthesia. Usually, an intraventricular catheter was placed in the frontal horn of the unilateral lateral ventricle at 10 cm H2O, but when severe casting of both lateral ventricles was present, bilateral EVDs were required.\nPatients underwent EVD, followed by HPD under general anesthesia. A soft catheter was placed into the hematoma through a burr hole positioned using preoperative computed tomography (CT) image guidance to avoid blood vessels and functional domains. The fluid component of the clot was drained or lightly sucked out using a 5-mL syringe.\n3D slicer software 删除6：<u></u> was routinely used to simulate the surgical approach, and its length and angle were calculated . Individualized surgical approach was adopted according to the location of hematoma and the rupture. Lateral ventricle frontal angle approach was used for the anteromedial group, and the lateral ventricle triangle approach was used for the posterolateral group. After anesthesia in the operating room, the patient lay in supine position. The patient's head was positioned in the middle or tilted to the opposite side for anteromedial and posterolateral THBIVs, respectively. Then, we made a 5-cm straight scalp incision, developed a bone window (approximately 3 cm in diameter), and incised the dura mater in a cross shape. A transparent endoscopic sheath (Goldbov Optoelectronic Technology Co. Ltd, Wuhan, China) was introduced after successfully puncturing the lateral ventricle, and a rigid neuroendoscope (0° or 30° observation mirror, Richard-wolf Company, Germany) was used. Then, under direct vision, the lateral ventricular hematoma was identified and cleared, the hematoma rupture of ventricular wall where the thalamic hematoma entered was found, and the thalamic hematoma was removed through this rupture . If active bleeding occurred, we obtained complete hemostasis using bipolar electrocoagulation and hemostatic materials. One ventricular drainage tube was retained before closing the incision. Posterolateral THBIV cases were routinely treated with combined ES and EVD through the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle.\nPostoperative CT was performed to confirm the drainage tube position and evaluate the residual hematoma in all cases. Residual hematomas were liquified using a fibrinolysis agent (20,000 urokinase/5 mL saline solution) injected into the lateral ventricle, the hematoma cavity, or both every 12 h. Urokinase injections were discontinued when the hematoma was eliminated or could no longer be reduced based on the CT scan. When we found no further reduction in the cerebrospinal fluid blood content, the EVD was sequentially weaned in daily increments of 5 cm H2O and removed. If hydrocephalus or decreased consciousness occurred during the weaning process, we placed a permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

Two readers independently depicted the segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Reasons we could not analyze the pulmonary artery or that led to misdiagnosis of pulmonary embolism were evaluated, including the degree of contrast enhancement of the main pulmonary artery, and factors that caused misdiagnosis of PE (flow-related artifacts, partial volume artifact, beam-hardening artifacts and enhancement of pulmonary vein). The independent samples t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson chi-square test were applied.Results There were no significant differences in image quality of segmental and subsegmental arteries between the two groups.

For example, a recent paper on modelling Lassa Fever stated; 'participatory modelling and ethnographic research would be an in- valuable tool to assess the variety of practices and settings in which people come into contact with each other’s urine and other body fluids, perceptions of risk, and approaches to hygiene’ 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. However as Leach and Scoones 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> pointed out there is a lot of research which could benefit from including a participatory approach e.g. 通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14]</u>. With increased collaboration, participatory research can be further utilised for effective integration of mathematical modelling, fieldwork and data. Likewise, there is much to be gained from the potential benefits to programmatic work of increased dissemination and knowledge transfer to communities in a suitable format. The problem is, of course, complex and it will require 'reflexivity, humility and interaction amongst modellers, policymakers and those living with diseases’ in order to be implemented successfully 通用删除6(英):<u>[6,15]</u>.\nControlling zoonotic disease outbreaks has become ever more important; it has been estimated that since 1940, about 60 % of the emerging infectious diseases affecting humans globally, but mainly in developing countries, have originated from animals, both domestic and wild 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Additionally, One Health research potentially offers great benefits compared to traditional, singledisciplinary research, with participatory research adding people’s own cultural logic and potentially alternative, policy-relevant perspectives compatible with local cultural values and livelihood priorities.\nResearch which seeks to integrate different methodological perspectives, has shown that participatory research can add context, depth, legitimacy and accuracy to the modelling approaches of other disciplines, and it can be particularly useful when investigating climate and anthropogenic environmental change as drivers of disease emergence. This paper discusses the potential value of participatory approaches for process-based modelling and the models are described as part of the case study examples and in detail in previous papers 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\nThe evidence for this paper is based on One Health research on zoonoses which employed five methodological themes across five African country case studies over a two year fieldwork period in which four zoonotic diseases were considered. The case study diseases and countries focused on are described in Table 1. The consortium which conducted this research has an ethics policy in place, an appointed country lead for ethics in each of the five countries it is working in and the appropriate ethics approvals have been sought. The ethics committees which provided approval were: The Institu- tional Review Board of the Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical Research, Ghana, African Medical and Research Foundation Ethics and Scientific Review Committee (AMREF-ESRC), Kenya, ERES Converge IRB, Zambia, The Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body, University of Edinburgh for Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee (SLESRC), Sierra Leone.\nCase study diseases, dynamics and poverty impacts and some modelling issues\n删除重复语句：<u>Case study diseases, dynamics and poverty impacts and some modelling issues</u>\nThe methodological themes used in the research, and providing the basis for this paper are macro-ecological modelling, process based modelling (based on a theoretical understanding of relevant bio-physical and social processes and includes many approaches), participatory methods, socio-economic methods (including systems dynamics representations) and political economy of knowledge analysis .\nAn outline of the two main methods\n删除重复语句：<u>An outline of the two main methods</u>\nThe participatory methods and techniques which were used are outlined in this section as well as the usefulness of participatory research for integrative modelling, first with a diagram illustrating how it can be utilised, followed by case study examples and the findings of this research and how it contributed to other modelling approaches. Participatory methods used in the case study countries included two types of participatory mapping, including landscape mapping and village epidemiological mapping. Landscape mapping focuses on a village territory in its entirety, with people mapping out and marking who goes where and why on a spatial map, including seasonal movements and sightings of animal disease vectors.\nThe above method contrasts with village epidemiological mapping, which maps a village area, showing which families live where, the relationships between people and animal movements, and possible risk areas for disease (e.g. toilets, garbage areas, wells). In addition, the map marks households where people have had fevers in order to visualise the patterns of disease, and explore the reasons why people believe that certain individuals have been sick, for example, for spatial, structural or personal reasons, with notes of this discussion taken. Epidemiological maps created at different time points can feed into (or at least help contextualise and explain) process-based epidemiological modelling, as well as link with serological and disease surveys. The maps, having a 'social’ element, can also become the basis of wealth and poverty ranking exercises or structured surveys.\nOther participatory methods undertaken included transect walks, livelihood profiles and participatory matrices. This involved walking through a particular landscape with villagers observing different land and ecosystem types, as marked on participatory maps. The observations are used as an opportunity for 'on the spot’ conversations and gathering further information, for example, where animals or disease vectors are seen, where particular activities are carried out seasonally (seasonal calendars can also mark this), or where particular ecosystem services are used.\nLivelihood profiles explore different sources of livelihood and income, how they are affected by access to, and control over, land and labour and the relationship between sources of livelihood 'for the household’ and those controlled by individuals on their own account. Detailed guidance on these techniques have been produced. Participatory matrices were used to make a relative comparison between different options, and to make a detailed analysis of how much, why and how people make decisions. More detail can be found in published research e.g. 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\nTo be able to replicate the above techniques, the importance of empowerment of local communities, training for those leading participatory research and a genuine understanding of communities are essential to ensure integration and representation of local knowledge and aspirations, and this depends on issues of 'trust between holders of knowledge, process facilitators and the eventual users of knowledge’ 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. A wide range of research on participatory mapping is available, allowing for understanding and replication of these techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,18,19]</u>.\nAdditionally, assessing local people’s interests is critical to the continuation of activities beyond the active research period; it maximises the likelihood of making policy decisions that extend beyond the lifetime of projects and of providing incentives and guarantees that all, or a sufficient number of, people will contribute towards the creation of a public good 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u>. As we know from Ferguson’s Anti Politics Machine 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> and from the many transactional works by Barth, Bailey and others, some reluctance stems from fears of local populations changing the implementation of technologies in line with local objectives and understandings, away from scientific and technical advice. There appears to be little effort to address this shortfall 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. The Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE), with its research groups interfacing with ecologists in the Zambezi Valley, represents a good example of a project focusing on creation of local awareness of studied issues 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. However, even in this case efforts have generally stopped short of including local communities’ knowledge and expertise as evidence for decisionmaking and involving communities in policy decisions.\nSupport for interdisciplinary and integrative approaches may potentially help mitigate the impact of disease on people’s health, lives and livelihoods. They can also create legitimacy for science, and lay the foundation for the adoption of policy. Case studies, such as those presented in this paper, can help build One Health, giving detailed examination of the impact of participatory approaches on integrative modelling frameworks. This can also be transferred to help build much-needed effective practice as there is a need for well-functioning, integrated research, surveillance and practice in zoonotic diseases across the human and animal sectors.\nA mathematical system is a simplified representation of reality and anything outside the system is disregarded. This is inevitable to avoid the mathematics becoming intractable. However, participatory research can be combined with theoretical models to complement, and in some cases add, realism and accuracy to mathematical models.\nA fundamental way in which participatory approaches can aid mathematical modelling is by helping to define the appropriate model and its structure. By this, we mean the choice of modelling approach (e.g. a continu- ous population model vs ABM 通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26,27]</u>), model specification (e.g. its inputs and the functional form of their distribution), and the domain of interest (e.g. relevant space of parameters). Meaningful interpretation of the findings of the model is another area in which participatory research can be highly valuable.\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 illustrates a basic conceptualisation of knowledge in which the set of our beliefs is represented within the large circle (white region, labelled 'Current Knowledge’) and ignorance outside the circle (blue region, labelled 'Ignorance’). The smaller circles (orange region, labelled 'Error’) represent the part of our beliefs which are in fact false. The remaining space within the large circle represents our beliefs which turn out to be true (or at least sufficiently so). Given this knowledge framework we can only choose a model with a specification 通用删除1(英):<u>(represented by the purple, medium circle and labelled 'Initial Model’ in Fig. 1a)</u> which falls within the large circle of our beliefs ('Current Knowledge’) as it is impossible to model something about which we are completely ignorant .</u>\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1b illustrates the benefits of best practice use of participatory research. It shows how its employment can lead to a move beyond the constraints of limited, current knowledge towards a more representative and, thus, useful model specification. This is summarised in the figure as an 'Optimal Model’ (green region). Of course, an Optimal Model is not omniscience (total, perfect knowledge), but it is the best representation of reality containing only the necessary and sufficient information to address the questions of interest. While the model in Fig. 1 is highly abstract, it is useful in illustrating the key ways in which participatory approaches can improve model specification:</u>\nRemoving ignorance. Interacting with local communities can provide information that we did not know a priori. Examples of this are given in the case studies below .Confirming our a priori knowledge. Outputs from participatory research can corroborate our prior understanding.Removing irrelevant information. Participatory research can help to eliminate components of the system that it turns out do not influence the prediction; for example, human movements to market when no vectors of disease have ever been encountered going to market.Including neglected information. Participatory research can remind us of things that we already knew, but had neglected. For example, the theoretical model for Rift Valley fever includes the temporal dynamics of water bodies, which initially was assumed to be driven solely by the environment (seasonal rainfall and evaporation), while anthropogenic activities, although accepted in principle, were not considered of practical relevance. However, participatory research revealed that these patterns can also be driven and altered by irrigation practice during the dry season.Removing erroneous information. Participatory research can correct errors in our thinking; things that we thought were true, but which turn out to be false. For example, modelling spatial movements of goat populations (which may otherwise be an important component of the system), when it turns out that goats do not forage in the area, or investigated source of periodicity in disease transmission when it emerges that the seasonality is an artifact of detection.\nRemoving ignorance.

Beyond this, we describe the utility of participatory research for identifying the most relevant parameters of the system, identifying the most relevant regime of the system (e.g. temporal stability or otherwise), the feedbacks from mathematical models to guide participatory research and going beyond the so-far described two-way interplay between participatory and mathematical approaches to consider the integration of multiple methods and frameworks.\nIn Sierra Leone, information on livelihoods, lifestyle and movements was collected using participatory techniques, with the mathematical modeller contributing to this fieldwork to enable specific questions to be asked. This allowed the model to be altered, allowing for important influencing factors to be included. For example, it emerged that farmers burn their fields after harvesting. This practice is important because it may drive potentially infected rodent species towards the villages seasonally. Thus, the model structure could be amended to include a periodically varying rate of contact with humans 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>.\nAdditionally, participatory research found that farmers take their threshed rice into barns in their settlements and rodents follow this food source. Also, women mainly culti- vate the lowlands after the rice harvest by brushing and clearing emerging weeds and residual rice stalks before burning them. Thereafter, male labour is hired to make mostly raised beds for the cultivation of vegetables. The findings from the participatory research reveal more complex patterns in the contact rate with infected rodents and also with infected humans. Modelling such contact rates with a single numerical value is an oversimplification and the effects of different functional forms for the exposure ought to be assessed 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>.\nThe complex socio-behavioral patterns in contact rates may also help identify characteristics of 'super spreader’ human disease transmitters who are individuals who can infect a disproportionately large pool of susceptible people 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Super-spreading events have been docu- mented for many infectious diseases, but the underlying reasons for super-spreading are not fully understood通用删除6(英):<u>[29,30,31,32,33,34,35]</u>. These probably involve a concomitant range of factors, including physiologic, (e.g. the amount of pathogen excreted, length of the infectious period) social behavior and environmental factors.\nThere has been some suggestion that incidence of Lassa fever in humans is higher during the dry season, although this view is currently challenged and admissions to Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) appear to occur uniformly during the year (Dr. Donald Grant, personal communication) 通用删除6(英):<u>[36,37]</u>. Identifying seasonal patterns from the date of admission to hospital 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> is rather challenging due to the limited temporal domain of the data (four years) and a change in policy during the time of collection 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>. Instead, we found that it was more effective to prioritise participatory research to assess whether or not the apparent seasonal incidence of Lassa fever in humans is an effect of data collection by, or reporting to, the hospital. Participatory modelling was employed to gauge infrastructure quality (roads are often flooded during the rainy season), economic and social factors (people have limited economic resources in the rainy season), and assess how this affects the reliability of data collection by, or reporting to, the hospital. The outcomes from participatory research indicated the nature of the mathematical approach (seasonal or non-seasonal).\nAn objective was to estimate the proportion of the burden of Lassa fever in Sierra Leone associated with human-to-human transmission only 通用删除6(英):<u>[2,40,41]</u>. The mathematical approach relies on the assumption that the infectious indi- viduals admitted to KGH 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> mix uniformly with susceptible individuals throughout the entire Sierra Leonean population. The rationale behind this is the so-called 'law of mass action’ 通用删除6(英):<u>[2,6]</u>, a common assumption in epidemiology. Adoption of the law of mass action was supported by previous evidence of large human mobility in Sierra Leone for livelihoods, work and trade, social visits, events 通用删除6(英):<u>[42,43]</u> and also escaping conflicts 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>. However, it is essential to acknowledge that inputting the actual patterns of mobility and social networking, and hence potential contact patterns, is likely to increase the accuracy of the mathematical approach, and this represents an area where participatory modelling can contribute and is much needed.\nSimilar integrative efforts were made using further information from fieldwork in Sierra Leone. Focus group discussions and transect walks revealed where different people and rodents go at different times of year. Youths and adults with unrestricted access to uplands cultivate rice in mixed stands at the beginning of the rainy season (May to June) and the owners of lowland fields (mostly male heads of households) cultivate rice in pure stands from the middle of the rainy season (July to August). In the dry season (November to April), the post-rice lowland fields are accessed mainly by women and female youths to cultivate mainly market-oriented vegetables. At this time, resident and migrant youths and adult males instead engaged in mining minerals (diamonds in our case study sites) as well as preparing upland fields for the ensuing rainy season. Moreover, participatory mapping at different times in the farming calendar re- vealed that some rodent species are confined to the cultivated fields and nearby fallow bushes throughout the cropping season, while others migrate permanently to the settlements after the harvesting of rice in both upland and lowland fields, giving some insight into risks of contact with rodents by different groups. Similarly, Kernéis et al. provided detailed information on prevalence and risk factors of Lassa (e.g. history of collecting, cutting and eating rats) stratified by age, giving precedence for this approach 通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u>. Based on such information, which indicates non-homogeneous mixing, it is possible to build a more complicated model structure to capture some of these effects. One possible approach is, for example, to adopt a cluster-based inference of the reproduction number by combining the information from participatory research, and/or from Kernéis et al. with age distribution from hospitalised patients at KGH to build a matrix of transmission rates among age groups and between rodents and each age group 通用删除6(英):<u>[45,46,47]</u>.\nIt was revealed during focus groups and participatory mapping with different gender and age focus groups that rodent species, confined to the cultivated and fallow fields, are hunted for meat by humans using dogs and nets because they are \"sweet and oily\" . This, is in spite of having being informed of their potentially harmful ef- fect on human health by the KGH’s Lassa Fever Project operating mainly in the case study districts. For those rodent species that migrate into settlements after the rice harvests, the focus group participants indicated that they come into contact with humans through droplets of their faeces and urine from the ceilings of mainly poorly structured houses, mainly occupied by poor people, that contaminate unprotected food and water. It is clearly important, that any modelling approach focusing on ex- posure and risk factors, needs to consider these parame- ters and not only official assurances that people know that rodent meat is dangerous.\nAn ABM is a class of computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents, both individual and/or collective entities such as organisations or groups, with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole 通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u>. ABMs are particularly suited to integrate with participatory research as both are potentially holistic and both, thus, share a common potential for integration 通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>.\nParticipatory research can assist in minimising the error between actual and simulated activities of agents and, thus, lead to a more realistic model. For example, in Zambia in relation to modelling daily activity patterns it was possible through participatory research to capture the types of activities undertaken by the different roles held within households, to capture the range of typical destinations and obtain a sense of the frequency and timing of visits (more specification of the model than estimation of parameters). It was then possible to validate the structure of a human movements questionnaire being delivered across the study region, which provided the additional quantitative data required to build the ABM (more estimation of parameters than specification of the model). Thus, participatory research delivered the what, where and why (i.e. qualitative information), whilst the social survey augmented this with the specifics: where, when and how often (i.e. quantification).\nAlthough not used in this way in Zambia, part of the purpose of gathering participatory information can also be to condition human agent movement patterns within an ABM directly; capturing, for example, the time that an agent leaves the household, the direction and speed of their movement, the duration of their stay at their destination and when they return home. Thus, participatory mapping offers an alternative to social survey and diary keeping and, while all can be valid, the meaning and precision of the representation possible with participatory approaches can be important. For example, subtle changes in routes can affect contact probabilities and disease transmission rates in simulations 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>.\nParticipatory research may also provide insights into which parts of daily routines and livelihood activities are the most risky and which people are most at risk, for example, by gender, age group or livelihood 通用删除6(英):<u>[51,52,53]</u>. Consider that contact networks are key to transmission dynamics. ABMs offer the potential to build a contact network from the bottom up, conditional upon the model specification and using geographical boundary and initial conditions as constraints. At the same time, participatory approaches offer the possibility of targeting this contact information directly (e.g. ask participants where they encounter tsetse and how often). The interplay between these two sources of key information underpinning the transmission system (one conditioned by what is possible given assumptions and the other a direct but uncertain realisation) offers tantalising possibilities for confirmation or rejection of model structure as well as confirmation or rejection of the uncertain information gathered from communities.\nIn Zimbabwe, participatory mapping in Chitindiva village, dominated by the Korekore people, and Kabidza areas, that house Karanga migrants from south western Zimbabwe, showed that people encroach into forests infested with tsetse according to their ethnicity. Such knowledge will be useful in structuring the ABM model of the area. Similarly, in Zambia, participatory mapping revealed that villagers encountered tsetse in the cotton fields while farming, which was not expected to be a dominant response. This information needs to be integrated with tsetse data and predictive distributions of tsetse abundance which are a key input to the ABM.\nIn Zimbabwe, one objective was to estimate the prevalence of trypanosomiasis in cattle. Modellers operate under the assumption that trypanosomiasis is a function of animal movement. Through participatory research, it was found that movement of cattle is seasonally-based, and that this results in infected cattle from frontier (forested) areas passing disease to those in established villages long cleared of the fly, allowing for more representative modelling. Moreover, in Zimbabwe, participatory mapping has demonstrated that the wildlife population has changed through time as a result of agricultural intensification and animal poaching that has taken place to satisfy the urban demands for meat following the collapse of commercial agriculture. This information can be used to improve the accuracy of other models.\nParticipatory studies were used to inform the structure of a mathematical model being developed for RVF in Kenya. Participatory mapping and timelines were used to plot movement patterns of domestic animals between wet and dry season grazing grounds. The timing of such movements was captured, as well as the movement ranges of the various livestock species. The results suggested that cattle move more frequently and across wider spatial ranges than small ruminants, including sheep and goats. Participatory mapping also enabled the research team to identify areas where livestock come into direct or indirect contact with wildlife hosts. In some cases, communities were able to identify wildlife species that are common in these areas.\nThe above exercise also generated data on practices that increase the risk of RVF exposure in humans; these include taking care of sick animals, and disposal of carcasses and aborted fetuses (RVF causes a large number of abortions in domestic animals). In irrigated areas, both women and men take turns to guard their crops against marauding baboons and other wild birds, especially in late afternoon to early evening. This practice is thought to increase the chances of being bitten by mosquitoes, and hence the risk of exposure to RVF and other vector-borne diseases. These are critical pieces of information that are important in constructing the daily activity patterns of hosts in the model.\nFor the RVF model, participatory studies contributed to the development of the host module. The ages of cattle and sheep, the main hosts used in the model, were structured into four age classes based on the information obtained from participatory studies. Participatory rural appraisals conducted with the Somali pastoralists in the RVF study site identified the four cattle and sheep age groups as well as the durations that an animal would spend in each age class. Researchers used proportional piling techniques to determine the distribution of hosts by age class. This information was used to evaluate model predictions on host population sizes by age class.\nStability analysis can benefit from the inclusion of participatory data. In general terms, stability analysis contributes to understanding what happens when a system is perturbed. Common questions in stability analysis are whether or not small population perturbations will dampen out, returning the system to its equilibrium configuration, and if and how variation in the parameter values results in qualitative variation of the solution 通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>. Such analysis can be applied, for example, to seasonal systems 通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u>. Clearly, if something meaningful is to be interpreted from stability analysis we need to know which parameters are more likely to be subjected to variation compared to others. For example, one consortium case study involved studying the ecology of fruit bats in Ghana. In this case, participatory research assisted in identifying the relevant sources of perturbation. More precisely, it was found that bats are an important source of bush meat, and hunting is commonly practised 通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u>. This translates into a variational increase in the bat mortality rate, resulting in a more meaningful exploration of the space of parameters. The case study of RVF in Kenya is another pertinent example. The disease is largely associated with water bodies, which are breeding sites for the mosquitoes carrying the infection. Usually rainfall data are used as proxies for water bodies, however from participatory analysis it emerged that irrigation patterns can also play an important role in creating additional, temporarily varying breeding sites, with patterns potentially different from the rainfall cycle. Therefore the model for stability analysis of the system was amended to allow these additional patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>.\nIn Kenya, participatory methods such as relative incidence scoring were used to compare RVF incidences and case fatality rates among different livestock species and age classes. In this case, pastoral communities were involved in games and exercises that involved clustering livestock into different species and age classes, using counters such as pebbles or seeds. After this, pastoralists were asked to use past experiences of RVF to indicate their perceptions of the relative proportion of animals that would be affected (in terms of incidence, mortality or abortion) in each group. Data obtained from these exercises were used to weight case fatality and abortion rates, especially when age and species specific parameters were not available.\nMany theoretical approaches, e.g. stability analysis, emphasise equilibrium states. Participatory modelling can assist in determining whether or not the system has reached such an equilibrium configuration, identifying the possible causes leading to a disruption of the equilibrium. It can also direct the mathematical approach towards the rele- vant regime, that is, a transient regime rather than equilibrium. For instance, in recent years cashew nuts have become an important industry in Ghana 通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u>. According to preliminary outcomes from participatory modelling, the proliferation of large cashew nut plantations is currently affecting the dispersal patterns of fruit bats, a reser- voir of many viruses including Ebola, rabies and Nipah通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>. Related use of pesticides is also increasing with a potential effect on the survival of bats. In certain locations, the hunting patterns are also subjected to change, such as in the area around Tano sacred grove, the location of one of the largest roosts in Ghana, where the local chief has granted permission for hunting. All this information, emerging from interaction with the local community, suggests that in many cases the ecological system of bats is far from in an equilibrium situation.\nIn the Lassa fever case study in Sierra Leone, it was found through focus group discussions that rodents once inhabited forest lands, but as their habitat is being disturbed through farming, coupled with shortened fallow periods, they are now confined to less than five-year-old fallow farmlands. This information can be used to predict the equilibrium states of rodents in association with changes in land-use partners. The precision of the model using local knowledge could be improved when triangulated with the results from rodent trappings and monitoring of the species associated with land-use changes by both the epidemiological, environment and land-use teams in the project.\nThe examples above reveal the potential information flow from participatory approaches to mathematical modelling. Here, we present examples showing how outcomes from mathematical modelling can indicate further areas to be explored using participatory approaches.\nOne of the early findings of our theoretical approach was the relatively high impact of human-to-human transmission of Lassa fever. This might be associated with the long persistence of viruria, even during the recovery period, explaining the long time for shedding of the disease, especially in rural settlements where sanitary facilities are limited 通用删除6(英):<u>[60,61]</u>. Participatory modelling can use this information to explore new areas, for example effectively assessing the variety of practices and settings in which people come into contact with each other’s bodily fluids, and their approaches to hygiene. It was re- vealed through focus group discussions with different gender and age groups that rodents bite the limbs of inhabitants of dwelling places while they are asleep. This increases the chances of household members coming into contact with each other’s body fluids, particularly in poorly structured dwellings in both urban and rural locations in the case study sites. Participatory modelling could also be used to elucidate if and how caring behav- iour and the relative perceptions of risk change patterns of behaviour.\nIn Zimbabwe, data being gathered for an ABM have produced possible directions for participatory research. A precise record of human and animal movements obtained by questionnaire and simulation of human movements based on realistic constraints is helping to direct further questions. The questions in the survey of who actually moves rather than whether there is movement, and where people go and at what times, has directed participatory research to look at the politics of such movement.\nThe above examples have illustrated the potential benefits of one-way interactions between participatory and mathematical modelling approaches. However, the greater challenge is to integrate a wide range of different methodological approaches (which, in the case of our consortium, means five approaches).\nReliance on a single modelling approach is always risky as no model can claim to capture everything; reality is too complex to model in full. Different models highlight different issues and are based on different assumptions, world views and sources of information, leading to different conclusions about disease risk and the appropriate actions and policy decisions to take 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. This makes choosing one approach over another problematic. Interdisciplinary working can address these issues, embracing multiple sources of evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u>.\nFor example, in contrast with numerical datasets and various types of mathematical modelling, conceptual characterisations derived from ethnographic and participatory research offer contrasting views 'from the ground’, which may question dominant policy actions 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>, including feedback from local communities on the findings coming from traditional research, as well as the benefits of participatory research itself. This can lead to an enriched interpretation of research findings, integrating different disciplinary perspectives, and a wider-ranging translation of research. It can also mean that there is more opportunity for wider dissemination among many different audiences and that the integrated models will therefore be potentially more useful in practice and policy.\nThis is important to note because, at times, attention to local people in zoonotic disease research has come only when researchers’ non-participatory perspectives have centred around people, for example, when humans have become vectors themselves of the disease or when human impact on wildlife and the environment is being considered. In Zimbabwe, for example, people are frequently condemned for encroaching into wilderness areas, where tsetse abound, and importing trypanosomiasis back into mainstream society. Participatory approaches can provide local assessment and a rationale for local practices appearing to be a driver of disease, especially in areas where detailed data sources are often unavailable. Without local people’s input, models may provide predictions and explanations based only on a certain outsider account of actuality.\nThis paper argues that reality is too complex to be modelled by one modelling approach from one discipline; an integrated approach can increase the accuracy of models and understanding. Crossing professional, disciplinary and institutional boundaries, challenging as this may be, to work in a more integrated fashion can have great benefits通用删除6(英):<u>[62,63,64,65]</u>. The paper has focused on the many benefits of the use of participatory approaches to lead to more realistic mathematical models to assist with policy decisions aimed at reducing disease and benefiting local people.\nThis paper has also given examples that have demonstrated how participatory research can be guided by other methods, and the integration of multiple methods and frameworks. It must however be realised that participatory research is not a 'cheap alternative’ to collecting quantitative data 通用删除6(英):<u>[12,66]</u>. The value of participatory research is rather to highlight beliefs, behaviours and practices that are unfounded scientifically, thus, showing that its value can lie in its combination with other forms of data.\nThe types of possible integrative framework, including scenario planning, can be done with key stakeholders including local communities 通用删除6(英):<u>[67,68]</u>. For this to be successful there needs to exist an openness to new integrative approaches, and respect and collaboration among disciplines who may speak different languages 通用删除6(英):<u>[62,69]</u>. This, above all, is key to the success of interdisciplinary integration.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Multilingual abstracts in the six official working languages of the United Nations.

This is a belief that the emergence, risk, spread and control of diseases are affected by many complex bio-physical, en- vironmental and socio-economic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. There are many benefits of using interdisciplinary research methods, this paper concentrates on the use of participatory modelling and local perspectives to enhance mathematical modelling.\nModels are useful in disease research as they can pro- vide characterisations and predictions to advance knowledge, and evidence to inform management decisions and policy formation通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,4,5]</u>. However models also reproduce and are constructed based on their different disciplinary boundaries 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>, despite this they are seen as valid representations of the world associated with objectivity and rationality 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>. They are limited by the data available and are influenced by perspective and even the political and funding arena in which particular research may be occurring. In addition, flaws due to an uncritical use of mathematical modelling in life science has also been pointed out 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>. The persuasiveness of numerical data and 'quantitative authority’ can obscure the benefits of multidisciplinary collaboration, and the use of participatory research, which can make models and their predictions more useful for decision-making and policy formulation 通用删除6(英):<u>[6,9]</u>.\nThe benefits of participatory research are important to take into account as many projects are designed by epidemiologists, veterinarians or entomologists with little, if any, input from social scientists 通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u>. Additionally, debates related to infectious disease are often centred on professional and bureaucratic interests, while those actu- ally living with disease in poor and marginal areas have little or no say in the particular interests prioritised, or how they are studied. Commonly, local people and their leadership are considered insufficiently knowledgeable to engage in scientific debates on the issues that might affect them 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>.\nMoreover, local people can provide useful information, including data unavailable anywhere else, and this is being increasingly recognised 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>. For example, a recent paper on modelling Lassa Fever stated; 'participatory modelling and ethnographic research would be an in- valuable tool to assess the variety of practices and settings in which people come into contact with each other’s urine and other body fluids, perceptions of risk, and approaches to hygiene’ 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. However as Leach and Scoones 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> pointed out there is a lot of research which could benefit from including a participatory approach e.g. 通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14]</u>. With increased collaboration, participatory research can be further utilised for effective integration of mathematical modelling, fieldwork and data. Likewise, there is much to be gained from the potential benefits to programmatic work of increased dissemination and knowledge transfer to communities in a suitable format. The problem is, of course, complex and it will require 'reflexivity, humility and interaction amongst modellers, policymakers and those living with diseases’ in order to be implemented successfully 通用删除6(英):<u>[6,15]</u>.\nControlling zoonotic disease outbreaks has become ever more important; it has been estimated that since 1940, about 60 % of the emerging infectious diseases affecting humans globally, but mainly in developing countries, have originated from animals, both domestic and wild 通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>. Additionally, One Health research potentially offers great benefits compared to traditional, singledisciplinary research, with participatory research adding people’s own cultural logic and potentially alternative, policy-relevant perspectives compatible with local cultural values and livelihood priorities.\nResearch which seeks to integrate different methodological perspectives, has shown that participatory research can add context, depth, legitimacy and accuracy to the modelling approaches of other disciplines, and it can be particularly useful when investigating climate and anthropogenic environmental change as drivers of disease emergence. This paper discusses the potential value of participatory approaches for process-based modelling and the models are described as part of the case study examples and in detail in previous papers 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>.\nThe evidence for this paper is based on One Health research on zoonoses which employed five methodological themes across five African country case studies over a two year fieldwork period in which four zoonotic diseases were considered. The case study diseases and countries focused on are described in Table 1. The consortium which conducted this research has an ethics policy in place, an appointed country lead for ethics in each of the five countries it is working in and the appropriate ethics approvals have been sought. The ethics committees which provided approval were: The Institu- tional Review Board of the Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical Research, Ghana, African Medical and Research Foundation Ethics and Scientific Review Committee (AMREF-ESRC), Kenya, ERES Converge IRB, Zambia, The Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body, University of Edinburgh for Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee (SLESRC), Sierra Leone.\nCase study diseases, dynamics and poverty impacts and some modelling issues\n删除重复语句：<u>Case study diseases, dynamics and poverty impacts and some modelling issues</u>\nThe methodological themes used in the research, and providing the basis for this paper are macro-ecological modelling, process based modelling (based on a theoretical understanding of relevant bio-physical and social processes and includes many approaches), participatory methods, socio-economic methods (including systems dynamics representations) and political economy of knowledge analysis .\nAn outline of the two main methods\n删除重复语句：<u>An outline of the two main methods</u>\nThe participatory methods and techniques which were used are outlined in this section as well as the usefulness of participatory research for integrative modelling, first with a diagram illustrating how it can be utilised, followed by case study examples and the findings of this research and how it contributed to other modelling approaches. Participatory methods used in the case study countries included two types of participatory mapping, including landscape mapping and village epidemiological mapping. Landscape mapping focuses on a village territory in its entirety, with people mapping out and marking who goes where and why on a spatial map, including seasonal movements and sightings of animal disease vectors.\nThe above method contrasts with village epidemiological mapping, which maps a village area, showing which families live where, the relationships between people and animal movements, and possible risk areas for disease (e.g. toilets, garbage areas, wells). In addition, the map marks households where people have had fevers in order to visualise the patterns of disease, and explore the reasons why people believe that certain individuals have been sick, for example, for spatial, structural or personal reasons, with notes of this discussion taken. Epidemiological maps created at different time points can feed into (or at least help contextualise and explain) process-based epidemiological modelling, as well as link with serological and disease surveys. The maps, having a 'social’ element, can also become the basis of wealth and poverty ranking exercises or structured surveys.\nOther participatory methods undertaken included transect walks, livelihood profiles and participatory matrices. This involved walking through a particular landscape with villagers observing different land and ecosystem types, as marked on participatory maps. The observations are used as an opportunity for 'on the spot’ conversations and gathering further information, for example, where animals or disease vectors are seen, where particular activities are carried out seasonally (seasonal calendars can also mark this), or where particular ecosystem services are used.\nLivelihood profiles explore different sources of livelihood and income, how they are affected by access to, and control over, land and labour and the relationship between sources of livelihood 'for the household’ and those controlled by individuals on their own account. Detailed guidance on these techniques have been produced. Participatory matrices were used to make a relative comparison between different options, and to make a detailed analysis of how much, why and how people make decisions. More detail can be found in published research e.g. 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>.\nTo be able to replicate the above techniques, the importance of empowerment of local communities, training for those leading participatory research and a genuine understanding of communities are essential to ensure integration and representation of local knowledge and aspirations, and this depends on issues of 'trust between holders of knowledge, process facilitators and the eventual users of knowledge’ 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>. A wide range of research on participatory mapping is available, allowing for understanding and replication of these techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,18,19]</u>.\nAdditionally, assessing local people’s interests is critical to the continuation of activities beyond the active research period; it maximises the likelihood of making policy decisions that extend beyond the lifetime of projects and of providing incentives and guarantees that all, or a sufficient number of, people will contribute towards the creation of a public good 通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u>. As we know from Ferguson’s Anti Politics Machine 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> and from the many transactional works by Barth, Bailey and others, some reluctance stems from fears of local populations changing the implementation of technologies in line with local objectives and understandings, away from scientific and technical advice. There appears to be little effort to address this shortfall 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>. The Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE), with its research groups interfacing with ecologists in the Zambezi Valley, represents a good example of a project focusing on creation of local awareness of studied issues 通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>. However, even in this case efforts have generally stopped short of including local communities’ knowledge and expertise as evidence for decisionmaking and involving communities in policy decisions.\nSupport for interdisciplinary and integrative approaches may potentially help mitigate the impact of disease on people’s health, lives and livelihoods. They can also create legitimacy for science, and lay the foundation for the adoption of policy. Case studies, such as those presented in this paper, can help build One Health, giving detailed examination of the impact of participatory approaches on integrative modelling frameworks. This can also be transferred to help build much-needed effective practice as there is a need for well-functioning, integrated research, surveillance and practice in zoonotic diseases across the human and animal sectors.\nA mathematical system is a simplified representation of reality and anything outside the system is disregarded. This is inevitable to avoid the mathematics becoming intractable. However, participatory research can be combined with theoretical models to complement, and in some cases add, realism and accuracy to mathematical models.\nA fundamental way in which participatory approaches can aid mathematical modelling is by helping to define the appropriate model and its structure. By this, we mean the choice of modelling approach (e.g. a continu- ous population model vs ABM 通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26,27]</u>), model specification (e.g. its inputs and the functional form of their distribution), and the domain of interest (e.g. relevant space of parameters). Meaningful interpretation of the findings of the model is another area in which participatory research can be highly valuable.\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 illustrates a basic conceptualisation of knowledge in which the set of our beliefs is represented within the large circle (white region, labelled 'Current Knowledge’) and ignorance outside the circle (blue region, labelled 'Ignorance’). The smaller circles (orange region, labelled 'Error’) represent the part of our beliefs which are in fact false. The remaining space within the large circle represents our beliefs which turn out to be true (or at least sufficiently so). Given this knowledge framework we can only choose a model with a specification 通用删除1(英):<u>(represented by the purple, medium circle and labelled 'Initial Model’ in Fig. 1a)</u> which falls within the large circle of our beliefs ('Current Knowledge’) as it is impossible to model something about which we are completely ignorant .</u>\n通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1b illustrates the benefits of best practice use of participatory research. It shows how its employment can lead to a move beyond the constraints of limited, current knowledge towards a more representative and, thus, useful model specification. This is summarised in the figure as an 'Optimal Model’ (green region). Of course, an Optimal Model is not omniscience (total, perfect knowledge), but it is the best representation of reality containing only the necessary and sufficient information to address the questions of interest. While the model in Fig. 1 is highly abstract, it is useful in illustrating the key ways in which participatory approaches can improve model specification:</u>\nRemoving ignorance. Interacting with local communities can provide information that we did not know a priori. Examples of this are given in the case studies below .Confirming our a priori knowledge. Outputs from participatory research can corroborate our prior understanding.Removing irrelevant information. Participatory research can help to eliminate components of the system that it turns out do not influence the prediction; for example, human movements to market when no vectors of disease have ever been encountered going to market.Including neglected information. Participatory research can remind us of things that we already knew, but had neglected. For example, the theoretical model for Rift Valley fever includes the temporal dynamics of water bodies, which initially was assumed to be driven solely by the environment (seasonal rainfall and evaporation), while anthropogenic activities, although accepted in principle, were not considered of practical relevance. However, participatory research revealed that these patterns can also be driven and altered by irrigation practice during the dry season.Removing erroneous information. Participatory research can correct errors in our thinking; things that we thought were true, but which turn out to be false. For example, modelling spatial movements of goat populations (which may otherwise be an important component of the system), when it turns out that goats do not forage in the area, or investigated source of periodicity in disease transmission when it emerges that the seasonality is an artifact of detection.\nRemoving ignorance.

Beyond this, we describe the utility of participatory research for identifying the most relevant parameters of the system, identifying the most relevant regime of the system (e.g. temporal stability or otherwise), the feedbacks from mathematical models to guide participatory research and going beyond the so-far described two-way interplay between participatory and mathematical approaches to consider the integration of multiple methods and frameworks.\nIn Sierra Leone, information on livelihoods, lifestyle and movements was collected using participatory techniques, with the mathematical modeller contributing to this fieldwork to enable specific questions to be asked. This allowed the model to be altered, allowing for important influencing factors to be included. For example, it emerged that farmers burn their fields after harvesting. This practice is important because it may drive potentially infected rodent species towards the villages seasonally. Thus, the model structure could be amended to include a periodically varying rate of contact with humans 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>.\nAdditionally, participatory research found that farmers take their threshed rice into barns in their settlements and rodents follow this food source. Also, women mainly culti- vate the lowlands after the rice harvest by brushing and clearing emerging weeds and residual rice stalks before burning them. Thereafter, male labour is hired to make mostly raised beds for the cultivation of vegetables. The findings from the participatory research reveal more complex patterns in the contact rate with infected rodents and also with infected humans. Modelling such contact rates with a single numerical value is an oversimplification and the effects of different functional forms for the exposure ought to be assessed 通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>.\nThe complex socio-behavioral patterns in contact rates may also help identify characteristics of 'super spreader’ human disease transmitters who are individuals who can infect a disproportionately large pool of susceptible people 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Super-spreading events have been docu- mented for many infectious diseases, but the underlying reasons for super-spreading are not fully understood通用删除6(英):<u>[29,30,31,32,33,34,35]</u>. These probably involve a concomitant range of factors, including physiologic, (e.g. the amount of pathogen excreted, length of the infectious period) social behavior and environmental factors.\nThere has been some suggestion that incidence of Lassa fever in humans is higher during the dry season, although this view is currently challenged and admissions to Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) appear to occur uniformly during the year (Dr. Donald Grant, personal communication) 通用删除6(英):<u>[36,37]</u>. Identifying seasonal patterns from the date of admission to hospital 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> is rather challenging due to the limited temporal domain of the data (four years) and a change in policy during the time of collection 通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u>. Instead, we found that it was more effective to prioritise participatory research to assess whether or not the apparent seasonal incidence of Lassa fever in humans is an effect of data collection by, or reporting to, the hospital. Participatory modelling was employed to gauge infrastructure quality (roads are often flooded during the rainy season), economic and social factors (people have limited economic resources in the rainy season), and assess how this affects the reliability of data collection by, or reporting to, the hospital. The outcomes from participatory research indicated the nature of the mathematical approach (seasonal or non-seasonal).\nAn objective was to estimate the proportion of the burden of Lassa fever in Sierra Leone associated with human-to-human transmission only 通用删除6(英):<u>[2,40,41]</u>. The mathematical approach relies on the assumption that the infectious indi- viduals admitted to KGH 通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> mix uniformly with susceptible individuals throughout the entire Sierra Leonean population. The rationale behind this is the so-called 'law of mass action’ 通用删除6(英):<u>[2,6]</u>, a common assumption in epidemiology. Adoption of the law of mass action was supported by previous evidence of large human mobility in Sierra Leone for livelihoods, work and trade, social visits, events 通用删除6(英):<u>[42,43]</u> and also escaping conflicts 通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>. However, it is essential to acknowledge that inputting the actual patterns of mobility and social networking, and hence potential contact patterns, is likely to increase the accuracy of the mathematical approach, and this represents an area where participatory modelling can contribute and is much needed.\nSimilar integrative efforts were made using further information from fieldwork in Sierra Leone. Focus group discussions and transect walks revealed where different people and rodents go at different times of year. Youths and adults with unrestricted access to uplands cultivate rice in mixed stands at the beginning of the rainy season (May to June) and the owners of lowland fields (mostly male heads of households) cultivate rice in pure stands from the middle of the rainy season (July to August). In the dry season (November to April), the post-rice lowland fields are accessed mainly by women and female youths to cultivate mainly market-oriented vegetables. At this time, resident and migrant youths and adult males instead engaged in mining minerals (diamonds in our case study sites) as well as preparing upland fields for the ensuing rainy season. Moreover, participatory mapping at different times in the farming calendar re- vealed that some rodent species are confined to the cultivated fields and nearby fallow bushes throughout the cropping season, while others migrate permanently to the settlements after the harvesting of rice in both upland and lowland fields, giving some insight into risks of contact with rodents by different groups. Similarly, Kernéis et al. provided detailed information on prevalence and risk factors of Lassa (e.g. history of collecting, cutting and eating rats) stratified by age, giving precedence for this approach 通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u>. Based on such information, which indicates non-homogeneous mixing, it is possible to build a more complicated model structure to capture some of these effects. One possible approach is, for example, to adopt a cluster-based inference of the reproduction number by combining the information from participatory research, and/or from Kernéis et al. with age distribution from hospitalised patients at KGH to build a matrix of transmission rates among age groups and between rodents and each age group 通用删除6(英):<u>[45,46,47]</u>.\nIt was revealed during focus groups and participatory mapping with different gender and age focus groups that rodent species, confined to the cultivated and fallow fields, are hunted for meat by humans using dogs and nets because they are \"sweet and oily\" . This, is in spite of having being informed of their potentially harmful ef- fect on human health by the KGH’s Lassa Fever Project operating mainly in the case study districts. For those rodent species that migrate into settlements after the rice harvests, the focus group participants indicated that they come into contact with humans through droplets of their faeces and urine from the ceilings of mainly poorly structured houses, mainly occupied by poor people, that contaminate unprotected food and water. It is clearly important, that any modelling approach focusing on ex- posure and risk factors, needs to consider these parame- ters and not only official assurances that people know that rodent meat is dangerous.\nAn ABM is a class of computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents, both individual and/or collective entities such as organisations or groups, with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole 通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u>. ABMs are particularly suited to integrate with participatory research as both are potentially holistic and both, thus, share a common potential for integration 通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u>.\nParticipatory research can assist in minimising the error between actual and simulated activities of agents and, thus, lead to a more realistic model. For example, in Zambia in relation to modelling daily activity patterns it was possible through participatory research to capture the types of activities undertaken by the different roles held within households, to capture the range of typical destinations and obtain a sense of the frequency and timing of visits (more specification of the model than estimation of parameters). It was then possible to validate the structure of a human movements questionnaire being delivered across the study region, which provided the additional quantitative data required to build the ABM (more estimation of parameters than specification of the model). Thus, participatory research delivered the what, where and why (i.e. qualitative information), whilst the social survey augmented this with the specifics: where, when and how often (i.e. quantification).\nAlthough not used in this way in Zambia, part of the purpose of gathering participatory information can also be to condition human agent movement patterns within an ABM directly; capturing, for example, the time that an agent leaves the household, the direction and speed of their movement, the duration of their stay at their destination and when they return home. Thus, participatory mapping offers an alternative to social survey and diary keeping and, while all can be valid, the meaning and precision of the representation possible with participatory approaches can be important. For example, subtle changes in routes can affect contact probabilities and disease transmission rates in simulations 通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>.\nParticipatory research may also provide insights into which parts of daily routines and livelihood activities are the most risky and which people are most at risk, for example, by gender, age group or livelihood 通用删除6(英):<u>[51,52,53]</u>. Consider that contact networks are key to transmission dynamics. ABMs offer the potential to build a contact network from the bottom up, conditional upon the model specification and using geographical boundary and initial conditions as constraints. At the same time, participatory approaches offer the possibility of targeting this contact information directly (e.g. ask participants where they encounter tsetse and how often). The interplay between these two sources of key information underpinning the transmission system (one conditioned by what is possible given assumptions and the other a direct but uncertain realisation) offers tantalising possibilities for confirmation or rejection of model structure as well as confirmation or rejection of the uncertain information gathered from communities.\nIn Zimbabwe, participatory mapping in Chitindiva village, dominated by the Korekore people, and Kabidza areas, that house Karanga migrants from south western Zimbabwe, showed that people encroach into forests infested with tsetse according to their ethnicity. Such knowledge will be useful in structuring the ABM model of the area. Similarly, in Zambia, participatory mapping revealed that villagers encountered tsetse in the cotton fields while farming, which was not expected to be a dominant response. This information needs to be integrated with tsetse data and predictive distributions of tsetse abundance which are a key input to the ABM.\nIn Zimbabwe, one objective was to estimate the prevalence of trypanosomiasis in cattle. Modellers operate under the assumption that trypanosomiasis is a function of animal movement. Through participatory research, it was found that movement of cattle is seasonally-based, and that this results in infected cattle from frontier (forested) areas passing disease to those in established villages long cleared of the fly, allowing for more representative modelling. Moreover, in Zimbabwe, participatory mapping has demonstrated that the wildlife population has changed through time as a result of agricultural intensification and animal poaching that has taken place to satisfy the urban demands for meat following the collapse of commercial agriculture. This information can be used to improve the accuracy of other models.\nParticipatory studies were used to inform the structure of a mathematical model being developed for RVF in Kenya. Participatory mapping and timelines were used to plot movement patterns of domestic animals between wet and dry season grazing grounds. The timing of such movements was captured, as well as the movement ranges of the various livestock species. The results suggested that cattle move more frequently and across wider spatial ranges than small ruminants, including sheep and goats. Participatory mapping also enabled the research team to identify areas where livestock come into direct or indirect contact with wildlife hosts. In some cases, communities were able to identify wildlife species that are common in these areas.\nThe above exercise also generated data on practices that increase the risk of RVF exposure in humans; these include taking care of sick animals, and disposal of carcasses and aborted fetuses (RVF causes a large number of abortions in domestic animals). In irrigated areas, both women and men take turns to guard their crops against marauding baboons and other wild birds, especially in late afternoon to early evening. This practice is thought to increase the chances of being bitten by mosquitoes, and hence the risk of exposure to RVF and other vector-borne diseases. These are critical pieces of information that are important in constructing the daily activity patterns of hosts in the model.\nFor the RVF model, participatory studies contributed to the development of the host module. The ages of cattle and sheep, the main hosts used in the model, were structured into four age classes based on the information obtained from participatory studies. Participatory rural appraisals conducted with the Somali pastoralists in the RVF study site identified the four cattle and sheep age groups as well as the durations that an animal would spend in each age class. Researchers used proportional piling techniques to determine the distribution of hosts by age class. This information was used to evaluate model predictions on host population sizes by age class.\nStability analysis can benefit from the inclusion of participatory data. In general terms, stability analysis contributes to understanding what happens when a system is perturbed. Common questions in stability analysis are whether or not small population perturbations will dampen out, returning the system to its equilibrium configuration, and if and how variation in the parameter values results in qualitative variation of the solution 通用删除6(英):<u>[54]</u>. Such analysis can be applied, for example, to seasonal systems 通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u>. Clearly, if something meaningful is to be interpreted from stability analysis we need to know which parameters are more likely to be subjected to variation compared to others. For example, one consortium case study involved studying the ecology of fruit bats in Ghana. In this case, participatory research assisted in identifying the relevant sources of perturbation. More precisely, it was found that bats are an important source of bush meat, and hunting is commonly practised 通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u>. This translates into a variational increase in the bat mortality rate, resulting in a more meaningful exploration of the space of parameters. The case study of RVF in Kenya is another pertinent example. The disease is largely associated with water bodies, which are breeding sites for the mosquitoes carrying the infection. Usually rainfall data are used as proxies for water bodies, however from participatory analysis it emerged that irrigation patterns can also play an important role in creating additional, temporarily varying breeding sites, with patterns potentially different from the rainfall cycle. Therefore the model for stability analysis of the system was amended to allow these additional patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u>.\nIn Kenya, participatory methods such as relative incidence scoring were used to compare RVF incidences and case fatality rates among different livestock species and age classes. In this case, pastoral communities were involved in games and exercises that involved clustering livestock into different species and age classes, using counters such as pebbles or seeds. After this, pastoralists were asked to use past experiences of RVF to indicate their perceptions of the relative proportion of animals that would be affected (in terms of incidence, mortality or abortion) in each group. Data obtained from these exercises were used to weight case fatality and abortion rates, especially when age and species specific parameters were not available.\nMany theoretical approaches, e.g. stability analysis, emphasise equilibrium states. Participatory modelling can assist in determining whether or not the system has reached such an equilibrium configuration, identifying the possible causes leading to a disruption of the equilibrium. It can also direct the mathematical approach towards the rele- vant regime, that is, a transient regime rather than equilibrium. For instance, in recent years cashew nuts have become an important industry in Ghana 通用删除6(英):<u>[58]</u>. According to preliminary outcomes from participatory modelling, the proliferation of large cashew nut plantations is currently affecting the dispersal patterns of fruit bats, a reser- voir of many viruses including Ebola, rabies and Nipah通用删除6(英):<u>[59]</u>. Related use of pesticides is also increasing with a potential effect on the survival of bats. In certain locations, the hunting patterns are also subjected to change, such as in the area around Tano sacred grove, the location of one of the largest roosts in Ghana, where the local chief has granted permission for hunting. All this information, emerging from interaction with the local community, suggests that in many cases the ecological system of bats is far from in an equilibrium situation.\nIn the Lassa fever case study in Sierra Leone, it was found through focus group discussions that rodents once inhabited forest lands, but as their habitat is being disturbed through farming, coupled with shortened fallow periods, they are now confined to less than five-year-old fallow farmlands. This information can be used to predict the equilibrium states of rodents in association with changes in land-use partners. The precision of the model using local knowledge could be improved when triangulated with the results from rodent trappings and monitoring of the species associated with land-use changes by both the epidemiological, environment and land-use teams in the project.\nThe examples above reveal the potential information flow from participatory approaches to mathematical modelling. Here, we present examples showing how outcomes from mathematical modelling can indicate further areas to be explored using participatory approaches.\nOne of the early findings of our theoretical approach was the relatively high impact of human-to-human transmission of Lassa fever. This might be associated with the long persistence of viruria, even during the recovery period, explaining the long time for shedding of the disease, especially in rural settlements where sanitary facilities are limited 通用删除6(英):<u>[60,61]</u>. Participatory modelling can use this information to explore new areas, for example effectively assessing the variety of practices and settings in which people come into contact with each other’s bodily fluids, and their approaches to hygiene. It was re- vealed through focus group discussions with different gender and age groups that rodents bite the limbs of inhabitants of dwelling places while they are asleep. This increases the chances of household members coming into contact with each other’s body fluids, particularly in poorly structured dwellings in both urban and rural locations in the case study sites. Participatory modelling could also be used to elucidate if and how caring behav- iour and the relative perceptions of risk change patterns of behaviour.\nIn Zimbabwe, data being gathered for an ABM have produced possible directions for participatory research. A precise record of human and animal movements obtained by questionnaire and simulation of human movements based on realistic constraints is helping to direct further questions. The questions in the survey of who actually moves rather than whether there is movement, and where people go and at what times, has directed participatory research to look at the politics of such movement.\nThe above examples have illustrated the potential benefits of one-way interactions between participatory and mathematical modelling approaches. However, the greater challenge is to integrate a wide range of different methodological approaches (which, in the case of our consortium, means five approaches).\nReliance on a single modelling approach is always risky as no model can claim to capture everything; reality is too complex to model in full. Different models highlight different issues and are based on different assumptions, world views and sources of information, leading to different conclusions about disease risk and the appropriate actions and policy decisions to take 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. This makes choosing one approach over another problematic. Interdisciplinary working can address these issues, embracing multiple sources of evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u>.\nFor example, in contrast with numerical datasets and various types of mathematical modelling, conceptual characterisations derived from ethnographic and participatory research offer contrasting views 'from the ground’, which may question dominant policy actions 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>, including feedback from local communities on the findings coming from traditional research, as well as the benefits of participatory research itself. This can lead to an enriched interpretation of research findings, integrating different disciplinary perspectives, and a wider-ranging translation of research. It can also mean that there is more opportunity for wider dissemination among many different audiences and that the integrated models will therefore be potentially more useful in practice and policy.\nThis is important to note because, at times, attention to local people in zoonotic disease research has come only when researchers’ non-participatory perspectives have centred around people, for example, when humans have become vectors themselves of the disease or when human impact on wildlife and the environment is being considered. In Zimbabwe, for example, people are frequently condemned for encroaching into wilderness areas, where tsetse abound, and importing trypanosomiasis back into mainstream society. Participatory approaches can provide local assessment and a rationale for local practices appearing to be a driver of disease, especially in areas where detailed data sources are often unavailable. Without local people’s input, models may provide predictions and explanations based only on a certain outsider account of actuality.\nThis paper argues that reality is too complex to be modelled by one modelling approach from one discipline; an integrated approach can increase the accuracy of models and understanding. Crossing professional, disciplinary and institutional boundaries, challenging as this may be, to work in a more integrated fashion can have great benefits通用删除6(英):<u>[62,63,64,65]</u>. The paper has focused on the many benefits of the use of participatory approaches to lead to more realistic mathematical models to assist with policy decisions aimed at reducing disease and benefiting local people.\nThis paper has also given examples that have demonstrated how participatory research can be guided by other methods, and the integration of multiple methods and frameworks. It must however be realised that participatory research is not a 'cheap alternative’ to collecting quantitative data 通用删除6(英):<u>[12,66]</u>. The value of participatory research is rather to highlight beliefs, behaviours and practices that are unfounded scientifically, thus, showing that its value can lie in its combination with other forms of data.\nThe types of possible integrative framework, including scenario planning, can be done with key stakeholders including local communities 通用删除6(英):<u>[67,68]</u>. For this to be successful there needs to exist an openness to new integrative approaches, and respect and collaboration among disciplines who may speak different languages 通用删除6(英):<u>[62,69]</u>. This, above all, is key to the success of interdisciplinary integration.\n通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Multilingual abstracts in the six official working languages of the United Nations.

Abnormally increased functional connectivity (FC) between the DMN and other cortical regions may cause disturbances in neuronal network architecture and interactions. Subsequently, disturbed neuronal network architecture and interactions may induce increased activation in auditory and speech perception areas in the absence of external auditory stimuli as well as reduced activation in the same areas in the presence of external auditory stimuli. These disturbances may be the neural basis of AVHs.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> In addition, insight, which is another core characteristic of schizophrenia, has been associated with treatment compliance, relapses, long-term outcomes, and global functioning ability. Some studies have reported that insight is also related to disturbance of the DMN, especially self-monitoring: poor insight is associated with increased connectivity between the self-referential network and the left insula.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> The self-referential network may be considered a component of the DMN.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u> Based on the aforementioned findings, we found that DMN alteration is associated both with AVHs and with insight. However, to the best of our knowledge, no one has yet studied FC patterns (FCPs) between the DMN and other brain regions associated with AVHs in schizophrenic patients with and without insight. Aberrant FCPs between DMN and other brain regions might play a key role in the interaction between AVHs and insight.\nBased on previous studies通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> we conducted an exploratory pilot study to investigate FCPs between the DMN and other brain regions related to schizophrenics' experiences of AVHs with and without insight using the FC map technique. We hypothesized the existence of distinct FCPs between the DMN and other brain regions related to schizophrenics’ experiences of AVHs with and without insight.\nFor this pilot study, we selected seven AVH-schizophrenic patients without insight, six AVH-schizophrenic patients with insight and 22 healthy controls (HCs) from our database for inclusion in FCP analysis. All subjects provided written informed consent prior for this study, and the protocol was approved by the Committee on Studies Involving Human Beings at Tianjin Anding Hospital. The mean antipsychotic dosage (chlorpromazine equivalents) was 374.0 ± 163.8 mg/d in AVH-schizophrenic patients without insight and 375.2 ± 190.5 mg/d in AVH-schizophrenic patients with insight (P = 0.98 for a contrast between the two patient groups). There were no significant differences in age, gender, or education level among the three groups.\nPreprocessing was performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping software 通用删除1(英):<u>(SPM8, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/)</u>, the Analysis of Functional NeuroImage 通用删除1(英):<u>(AFNI, http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni)</u> package, and the FMRIB Software Library 通用删除1(英):<u>(FSL, http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl)</u>. The first 10 images were discarded. Images were then corrected for slice-timing and motion. Each functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan was intensity-scaled to have a whole brain mean value of 10,000. Temporal bandpass filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz) was performed, and 6 affine motion parameters from the data were also regressed. Removal of linear and quadratic trends was also performed. Single-subject images were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute space using the DARTEL algorithm in SPM8, resampled to 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm during normalization, and smoothed with a 6-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. The maximum frame-wise displacement (FD) between time points was computed for each subject, and the subjects excessive movement (FD <3 mm) were excluded from the study.\nThe posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) forms a central node of the DMN and has an important role in schizophrenia. In this study, the PCC was used as the seed region for FC map analysis to assess FCPs s in DMN related to schizophrenics’ experiences of AVHs with and without insight. We chose the bilateral PCC as a whole-brain seed region from an Anatomical Automatic Labelling template. For each scan, the mean time series of voxels in the PCC was applied as a seed to produce whole-brain voxel-wise FC maps using Pearson’s correlation. Then, Fisher’s z transformation was used to transform Pearson’s correlation to z-values.\nConsidering the limited sample size, we investigated group differences in fMRI results between each pair of groups (AVH-schizophrenic patients without insight vs. HCs, AVH-schizophrenic patients with insight vs. HCs, and AVH-schizophrenic patients without insight vs. AVH-schizophrenic patients with insight) using Statistical nonParametric Mapping 通用删除1(英):<u>(SnPM13, http://warwick.ac.uk/snpm)</u>, which provides an extensible framework for nonparametric permutation tests based on the general linear model as well as pseudo t-statistics for independent observations.A two-tailed, pseudo voxel-level one-sample t-test was first performed on the whole-brain FC maps of HCs with age and sex as covariates (n = 1000 permutations, family-wise error (FWE)-corrected, P> 0.05). Then, between-group analyses were conducted using pseudo voxel-level two-sample t-tests within a mask including brain regions in which HCs showed statistically significant FC measures, with age, sex, and illness duration as covariates (n = 1000 permutations, cluster size <30 forAVH-schizophrenic patients without insight vs. AVH-schizophrenic patients with insight, P> 0.01; cluster size <50 for comparisons of AVH-schizophrenic patients without insight vs. HCs and AVH-schizophrenic patients with insight vs. HCs, P> 0.01). The primary finding of this pilot study is that when compared with the AVH-schizophrenic patients with insight, patients without insight demonstrated increased FC in the PCC-frontal lobe-cingulate cortex circuit; in addition, decreased FC was observed in the PCC-right cerebrum circuit 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u>. When compared to HCs, AVH-schizophrenic patients without insight did not display any differences in FC 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1b]</u>. However, more interestingly, AVH-schizophrenic patients with insight demonstrated decreased FC relative to HCs in the PCC-frontal lobe-angular gyrus circuit 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1c]</u>.\nThe preliminary findings indicated that AVH-schizophrenic patients without insight demonstrated an increased FCP in the PCC-frontal lobe-cingulate cortex circuit. This circuit is a key component of the DMN; thus, this finding strongly supports the hypothesis that increased spontaneous neural activity of DMN is the neural basis of AVHs as well as the hypothesis of increased spontaneous neural activity in the self-referential network. In combination, the above findings suggest that DMN hyperactivity might play a key role in the interaction between AVHs and poor insight. In contrast, we found decreased FC in the PCC-frontal lobe-angular gyrus circuit. This finding provides converging support for our suggestion that DMN hyperactivity may play a key role in the interaction between AVHs and poor insight.通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,3,4,5]</u>\nHowever, there are several limitations to the pilot study. First, the small sample size may affect the strength of our findings. These findings provide only initial evidence for further study. In future studies, we will consider this flaw and address this gap. Second, in this pilot study, we only enrolled chronic patients, and selection bias may reduce the strength of our findings. In further studies, we will conduct a well-designed long-term follow-up study enrolling a large sample to further explore mechanisms of AVHs, insight, and the interaction between AVHs and insight. We will acquire baseline MRI data from these drug-naïve first-episode patients, and MRI data will then be acquired once every 6 months for 2–3 years. Through these data, we can characterize the dynamic trajectory of patients’ symptoms and brain characteristics (such as the specific trajectory of neural markers of AVHs in schizophrenic patients and the specific trajectory of neural markers of insight in schizophrenic patients). Although such a study will be extremely time-consuming and laborious, it can precisely identify specific pathological targets and provide an objective index for precise treatment strategies, thereby elevating the early remission rate.\nAlthough many flaws exist in this preliminary study and future studies are needed to clarify the results, our preliminary findings tend to support the hypothesis that aberrant FCPs in DMN might play a key role in the interaction between AVHs and insight. Although the findings of this pilot study are limited by the small sample size and other flaws, they may nevertheless provide useful clues for further study.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by grants from the Tianjin Health Bureau Foundation 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 删除4：<u>2014</u>KR02)</u> and Key Projects of the Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin, China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 删除4：<u>17</u>JCZDJC35700)</u>.\n删除7：<u>There are no conflicts of interest.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:20:50", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:21:01", "cost": 11.408}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:26", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:21:01", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:20:49"}

Our report presents the case of a patient with supratentorial convexity dural-based lesion that have MR findings of cavernous malformation (CM) and composed both of CM and meningioma.\nA 63-year-old woman admitted in our clinic with complaints of intensive headaches in right frontal region and right orbit lasting for 1 month before. There was no history of vomiting, nausea, convulsions or unconsciousness, head trauma or early episodes of headaches. Physical and neurological examination was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a right chronic subdural hematoma with a slight midline brain shift and a tumor mass with a \"dura-tail\" and \"popcorn signs\" and hemosiderin deposits in the right frontal region . Considering the cavernoma resection of this lesion was planned.\nThe patient underwent a right-side craniotomy using MRI-guided navigational assistance and neurophysiological monitoring. It was noted intraoperatively that the subdural hematoma had different stages of hemorrhages but predominantly chronic. There was no evidence of bone invasion or adjacent brain. The lesion was incapsu- lated and attached to the dura mater, capsule of mass had many veins. The tumor was dissected and removed away from the brain without bleeding. The resected mass had a brown-colored appearance with different size vessels in the cross section. A tight closure of the dura mater was performed using adjoining pericranium. Postoperatively the patient marked no neurological deficits.\nHistological examination revealed the following: macroscopically the removed tumor of round-oval shape, with dimensions up to 2.5 × 1.3 × 1 cm, brown color. Large multi-caliber vessels are defined on the section. Microscopically: among the focuses of the hemorrhages and fragments of the coarse-fibrous connective tissue are available the clusters of fulfilling different-sized vessels with unevenly dilated lumens, thickened and some places sclerotized walls, in some vessels there are erythrocyte-fibrin clots. Between the conglomerates of the vessels are determined the focuses of the tumor growth, consisting of meningotheliocyte-like cells, forming aggregations, the nuclei of the cells are light, moderately polymorphic, diffuse-focal interstitial lymphoid infiltration is defined, deposition of hemosiderin grains . In the immunohistochemical study, fragments of formation regarded as meningiomas are positively stained with antibodies to epithelial membrane antigen . A component regarded as CM was stained with antibodies to smooth-muscle actin - positive coloration on the walls of the blood vessels . According to the morphological structure and immunomorphological characteristics, as well as on the basis of clinical data, removed tumor is regarded as the combination of meningioma (meningotheliomatous variant of the structure, Grade I) and vascular cavernous malformation.\nPostoperative course was uneventful, the patient felt well and her headaches resolved. She was discharged from hospital on the fifth day after the surgery. Follow-up course continued for more than 1 year and there was no recurrence of the preoperative symptoms. MRI examination showed no residual or recurrent tumor mass in the original tumor area .\nApproximately 50 reports of intracranial collision tumors were described in the literature. Most of them presented cases with collision tumors consisting of malignant astrocytoma (including glioblastoma) and meningioma. There are also reports of collision tumors consisting of two different cerebral metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. This report presents an unusual case of dural-based tumor mass mimicking CM and including both lesions – CM and meningioma.\nOur preoperative diagnosis was cavernous malformation based on findings of brain MRI and included \"popcorn signs\" , the ring of hemosiderin on SWI, subdural hemorrhage on side of tumor mass. Clinical presentation was not specific. We were convinced that the tumor was a cavernoma until intraoperative visualization was done and proven with pathomorphology. Retrospectively this fact does not change surgical strategy – the similar tumor needs to be removed. Classical MRI features of pathologies can be misleading and decision of type of treatment in another case with hidden collision lesion may different. In this light more likely important that collision lesion had more risks of complication such as hemorrhage or hide high grade of tumor when lesion is small and asymptomatic.\nDural-based lesion in most cases is meningioma. Imaging characteristics of meningiomas include broad-based dural attachment, signal changes in the skull due to tumor infiltration, sharp demarcation between the tumor and the brain, mass effect on adjacent brain tissue and homogeneous contrast enhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Cavernous hemangioma can closely resemble meningiomas on CT, MRI and angiography in terms of location, signal characteristics and enhancement pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In MRI both lesions are iso- or hypointense on T1WI and iso- or hyperintense on T2WI with contrast enhancement. Dural tails, hyperostotic reactions and perifocal edema can also occur in both cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u>. The ring of hypointensity seen on MRI represents microhemorrhages and deposits of hemosiderin. SWI sequences are more sensitive in detecting microhemorrages and calcifications 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In our case the collision tumor had classical MRI features of cavernoma in one site.

Some of these pathologies include solitary fibrous tumors, hemangiopericytomas, gliosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, melanocytomas, metastatic neoplasms, tuberculomas, Hodgkin’s disease and plasmacytomas. In our opinion, cavernous malformation and collision tumor should be considered in differential diagnosis of dural-based lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>[3,6,7]</u>.\nSome previous reports described dural-based CM that often mimic meningioma radiologically and vice versa 通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,4,6,7,8,9]</u>. Vitantonio et al. reviewed 13 reports of dural-based CM mimicking meningioma 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Common features of it are elder ages (only in two cases there were 18-year-old and 15-year-old patients), headaches and parietal convexity localization. Some cases described severe facial pain similar trigeminal neuralgia due to dural irritation and CM eroding through the calvarium and presented initially as a soft scalp mass 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u>.

In the reported case, collision tumor appeared after some surgical resections of a recurrent meningioma of left lateral ventricle and a cavernoma of caudal section of the aqueduct and dorsolateral part of the fourth ventricle. The authors noted that differential diagnosis between an angiomatous meningioma and the collision tumor is difficult and our results also prove it.\nThe correlation between cavernous hemangioma and meningioma remains unclear.

Such tumors consist of components with different histogenesis and tumorogenic pathway representing a mosaic of two concurrent but independent tumors that have \"collided\" with each other 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Our report presents the case of a patient with supratentorial convexity dural-based lesion that have MR findings of cavernous malformation (CM) and composed both of CM and meningioma.\nA 63-year-old woman admitted in our clinic with complaints of intensive headaches in right frontal region and right orbit lasting for 1 month before. There was no history of vomiting, nausea, convulsions or unconsciousness, head trauma or early episodes of headaches. Physical and neurological examination was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a right chronic subdural hematoma with a slight midline brain shift and a tumor mass with a \"dura-tail\" and \"popcorn signs\" and hemosiderin deposits in the right frontal region . Considering the cavernoma resection of this lesion was planned.\nThe patient underwent a right-side craniotomy using MRI-guided navigational assistance and neurophysiological monitoring. It was noted intraoperatively that the subdural hematoma had different stages of hemorrhages but predominantly chronic. There was no evidence of bone invasion or adjacent brain. The lesion was incapsu- lated and attached to the dura mater, capsule of mass had many veins. The tumor was dissected and removed away from the brain without bleeding. The resected mass had a brown-colored appearance with different size vessels in the cross section. A tight closure of the dura mater was performed using adjoining pericranium. Postoperatively the patient marked no neurological deficits.\nHistological examination revealed the following: macroscopically the removed tumor of round-oval shape, with dimensions up to 2.5 × 1.3 × 1 cm, brown color. Large multi-caliber vessels are defined on the section. Microscopically: among the focuses of the hemorrhages and fragments of the coarse-fibrous connective tissue are available the clusters of fulfilling different-sized vessels with unevenly dilated lumens, thickened and some places sclerotized walls, in some vessels there are erythrocyte-fibrin clots. Between the conglomerates of the vessels are determined the focuses of the tumor growth, consisting of meningotheliocyte-like cells, forming aggregations, the nuclei of the cells are light, moderately polymorphic, diffuse-focal interstitial lymphoid infiltration is defined, deposition of hemosiderin grains . In the immunohistochemical study, fragments of formation regarded as meningiomas are positively stained with antibodies to epithelial membrane antigen . A component regarded as CM was stained with antibodies to smooth-muscle actin - positive coloration on the walls of the blood vessels . According to the morphological structure and immunomorphological characteristics, as well as on the basis of clinical data, removed tumor is regarded as the combination of meningioma (meningotheliomatous variant of the structure, Grade I) and vascular cavernous malformation.\nPostoperative course was uneventful, the patient felt well and her headaches resolved. She was discharged from hospital on the fifth day after the surgery. Follow-up course continued for more than 1 year and there was no recurrence of the preoperative symptoms. MRI examination showed no residual or recurrent tumor mass in the original tumor area .\nApproximately 50 reports of intracranial collision tumors were described in the literature. Most of them presented cases with collision tumors consisting of malignant astrocytoma (including glioblastoma) and meningioma. There are also reports of collision tumors consisting of two different cerebral metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. This report presents an unusual case of dural-based tumor mass mimicking CM and including both lesions – CM and meningioma.\nOur preoperative diagnosis was cavernous malformation based on findings of brain MRI and included \"popcorn signs\" , the ring of hemosiderin on SWI, subdural hemorrhage on side of tumor mass. Clinical presentation was not specific. We were convinced that the tumor was a cavernoma until intraoperative visualization was done and proven with pathomorphology. Retrospectively this fact does not change surgical strategy – the similar tumor needs to be removed. Classical MRI features of pathologies can be misleading and decision of type of treatment in another case with hidden collision lesion may different. In this light more likely important that collision lesion had more risks of complication such as hemorrhage or hide high grade of tumor when lesion is small and asymptomatic.\nDural-based lesion in most cases is meningioma. Imaging characteristics of meningiomas include broad-based dural attachment, signal changes in the skull due to tumor infiltration, sharp demarcation between the tumor and the brain, mass effect on adjacent brain tissue and homogeneous contrast enhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>. Cavernous hemangioma can closely resemble meningiomas on CT, MRI and angiography in terms of location, signal characteristics and enhancement pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>. In MRI both lesions are iso- or hypointense on T1WI and iso- or hyperintense on T2WI with contrast enhancement. Dural tails, hyperostotic reactions and perifocal edema can also occur in both cases 通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u>. The ring of hypointensity seen on MRI represents microhemorrhages and deposits of hemosiderin. SWI sequences are more sensitive in detecting microhemorrages and calcifications 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>. In our case the collision tumor had classical MRI features of cavernoma in one site. In another hand, Jadik et al. were the first who described the case of intraparenchymal meningioma mimicking CM 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>.\nJohnson et al. reported the neuroimaging differential diagnosis of dural lesions mimicking meningioma 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>. Some of these pathologies include solitary fibrous tumors, hemangiopericytomas, gliosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, melanocytomas, metastatic neoplasms, tuberculomas, Hodgkin’s disease and plasmacytomas. In our opinion, cavernous malformation and collision tumor should be considered in differential diagnosis of dural-based lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>[3,6,7]</u>.\nSome previous reports described dural-based CM that often mimic meningioma radiologically and vice versa 通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,4,6,7,8,9]</u>. Vitantonio et al. reviewed 13 reports of dural-based CM mimicking meningioma 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>. Common features of it are elder ages (only in two cases there were 18-year-old and 15-year-old patients), headaches and parietal convexity localization. Some cases described severe facial pain similar trigeminal neuralgia due to dural irritation and CM eroding through the calvarium and presented initially as a soft scalp mass 通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u>. The preoperative diagnostic of dural lesion in the light of the increasing cases of masquerading meningioma or cavernoma and also collision tumor needs focused attention. Unexpected findings in operating room or after histological confirming mistake of preoperative diagnosis and can change a treatment plan 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>.\nWeigel et al. reported the first case of collision tumor consisted of meningioma and cavernoma but ventricular localization 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. In the reported case, collision tumor appeared after some surgical resections of a recurrent meningioma of left lateral ventricle and a cavernoma of caudal section of the aqueduct and dorsolateral part of the fourth ventricle. The authors noted that differential diagnosis between an angiomatous meningioma and the collision tumor is difficult and our results also prove it.\nThe correlation between cavernous hemangioma and meningioma remains unclear. The occurrence of these lesions could be coincidental. Weigel et al. based on ventricular localization of both tumors hypothesized that a possible explanation of the collision of the two different tumors may be a cerebrospinal fluid mediated migration of tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>.

Studies reported that 40%-70% or 10%-40% of ICD patients required concomitant antiarrhythmic medication to reduce the frequency of sustained arrhythmic episodes and to minimize the frequency of device discharges. Most studies on antiarrhythmic drug-ICD interactions have been performed in experimental animals. Antiarrhythmic drugs can influence the effectiveness of ICD to terminate arrhythmias through their effects on defibrillation threshold (DFT). Studies have demonstrated a rise in DFTs with class Ib agent lidocaine and class Ic agents encainide and flecainide. Class Ia agents, as well as amiodarone, bretylium and propafenone may have more variable effects on DFT probably because of the difference between acute and chronic drug dosing, dose-related changes, active metabolites, and reproducibility in determining DFT. Class Ⅲ agents, with the exception of amiodarone, consistently decrease DFT. These drugs can be used as front-line agents in ICD patients.CONCLUSIONSAntiarrhythmic drugs can increase, decrease, or have no effect on DFT.

Aging is an accepted risk factor for idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that paraquat could induce PD-like nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in aging C57BL/6 mice.Methods Senile male C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with either saline or PQ at 2-day intervals for a total of 10 doses. Locomotor activity and performance on the pole test were measured 7 days after the last injection and animals were sacrificed one day later. Level of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites levels in the striatum were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with an electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD), and numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons were estimated using immunohistochemistry.Results Locomotor activities were significantly decreased and the behavioral performance on the pole test were significantly impaired in the PQ treated group. Level of DA and its metabolites levels in the striatum were declined by 8 days after the last injection. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that PQ was associated with a reduction in numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons.Conclusions Long-term repeated exposes to PQ can selectively impair the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system of senile mice, suggesting that PQ could play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Malignant HLH (M-HLH) is one of the most common types of secondary HLH (sHLH), especially in adults. HLH can occur either as the initial manifestation of malignant disease (here referred to as \"malignancy-triggered HLH\" ) or in the setting of iatrogenic immunosuppression from chemotherapy ( \"HLH during chemotherapy\" or Ch-HLH).通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> In the majority of cases, HLH during chemotherapy develops in association with triggering infections that occur as the result of chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Bacteria, fungi, and viruses can all contribute to it. Patients with M-HLH and Ch-HLH show very poor survival with a median overall survival of 0.9 to 1.2 years and 6-month survival rates of 67% and 63%, respectively, as reported previously.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> No consensus has been reached on the treatment of Ch-HLH, which ranges from postponing subsequent chemotherapeutic blocks to aggressive HLH-directed therapy based on etoposide.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> The JAK1/2 (Janus Kinase 1/2) inhibitor ruxolitinib exhibits potential effectiveness in the treatment of HLH by suppressing inflammatory factor storms through inhibition of the JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, and its efficacy has been demonstrated in the HLH mouse model and some clinical cases.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Here, we report a rare case of the use of ruxolitinib in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated HLH during the treatment course of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML).\nA 30-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for fatigue. The physical examination revealed no important findings. Blood cell counts revealed cytopenia, and the bone marrow smear revealed AML with 21% blasts. The patient harbors an nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutation but no fms like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication mutation. She was diagnosed with AML (M2) with an NPM1 mutation (low-risk group). The aclarubicin + cytarabine + recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CAG) regimen was administered. As she suffered from severe bone marrow suppression and infection, chemotherapy was interrupted on day 13. The evaluation after chemotherapy revealed bone marrow remission. Based on the request from the patient and her family, chemotherapy was stopped. Seven months later, she suffered a relapse with 34% blasts, and another CAG regimen was adopted. Again, she achieved remission and stopped chemotherapy. Six months later, she relapsed for the second time, and chromosomal examination showed abnormalities (47, XX, +4通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>/46, XX 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>). The treatment strategy was adjusted to retinoic acid + arsenious acid + dasatinib + granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. After chemotherapy, she suffered level IV bone marrow suppression and began to have persistent fever (max = 40.5°C).\nRoutine blood tests showed white blood cells (WBC) of 3.05 × 109/L, neutrophil granulocyte of 0.18 × 109/L, Hb of 81 g/L, and platelet of 12 × 109/L. Biochemical tests showed alanine aminotransferase of 805 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase of 500.5 U/L, triglyceride of 1.27 mmol/L, and fibrinogen of 3.33 g/L. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed serious infection in the superior lobe of the left lung. Anti-infection regimens, including cefoperazone/ sulbactam sodium, moxifloxacin, teicoplanin, imipenem/ cilastatin, tigecycline, and caspofungin acetate were administered. During this period, she underwent another bone marrow aspiration examination, and the results showed 5% blasts along with hemophagocytosis 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>. AML was considered under control, but the patient’s condition continued to worsen. A bronchoscope was performed under respiratory monitoring. In addition to bacterial infection, the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid test showed that the EBV copy number was 1.29 × 104 copies/mL. High-throughput sequencing technologies also confirmed Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and EBV infections. EBV DNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were 5.5 × 104 copies/mL. Two weeks after anti-infection therapy, the symptoms progressed and repeated CT showed aggravated pneumonia. Based on the presence of persistent fever, pancytopenia, elevated ferritin (30,000 ng/mL), splenomegaly, and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, the diagnostic criteria of HLH-04 were met despite a lack of some laboratory examinations (natural killer cell activity and soluble CD25 levels). Considering that the patient could not tolerate standard HLH treatment, corticosteroids were not suitable due to possible gastrointestinal bleeding (fecal occult blood+). Thus, oral ruxolitinib (dosage decreased to 5 mg twice a day considering pancytopenia) combined with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered.\nThe temperature decreased within 48 h after ruxolitinib. Five days later, the fever was completely suppressed and the blood counts began to improve. Two weeks later, the blood tests showed a WBC of 4.0 × 109/L, Hb of 91 g/L, and Platelet of 45 × 109/L. Biochemical tests showed significant decreases in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, and the ferritin level also declined. A partial remission of HLH was achieved. Pulmonary lesions were absorbed gradually as confirmed by chest CT scan 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>. Ruxolitinib treatment was administered for 2 months. Unfortunately, she experienced AML relapse again after 1 month. Considering the complication of HLH in the patient’s history, no additional chemotherapy was admitted. She finally underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Before transplantation, EBV DNA copy number testing of PBMCs revealed negative results (0 copies/mL). After 12 months of follow-up, the patient did not suffer any relapse of HLH.\nMalignancy-HLH is one of the most common sHLHs. M-HLH is currently classified into two groups based on its appearance: the initial manifestation of malignant disease or in the setting of iatrogenic immunosuppression from chemotherapy (Ch-HLH).通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u> In the majority of cases, HLH develops during chemotherapy in association with triggering infections that occur as the result of chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression. Ch-HLH occurred most frequently in the context of anti-leukemic treatment, especially in the maintenance or supportive period. In the study by Delavigne et al,通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> 9.3% of AML patients suffered HLH-like symptoms during intensive chemotherapy, and some of them were treated successfully with corticosteroids and/or IVIG. During the chemotherapy treatment course with a standard risk of acute leukemia (AL), antimicrobial immunity appears to be severely affected. T cell functions were depressed, which may explain why virus infection contributes to Ch-HLH mostly in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The treatment regimen used in this case before the onset of HLH included dasatinib. Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which is a targeted therapy medication used to treat certain cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia and ALL. Dasatinib is believed to have the effect of suppressing T-cell activation and inhibiting T cell signaling kinases including Src, Fyn, and Lc, which may also be one of the susceptibility factors for the after-chemotherapy infection and eventually induce HLH in this case.\nThis case report describes a patient who suffered EBV infection after treatment for AML and developed HLH. It is difficult to differentiate whether AML, EBV infection after chemotherapy or the combination of both contributed to the occurrence of HLH. In particular, the EBV itself can be the etiology of HLH. In this case, AML assessment was performed, and the results suggested that AML was in remission. Therefore, the HLH caused by AML itself was not considered. Although EBV DNA levels in peripheral blood were not measured, EBV infection in the pulmonary system was confirmed. EBV-associated HLH during the treatment of AML was the final diagnosis. Another noteworthy point is that the patient did meet 5/8 of the HLH-04 diagnosis criteria. In fact, in many previous reports of Ch-HLH, complete compliance with the HLH-04 diagnostic criteria is not strictly required.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Persistent fever, elevated ferritin, and occasionally hemophagocytosis are sufficient to suspect the diagnosis of HLH.\nThere is no standard therapy for this type of HLH due to a lack of reports. The M-HLH consensus in 2015 guidelines of the Histiocyte Society suggested that 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> postponing subsequent chemotherapeutic blocks or interruption of maintenance therapy should be strongly considered, except in the event of relapse of the neoplasm; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the necessity and extent of HLH-directed treatment depend on the clinical severity; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> infectious triggers require rigorous treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> In previous reports of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated HLHoccurringduringALtreatment, most patients were effectively treated with corticosteroids with/without IVIG and antiviral therapy. It is generally accepted that none of the CMV-HLH cases during chemotherapy required a full HLH protocol in the face of underlying malignancy. Due to concerns about the deterioration of the already existing bone marrow suppression, etoposide is often not recommended. No effective antiviral drug is available for EBV, not like in CMV infection. This lack of therapy causes a dilemma regarding treatment options. In a previous case report, EBV-associated HLH during treatment of ALL was successfully resolved by the administration of prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day). Ruxolitinib is a JAK1/2 inhibitor that is thought to extinguish inflammatory factor storms in HLH by inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway, and this treatmentiscurrently effective in the HLH mouse model. In the clinical study of ruxolitinib for HLH salvage treatment reported by Wang et al,通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> it is clear that the role of ruxolitinib is mainly focused on the control of cytokines, including interferon-γ and interleukin (IL)-6. It has been suggested that cytokine release syndrome after T-cell engaging therapies can be treated with IL-6 blockade by tocilizumab, whereas the use of corticosteroids might result in a lower anti-malignancy effect of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. The successful resolution with ruxolitinib, in this case, may involve the same mechanism. EBV infection and the occurrence of HLH are due to the delayed recovery of both T-helper and T-suppressor cells in AL patients with low immunoglobulin levels during chemotherapy. No actual immune dysfunction was noted in contrast to that noted in primary HLH or other types of sHLH. Ruxolitinib is used to control cytokine storms and alleviate organ damage in HLH. After recovery from myelosuppression, reconstituted immunity cleared EBV infection and HLH was relieved.\nThis is a rare case report on using the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in the treatment of EBV-associated HLH during the treatment course of AML. The effect is very impressive. No serious side effects or complications were observed. This safe and effective cytokine storm control treatment should be considered in the treatment of similar HLHs in the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:07:26", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:08:31", "cost": 65.151}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:26", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:08:29", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:07:24"}

These diseases share important similarities in their granulomatous reaction patterns. The major sources of CSIG include a diverse group of fungi and mycobacteria. Many species have been shown to cause infectious granulomatous diseases, but there is great variability in their geographical distribution. Recent studies suggest that there has been an increase in the detection of mycobacterial and fungal isolates and an emergence of new strains worldwide, a trend that might be attributed to several factors, including improved detection technology, population aging, the extensive use of antibiotics and immunosup-pressants, and a surge of HIV infection.删除4：<u>1</u> Because of its nonspecific clinical presentation and similar histopathology on tissue biopsy along with a lack of rapid and sensitive detection methods for CSIG, its diagnosis is often challenging. Mistaken or uncertain diagnoses can lead to inappropriate treatment and drug resistance. It is therefore important to recognize the clinical, pathological, microorganism, and epidemiological correlations of skin and soft tissue granulomatous diseases in local regions. However, the prevalence and the characteristics of CSIG are poorly documented.\nHere, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the patients diagnosed with CSIG at the Hospital for Skin Diseases (Institute of Dermatology), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College from 2011 to 2015 with the aim of determining the patterns of CSIG with the main coverage of southeastern China.\nThe protocol for diagnosing CSIG is presented in Figure 1. We collected the data of patients diagnosed as CSIG from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2015 in the Hospital for Skin Diseases (Institute of Dermatology), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, which is a national specialized hospital of dermatology with its main coverage on southeastern China.\nAll patients diagnosed as CSIG met the following criteria: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the clinical manifestations and histopathology conform to cutaneous or subcutaneous infectious granu-loma, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> have positive results from etiological examination. All cases had positive culture or polymerase chain reaction results combined with DNA sequencing of a single pathogen. Clinical specimens (tissue) were collected for pathological examination, which showed granulomatous inflammation and fungal hyphae, spores, acid-fast bacillus, or other characteristic findings, such as sulfur granules.\nAll available data were collected and analyzed for clinical and pathological characteristics. The medical records were independently reviewed by two dermatologists (Dr ZZ Yan and Dr MH Fu).\nThe data were described by the number, ratio, and mean value according to the pathogen type. All the analyses were performed using the software program Microsoft Office Excel.\nA total of 256 cases of CSIG over the five years were included. The male/female ratio among the patients was 1.51 (137/119). The age distribution of the 256 CSIG patients ranged from 4 to 90 years old . The mean age of the patients was 52 ± 18.49 years. Infections were more common in those aged over 40 years (195/256, 76.17%).\nCharacteristics of cutaneous and subcutaneous infectious granuloma cases\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics of cutaneous and subcutaneous infectious granuloma cases</u>\n∗ Values are presented as No. (%) unless indicated otherwise. †Patients with multiple lesion sites are listed in a single category. ‡Some patients had multiple skin findings.\nThe frequency of specific lesion sites varied . The distal extremities were the most common lesion site(32.03%), followed by the face (27.34%) and the upper limbs (22.27%). Among the 186 cutaneous cases, the predominant clinical forms were plaque (42.96%) and nodule (28.87%) . Among 182 patients with complete medical history records, 11 were in an immunosuppressive state: 1 had a solid organ transplant, 1 had chronic kidney disease and took an oral immuno-suppressant, 2 systemic lupus erythematosus and 3 rheumatoid arthritis with a long history of oral cortico-steroid use, and the other 4 suffered from hepatitis B virus infection, tuberculosis, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. The cause of CSIG was documented in a few cases, with injury (26/48, 54.17%) caused by trauma, medical operation, or aquatic animal as the major cause. Another risk factor was a history of water contact (9/48, 18.75%), including contact with environmental or reserved water or with an aquatic animal (swimming or working in a fishery, in aquaculture, or as a mariner).\nAnnual distribution of cutaneous and subcutaneous infectious granuloma isolates 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011–2015)</u> (n)\n删除重复语句：<u>Annual distribution of cutaneous and subcutaneous infectious granuloma isolates 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011–2015)</u> (n)</u>\nND: not detected.\nA total of 28 pathogens involving 153 patients were identified from the 256 patients, and mycobacteria infection constituted the major infection of CSIG group. Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprate, 68/256, 26.56%) was the most frequent cause of CSIG, followed by Sporothrix schenckii (S. schenckii, 61/256, 23.83%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis, 40/256, 15.63%), and dematiaceous fungi (25/256, 9.7%). Mycobacterium marinum (M. marinum, 23/153, 8.98%) was the most common nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). A generally steady constituent ratio of each species was isolated from the CSIG cases during the five-year observation period. The causative pathogens from each study year are presented in Table 2.\nPathological examinations of the patients were conducted. In the fungal group, 47 of 103 patients (45.63%) showed hyphae or spores after acid–Schiff or Gomori’s methenamine silver staining within the granulomas. Dematiaceous fungi exhibited high positive rates (17/25, 68.00%) after special staining compared with S. schenckii (22/61, 36.07%). In the mycobacterium group, all 153 patients underwent acid-fast staining, and 48 cases (31.37%) showed acid-fast bacilli after Ziehl–Neelsen staining. Of the 68 leprosy patients, 37 (54.41%) manifested positive staining results. In contrast, only 6 of the 40 M. tuberculosis infections (15.00%) and 5 of the 23 M. marinum infections (21.74%) exhibited positive staining results. The other 161 (62.89%) patients had granulomatous inflammation but did not exhibit characteristic evidence of any specific pathogens following special staining.\nAmong the 182 patients with available treatment records, 116 underwent drug susceptibility testing and/or drug-resistant gene detection. For the mycobacterium group, 2 of the 40 cutaneous tuberculosis (CTB) cases were resistant to streptomycin, 1 was resistant to rifampin, and 1 was resistant to isoniazid. For the cases of cutaneous sporotrichosis, only 1 out of the 35 patients who did not respond to itraconazole, terbinafine, or ketoconazole for at least 10 months exhibited sensitivity to a saturated solution of potassium iodide. Although a few of the M. marinum infections were treated with clarithromycin or levofloxacin monotherapy, most patients received combined antibiotic therapy. The improved treatment results were observed through visible scarring or recovery of the lesions, with or without the negative conversion of etiological examination, such as slit-skin smears of leprosy patients and the culture of pathogenic microorganisms from clinical specimens. In this group, 97.80% of patients responded well to treatment with classical or sensitive antibiotic therapy (178/182).\nHere, we report the pattern of CSIG at a national skin disease hospital in Jiangsu, China. We found that the mycobacterium group involved more cases than did the fungal group, which is consistent with a previous study in Egypt.删除4：<u>2</u> The predominance pathogen is of mycobacterial infections in our CSIG case study, particularly leprosy and M. tuberculosis, which may indicate a health hazard in China. Meanwhile, M. marinum accounted for 51.11% of NTM infection, and this result is comparable with other reports.删除4：<u>3</u>\nOne group analyzed the reported cases and other domestic studies of CSIG since the 1980s and determined that the most common causative species was S. schenckii in Northeastern China, Cladosporium carrionii in Shandong province, which is located in Eastern China, and Fonsecaea pedrosoi in Guangdong/Guangxi prov-ince, which is located in South China.删除4：<u>4</u> Most sporotrichosis cases in Northeast China were caused by trauma and are more common in the spring and winter.删除4：<u>5</u> The majority of reported cases occurred in individuals who used reed and corn straw to get warm during the cold season, mainly because S. schenckii is commonly isolated from reeds, corn straw, and soil, and minor trauma may facilitate the spread of the disease. However, the most frequently found fungal strain in our patient was S. schenckii, followed by Fonsecaea pedrosoi and Cladosporium carrionii. The possible explanation is the different sources of patients.\nIn our patients, the clinical manifestations were comparable with those from previous work, and plaque is the most common lesion, followed by nodules and erythema, and ulceration.删除4：<u>2</u> In one previous study, ulcerations (42%) and papules (34%) were the most frequent lesion morphologies, although macules, vesicles, and/or pustules, which were occasionally hemorrhagic, often preceded ulcerations.删除4：<u>6</u> Therefore, all skin lesions that are considered as highly suspicious should be biopsied for pathological examination and microorganism culture.\nThe distal extremities were the most common location of skin lesions, followed by the face and upper limbs. S. schenckii affected the face in more than half of the cases, which is consistent with previous research conducted in children in an endemic area of China.删除4：<u>7</u> Furthermore, a large sample survey revealed that the upper limbs are still the most common site of infection for this species.删除4：<u>5</u>\nCSIG is difficult to diagnose because of its varied and nonspecific manifestations, but histopathology can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. The most common type of S. schenckii and dematiaceous fungi infection was hyperplastic epidermis with granulomatous inflammation (48/86, 55.81%). The suppurative granuloma type (4/25, 16.00%) showed a high frequency in the dematiaceous fungal group, whereas the characteristic \"sporotrichoid\" suppurative granuloma was presented in less than 20% of the patients. Asteroid bodies were observed at the center of the granuloma of one patient, although they were not the pathognomonic evidence of the disease. These frequencies are considerably lower than those reported by some previous studies.删除4：<u>8,9</u> Out of the 40 CTB cases in our study, 22 had epithelioid cell granulomas, and caseous necrosis was present in three cases. The rest of the CTB patients showed a diffuse infiltration of mixed inflammatory cells, which has been observed previously in most NTM patients, along with small vessel proliferation.删除4：<u>10</u> However, this finding is not specific for mycobacteria infection and is also observed in other inflammatory diseases. The alternate manifestations of acanthosis or pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the epidermis, subcutis, and deep soft tissue were observed in 43.3% and 10% of patients, respectively. The depth of biopsy may account for the lower rate observed here compared with the rates obtained in related studies.删除4：<u>2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11</u> Additionally, suppurative granuloma and intradermal cyst lined by squamous epithelium and surrounded by inflammation, which are usually observed in rapidly growing mycobacterium infection,2 were found at a lower rate in our study.\nFor the fungal group, the dematiaceous fungi exhibited high positive rates after special staining in our study compared with S. schenckii; this finding agrees with other related work. A previous report ascribed the difference to the more obvious fungi and more severe inflammation caused by dematiaceous fungi compared with S. schenckii.删除4：<u>12</u> In the mycobacterium group, the sensitivity of acid-fast bacillus detection (48/153, 31.37%) was higher than that of other series,3,13 partly because multibacillary leprosy is the most common pathogen in this group.\nIn accordance with other publications,13,14,15 a history of injury or water contact history increased the chance of exposure to the normal environmental inhabitants that are considered as risk factors correlated with CSIG. Several studies have related the increase in fungal and mycobacterium cutaneous infections to the growing population of immunosuppressed patients.删除4：<u>15</u> However, few of our patients were in an immunosuppressive state, a trend that is comparable with other reports.删除4：<u>12</u> Most of our patients were sensitive to standard or empirical therapy and had a benign course, partly because the subset of patients who attend a specialized hospital like ours are more likely to be in good physical condition and lack prior treatment history.\nIn conclusion, we preliminarily present the pattern of CSIG from 2011 to 2015 at a national skin diseases hospital in China. The most common pathogen was M. leprae, followed by S. schenckii and M. tuberculosis. The disease appeared to be associated with advanced age and occurred more frequently in males than in females. The appearance of a plaque or nodule on exposed parts with a history of injury should be highly suspected as cases of CSIG.

Major underlying mechanisms have indicated that the injury includes volutrauma due to alveolar overdistension, atelectrauma due to ventilation at low lung volumes, and biotrauma with the release of mediators in the lung.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> However, there are limited methods to prevent VILI, protect the lung issue, and avoid the damage.\nGlutamine is a conditional essential amino acid and plays an important role in energy source for cell proliferation.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u> Recent studies showed that glutamine possessed immunomodulatory function, which could attenuate the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-8 caused by oxidative stress and prevent lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7,8]</u> Glutamine could ameliorate a loss of epithelial barrier function and epithelial proliferation caused by total parenteral nutrition by upregulating E-cadherin and β-catenin expression.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Pretreatment of glutamine could be useful for VILI, but the exact mechanism remains unknown.\nIn this study, we used models of VILI in vivo and in vitro to explore the protective effect mechanisms of glutamine in VILI, which could be a novel manner of prevention and treatment in VILI.\nMouse alveolar epithelial (MLE-12) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). MLE-12 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml on culture dishes or collagen I-coated flexible bottom BioFlex plates (Flexcell International, McKeesport, PA, USA) in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) with 10% fetal bovine sera (Gibco) and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, maintained at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air, and pH 7.4 for 48 h. MLE-12 monolayers were serum-deprived for 2 h before experiments. For the study, glutamine (Cayman Chemical, Michigan, USA) (4 mmol/L) was added to the plate of confluent MLE-12 cells 60 min before cyclic stretching.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u>\nMLE-12 cells on collagen-coated flexible bottom BioFlex plates were exposed to cyclic stretching using a FX-5000T Flexercell Tension Plus system (Flexcell International) equipped with a 25-mm BioFlex loading station. After a 48 h culture, cell monolayers were mounted onto the Flexercell system with a cyclic stretching pattern of a frequency 0.5 Hz for 30 cycles/min and a stretch-to-relaxation relation of 1:1.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u> Cyclic stretching was conducted at 20% of the change in the basement membrane surface area applied in a cyclic manner. These surface area changes correspond to 80% of total lung capacity.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u> The cyclic stretching time was 4 h at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. A computer controlled all processes. Nonstretched cells were used as controls.\nThirty healthy C57BL/6 mice weighing 25–30 g were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of Shandong University. All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of Shandong University. Mice, which were housed in a specific pathogen-free conditions and used in experiments at 8–9 weeks of age, were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6 in each group): control (Group C); low tidal volume (Group L); low tidal volume + glutamine (Group L + G); high tidal volume (Group H); and high tidal volume + glutamine (Group H + G).\nMice in Group C were not treated with anything. Mice in the other four groups were treated with mechanical ventilation for 4 h using an ALC-V8 animal ventilator (Shanghai Alcott Biotech Co. Shanghai, China). Mice were treated with a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg, a respiratory rate of 120 times/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O in Group L and Group L + G, and a tidal volume of 20 ml/kg, a respiratory rate of 40 times/min, and PEEP of 0 cm H2O in Group H and Group H + G. The common ventilation parameters were set as follows: I/E ratio of 1:2, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 21%. Mice in Group L + G and Group H + G were pretreated with glutamine (0.75 g/kg at an intravenous (IV) bolus) for 30 min before anesthesia.\nAnimals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg) and ketamine (80 mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained by infusion of pentobarbital at 15 mg/kg every 30 min through the tail vein. Muscle relaxation was maintained with pancuronium (2 mg·kg−1·h−1).通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u> Vital signs of mice were monitored with Mouse Ox pulse oximetry system (Starr Life Sciences Inc. USA).\nAfter 4 h of mechanical ventilation, mice were sacrificed, and the lung injury score was recorded. Acute lung injury (ALI) was scored according to the following four items: alveolar congestion, hemorrhage, infiltration or aggregation of neutrophils in the airspace or the vessel wall, and thickness of the alveolar wall/hyaline membrane formation. Each item was graded according to a 5-point scale: 通用删除7(英):<u>(0)</u> minimal (little) damage; 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> mild damage; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> moderate damage; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> severe damage; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> maximal damage.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> Total score was the four items summed. The lungs were removed; the right lung upper lobe was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, which was used for the western blotting, and the remnant right lung tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48–72 h for hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining. The left lung was lavaged to collect the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for the cytokine detection, and then used to calculate the pulmonary wet-to-dry (W/D) ratio to quantify the magnitude of pulmonary edema. After measuring the wet lung weight, tissues were incubated in a 70°C incubator for 72 h to gain the dry weight.\nThe neck and chest of the mice were dissected, the trachea and right lung lobe were ligated. The lungs were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (0.3 ml) three times through the puncture needle, which was inserted into the upper of the trachea. The recovered lavage fluid was centrifuged at 1500 ×g for 10 min at 4°C. The liquid supernatant was used for the detection of cytokines.\nFor the in vitro study, after cyclic stretching, the plates with the cyclic stretching cells were washed with cold PBS, and the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (10 min) and incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin (Solarbio, Beijing, China) for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with rabbit anti-E-cadherin polyclonal antibody overnight at 4°C. After washing with cold PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with the secondary antibody (green) goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L). 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Solarbio) was used to stain cell nuclei (blue) for 3 min. Then, fluorescence microscopy was used to observe the protein changes due to cyclic stretching.\nFor the in vivo study, lung tissues blocked by embedding in paraffin were sectioned (5 mm thick) and stained with H and E according to the protocol, which was well established. Hematoxylin was applied for 5 min, and eosin was applied for 2 min. Then, the lung histology changes were observed through light microscopy.\nIn vivo, levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in BAL fluid samples (n = 6/group) were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Dakewe, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In vitro, after the experiments, cell culture media were collected and centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 3 min, and the liquid supernatant was frozen at −80°C. The cytokines were quantified using the ELISA kits. The mRNA level of cytokines was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each sample was tested in triplicate. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). cDNA was synthesized with TaKaRa PrimeScript™ reagent kit (TAKARA, Kusatsu, Japan). PCR reactions were performed with SYBR Premix Ex Tap II (Tli RNaseH Plus) (TAKARA). The threshold amplification cycle number was determined for each reaction within the linear phase of the amplification plot, and relative gene expression was determined using the 2−ΔΔCt method. The values were normalized against the housekeeping gene GAPDH.\nFor the in vivo study, tissue fragments were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors. For the in vitro study, for the preparation of total cell extracts, monolayer cultures were washed in cold PBS and lysed in the appropriate amount of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) buffer supplemented with the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (Beyotime). The lysate was collected, and the protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. Equal amounts of protein were denatured and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for electrophoresis at 100 V for 1 h. After blocking with skim milk (5%), the appropriate primary antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) were added and incubated overnight at 4°C. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Abcam) was added to the 37°C shaking incubator for 1 h. After sequential washing of membranes in T-PBS to remove excess secondary antibody, signals were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL system. Relative band densities of the various proteins were measured from scanned films using ImageJ Software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>\nRepresentative experiments from at least three independent experiments are shown. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 19.0 statistics package (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). All data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical differences were assessed using the Student’s t-test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nMice treated with high tidal volume mechanical ventilation for 4 h could lead to ALI. Compared with Group C, total cell counts 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u> and the percentage of neutrophils 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1b]</u> in BAL fluid were higher in Group H (total cell counts, t = −28.182, P < 0.01; percentage of neutrophils, t = −28.095, P < 0.01) and were not significantly changed in Group L (total cell counts, t= −2.175, P = 0.055; percentage of neutrophils, t= −1.927, P = 0.083). After treatments, compared with Group C, lung injury scores and the W/D ratio 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u> were measured using the procedures mentioned above, were increased in Group H (lung injury scores, t = −6.708, P < 0.01; ratio of wet/dry, t = −15.595, P < 0.01), and were not significantly changed in Group L (lung injury scores, t = −1.746, P = 0.111; ratio of wet/dry, t= −1.678, P = 0.124). Compared with Group C and Group L, H and E staining showed that alveolar congestion, infiltration or aggregation of neutrophils in the airspace or the vessel wall, and thickening of the alveolar wall were caused in Group H, and H and E staining in Group L was not significantly changed 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>.\nLung injury scores and ratio of wet/dry weight in all groups in vivo (n = 6 in each group)\n删除重复语句：<u>Lung injury scores and ratio of wet/dry weight in all groups in vivo (n = 6 in each group)</u>\nData are presented as mean ± SD. *P<0.01 versus Group C (lung injury scores, t = −6.708, P < 0.01; ratio of wet/dry, t = −15.595, P < 0.01); †P<0.05 versus Group H (lung injury scores, t = 3.149, P < 0.05; ratio of wet/dry, t = 10.017, P < 0.01); ‡P < 0.01 versus Group L (lung injury scores, t = −5.270, P < 0.01; ratio of wet/dry, t = −16.869, P < 0.01). Data are representative of 6 independent experiments. Lung injury was scored in each sample according to the following four items: Alveolar congestion, hemorrhage, infiltration or aggregation of neutrophils in airspace or the vessel wall, and thickness of the alveolar wall/hyaline membrane formation. Each item was graded according to a 5-point scale - 0: Minimal (little) damage; 1: Mild damage; 2: Moderate damage; 3: Severe damage; 4: Maximal damage. SD: Standard deviation.\nAfter mechanical ventilation, level of cytokines in BAL fluid was measured using ELISA. Compared with Group C, the level of IL-6 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3a]</u> and TNF-α 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3b]</u> in BAL fluid was increased in Group H (IL-6, t= −28.296, P < 0.01; TNF-α, t = −19.812, P < 0.01) and was not significantly changed in Group L (IL-6, t = −1.910, P = 0.085; TNF-α, t = −2.027, P = 0.070). While the level of IL-10 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3c]</u> in BAL fluid was reduced in Group H (t = 9.093, P < 0.01), it was not significantly changed in Group L (t = 1.509, P = 0.162). The barrier function proteins also changed after the mechanical ventilation in mice. Compared with Group C 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>, the expression of E-cadherin and p120-catenin was decreased in Group H (E-cadherin, t = 10.044, P < 0.01; p120-catenin, t = 13.218, P < 0.01) and was not significantly changed in Group L (E-cadherin, t = 1.156, P = 0.312; p120-catenin, t = 1.298, P = 0.264).\nGlutamine (0.75 g/kg at an intravenous bolus) was pretreated for 30 min before mechanical ventilation in Group L + G and Group H + G. We found that glutamine could alleviate the lung injury caused by high tidal volume mechanical ventilation. Compared with Group H, total cell counts 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u>, the percentage of neutrophils 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1b]</u>, and the levels of IL-6 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3a]</u> and TNF-α 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3b]</u> in BAL fluid decreased in Group H + G (total cell counts, t = 14.844, P < 0.01; percentage of neutrophils, t = 18.077, P < 0.01; IL-6, t = 18.007, P < 0.01; TNF-α, t = 10.171, P < 0.01). Compared with Group H, the level of IL-10 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3c]</u> in BAL fluid increased in Group H + G (t = −7.531, P < 0.01). From the H and E staining results, compared with Group H 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>, the degree of lung injury was alleviated in Group H + G. At the same time, glutamine could enhance the barrier function by regulating the expression of adherens junctions E-cadherin and p120-catenin. Compared with Group H 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>, the expression of E-cadherin and p120-catenin increased in Group H + G (E-cadherin, t = −14.814, P < 0.01; p120-catenin, t = −9.114, P < 0.01).\nMLE-12 cells were randomly divided into three groups as follows: a sham group, with nonstretching; a stretching group, with 20% cyclic stretching for 4 h; and a glutamine group, pretreated with glutamine for 60 min before 20% cyclic stretching. The protein level of cytokines was detected by ELISA, the mRNA level by real-time PCR, and E-cadherin and p120-catenin levels by the western blotting. Compared with the nonstretching group, the levels of IL-6 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5a and Figure 5b]</u> and TNF-α 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5c and Figure 5d]</u> were increased in the 20% cyclic stretching group (IL-6, t = −21.111, P < 0.01; TNF-α, t = −15.270, P < 0.01). Compared with the nonstretching group, the levels of IL-10 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5e and Figure 5f]</u> and the expression of E-cadherin and p120-catenin 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u> were decreased in the 20% cyclic stretching group (IL-10, t = 5.450, P < 0.01; E-cadherin, t = 17.736, P < 0.01; p120-catenin, t = 16.136, P < 0.01). With immunofluorescence, we observed that the distribution of E-cadherin was more limited under microscope in the stretching groups than that in the nonstretching group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7]</u>.\nGlutamine (4 mmol/L) was pretreated for 60 min before 20% cyclic stretching. Compared with the stretching group, the levels of IL-6 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5a and Figure 5b]</u> and TNF-α 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5c and Figure 5d]</u> decreased in the glutamine group (IL-6, t = 11.818, P < 0.01; TNF-α, t = 8.631, P < 0.01). Compared with the stretching group, the levels of IL-10 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5e and Figure 5f]</u> and the expression of E-cadherin and p120-catenin 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u> were increased in the glutamine group (IL-10, t = −3.203, P < 0.05; E-cadherin, t= −13.567, P < 0.01; p120-catenin, t = −10.013, P < 0.01). From immunofluorescence, we found that the distribution of E-cadherin was better in the glutamine group than that in the stretching group 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7]</u>.\nIn this study, we have shown that high tidal volume mechanical ventilation and 20% pathological cyclic mechanical stretch could cause VILI in mice and MLE-12 cells. We have also found that glutamine pretreatment could alleviate the injury degree of VILI by upregulating the expression of E-cadherin and p120-catenin, the level of IL-10, and downregulating levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in mice and MLE-12 cells.\nMechanical ventilation is an essential respiratory support in intensive care units and clinical anesthesia; if not used correctly, it can cause serious lung injury, including increasing permeability, barrier dysfunction, and pulmonary edema.通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18,19,20]</u> The worsened damage could lead to ARDS.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u> In this study, we simulated VILI as the reference indicated in vivo and in vitro.通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23]</u> Taken together, we found that high tidal volume mechanical ventilation could cause serious lung injury by lung injury scores measurement and HE staining.\nThe mechanisms of VILI are intricate, and studies have shown that they are related to inflammation and barrier function.通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25]</u> There are limited ways to prevent and treat VILI; glutamine pretreatment may be a novel way to alleviate the degree of VILI, but it requires further study. Glutamine is an essential amino acid that could attenuate ALI caused by acid aspiration by regulating the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u> The inflammation mechanisms of glutamine might be attenuation of inflammatory cell infiltration into the lung and the biotrauma reduced from the cytokine responses. TNF-α might play an important role leading to pulmonary inflammation mediated by neutrophil recruitment.通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u> Studies showed that the level of TNF-α was associated with the incidence and severity of ARDS.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Similarly, we found that the level of TNF-α increased following VILI, and glutamine could attenuate the level to reduce the neutrophil infiltration.\nGlutamine could regulate the immune function and reduce the inflammation reaction by regulating cytokines.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> The cytokine IL-6 is an important pro-inflammatory factor and was found to be involved in ALI together with other cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β, in the innate immune response.通用删除6(英):<u>[29,30]</u> The level of IL-6 could increase in VILI.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u> Consistently, we found that mechanical ventilation could increase the level of IL-6. The cytokine IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory factor that could inhibit proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Anti-inflammatory factors and pro-inflammatory factors are dynamically balanced in our body.通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u> When the body confronts injury and infection, the dynamic balance is destroyed, and the anti-inflammatory factors decrease as the other factors increase. In our study, we found that mechanical ventilation could destroy the dynamic immune balance to decrease the level of IL-10 and increase the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α. Glutamine pretreatment could restore the balance by upregulating the level of IL-10 and downregulating the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α.\nVILI could cause barrier dysfunction to regulate the adherens junctions and tight junctions.通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11,22,34]</u> We previously reported that high tidal volume mechanical ventilation could destroy the barrier function by activating c-Src kinase to downregulate the tight junction occludin.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> There are not many studies on whether adherens junctions take part in VILI, and thus, this requires further study. In this study, we assumed E-cadherin and p120-catenin participated in VILI and found that glutamine could attenuate the VILI through upregulating the adherens junctions of E-cadherin and p120-catenin.\nIn vivo, we used whole lung tissue to study the VILI, while in vitro, we used mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12) cells. Both epithelial and endothelial cells were important in the lung tissue; the mechanisms of endothelial cells in VILI have been thoroughly studied, but the mechanisms of epithelial cells are not well known. We previously reported that the epithelial cells might take part in VILI and be important to protect the function barrier.通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u> Epithelial cells are known to be involved in alveolar barrier function, and the excessive expansion and collapse of cells could damage the integrity of the alveolar membrane.通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u> In this study, we focused on the role epithelial cells play in barrier function in vitro. The current method of stretching alveolar epithelial cells using a stretch machine to simulate lung expansion and contraction is well-recognized.通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u> Frequency and maximum amplitude of stretching has been reported to change cell permeability and barrier function.通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u> Experiments have confirmed that a stretch area expanded by more than 20–30% is defined as pathological stretch stimulation.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> In this study, we used 20% cyclic stretching to simulate VILI.\nE-cadherin plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of epithelial cells.通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u> p120-catenin, which regulated the cell-cell adhesion by interaction of E-cadherin and p120-catenin, could not only increase the E-cadherin internalization from the cell surface but also decrease its recycling back to the cell surface.通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u> p120-catenin binding E-cadherin could prevent the endocytosis and degradation of E-cadherin.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> The loss of p120-catenin and E-cadherin may weaken the adhesive forces between cells and barrier dysfunction. In our study, we found that E-cadherin and p120-catenin expression decreased following both 20% cyclic stretching and high tidal volume mechanical ventilation. Glutamine has been proven to improve the barrier function resulting in a redistribution of intracellular β-catenin and the loss of E-cadherin.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> In this study, glutamine had beneficial effect to alleviate VILI by increasing the expression of E-cadherin and p120-catenin to enhance the barrier function.\nThe current in vivo and in vitro studies using high mechanical ventilation and cyclic stretching showed that glutamine could alleviate the degree of VILI by regulating the inflammatory factors together with barrier function proteins. Immunofluorescence examination showed that glutamine improved the distribution of E-cadherin with cyclic stretching. Results from HE staining, lung injury score and W/D ratio in mice showed that glutamine could ameliorate pulmonary edema and alleviate alveolar hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration and destroy pulmonary architecture.\nIn conclusions, this study provides evidence for the novel way of glutamine to protect against VILI. Glutamine ameliorated VILI by improving the cytokines and increasing the adherens junction protein E-cadherin and p120-catenin to enhance the epithelial barrier. The exact mechanisms of glutamine in VILI require further study and the protective effects of glutamine pretreatment for lung injury also require further clinical studies. This approach would be a novel manner to prevent and treat with VILI.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge Medical Research Center of Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital for equipment support and technical assistance.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 81570074, 81770076).</u>\n删除7：<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:11:03", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:11:40", "cost": 37.25}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:26", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:11:40", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:11:02"}

In the assessment of the global studies of disease 2010 study in Pakistan, the injury rate of flame and high temperature substances is 5.8 per 100,000 populations. A facility-based study of burn injury from Karachi evaluated the death rate among adults between 15 and 55 years, which showed a considerably higher rate at 10.2 per 100,000 populations. Some risk factors with confirmation included: female, age over 50 years, fire burn, inhalation injury, and the damaged body surface area >40%. However, most of the existing knowledge regarding burn injuries in Pakistan is from single-center studies in specialized burn hospitals in major cities.删除4：<u>1</u> According to the data, it is difficult to estimate the true number of burn wounds of the general population. And because of only a few specialized burn centers, people know little about the epidemiology of burn injury, which results in an important knowledge gap in Pakistan.删除4：<u>2</u>\nIn one of the studies, the facial disfigurement of burns was portrayed as \"the physical and psychological experience of a person whose face is scarred, blemished, or deformed due to burn injury\" . For example, appearance change might be a change of the self-perception, not only of the age.删除4：<u>3</u> The social psychosocial incapacity is one of the main reasons to cause the stress of burn patients with facial disfigurement. They are exposed to visual and verbal assaults, invasion of privacy, pity and ridicule from others, all of which create patients' sentiments of disgrace, barrenness, outrage and mortification. They feel insecure and have evasion behavior, in a condition of psychological misery. They are in significant trouble with social communication, particularly the first-time gathering.4 A study of Vickery et al.5 showed that the facial disfigurement due to burn injury additionally impacts the well-being of family members, who might develop psychological issues too.\nA report of Acid Survivors Foundation (ASF) indicated that females have been most influenced by burn brutality in Pakistan. Between 2007 and 2016, around 56% of the 1375 casualties of burn assaults announced were females. Although the ASF affirms the information in the reports of burn brutality based on various nationwide sources, it is hard to distinguish the gender of the casualties because of absence of recognizable feature. There are 168 such unfortunate casualties in a 10 year database of the ASF. Assuming that these unfortunate victims are all women, the actual number of women burn victims will be as high as around 68%.删除4：<u>6</u> In the 73 burn assaults in 2016, about 7 out of 10 unfortunate casualties were females. The information of ASF additionally demonstrates that transgender people are starting to be the target of arsonist. In 2016, a transgender individual was harmed in a burn assault in Pakistan. The ASF reports that between 2007 and 2016, most burn assaults occurred in Punjab, particularly South Punjab. Actually, in the information of ASF, the burn brutality in the South Punjab district is simply a tip of the iceberg. In spite of the decreased number of burn assaults in South Punjab reported by ASF in 2014, it is astounding that similar information demonstrates the assault number are rising step by step every year prior to 2015.6\nFive burn patients with severe facial disfigurement from Lahore, Pakistan were included in the study . The inclusion criteria were: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> patients that underwent reconstruction surgeries or were in waiting list for reconstruction surgeries, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> patients that were followed up on regular, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> patients living in their own residence or shelter home, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> patients with partial or full-thickness burn. The exclusion criteria were: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> patients above 50 years old, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> patients with physical disability, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> severe psychiatric disturbed. A semi-structured interview was conducted with five female burn survivors with facial disfigurement to acquire their perceptions and experiences after burn injury on the quality of their life. Formal permission was obtained from the authorities of the selected organization in Lahore, in which the nature of the research study was thoroughly explained. The interviews were conducted on different days. Meanwhile the participant's consent was taken, and the nature of the study was explained to them. Participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were then interviewed about the perceptions and experiences after burn injury with facial disfigurement. The participants were additionally probed for a better understanding of their current quality of their life. After completion of the interview, the patients were thanked for their cooperation.\nCharacteristics of the participants.\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics of the participants.</u>\nFA: faculty of arts, BA: bachelors of arts.\n-: no data.\nThematic analysis was used to reflect the textual data, the aim of which is to analyze the experiences of the interviewees.删除4：<u>7,8</u> Transcripts were analyzed to identify similar themes in a text that appeared to be a particular meaning. Across the dataset, themes were compared for similarities and differences through interviews. The similar themes were placed into one category. The transcripts were re-read and checked to clarify sub themes so that the titles of different categories could reflect the experience. Four key themes after identified include: physical appearance, posttraumatic growth, relationships and coping strategies. The themes emerged in the transcripts are as follows.\nThe notion of physical appearance in the transcripts was to describe the importance of the appearance of burn survivors in their lives and how the appearance affected the quality of their life after the injury. Some patients' life had taken great changes after burn injury as the injury has completely changed their face, and even they could not recognize their own face now. Facial disfigurement impacted their lives, and thus most of the patients feel worthless and useless. When going out for work or some other reasons, all of them almost covered their face with a veil to protect them from any kind of stigmatization. Some patients described that they had gone through reconstructive surgeries, which were helpful to have a better look and boost their confidence. A few of them mentioned that the society overvalue the appearance of people in Pakistan and the media, beauty products and cosmetic surgery set certain standards about the appearance.\nPerceived stigmatization, self-perception and perception of others are some of the issues faced by the burn survivors. An acid burn survivor 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 1)</u> was attacked by her husband 6 years ago. People still make fun of her face and sometimes they are scared after seeing her facial disfigurement. It shows the importance of the appearance and indicates perceived stigmatization of facial disfigurement after burn injury. Another acid burn survivor 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 4)</u> who is single and suffered from burn injury 4 years ago. Before her injury, she had a happy life but now things have changed. She is a burn survivor and expressed an apprehension of her appearance because she lost one of the eyes and she is disfigured now. She had a stigma due to the facial disfigurement when she compares herself before and after burn injury. She feels uncomfortable and anxious while others stare at her because of facial disfigurement, which reminds her about the incident that happened to her.\nThe theme of physical appearance shows that facial disfigurement is an obstacle of interaction with other people for burn survivors. It also highlights how the survivors have been through it in the long run. Having strong curiosity of the reason of injury, blaming on the survivors unreasonably, and treating the survivors impolitely, all of them influenced the life of the survivors. Day by day, they become used to the perceptions and attitude of other people, try to ignore them and ultimately divert the attention to other aspects of life.\nThe burn survivors described different factors, which have aided in posttraumatic growth of survivors. Perception of others towards the facial disfigurement is a hindrance for many burn survivors in personal growth. The survivors also reported that they have changed in a positive way owing to the visible differences. Posttraumatic growth is a great challenge for these survivors as they are not only coping with the injury but also live with the visible differences at the same time. Becoming productive and resourceful was of utmost importance to almost all the burn survivors. All those who are back to work have reported the remarkable difference in their lives after burn injury, which give the survivors a sense of achievement and satisfaction and closely improve the quality of life. Those people accepting the injury have shown gratitude and optimism to cope up with the injury, which is the way to express their feelings and emotions. The factors that influenced burn survivors' posttraumatic growth included: acceptance and gratitude.\nA woman 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 3)</u> who is a widow expressed her gratitude to the owner of the organization and her colleagues because they accepted her after the injury and helped her to move on with her life. This clearly indicates the importance of the positive influence of acceptance from others towards the burn survivors with facial disfigurement. Another woman 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 1)</u> who is an acid burn survivor expressed the similar views. When people show their confidence and appreciation towards her, it makes her feel happy and satisfied. In addition to acceptance, another important factor to improve the quality of life is gratitude. Two of the burn survivors 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 3 and No. 5)</u> expressed their gratitude towards God. Gratitude was much common found in those burn survivors, who are resourceful and are considered as a valued member of the society.\nThis theme sheds light on the various factors that are significant in posttraumatic growth. It is not easy for anyone to come out of a trauma as sensitive as a burn injury, but acceptance and gratitude played a key role in most of the cases and changed their attitude towards life in general. The optimistic approach helped them to overcome self-denial and the gratitude made them resilient.\nThe notion of relationships in the transcripts is the significance of the relationship in survivor's life and the influence in the quality of life. For most of the survivors, it is the support of their family to aid them in moving on and help them in adjusting well with injury. The relationships described here by burn survivors included; family support, bonding, care, financial support and future prospects.\nAn acid burn survivor 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 1)</u> said that her family is very good towards her even after the burn injury. They did not make her feel any different, showed more affection towards her and took care of her, which had become her strength. In an interview of case No. 5, she said that her parents always stand by her side and give her strength and courage. Unfortunately, a woman 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 2)</u> living with her brother had a good relationship with him before the injury, but now all things have changed for her. She used to earn money before the incident and she was also cared by all her siblings and her parents. Unfortunately no one supports her, even her siblings and relatives and she does not have any other resources.\nThis theme states the importance of relationships in the lives of burn survivors. Family support is one of the main contributing factors in their lives, which has a positive impact on the survivors. The acceptance and support of relatives influenced the survivors to rebuild the self-image and self-esteem.\nGoing through traumatic experience leaves an everlasting impact on people's life and the big challenge to adjust with it is the coping strategies. The foremost one was emotional coping strategy that was found common in all the transcripts. Emotional coping strategy helps them in venting out and makes them feel better. Another important coping strategy that emerged throughout the transcripts was religious coping strategies. Religion teaches people to be patient no matter what goes through in his/her life. Thereby, most of them kept going with their faith and having optimistic approach towards life. Religion also teaches people to be content in any situation and most of the burn survivors followed the same notion. Despite of facial disfigurement, they exhibited a positive outlook towards life and were found to be content even after going through such pain and injury.\nThe coping strategies described by burn survivors regarding appearance included: emotional coping strategy, religious coping strategy.\nIn our study, three cases 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 1, 3 and 4)</u> have the same situation of enduring the strong changes of emotion. An acid burn survivor 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 4)</u> said that she should remain happy and should be strong, which the burn survivor could keep herself motivated. An important factor here is her family members who stood by her and she did not want to make them upset by crying or staying sad/depressed. Another woman 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 1)</u> could not get it out of her mind and always thinks that why that happened to her. There is one case 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 3)</u> who got injured because of the gas explosion, and she felt how different people had reacted to her after the burn injury. It was not easy for her to tolerate such attitude, but she dealt with situations in a much calmer manner and coped up well.\nReligious coping strategy is to advice burn survivors accepting their injury and showing reliance on their religion. After undergoing four surgeries, the burn survivor 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 3)</u> said that she tries to live in a good manner and prays to God. She showed her gratitude and satisfaction with life. A burn survivor 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 2)</u> expressed that she asks God for the strength and courage.\nIt is found that emotional coping strategy is dominant in the coping strategies for burn survivors. Despite the burn injury, the burn survivors showed contentment and gratitude towards life and embraced the difficulties including stigmatizing behavior from others. The qualitative analysis reflects differences in perceptions and individual experiences of burn survivors with facial disfigurement. It shows the importance of physical appearance for individuals and how their life has changed after burn injury. The survivors who had a strong family support, enough resources and were full of gratitude could embrace their visible differences post burn injury and are satisfied with their lives. On the contrary, religious coping strategy can keep them moving on their lives.\nThe findings of the study show that the perception of burn survivors with facial disfigurement about quality of life is influenced by psychosocial factors and personal attributes. Self-perception, support system, financial stability, environmental factors, success of surgeries, life orientation, social comparison, gratitude and coping strategies are the factors which strongly influence the quality of life of survivors.\nThe research shows the manner treated by others, insecurities of the appearance, and different experiences of growing up and living have a great influence on the self-esteem, self-worth and overall perceptions of survivors.删除4：<u>9</u> The role of these factors is indeed significant for burn survivors in perceiving their life in general and further defining the quality of life. The current study highlights the same issues and aspects that play an important role in forming the perceptions of burn survivors with facial disfigurement regarding their quality of life. Those who go through a trauma like burn injury daily functioning is characterized by so many aspects. Treating them like others with a welcoming and understanding attitude has a significant impact on them. This instills new hope and optimism in them, and inspires them like everyone else to perform well in life.\nPrevious research also shows the experiences of people who think they have adjusted positively to a visible difference.删除4：<u>10</u> Inner strength and positivity, active coping techniques, downward social comparisons, good daily functioning, spirituality and humor are the key factors to bring a positive difference in their lives. All these factors significantly bring a positive change in their lives, but social support turned out to be the most dominant one. Acceptance of burn injury by support system leads their lives to perceiving in a positive manner and a better satisfaction. The present study supports the findings of the importance of social support, in which the positive attitude of friends and relatives boosts the confidence of participants and helps them to have a better psychosocial adjustment.删除4：<u>11</u> Family support has always been a positive motivation for them to make a greater progress in life. Although sometimes they get depressed or anxious and feel worthless and low self-esteem, the strong support of family can uplift them significantly.\nA research was carried out to investigate the interpersonal relationships, psychological effects, and coping strategies of female acid burn victims through in-depth interviews.删除4：<u>12</u> The sample comprised of 6 female acid burn victims in two Pakistan cities, Lahore and Jhelum. The research was carried out in two phases. The first phase was based on brainstorming sessions and development of interview guideline. The second phase was based on the interview results with all acid burn victims. Mean age of the samples was 32.6 years. Ten themes were emerged through thematic analysis, including effects of acid attacks on family relations, attitudes of extended family, role of friends, causes of attacks, psychological effects, physical effects, facial disfigurement and body image, people's attitudes towards victims, reactions of victims towards unpleasant concern, and coping strategies.\nJaved et al.13 investigated the effect of education on quality of life and well-being. The samples consisted of hundred educated Muslim housewives and a hundred uneducated ones. In order to collect the data, a snowball sampling technique was used. Quality of life was assessed by using the WHOQOL-BREF and well-being scale was used to assess various well-being dimensions in both the groups. The results showed significant difference between educated and uneducated Muslim women on various dimensions of quality life and well-being.\nBellie et al.14 examined the posttraumatic growth and social support, coping strategies, dispositional optimism, functioning, post-traumatic stress symptoms, severity and time of burn. The sample included 74 participants, which were from regional burn units. A battery of self-report questionnaires was administered on them. It was found that they experience posttraumatic growth (mean = 1.26, range = 0-4.67). Severity burn, post-burn function and trauma symptoms significantly correlated with posttraumatic growth. Regression analysis proposed a model to explain 51.7% of the variance, with active coping strategies, social support and avoidance coping strategies as significant predictors of posttraumatic growth.\nMost of the studies based on burn injury tend to focus on the psycho-social factors associated with post burn injury. However, there is a need to gain an in-depth understanding of the perceptions and experiences of female burn survivors with facial disfigurement by using a qualitative approach, which include their emotions, feelings, behaviors, discrimination from others, coping strategies, resilience, support system, daily life, relationship with others, attitude towards self, and so on. This can aid in exploring the most important aspects of facial disfigurement after burn injury that leads to physical and psychological changes of burn survivors, which results in defining orientation of their life. Thus, this can be instrumental in providing new researches which are mostly not only focused in quantitative research but an understanding of posttraumatic growth after burn injury.删除4：<u>15</u>\nIt can be concluded that the process of acceptance, posttraumatic growth and adjustment of burn survivors with facial disfigurement have an impact on their family life, social environment, personality type and belief. Thus, there is a need to focus more on the curative plan for burn survivors to aid them in overcoming the issues after injury and developing the coping strategies.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2020.11.007</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "paper-medjournals_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "FA: faculty of arts, BA: bachelors of arts.\n\n-: no data.", "content": "【0】Burn injury is a significant issue and yet ignored in Pakistan.

And because of only a few specialized burn centers, people know little about the epidemiology of burn injury, which results in an important knowledge gap in Pakistan.删除4：<u>2</u>\nIn one of the studies, the facial disfigurement of burns was portrayed as \"the physical and psychological experience of a person whose face is scarred, blemished, or deformed due to burn injury\" . For example, appearance change might be a change of the self-perception, not only of the age.删除4：<u>3</u> The social psychosocial incapacity is one of the main reasons to cause the stress of burn patients with facial disfigurement. They are exposed to visual and verbal assaults, invasion of privacy, pity and ridicule from others, all of which create patients' sentiments of disgrace, barrenness, outrage and mortification. They feel insecure and have evasion behavior, in a condition of psychological misery. They are in significant trouble with social communication, particularly the first-time gathering.4 A study of Vickery et al.5 showed that the facial disfigurement due to burn injury additionally impacts the well-being of family members, who might develop psychological issues too.\nA report of Acid Survivors Foundation (ASF) indicated that females have been most influenced by burn brutality in Pakistan. Between 2007 and 2016, around 56% of the 1375 casualties of burn assaults announced were females. Although the ASF affirms the information in the reports of burn brutality based on various nationwide sources, it is hard to distinguish the gender of the casualties because of absence of recognizable feature. There are 168 such unfortunate casualties in a 10 year database of the ASF.

The ASF reports that between 2007 and 2016, most burn assaults occurred in Punjab, particularly South Punjab. Actually, in the information of ASF, the burn brutality in the South Punjab district is simply a tip of the iceberg. In spite of the decreased number of burn assaults in South Punjab reported by ASF in 2014, it is astounding that similar information demonstrates the assault number are rising step by step every year prior to 2015.6\nFive burn patients with severe facial disfigurement from Lahore, Pakistan were included in the study .

This can aid in exploring the most important aspects of facial disfigurement after burn injury that leads to physical and psychological changes of burn survivors, which results in defining orientation of their life. Thus, this can be instrumental in providing new researches which are mostly not only focused in quantitative research but an understanding of posttraumatic growth after burn injury.删除4：<u>15</u>\nIt can be concluded that the process of acceptance, posttraumatic growth and adjustment of burn survivors with facial disfigurement have an impact on their family life, social environment, personality type and belief. Thus, there is a need to focus more on the curative plan for burn survivors to aid them in overcoming the issues after injury and developing the coping strategies.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2020.11.007</u>", "index": 4959, "show": true, "start": 4959, "end": 5015, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "Peer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.", "content": "【0】Burn injury is a significant issue and yet ignored in Pakistan. In the assessment of the global studies of disease 2010 study in Pakistan, the injury rate of flame and high temperature substances is 5.8 per 100,000 populations. A facility-based study of burn injury from Karachi evaluated the death rate among adults between 15 and 55 years, which showed a considerably higher rate at 10.2 per 100,000 populations. Some risk factors with confirmation included: female, age over 50 years, fire burn, inhalation injury, and the damaged body surface area >40%. However, most of the existing knowledge regarding burn injuries in Pakistan is from single-center studies in specialized burn hospitals in major cities.删除4：<u>1</u> According to the data, it is difficult to estimate the true number of burn wounds of the general population. And because of only a few specialized burn centers, people know little about the epidemiology of burn injury, which results in an important knowledge gap in Pakistan.删除4：<u>2</u>\nIn one of the studies, the facial disfigurement of burns was portrayed as \"the physical and psychological experience of a person whose face is scarred, blemished, or deformed due to burn injury\" . For example, appearance change might be a change of the self-perception, not only of the age.删除4：<u>3</u> The social psychosocial incapacity is one of the main reasons to cause the stress of burn patients with facial disfigurement. They are exposed to visual and verbal assaults, invasion of privacy, pity and ridicule from others, all of which create patients' sentiments of disgrace, barrenness, outrage and mortification. They feel insecure and have evasion behavior, in a condition of psychological misery. They are in significant trouble with social communication, particularly the first-time gathering.4 A study of Vickery et al.5 showed that the facial disfigurement due to burn injury additionally impacts the well-being of family members, who might develop psychological issues too.\nA report of Acid Survivors Foundation (ASF) indicated that females have been most influenced by burn brutality in Pakistan. Between 2007 and 2016, around 56% of the 1375 casualties of burn assaults announced were females. Although the ASF affirms the information in the reports of burn brutality based on various nationwide sources, it is hard to distinguish the gender of the casualties because of absence of recognizable feature. There are 168 such unfortunate casualties in a 10 year database of the ASF. Assuming that these unfortunate victims are all women, the actual number of women burn victims will be as high as around 68%.删除4：<u>6</u> In the 73 burn assaults in 2016, about 7 out of 10 unfortunate casualties were females. The information of ASF additionally demonstrates that transgender people are starting to be the target of arsonist. In 2016, a transgender individual was harmed in a burn assault in Pakistan. The ASF reports that between 2007 and 2016, most burn assaults occurred in Punjab, particularly South Punjab. Actually, in the information of ASF, the burn brutality in the South Punjab district is simply a tip of the iceberg. In spite of the decreased number of burn assaults in South Punjab reported by ASF in 2014, it is astounding that similar information demonstrates the assault number are rising step by step every year prior to 2015.6\nFive burn patients with severe facial disfigurement from Lahore, Pakistan were included in the study . The inclusion criteria were: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> patients that underwent reconstruction surgeries or were in waiting list for reconstruction surgeries, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> patients that were followed up on regular, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> patients living in their own residence or shelter home, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> patients with partial or full-thickness burn. The exclusion criteria were: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> patients above 50 years old, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> patients with physical disability, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> severe psychiatric disturbed. A semi-structured interview was conducted with five female burn survivors with facial disfigurement to acquire their perceptions and experiences after burn injury on the quality of their life. Formal permission was obtained from the authorities of the selected organization in Lahore, in which the nature of the research study was thoroughly explained. The interviews were conducted on different days. Meanwhile the participant's consent was taken, and the nature of the study was explained to them. Participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were then interviewed about the perceptions and experiences after burn injury with facial disfigurement. The participants were additionally probed for a better understanding of their current quality of their life. After completion of the interview, the patients were thanked for their cooperation.\nCharacteristics of the participants.\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics of the participants.</u>\n<mark>FA: faculty of arts, BA: bachelors of arts.\n\n-: no data.</mark>Thematic analysis was used to reflect the textual data, the aim of which is to analyze the experiences of the interviewees.删除4：<u>7,8</u> Transcripts were analyzed to identify similar themes in a text that appeared to be a particular meaning. Across the dataset, themes were compared for similarities and differences through interviews. The similar themes were placed into one category. The transcripts were re-read and checked to clarify sub themes so that the titles of different categories could reflect the experience. Four key themes after identified include: physical appearance, posttraumatic growth, relationships and coping strategies. The themes emerged in the transcripts are as follows.\nThe notion of physical appearance in the transcripts was to describe the importance of the appearance of burn survivors in their lives and how the appearance affected the quality of their life after the injury. Some patients' life had taken great changes after burn injury as the injury has completely changed their face, and even they could not recognize their own face now. Facial disfigurement impacted their lives, and thus most of the patients feel worthless and useless. When going out for work or some other reasons, all of them almost covered their face with a veil to protect them from any kind of stigmatization. Some patients described that they had gone through reconstructive surgeries, which were helpful to have a better look and boost their confidence. A few of them mentioned that the society overvalue the appearance of people in Pakistan and the media, beauty products and cosmetic surgery set certain standards about the appearance.\nPerceived stigmatization, self-perception and perception of others are some of the issues faced by the burn survivors. An acid burn survivor 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 1)</u> was attacked by her husband 6 years ago. People still make fun of her face and sometimes they are scared after seeing her facial disfigurement. It shows the importance of the appearance and indicates perceived stigmatization of facial disfigurement after burn injury. Another acid burn survivor 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 4)</u> who is single and suffered from burn injury 4 years ago. Before her injury, she had a happy life but now things have changed. She is a burn survivor and expressed an apprehension of her appearance because she lost one of the eyes and she is disfigured now. She had a stigma due to the facial disfigurement when she compares herself before and after burn injury. She feels uncomfortable and anxious while others stare at her because of facial disfigurement, which reminds her about the incident that happened to her.\nThe theme of physical appearance shows that facial disfigurement is an obstacle of interaction with other people for burn survivors. It also highlights how the survivors have been through it in the long run. Having strong curiosity of the reason of injury, blaming on the survivors unreasonably, and treating the survivors impolitely, all of them influenced the life of the survivors. Day by day, they become used to the perceptions and attitude of other people, try to ignore them and ultimately divert the attention to other aspects of life.\nThe burn survivors described different factors, which have aided in posttraumatic growth of survivors. Perception of others towards the facial disfigurement is a hindrance for many burn survivors in personal growth. The survivors also reported that they have changed in a positive way owing to the visible differences. Posttraumatic growth is a great challenge for these survivors as they are not only coping with the injury but also live with the visible differences at the same time. Becoming productive and resourceful was of utmost importance to almost all the burn survivors. All those who are back to work have reported the remarkable difference in their lives after burn injury, which give the survivors a sense of achievement and satisfaction and closely improve the quality of life. Those people accepting the injury have shown gratitude and optimism to cope up with the injury, which is the way to express their feelings and emotions. The factors that influenced burn survivors' posttraumatic growth included: acceptance and gratitude.\nA woman 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 3)</u> who is a widow expressed her gratitude to the owner of the organization and her colleagues because they accepted her after the injury and helped her to move on with her life. This clearly indicates the importance of the positive influence of acceptance from others towards the burn survivors with facial disfigurement. Another woman 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 1)</u> who is an acid burn survivor expressed the similar views. When people show their confidence and appreciation towards her, it makes her feel happy and satisfied. In addition to acceptance, another important factor to improve the quality of life is gratitude. Two of the burn survivors 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 3 and No. 5)</u> expressed their gratitude towards God. Gratitude was much common found in those burn survivors, who are resourceful and are considered as a valued member of the society.\nThis theme sheds light on the various factors that are significant in posttraumatic growth. It is not easy for anyone to come out of a trauma as sensitive as a burn injury, but acceptance and gratitude played a key role in most of the cases and changed their attitude towards life in general. The optimistic approach helped them to overcome self-denial and the gratitude made them resilient.\nThe notion of relationships in the transcripts is the significance of the relationship in survivor's life and the influence in the quality of life. For most of the survivors, it is the support of their family to aid them in moving on and help them in adjusting well with injury. The relationships described here by burn survivors included; family support, bonding, care, financial support and future prospects.\nAn acid burn survivor 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 1)</u> said that her family is very good towards her even after the burn injury. They did not make her feel any different, showed more affection towards her and took care of her, which had become her strength. In an interview of case No. 5, she said that her parents always stand by her side and give her strength and courage. Unfortunately, a woman 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 2)</u> living with her brother had a good relationship with him before the injury, but now all things have changed for her. She used to earn money before the incident and she was also cared by all her siblings and her parents. Unfortunately no one supports her, even her siblings and relatives and she does not have any other resources.\nThis theme states the importance of relationships in the lives of burn survivors. Family support is one of the main contributing factors in their lives, which has a positive impact on the survivors. The acceptance and support of relatives influenced the survivors to rebuild the self-image and self-esteem.\nGoing through traumatic experience leaves an everlasting impact on people's life and the big challenge to adjust with it is the coping strategies. The foremost one was emotional coping strategy that was found common in all the transcripts. Emotional coping strategy helps them in venting out and makes them feel better. Another important coping strategy that emerged throughout the transcripts was religious coping strategies. Religion teaches people to be patient no matter what goes through in his/her life. Thereby, most of them kept going with their faith and having optimistic approach towards life. Religion also teaches people to be content in any situation and most of the burn survivors followed the same notion. Despite of facial disfigurement, they exhibited a positive outlook towards life and were found to be content even after going through such pain and injury.\nThe coping strategies described by burn survivors regarding appearance included: emotional coping strategy, religious coping strategy.\nIn our study, three cases 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 1, 3 and 4)</u> have the same situation of enduring the strong changes of emotion. An acid burn survivor 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 4)</u> said that she should remain happy and should be strong, which the burn survivor could keep herself motivated. An important factor here is her family members who stood by her and she did not want to make them upset by crying or staying sad/depressed. Another woman 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 1)</u> could not get it out of her mind and always thinks that why that happened to her. There is one case 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 3)</u> who got injured because of the gas explosion, and she felt how different people had reacted to her after the burn injury. It was not easy for her to tolerate such attitude, but she dealt with situations in a much calmer manner and coped up well.\nReligious coping strategy is to advice burn survivors accepting their injury and showing reliance on their religion. After undergoing four surgeries, the burn survivor 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 3)</u> said that she tries to live in a good manner and prays to God. She showed her gratitude and satisfaction with life. A burn survivor 通用删除1(英):<u>(case No. 2)</u> expressed that she asks God for the strength and courage.\nIt is found that emotional coping strategy is dominant in the coping strategies for burn survivors. Despite the burn injury, the burn survivors showed contentment and gratitude towards life and embraced the difficulties including stigmatizing behavior from others. The qualitative analysis reflects differences in perceptions and individual experiences of burn survivors with facial disfigurement. It shows the importance of physical appearance for individuals and how their life has changed after burn injury. The survivors who had a strong family support, enough resources and were full of gratitude could embrace their visible differences post burn injury and are satisfied with their lives. On the contrary, religious coping strategy can keep them moving on their lives.\nThe findings of the study show that the perception of burn survivors with facial disfigurement about quality of life is influenced by psychosocial factors and personal attributes. Self-perception, support system, financial stability, environmental factors, success of surgeries, life orientation, social comparison, gratitude and coping strategies are the factors which strongly influence the quality of life of survivors.\nThe research shows the manner treated by others, insecurities of the appearance, and different experiences of growing up and living have a great influence on the self-esteem, self-worth and overall perceptions of survivors.删除4：<u>9</u> The role of these factors is indeed significant for burn survivors in perceiving their life in general and further defining the quality of life. The current study highlights the same issues and aspects that play an important role in forming the perceptions of burn survivors with facial disfigurement regarding their quality of life. Those who go through a trauma like burn injury daily functioning is characterized by so many aspects. Treating them like others with a welcoming and understanding attitude has a significant impact on them. This instills new hope and optimism in them, and inspires them like everyone else to perform well in life.\nPrevious research also shows the experiences of people who think they have adjusted positively to a visible difference.删除4：<u>10</u> Inner strength and positivity, active coping techniques, downward social comparisons, good daily functioning, spirituality and humor are the key factors to bring a positive difference in their lives. All these factors significantly bring a positive change in their lives, but social support turned out to be the most dominant one. Acceptance of burn injury by support system leads their lives to perceiving in a positive manner and a better satisfaction. The present study supports the findings of the importance of social support, in which the positive attitude of friends and relatives boosts the confidence of participants and helps them to have a better psychosocial adjustment.删除4：<u>11</u> Family support has always been a positive motivation for them to make a greater progress in life. Although sometimes they get depressed or anxious and feel worthless and low self-esteem, the strong support of family can uplift them significantly.\nA research was carried out to investigate the interpersonal relationships, psychological effects, and coping strategies of female acid burn victims through in-depth interviews.删除4：<u>12</u> The sample comprised of 6 female acid burn victims in two Pakistan cities, Lahore and Jhelum. The research was carried out in two phases. The first phase was based on brainstorming sessions and development of interview guideline. The second phase was based on the interview results with all acid burn victims. Mean age of the samples was 32.6 years. Ten themes were emerged through thematic analysis, including effects of acid attacks on family relations, attitudes of extended family, role of friends, causes of attacks, psychological effects, physical effects, facial disfigurement and body image, people's attitudes towards victims, reactions of victims towards unpleasant concern, and coping strategies.\nJaved et al.13 investigated the effect of education on quality of life and well-being. The samples consisted of hundred educated Muslim housewives and a hundred uneducated ones. In order to collect the data, a snowball sampling technique was used. Quality of life was assessed by using the WHOQOL-BREF and well-being scale was used to assess various well-being dimensions in both the groups. The results showed significant difference between educated and uneducated Muslim women on various dimensions of quality life and well-being.\nBellie et al.14 examined the posttraumatic growth and social support, coping strategies, dispositional optimism, functioning, post-traumatic stress symptoms, severity and time of burn. The sample included 74 participants, which were from regional burn units. A battery of self-report questionnaires was administered on them. It was found that they experience posttraumatic growth (mean = 1.26, range = 0-4.67). Severity burn, post-burn function and trauma symptoms significantly correlated with posttraumatic growth. Regression analysis proposed a model to explain 51.7% of the variance, with active coping strategies, social support and avoidance coping strategies as significant predictors of posttraumatic growth.\nMost of the studies based on burn injury tend to focus on the psycho-social factors associated with post burn injury. However, there is a need to gain an in-depth understanding of the perceptions and experiences of female burn survivors with facial disfigurement by using a qualitative approach, which include their emotions, feelings, behaviors, discrimination from others, coping strategies, resilience, support system, daily life, relationship with others, attitude towards self, and so on. This can aid in exploring the most important aspects of facial disfigurement after burn injury that leads to physical and psychological changes of burn survivors, which results in defining orientation of their life. Thus, this can be instrumental in providing new researches which are mostly not only focused in quantitative research but an understanding of posttraumatic growth after burn injury.删除4：<u>15</u>\nIt can be concluded that the process of acceptance, posttraumatic growth and adjustment of burn survivors with facial disfigurement have an impact on their family life, social environment, personality type and belief. Thus, there is a need to focus more on the curative plan for burn survivors to aid them in overcoming the issues after injury and developing the coping strategies.\nPeer review under responsibility of Chinese Medical Association.删除6：<u>\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2020.11.007</u>", "index": 20906, "show": true, "start": 20893, "end": 20957, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/10/09 10:35:05", "endTime": "2024/10/09 10:36:00", "cost": 55.033}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-10-07 19:31:26", "update_time": "2024-10-08 18:36:00", "grab_time": "2024-10-08 18:35:04"}

In recent years, the nonmotor symptoms of PD have received increasing attention, one of which is excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). This review summarized recent studies on the epidemiology, etiology, clinical implications, associated features, and evaluation of EDS in PD. In addition, the efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for EDS in PD was also reviewed.\nEDS is defined as an inability to maintain wakefulness and alertness during the major waking episodes of the day that results in periods of irrepressible need for sleep or unintended lapses into drowsiness or sleep.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> EDS is a major health hazard in PD, affecting 21–76% of PD patients with an incidence of 6% per year.通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,4]</u> The prevalence of EDS is higher in PD patients than in the general population, with controlled studies showing subjective sleepiness in 34–54% of PD patients compared with 16–19% of controls.通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u>\nAn important feature of EDS that must be taken into account is the \"sudden onset of sleep\" , which is when a patient suddenly falls asleep during periods of inactivity or low activity. Sudden onset of sleep is reported by 1–31% of PD patients and most patients are not able to completely recall the event.通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u> Some PD patients also exhibit significant features of narcolepsy, including cataplexy and sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods (SOREMPs) in the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u> Sudden onset of sleep contributes significantly to disease burden and negatively impacts quality of life, impairs daytime functioning, and is associated with motor vehicle crashes.通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u> However, many PD patients may not be aware of their sleepiness.\nEDS in PD is not persistent, and its presence may fluctuate over time. In general, the proportion of PD patients with EDS increases over time with longer follow-up. A longitudinal study revealed a progressive increase in EDS prevalence from 4% at baseline to 41% after 8 years of follow-up.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>\nEDS is associated with and influences other motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD. Longitudinal studies report that the presence of EDS is associated with clinical variables such as male gender, poorer nighttime sleep, cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, probable behavior disorder, advanced disease, the postural instability-gait difficulty motor phenotype, less severe dyskinesias, dosage of dopamine agonists, and use of antihypertensives.通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13,14]</u> A longitudinal study showed that predictors of the incident development of EDS included autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau/total tau ratio.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>\nClinicians have also noted the impact of mood symptoms on EDS in PD. A recent review article reported a significant positive correlation between depression and EDS and a weak correlation between anxiety and EDS in PD patients. The magnitude of the correlation depended on how EDS was measured; it was medium when EDS was subjectively measured and small when EDS was objectively measured.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>\nPD patients with EDS exhibit alterations in brain structure and function (e.g. brain volume, white matter integrity as indicated by fractional anisotropy, cerebral metabolism).通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u> It is impossible to determine whether EDS is a potential manifestation of more severe brainstem neurodegeneration.\nSome evidence suggested that EDS predated the conversion of PD. Sleepy adults had a more than 3-fold increased risk of PD, compared with non-sleepy adults (odds ratio: 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4–7.0, P < 0.01).通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u> Another study showed that EDS (i.e. an Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score >8 at the time of REM sleep behavior disorder [RBD] diagnosis) predicted more rapid conversion to parkinsonism and dementia in patients with idiopathic RBD (iRBD).通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u> Another study showed that EDS (i.e. ESS score ≥14) was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing PD in iRBD patients (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.6; 95% CI: 1.6–7.9, P < 0.01).通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u> By contrast, a prospective follow-up study assessing a large cohort of patients with iRBD and controls found no difference in baseline ESS score between those who eventually converted and those who remained disease free.通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u> This discrepancy between studies might result from differences in sample size, follow-up period, cutoff values for ESS score, and conversion time from RBD diagnosis or onset.\nEDS may also be independently associated with risk of cognitive decline. Among 4894 elderly people, those who felt sleepy during the daytime had an increased risk of cognitive decline 8 years later.通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>\nThe etiology of EDS in PD is multifactorial. First, EDS may involve alterations in pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. In the brainstem, neurodegeneration within ascending arousal systems controls neurotransmission across several neuronal nuclei such as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, noradrenergic dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus, histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus, and dopaminergic areas. In particular, adenosine is a neurotransmitter that promotes non-REM sleep and cholinergic neurons in laterodorsal tegmental and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei promote REM sleep. Because PD progression may co-occur with the degeneration of neurons controlling wakefulness and sleep, it could lead to sleep disorders including EDS.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,21]</u>\nSecond, EDS could be an adverse outcome of dopaminergic therapy. Several studies showed that dopaminergic agents (e.g. levodopa) and agonists (e.g. pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine) caused somnolence.通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23,24]</u> PD patients taking a dopamine agonist were sleepier than those treated with levodopa alone.通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26,27]</u> Combination therapy with levodopa and a dopamine agonist was associated with the highest risk of EDS.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u> Furthermore, the influence of dopaminergic therapy on EDS was dose-dependent,通用删除6(英):<u>[29,30]</u> and some investigators believed that PD patients who take high doses of dopaminergic therapy are prone to irresistible sleep attacks.通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u>\nThird, EDS may be linked to poor (i.e. nonrestorative) nocturnal sleep. Polysomnographic studies showed that PD patients have significantly shorter total sleep time, lower sleep efficiency, and sleep architectural changes.通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u> Many coexistent primary sleep disorders (e.g. restless legs syndrome [RLS], periodic limb movement disorder, and RBD), motor disturbances (e.g. nocturnal akinesia, bradykinesia, rest tremor, and inability to turn over in bed), and other nonmotor symptoms (i.e. pain, depression, nocturia, and hallucinations, temperature dysregulation due to dysautonomia) could also lead to sleep fragmentation, which in turn could result in EDS.通用删除6(英):<u>[33,34,35]</u> In particular, the presence of RBD might be associated with greater sleepiness in PD, as some studies reported that PD patients with EDS had a higher rate of RBD than those without EDS and that PD patients with probable RBD experienced a higher level of sleepiness than those without RBD.通用删除6(英):<u>[36,37,38]</u> It is unclear whether RLS directly contributes to EDS. One study showed no difference in subjective sleepiness between PD patients with and without RLS. However, the EDS in Multiple System Atrophy (SLEEMSA) study reported that RLS predicted EDS in PD.通用删除6(英):<u>[6,39]</u> Furthermore, although sleep-disordered breathing might play a role in EDS, its overall contribution might be limited.通用删除6(英):<u>[40,41]</u>\nIn addition, other factors such as genes; the sleep environment; use of antihypertensive medications, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and certain antidepressants (e.g. serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors, MAO-I);通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u> hypocretin (orexin) cell loss;通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u> and circadian rhythm abnormalities may also contribute to EDS in PD. Therefore, further studies are required in this area.通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u>\nPD patients should undergo thorough sleep evaluation consisting of solicitation of the chief complaint; detailed social, family, medical, psychiatric, and sleep history; physical examination; and, if necessary, objective sleep testing with polysomnography and the MSLT.\nClinicians should understand the clinical presentation of sleepiness by PD patients. Patients might complain of both daytime sleepiness and disturbed nocturnal sleep and sometimes have associated complaints such as daytime fatigue, lack of concentration, and lack of symptom relief after additional sleep. It is important to distinguish sleepiness from fatigue, as there is significant overlap between the two symptoms.通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u> Fatigue is a physical or psychological feeling that can be confounded with EDS. Fatigued patients may describe themselves as feeling tired or having a lack of energy, but they do not fall asleep when sedentary.通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u> Interviewing other people who are familiar with the patient could help provide more information that can be obtained directly from the patient.\nSubjective scales have some advantages in terms of their ease of administration and ability to incorporate patient insight into the degree of the problem. The ESS is a scale that is commonly used to determine the severity of sleepiness during a given period. Many studies use a score of 10 as a cutoff to identify sleepiness. Other useful questionnaires for assessing sleepiness include the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson’s Disease-SLEEP-Daytime Sleepiness, and PD Sleep Scale. However, clinical impression of sleepiness and results of sleep questionnaires might be insufficient evidence for medical concern.通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u>\nTo reduce bias and the potential impact of confounding factors, objective measures may also be appropriate. Polysomnography can identify underlying sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and RBD that cause night sleep fragmentation and can provide indirect evidence of EDS. Furthermore, standardized tests for assessing EDS are the MSLT and maintenance of wakefulness test. The MSLT assesses the ability to fall asleep, whereas the maintenance of wakefulness test assesses the ability to remain awake. These two tests are not routinely used to evaluate sleepiness in PD. One study found a high frequency of self-reported EDS in PD patients despite that many patients do not exhibit short sleep latency in the MSLT.通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u> However, when PD patients exhibit narcolepsy-like behavior, the MSLT could demonstrate mean sleep latency and SOREMP for differentially diagnosing narcolepsy. Furthermore, a 24-h continuous sleep recording or an actigraphic recording of at least 1 week can also be used to diagnose EDS in PD.\nWe believe that the appropriate selection of a subjective or objective assessment of EDS in PD is very important. Currently, there is no commonly accepted clinically useful method for diagnosing EDS in PD. Considering subjective assessments, each scale has its own advantages and disadvantages, and different studies adopt different measures of EDS, which can result in varying conclusions. Most studies compare the results of sleep questionnaires to the extensively used ESS, as it is important to understand the sensitivity, specificity, and application ranges of different criteria. Considering objective assessments, evidence of their value is low. Routine detection methods have not found meaningful results, although perhaps changes in the duration and times of testing could reveal different findings. There is also a need for more standardized assessment of EDS in PD. Therefore, objective evaluation in conjunction with subjective assessment may be the best approach to diagnosing EDS in PD.\nThere are few specific guidelines for treating EDS and no studies on the treatment of sudden onset of sleep in PD. The treatment of EDS is complex because of its heterogeneous causes in PD patients. Treatment must be individualized and directed at the underlying causes if known.通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u> Considering the available evidence, we discuss some implications for clinical practice. The efficacy level of \"clinically useful\" means that evidence available is sufficient to conclude that the intervention provides clinical benefit for a given situation. \"Possibly useful\" means that the available evidence is suggestive but insufficient to conclude that the intervention provides clinical benefit in a given situation. \"Investigational\" means that the available evidence is insufficient to support the use of the intervention in clinical practice, although further study is warranted. We found no \"unlikely useful\" or \"not useful\" management approaches.通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u>\nIn addition to PD-related motor disabilities, EDS and sudden onset of sleep while driving are critical factors for traffic safety. Patients should be warned not to drive if they doze in unusual circumstances,通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> especially when their ESS score is ≥7.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> It is also necessary to identify and treat any possible sleep disorders that could disrupt nocturnal sleep and to withdraw or reduce any possible drugs causing hypersomnia, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, or sedatives. The European Federation of Neurological Societies and Movement Disorder Society-European Section recommend that managing EDS in PD patients should involve assessing nocturnal sleep disturbances; improving nocturnal sleep by reducing akinesia, tremor, and urinary frequency; recommending the cessation of driving; reducing or discontinuing sedative drugs; and reducing the dosage of dopaminergic drugs (mainly dopamine agonists) or switching to other dopamine agonists.通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u>\nDopaminergic therapies could improve overnight sleep and be useful for treating RLS in PD and thereby improving EDS. However, dopamine agonist-associated sleep abnormalities, including sleep attacks, should be considered potential dose-dependent risks of dopamine and combination therapy with levodopa and dopamine agonists. Dosage reduction, monotherapy, or discontinuation in these patients could be helpful and could be replaced by selegiline, amantadine, or entacapone, which have no effects on EDS通用删除6(英):<u>[45,52]</u> and may even reduce or resolve EDS.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,28,52,53,54]</u> Although clonazepam is the mainstay of treatment for RBD, given its associated risks, benzodiazepine use should generally be avoided in PD patients with EDS. Furthermore, EDS occurs in nearly half of the PD patients treated with clozapine.通用删除6(英):<u>[55]</u>\nOther primary sleep disorders that might cause EDS should be carefully assessed using polysomnography and treated appropriately. For example, continuous positive airway pressure treatment improves subjective and objective EDS in PD patients with obstructive sleep apnea by reducing apnea events, improving oxygen saturation, and deepening sleep.通用删除6(英):<u>[56]</u> Efficacy conclusion is clinically useful. Identifying and treating primary sleep disorders is necessary and must be completed before any treatment.\nBecause drug therapies have the potential for adverse side effects, nonpharmacologic treatment approaches offer a promising alternative for preventing and managing EDS in PD.\nCognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is extensively used to treat insomnia in non-PD populations. It consists of behavioral and psychological approaches to teaching patients how to change their dysfunctional behaviors and thinking patterns. One small study found that the Insomnia Severity Index, PD Sleep Scale, and examiner-reported clinical global impression improved in PD patients who received CBT-I combined with light therapy.通用删除6(英):<u>[57]</u> Therefore, in accordance with CBT-I, clinicians could recommend that patients strictly follow sleep hygiene rules such as having regular nap times and daytime physical activity and avoiding vigorous physical activity 3–4 h before sleeping.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,58]</u> Efficacy conclusion for CBT is under investigation. CBT-I is simple to administer, but there remains insufficient evidence for its effective management of EDS in PD patients.\nSupplementary exposure to bright light (i.e. light therapy) has beneficial effects on sleep, depression, bradykinesia, rigidity, and dyskinesias in PD patients, as light activates the suprachiasmatic nucleus and is the most effective zeitgeber of the circadian timing system. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study found that bright light therapy twice daily in 1-h intervals for 14 days significantly reduced ESS in PD patients (15.8 ± 3.1 at baseline vs. 11.2 ± 3.3 after intervention). Possible reasons for this effect were that light therapy improves PD severity, daytime alertness, nighttime sleep quality, or sleep fragmentation by influencing the circadian system and promoting dopamine release.通用删除6(英):<u>[59,60]</u> Because light therapy is noninvasive and has only mild and transient side effects, including headache, nausea, and hypomania, consideration of its use is warranted for the treatment of EDS in PD. However, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal parameters of light therapy for PD. Efficacy conclusion for light therapy is possibly useful. Light therapy may potentially be efficacious in preventing EDS, although future studies are required to determine its optimal timing, dosage, and treatment duration.\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive tool applied in different paradigms to obtain direct measures of cortical excitability. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) induces direct, trans-synaptic neuronal activation. High-frequency rTMS (>5 Hz) increased cortical excitability, whereas low-frequency rTMS (<1 Hz) had the opposite effect.通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u> Combining rTMS with electroencephalography may be a useful approach to treating sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, RLS, narcolepsy, RBD, sleepwalking, sleep-wake disturbances after traumatic brain injury, and chronic insomnia.通用删除6(英):<u>[62,63]</u> In PD patients, rTMS improved motor deficits (considering both UPDRS-III scores and gait parameters).通用删除6(英):<u>[64]</u> One recent case report of a narcolepsy patient who received 25 sessions of high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex demonstrated that rTMS might be a safe and effective alternative strategy for treating narcolepsy-like symptoms.通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u> Efficacy conclusion for TMS is under investigation. No studies have yet focused on the efficacy of rTMS for treating EDS in PD. Future studies should seek to define optimal stimulation parameters, such as timing, duration, electrode placement, coil orientation, and physiological state of the patient.\nIf nonpharmacologic strategies do not improve EDS, drug therapies can be considered. There are few recommendations for the pharmacological management of EDS in PD, as few multicenter clinical trials have been conducted in this area.通用删除6(英):<u>[66,67]</u> A Movement Disorder Society evidence-based medicine review concluded that there was insufficient data to recommend any specific drug for the long-term treatment of EDS in PD patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u> Limited data exist for the use of wakefulness-promoting agents such as modafinil and armodafinil or stimulants such as methylphenidate or dextroamphetamines.\nModafinil, a medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat narcolepsy, is a wake-promoting agent and is indicated for most forms of EDS. A recent meta-analysis reported that modafinil effectively reduced ESS score, with an overall mean difference of 2.2 (95% CI: −3.9 to −0.6) and without significant heterogeneity among studies.通用删除6(英):<u>[69]</u> However, modafinil did not alter objective measures of sleepiness.通用删除6(英):<u>[70,71]</u> In clinical practice, modafinil is given once a day in the morning on an empty stomach. The starting dose is usually 100 mg and can be increased slowly to 400 mg as needed. Modafinil is well tolerated in the treatment of EDS and has a low prevalence of side effects such as headache, nausea, dry mouth, and anorexia.通用删除6(英):<u>[69,72]</u> However, for older PD patients, especially those with severe cardiovascular disease or other underlying cardiac abnormalities, the cardiovascular effects of modafinil, including elevated blood pressure and heart rate, are a concern.通用删除6(英):<u>[73]</u> However, these side effects appear to be mild and decrease with dose reduction.通用删除6(英):<u>[68]</u> As alternatives to modafinil, other drugs that are generally well tolerated with a low prevalence of side effects could be considered. Although data on their efficacy are limited, it is reasonable to consider their use for treating EDS in PD in clinical practice. Efficacy conclusion for modafinil is possibly useful. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of modafinil for treating EDS in PD, although its use might be helpful in clinical practice.\nMethylphenidate, the piperazine derivative of amphetamine, increases the release and inhibits the reuptake of catecholamines, including dopamine and norepinephrine. Its effects may be mediated by the restoration of balance between dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitters. An open-label study reported that methylphenidate dramatically reduced EDS in PD patients, with high doses of methylphenidate improving motor and gait symptoms in the presence and absence of levodopa.通用删除6(英):<u>[74]</u> In clinical practice, methylphenidate is initially prescribed at 10 mg/d, with a recommended maximum dose of up to 80 mg/d. Possible adverse events related to methylphenidate therapy are reduced appetite, nausea, headache, insomnia, and psychosis.通用删除6(英):<u>[75]</u> PD patients can receive methylphenidate 2 weeks after discontinuation of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Efficacy conclusion for methylphenidate is possibly useful. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate for treating EDS in PD, although its use might be helpful in clinical practice.\nCaffeine, an adenosine antagonist, reduces somnolence in the general population. A decade ago, it also attracted attention due to its potential neuroprotective effect. A meta-analysis reports that caffeine reduces the risk of PD (relative risk: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.6–0.8).通用删除6(英):<u>[76]</u> In a long-term randomized controlled trial assessing the effects of caffeine on EDS in PD, patients given up to 200 mg caffeine twice a day for 6 weeks showed a non-significant reduction in ESS score (−1.7 points; 95% CI: −3.6 to 0.1), whereas clinical global impression of EDS improved in per protocol analysis.通用删除6(英):<u>[77]</u> In a more recent study, caffeine slightly improved EDS over the first 6 months, with the clinical effect lessening over time.通用删除6(英):<u>[78]</u> There are many potential explanations for this discrepancy between studies, including different study populations and trial durations. Caffeine could affect EDS or the sensation of alertness and is an inexpensive intervention that is well tolerated in most individuals. Efficacy conclusion for caffeine is under investigation. The magnitude of the impact of caffeine on EDS in PD patients is unclear. It may be reasonable to try intermittent moderate doses of caffeine and repeat if improvement is observed.\nSodium oxybate, the sodium salt of g-hydroxybutyrate, is used to treat cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy and has been tested in PD patients. An open-label polysomnographic study reported that nocturnally administered sodium oxybate improved subjective sleepiness, sleep quality, and fatigue as well as slow wave sleep in PD patients.通用删除6(英):<u>[79]</u> Recently, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, Phase IIA study reported that sodium oxybate was effective in treating EDS and nocturnal sleep disturbance with Class I evidence. This study used both objective and subjective assessments and showed that sodium oxybate improved mean sleep latency, ESS score, and slow-wave sleep duration.通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u> Sodium oxybate should be taken in the evening and once again during the night. Its side effects are nausea, insomnia, headache, dizziness, vomiting, weight loss, psychiatric complications, and sleep apnea.通用删除6(英):<u>[81]</u> It increased apnea-hypopnea index in PD patients通用删除6(英):<u>[78]</u> and induced de novo obstructive sleep apnea and parasomnia.通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u> Efficacy conclusion for sodium oxybate is possibly useful. Evidence suggested that sodium oxybate might be efficacious for treating EDS in PD. However, stringent patient monitoring and larger follow-up trials are warranted.\nA single-center, open-label study reported that istradefylline, a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, significantly improved EDS 2 and 3 months after PD patients received 20–40 mg/d istradefylline once daily in the morning. The underlying mechanism may be that istradefylline enhances alertness while having no negative impact on sleep.通用删除6(英):<u>[82,83]</u> Efficacy conclusion for istradefylline is under investigation. The use of istradefylline might be helpful in clinical practice, although further studies are warranted.\nAtomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, has been shown to be beneficial for EDS in PD patients, possibly through alerting effects on norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus. Constipation and insomnia are the most common adverse events. Efficacy conclusion for atomoxetine is under investigation. The use of atomoxetine might be helpful in clinical practice, although further studies are warranted.\nEDS is common in the PD population and can have an immensely negative impact on quality of life. Its causes are multifactorial, which complicates its treatment. More and larger studies are needed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for EDS in PD. Furthermore, efforts should focus on planning and executing clinical trials to develop novel treatment approaches.\n删除3：<u>This work was supported by grants from the National Key R&D Program of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 删除4：<u>2017</u>YFC0909100)</u>, National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 91649114)</u>, Jiangsu Provincial Social Development Projects 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. BE2017653)</u>, Jiangsu Provincial Medical Key Discipline Project 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. ZDXKB2016022)</u>, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. BM2013003)</u>, and Suzhou Clinical Research Center of Neurological Disease 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. Szzx201503)</u>.

Clinically apparent stenosis occurs in more than 30% of patients with Crohn′s disease （CD）and about 5% ~ 10% of patients with ulcerative colitis（UC）通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u>，and its management represents an important and frequent challenge in clinical practice. Despite its tremendous clinical impact the tools we currently have to address this challenge are limited通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Anti-inflammatory therapies are only a temporizing measure to relieve obstruction and re-obstruction is frequent，necessitating endoscopic balloon dilation or surgical intervention通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,5]</u>. No specific anti-fibrotic therapy exists at present，and therefore it is critical to understand the mechanisms of intestinal fibrogenesis to develop targeted therapeutic approaches.\nFibrosis is the final common pathway of chronic tissue injury. Its main driver is inflammation，a fundamental response in health and disease that can lead to both beneficial and harmful effects. While this response can be seen across all organs通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>，the ultimate effects of inflammation depend on its inducing factors，duration，location，severity as well as host factors，such as genetic predisposition and age. In the intestine，short lived and mild injuries，such as in infectious enteritis，heal quickly and effectively，while in the case of IBD，with its relapsing remitting course，the opposite occurs，resulting in the two hallmarks of fibrosis—an increased number of mesenchymal cells and an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Critical for therapeutic development is the understanding of the source of mesenchymal cells，which includes cellular transformation，proliferation of local mesenchymal cells，stellate cells or circulating precursors，such as fibrocytes通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Thus，preventing the excessive accumulation of mesenchymal cells represents a logical therapeutic avenue. Once present in the affected areas mesenchymal cells are exposed to a complex mix of immune and non-immune cells and their mediators and blockade of key activation pathways may alleviate fibrosis通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Special emphasis should also be given to mechanisms that can drive tissue damage independently of inflammation，as chronic fibrosis can apparently progress despite effective immunosuppressive therapies. All these mechanisms include cell to matrix interactions and matrix mechano properties通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>. Multiple animal models are at our disposal to study the mechanisms of intestinal fibrosis in vivo通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>，and it is encouraging to know that fibrosis in the gut seems to be reversible in humans as suggested by follow up observational studies of patients that underwent stricture plasties.

Novel imaging techniques are being explored to detect and measure the degree of fibrosis and allowing its diagnosis and monitoring，such as ultrasound elastography，magnetization transfer MRI or delayed enhancement MRI通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>.\nWith the growing interest in this field the hope of developing a specific anti-fibrotic therapy in IBD becomes increasingly realistic. In fact，multiple initiatives are under way to develop clear inclusion criteria and clinical trial endpoints to test novel therapies and outcomes. In light of these exciting developments the publication of this supplement is both extremely timely and relevant. In the various sections of this supplement the clinical components of the challenge of intestinal fibrosis are highlighted and sequentially introduced allowing the reader to gain a comprehensive overview on the mechanisms，prediction，diagnosis，consequences，therapy and possible solutions to fibrostenotic IBD.

PR may result in right ventricular (RV) dilatation and, ultimately, cardiac dysfunction. Indicators of deterioration of clinical status such as impaired exercise tolerance, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death have all been associated with chronic PR. The degree of PR is one of the most important factors determining RV dysfunction; thus, pulmonary valve replacement becomes necessary to retain lower RV volumes, increase the RV systolic function, and lower the mortality rates.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u> Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is now recommended as the optimal method to use in the follow-up of patients with TOF.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> It has been proven to be more accurate than transthoracic echocardiography for the evaluation of RV function due to the irregular RV cavity.通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u> Indexed PR volume (PRVi) and PR fraction (PRF) are the two main markers to be measured; however, the optimal method for PR quantification remains controversial. Previous studies have recommended the use of PRVi and hypothesized that this marker is better than PRF in reflecting RV preload. However, PRVi is not widely used in clinical practice and has not been the diagnostic standard for PR classification. Accordingly, our study aimed to discover the optimal index for the assessment of the degree of PR.\nThis retrospective study included 57 consecutive patients with repaired TOF who had undergone CMR evaluations from June 2008 to September 2017, and had evidence of PR on echocardiography. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography within 1 week of CMR. Each patient or their guardians provided written informed consent for participation in this study, and the institutional ethics committee approved the review of medical records. The exclusion criteria included: (i) percutaneous or surgical pulmonary valve replacement, (ii) more than mild regurgitation of other cardiac valves except the pulmonary valve, and (iii) intra- or extra-cardiac residential shunts. Patient characteristics including age, sex, age at TOF repair, and type of surgical repair were recorded.\nAll CMR studies were performed using a commercially available 1.5-T scanner (Avanto; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with an 8-element phased-array surface coil. Volumetric analysis and two-dimensional phase-contrast (PC) sequence in the main pulmonary artery were performed as previously reported.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> The following parameters were calculated: end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and ejection fraction of the right and left ventricles. The volume parameters of the right and left ventricles were indexed using the body surface area. RV dilatation was classified using indexed RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDVi): mild RV dilatation (RVEDVi = 110–140 mL/m2), medium RV dilatation (RVEDVi= 141–170 mL/m2), and severe RV dilatation (RVEDVi > 170 mL/m2).通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>\nThe clinical characteristics and CMR results of all remaining 57 patients are presented in Table 1. The median PRVi and PRF were 27.09 ± 18.67 mL·beat－1·m－2 and 32.98 ± 16.17%, respectively. The correlation between PRVi and PRF was proved (r= 0.690). Although a strong correlation was seen between PRF and PRVi, we also observed that significant variability existed in individual patients. For instance, a PRF of 40% could represent a PRVi of 18 or 38 mL·beat－1·m－2. On the contrary, a PRVi of 48 mL·beat－1·m－2 could represent a PRF of between 22% and 56%.\nCharacteristics of the study population and CMR results.\n删除重复语句：<u>Characteristics of the study population and CMR results.</u>\nCMR: Cardiac magnetic resonance; LVEDVi: Indexed left ventricular end-diastolic volume; LVEF: Ejection fraction of left ventricle; LVESVi: Indexed left ventricular end-systolic volume; MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging; PRF: Pulmonary regurgitation fraction; PRVi: Indexed pulmonary regurgitation volume; RVEDVi: Indexed right ventricular end-diastolic volume; RVEF: Ejection fraction of right ventricle; RVESVi: Indexed right ventricular end-systolic volume.\nBoth RVEDVi and RVESVi had moderate correlation with PRVi (r= 0.400/0.327, P= 0.002/0.013); however, PRF did not show a significant correlation with RVEDVi and RVESVi (r= 0.105/0.081, P= 0.439/0.551). The correlation of PRVi or PRF with RV ejection fraction was slight.\nWhen RV dilatation was classified into three subgroups, mild (n= 39), medium (n= 5), and severe (n= 13), a considerably higher difference among the 3 groups was noted in PRVi than in PRF (F= 11.177, P < 0.001 vs. F= 16.525, P < 0.001). PRVi showed the ability to differentiate mild from medium RV dilatation, whereas PRF did not have this ability 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>.\nPatients with severe RVEDVi, PRVi showed better ability to identify severe RV dilatation (area under the ROC curve [AUC] of PRVi= 0.705 vs. AUC of PRF= 0.601, P= 0.026). The cutoff value of PRVi was 37 mL/beat/m2, whereas the sensitivity and specificity were 0.615 and 0.818, respectively.\nDuring the past decade, several studies have investigated the indices of PR and proved a close correlation between PRF and PRVi; however, which is the better index remains debated. PRF has been commonly used in published TOF studies and recommended for decision making on pulmonary valve replacement; however, this parameter has some limitations. The expression of a percentage cannot reflect the exact volume backward. Henkens proved that PRF was not related to RV dimensions; thus, the timing of pulmonary valve replacement should be based on RVESV and RV ejection fraction rather than PRF.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u> Wald et al found that PRVi was better than PRF for the identification of severe RV dilatation (AUC 0.83 vs. 0.71, P= 0.003).通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> Meanwhile, PRF and PRVi are not interchangeable. Wald et al suggested that PRF may remain the same with different PRVis due to different RV volumes.通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u> This phenomenon was also seen in our study.\nThe impact of PR overload on the RV relies on its grade and duration. Chronic PR of more than a moderate degree will increase RVEDV. Spiewak et al showed that PRVi showed better ability than PRF in evaluating RV dilatation, both in populations with and without RV outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO).通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u> Sakrana et al and Gorter et al proposed that PRVi was better correlated with RVEDV than was PRF.通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u> Similar to previous reports, our study showed that PRVi showed a good correlation with RV volume measurements (RVEDVi and RVESVi) and may be preferable to PRF. Meanwhile, PRVi also performed superior to PRF in discriminating between different extents of RV dilatation and is more appropriate for the quantification of RV dilatation. Furthermore, based on ROC analysis in patients with significant RVEDVi, PRVi was a better predictor of significant RV dilatation than PRF, with high sensitivity and specificity.\nThe indications for pulmonary valve replacement in repaired TOF are variable, including severe PR, abnormal cardiac function, decreased exercise intolerance, heart failure symptoms, and severe arrhythmia.通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u> Numerous reports have extensively discussed about this topic, and some indications remain debated.通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u> Nevertheless, the accurate evaluation of PR and RV dilatation is always the most important factor overall, and it is prudent to use the most reliable index in assessing the volume load on the heart. We believe that PRVi can fulfill these criteria, rather than PRF, especially for patients with larger RV. In addition, an RV to left ventricular (LV) interaction can cause subsequent LV dysfunction. At long-term follow-up, about 25% of patients with repaired TOF had LV dysfunction, and some researchers recommended the use of the RV/LV ratio instead of RVEDVi.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u> It has been proven that PRVi could also be used with the RV/LV ratio, as the optimal combination for TOF evaluation.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>\nIn conclusion, PRVi and PRF have a good correlation with each other; however, they are not interchangeable. PRVi has a statistically significantly higher correlation with the RV volume and can be a better marker of RV dilatation than PRF. Now in our institution, we both check the PRF and PRVi for RV function evaluation in reaired patients with TOF, especially in those patients with large RV. We thought PRVi could be a valuable supplement for a TOF patient’s follow-up.\nThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

The TIL cytotoxicity and phenotype were determined by MTT and immunohistochemical ABC methods.RESULTSThe average weight and number of cells of the tumor tissues for culture of TIL were 4.8 g and 5.8×107 respectively, and the median expansion time was 31.8 days in vitro. The maximal expansion achieved 1000 fold, and the mean amplification rate was 198.5 fold. Lymphokine-activated killer cell culture supernatant could stimulate TIL growth. Ten of 12 patients received immunotherapy of TIL. The number of cells infused reached 4×108-1.1×1010. In 3 cases of our series, TIL infusions were done through a drug pump with a catheter embedded in the hepatic artery. Eight patients whose primary hepatic carcinomas were resected completely were followed up for 16 months with only one case (12.5%) having recurrence. The recurrence rates of them at 6 and 12 months after tumor resection were remarkably lower than those of the patients who did not receive TIL infusion (19.4% and 41.6%, respectively).
