We are suspicious of a possible link between the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and generalized gingival inflammation associated with hyperemic, erythematous gingival enlargement that was noticed one week after vaccination. The patient was a breastfeeding woman who presented with a chief complaint of a sudden change of normal pink gum tissue to fiery red, swollen, and bleeding one week after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Blood disorders and mucocutaneous lesions were ruled out. The patient had a large zone of inflamed gingiva in the maxilla, extending from the gingival margin to and beyond the mucogingival junction, with no evidence of malignancy. Microscopic examination disclosed reactive changes and areas of neutrophilic exocytosis in the epithelium and plasma cell infiltrate in the lamina propria, confirming a diagnosis of plasma cell gingivitis. Changing the patient’s oral care products and non-surgical periodontal therapy with anti-inflammatory medications improved her condition modestly. Periodontal surgery was planned to facilitate self-performed oral hygiene and complete resolution of the gingival enlargement, preventing plaque-retentive niches for bacterial growth.\n\n【7】Introduction\n------------\n\n【8】Gingival enlargement can be painful, disfiguring, and distressing. Medications that induce gingival overgrowth can dysregulate oral function, cause periodontal and dental infections, and delay tooth eruption in children. Prescription drug-induced periodontal disease is on the rise in children and young adults, and these drugs or their interactions can induce gingival overgrowth, specifically in younger populations. The overgrowth may provide a subgingival nidus for pathogens that promote gingivitis or periodontitis, and the tissue may even become malignant. In addition, this overgrowth may function as a reservoir for microorganisms \\[1\\] .\n\n【9】Drug-induced gingival overgrowth develops from an increase in the extracellular matrix of connective tissue \\[2\\] . Factors influencing the overgrowth include drug type, dose, concomitant use of other drugs, preexisting periodontal disease, oral hygiene habits, and individual susceptibility \\[1\\] . The mechanistic pathway underlying the development of gingival overgrowth may involve upregulation of the profibrotic growth factor transforming growth factor-beta 1(TGF-β) \\[3\\] .\n\n【10】The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine received emergency approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration. Current reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that anaphylactic reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine may occur more frequently than seen with other vaccines, although the etiology of reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines is unclear. Therefore it is recommended that individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to polyethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol derivatives, or polysorbate inform the vaccinating center \\[4\\] . It should also be noted that multiple viruses can affect the oral cavity, including the herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, varicella-zoster virus (chicken pox), Coxsackievirus, and human papillomavirus \\[5,6\\] .\n\n【11】We report a possible link between the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and generalized gingival inflammation with hyperemic, erythematous, and gingival overgrowth. Recognizing that the vaccine may be associated with gingival hyperplasia assists in managing the side effects and minimizing harm \\[7\\] , especially as plasma cell gingivitis presents pathologic alterations similar to other blood disorders and diseases \\[8\\] .\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】The patient was a 42-year-old breastfeeding woman who presented to our clinic with a chief complaint of a sudden change of normal pink gum tissue to fiery red, swollen and bleeding gingiva a week after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Generalized bleeding upon probing was observed. A detailed health history interview disclosed 1-year use of Sensodyne toothpaste (Glaxo Smith Kline) and ACT mouthwash (Sanofi). No abnormalities or bone loss were noted on her radiographs, and all blood chemistry parameters were within the normal range, ruling out leukemia and other blood disorders. Treatment and follow-up initial periodontal therapy comprising scaling and root planning and oral hygiene instructions were given, with modest improvements. Although the topical application of chlorpheniramine maleate (25 mg) for a period of 10 days and a low dose of oral lisinopril (5 mg once daily) to decrease inflammation is supported in the literature \\[9,10\\] , it is contraindicated in breastfeeding women. Instead, the patient was prescribed ibuprofen and methylprednisone to reduce the swelling and inflammation.\n\n【14】The patient reported no significant medical history other than possible allergic reactions to penicillin and azithromycin. It should be noted that allergic reactions to azithromycin are exceedingly rare. Microscopic examination of a biopsy sample disclosed the heavy presence of plasma cells in the underlying connective tissue, establishing a diagnosis of plasma cell gingivitis. The patient developed soft tissue lesions that mimicked spongioma in the maxilla and gingival hyperplasia in the mandible. It is unclear whether these lesions were an oral manifestation of systemic involvement or limited to immune receptors in the oral cavity. This process is not consistent with any described and recognized allergic reactions. It is not consistent with an IgE-mediated reaction. Further, it is not consistent with any antibody-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. While it is a cellular response, the histopathologic description is inconsistent with Type 4 hypersensitivity, and a direct cause-effect relationship has not been established.\n\n【15】Clinical and histopathological presentation: The patient did not respond significantly to mechanical debridement, non-surgical therapy, or pharmaceutical management, so a biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Two biopsies were performed as the clinical presentation differed between the maxilla and the mandible. The patient had a large zone of inflamed gingiva in the maxilla, extending from the gingival margin to and beyond the mucogingival junction (Figure 1) . However, in the mandible, gingival overgrowth was observed that covered half of the clinical length of the mandibular anterior crowns and was inflamed. Because of concerns regarding the gingival recession and esthetic appearance following the biopsy, we selected the mucogingival junction as the biopsy site. The cosmetic aspect was less of a concern for the mandibular anterior teeth because of the nature of the gingival growth, so the biopsy size was more extensive (teeth 23–26) in the mandible than in the maxilla.\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】Microscopic examination was performed at John Hopkins hospital, Dermatology department, Oral pathology, Baltimore, Maryland. Histologic examination of the maxillary biopsy from the mucogingival junction of the tooth #11 area disclosed reactive changes and areas of neutrophilic exocytosis in the epithelium (Figure 2) . In addition, plasma cell infiltration was observed in the lamina propria. There was no evidence of malignancy, but the biopsy from the mandibular anterior teeth disclosed a linear portion of the squamous gingival mucosa. The surface epithelium exhibited psoriasiform hyperplasia with spongiotic changes and brisk neutrophilic exocytosis. The lamina propria was engorged with a dense infiltrate of chronic inflammatory cells composed primarily of plasma cells. These plasma cells demonstrated polyclonality, as evidenced by immunostaining with Kappa and Lambda antibodies. Because of the heavy presence of plasma cells in the underlying connective tissue, the clinical and histopathologic features supported a diagnosis of plasma cell gingivitis \\[11\\] .\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】The patient reported that she had no skin lesions, and Nikolsky’s sign was negative, so mucocutaneous lesions were ruled out as a differential diagnosis.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【21】This rare case required special management and follow-up. The etiology of plasma cell gingivitis can be allergenic, neoplastic, or unknown. The sudden development of hyperemic, erythematous, and edematous gingiva suggests a severe immune reaction. This process is not consistent with any described and recognized allergic reactions. In addition, it is not consistent with any IgE-mediated reaction.\n\n【22】Further, it is not consistent with any antibody-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. While it is a cellular response, the histopathologic description is inconsistent with Type 4 hypersensitivity, and a direct cause-effect relationship has not been established. Three months post-treatment, the patient showed modest improvement. However, the possible role of the vaccine in triggering plasma cell gingivitis is unclear. Because of the excessive gingival display (“gummy smile”) and incomplete eruption of the patient’s teeth, complete resolution of her gingival overgrowth is not expected. The treatment plan was to perform crown-lengthening surgery to facilitate self-performed oral hygiene and resolve the gingival enlargement further. The patient’s “gummy smile” is unaesthetic and plasma cell gingivitis exacerbated it. Without surgical treatment, the gingival enlargement acts as plaque-retentive niches for bacterial growth. Altogether, this case report suggests a possible association between plasma cell gingivitis and the Pfizer vaccine.\n\n【23】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【24】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

A comprehensive assessment scan protocol consisting of two electrocardiography-gated cardiac acquisitions was used. The early (first) phase imaging indicated that the patient was anatomically suitable for a catheter ablation procedure and had no significant stenosis with moderate coronary artery calcification but showed a contrast-filling defect in the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA). The equilibrium (second) phase imaging showed global myocardial Late Iodine Enhancement (LIE), marked elevation in Extracellular Volume Fraction (ECV) of 72% \\[a normal range of 23%–28%\\]), and contrast fill-in in the LAA, indicating no thrombus (Figure) . These findings were strongly suggestive of occult cardiac amyloidosis. The endomyocardial biopsy confirmed the presence of interstitial transthyretin amyloid deposition. Genetic testing was negative for transthyretin mutations. The patient was eventually diagnosed with AF concomitant with wild-type Transthyretin Cardiac Amyloidosis (ATTRwt-CA).\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Recent studies have suggested that up to 10% to 15% of older adults with heart failure may have unrecognized ATTRwt-CA \\[1\\] . Moreover, ATTRwt-CA is often accompanied by AF. Although treatment for ATTRwt-CA was previously limited to supportive care, effective pharmacological treatments of ATTRwt-CA are now available. However, using current diagnostic strategies, it is difficult to identify the occurrence of ATTRwt-CA in AF patients before treatment.\n\n【9】To delineate the complex and variable anatomy of the pulmonary veins, left atrium, LAA, and surrounding structures, such as the esophagus and phrenic nerves, pre-procedure cardiac CT is widely used for ablation planning because of its accessibility, fast acquisition time, and simultaneous coronary artery evaluation. Additional equilibrium-phase cardiac imaging can allow myocardial characterization by assessing LIE and ECV \\[2,3\\] . Furthermore, it is a reasonable alternative to transesophageal echocardiography for LAA thrombus evaluation and blood stasis differentiation. This comprehensive “one-stop shop” assessment of CT imaging is believed to offer a practical and useful approach to improve the efficacy and safety of the AF catheter ablation procedure.\n\n【10】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【11】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

In addition, stroke associated with COVID-19 has been related to multiple immune and non-immune mechanisms leading to thromboembolic and ischemic phenomena. We present the case of an initially COVID-19-antigen-positive female patient with no apparent relevant history attending the emergency department with symptoms of posterior circulation stroke. The patient had a favourable evolution during her hospitalization, presenting a complete recovery.  \n\n【7】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【8】MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging  \n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】The COVID-19 virus is associated with diverse pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations. Many of their pathophysiological mechanisms are still unknown. Neurological conditions associated with COVID-19 include transverse myelitis, seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy, and ischemic stroke, mainly from the anterior cerebral circulation territory \\[1\\] . The COVID-19 symptoms are often mild at onset, but when neurological complications occur, a grim outcome can accompany them \\[2\\] .\n\n【11】The mechanisms associated with thromboembolism and ischemia include immune-mediated thrombophilia and hypercoagulability states, alterations in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, cardioembolism, cardiomyopathy, and neurovascular damage \\[3\\] .\n\n【12】In this report, we present the case of a woman who had mild flu-like symptoms for eleven days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and arriving at the emergency department with clinical manifestations compatible with posterior territory circulation stroke.\n\n【13】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】Background: This case involves a 50-year-old woman with a long-standing history of hypothyroidism who receives levothyroxine treatment. She was otherwise healthy, with no reported cerebrovascular risk factors or history of migraines. The patient received complete vaccination with three doses of Pfizer, with her last dose administered 18 months before the onset of her current illness.\n\n【15】Thirteen days before her admission, the patient had close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Two days after the contact, she experienced a severe, non-throbbing headache, retro-ocular pain, myalgias, arthralgias, dry cough, and fever. These symptoms progressively worsened over four days and gradually improved over a similar period. A COVID-19 antigen test yielded a positive result on the fourth day after symptom onset. Three hours before admission to the emergency room, upon awakening, the patient reported a sudden-onset bilateral non-throbbing occipital headache. The pain rapidly intensified, reaching an unbearable level within one minute. The patient also developed dysarthria, vertigo, and ataxia. She denied the presence of tinnitus, phosphenes, nausea, or vomiting, and there were no disturbances in consciousness; a persistent cough was the only remaining infection symptom at the time of admission. Vital signs were within normal range.\n\n【16】Neurological examination: The patient´s neurological examination showed scanning speech, vertigo, and erratic eye movements with multidirectional nystagmus, ataxia, and dysdiadochokinesia of the upper and lower right limbs. The first NIHSS score was 2 points. Meningeal signs were negative. Due to the sudden onset of symptoms, and the preponderance of negative over positive cerebellar symptomatology, the clinical diagnosis on admission was a hemispheric cerebellar syndrome of probable vascular etiology rather than a basilar migraine-like episode.\n\n【17】Clinical tests: Clinical tests performed upon arrival at the ER included a negative SARS-CoV-2 antigen test, a normal posteroanterior chest x-ray, and routine laboratories were normal (Table) .\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】An MRI conducted 20 minutes later revealed areas of hyperintensity in the right cerebellar hemisphere on the DWI sequence, coincident with hypointensity on the ADC map sequences. Perfusion sequences showed increased mean transit time and decreased cerebral blood flow. These findings were congruent with a late hyperacute stroke in the territory of the right posteroinferior cerebellar artery (Figure A) . Head and neck CT angiography revealed no abnormalities, and therefore, and therefore no further transcranial Doppler or cervical vessels ultrasonography examination was considered necessary to search for etiology, treatment, or follow-up. A 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemic lesions or necrosis. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal findings, and no interatrial septal shunts were detected with the contrast test. Given the normality of the transthoracic echocardiogram, transesophageal echocardiography was not considered for the etiological diagnosis.\n\n【20】Evolution: During hospitalization, constant cardiac and blood pressure monitoring was implemented. In the first 24 hours, the patient continued to experience headaches and paresthesia in the right arm while dual antiplatelet therapy began. The following day they marked a complete remission of symptoms. One day prior to discharge, an RT-PCR was conducted, yielding positive results for SARS-CoV-2. At the follow-up consultation one month after the acute event, the patient was asymptomatic without any deficits. A follow-up MRI performed two weeks later revealed a faint area of increased signal intensity in the subcortical region of the right cerebellum on FLAIR sequences (Figure B) . No further COVID testing was conducted following the patient’s discharge.\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】Recent literature on SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that the condition is not limited to the respiratory system but has the potential to trigger systemic alterations in acute, subacute, and chronic phases \\[5\\] . Neurological manifestations range from signs and symptoms that do not impact life or functionality to severe conditions such as stroke, myelitis, or Guillain-Barré syndrome \\[6\\] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke cases have been reported \\[7\\] .\n\n【24】The present case presents specific demographic, clinical, topographical, and temporal characteristics that merit its analysis. Our patient has unusual demographic characteristics compared to other populations described throughout the pandemic. Generally, stroke patients are typically older than 66 years, male, and have cardiovascular comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary syndrome, or atrial fibrillation \\[4\\] . However, in the present case, cardiovascular risk factors were not documented. Hematological studies conducted at hospital discharge to investigate procoagulant factors, including antithrombin III , factor V Leiden mutation, proteins C and S, antiphospholipid antibodies, and homocysteine, did not reveal any abnormalities. Therefore, the case was initially classified as an embolic stroke of undetermined origin \\[8\\] .\n\n【25】Posterior fossa involvement is rare and reported in 3%–7% of all cases of COVID-19-associated stroke \\[9,10\\] . In Mexico, a study by Flores-Silva et al. showed that 0.8% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients presented with stroke, with most cases being ischemic and affecting the anterior circulation \\[11\\] . Prior to the pandemic, ischemia accounted for 52% of stroke cases in Mexico, with posterior circulation involvement at 17%. The high incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage was attributed to the prevalence of hypertension in the susceptible population \\[12,13\\] . Additionally, a study by López-Mena et al. analyzed stroke incidence among vaccinated patients, with a median age of 65 years and a median time of 2 days from vaccination to stroke. Acute ischemic stroke was the most common presentation, and most events occurred after the administration of the first dose \\[14\\] .\n\n【26】Several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the development of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients. These mechanisms include increased coagulation pathway function, activation of proinflammatory and procoagulant pathways, endothelial damage, and subsequent thrombus formation \\[15\\] . Other pathogens, such as the Varicella zoster virus, have also been shown to induce vasculopathy, leading to thrombosis and ischemia through direct infection \\[16\\] .\n\n【27】Vascular integrity disruption, bradykinin accumulation, and increased expression of adhesion molecules contribute to the development of a “procoagulant” endothelium \\[17\\] . Interleukin-8 levels have been linked to a sudden increase in the total number of neutrophils, which are associated with worse disease outcomes. Dapsone has shown potential in modulating cytokine levels and other proinflammatory factors, making it a promising approach for severe COVID-19 manifestations \\[18\\] .\n\n【28】Hematogenous and neuronal dissemination of COVID-19 are proposed mechanisms that could explain the immune-mediated involvement of the nervous system. The widespread expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in the central nervous system, along with the compromise of the blood-brain barrier due to endothelial cell infection, leads to neuronal cell death. A vasculitic damage mechanism has also been hypothesized \\[6\\] . Large vessel disease, characterized by a high systemic inflammation pattern without evident coagulopathy, is associated with a better prognosis and lower disability \\[19\\] .\n\n【29】The wide variability in the demographic and topographic characteristics of stroke in COVID-19 patients demonstrates the heterogeneity of the underlying pathophysiology. The most frequently described manifestations of COVID-19-associated stroke are hemiparesis (65.7%), altered mental status (51.4%), and dysarthria (34.3%). In the present case, only dysarthria was manifested \\[9\\] . Notable differences between our patient and the characteristics described in The Global COVID-19 Stroke Registry include a higher prevalence of ischemic stroke in males (37.9% of patients were female) and the absence of associated risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, or type 2 diabetes. Our patient manifested two of the three most common symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with stroke: fever (occurring in 55.2%) and cough (53.5%).\n\n【30】A case series by Meshref et al. highlighted the presence of overlapping coagulation alterations and inflammatory dysregulation in COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular events. For example, lymphopenia and elevated white blood cells were observed in almost all patients, and thrombocytosis and elevated procoagulant factors were also somewhat common findings. However, in this case, the patient did not show any abnormalities in the aforementioned laboratory tests \\[20\\] . Lastly, the patient was discharged completely asymptomatic, which is different from the 51% of patients who leave the hospital with severe disability rates \\[10\\] .\n\n【31】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【32】We present a case of a woman who experienced a hyperacute stroke in the right PICA territory associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite thorough investigation, no clear etiology was identified.\n\n【33】As seen in other reports, the underlying mechanisms by which COVID-19 causes ischemic brain disease are not well understood. The distinctive clinical and demographic presentation of this case emphasizes the need for attentiveness to atypical neurovascular syndromes in the context of COVID-19. Furthermore, the disparity between negative antigen test results at the beginning of hospitalization and positive RT-PCR tests at discharge highlights the importance of exercising caution and employing more sensitive and specific early confirmation tests when necessary.\n\n【34】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【35】The authors would like to thank Alfredo Montenegro for aiding in the realization of this work.\n\n【36】Funding Sources: No funding was received for the realization of this work.\n\n【37】Ethics: Informed consent was obtained for this publication.\n\n【38】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【39】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

ECD usually presents as multifocal osteosclerotic symmetric diaphyseal and metaphyseal bone lesions with characteristic epiphyseal sparing in long bones and at least one non-osseous organ involvement. Almost any organ can be involved, but the involvement of the omentum is extremely rare. ECD presentation as an omentum-dominant disease clinically mimicking omental carcinomatosis with the sparing of metaphyses and diaphyses has not been reported in the medical literature. We describe a case of a 40-year-old male who presented with an inguinal hernia caused by herniation of a massively thickened omentum due to involvement by ECD. The diagnosis of ECD was delayed by one year because of the unusual presentation of omentum-dominant disease and lack of involvement of metaphyses and diaphyses. The patient developed Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) 156 months after the diagnosis of ECD. We describe a rare presentation of ECD that caused a delay in diagnosis and discuss the relationship of ECD with MDS.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【8】A 40-year-old healthy male underwent elective right inguinal herniorrhaphy in April 2005, where thickened omentum and a nodular hernia sac were found and excised. Pathology from the hernia sac showed foci of submesothelial granulation tissue with inflammation and multinucleated giant cells. Fluid from the hernia sac showed reactive mesothelial cells with chronic inflammation and histiocytes. Slides were sent to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology for an expert opinion which suggested histiocytic panniculitis. The differential diagnoses included pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma, and possible Weber Christian disease. A computerized axial tomography scan (CT scan) of the abdomen and pelvis was done in May 2005, which showed diffuse omental thickening with maximal thickness measuring 1.5 cm in the left upper quadrant, 3.3 cm in the anterior mid abdomen, 5.8 cm in the right lower quadrant and perirectal thickening. Serum amylase, lipase, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cancer antigen 19-9 were within normal ranges. Complete Blood Count (CBC) showed a White Blood Cell Count (WBC) of 7,000/uL with a normal differential, hemoglobin (hb) 14 g/dL, and platelets 354,000/uL. Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) was mildly low at 78 fL. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and iron profile were within normal ranges, and fecal occult blood testing was negative. Due to perirectal thickening, he underwent a sigmoidoscopy with systematic biopsies, as there was no macroscopic lesion that showed a normal sigmoid mucosa without abnormal findings or neoplasms. The patient was seen by Rheumatology. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 22, and an antinuclear antibody was not expressed. Complement levels were within normal ranges. The patient was started on systemic steroids for suspected Weber Christian disease.\n\n【9】However, repeat CT scans done in February 2006 showed increased density of omental thickening, suggesting worsening disease with thickening of 1.7 cm in the left upper quadrant, 5.9 cm in the anterior mid-abdomen, and 6.2 cm in the right lower quadrant. A repeat omental biopsy again revealed panniculitis. The patient developed progressive leukocytosis and worsening anemia with each visit. In June 2006, a CBC showed a WBC of 18.9 k/uL with 81% neutrophils, hb 10.8g/dL, MCV 73 fL, and platelets 539,000/uL. A repeat iron profile showed iron 37 ug/dl, total iron binding capacity 293 ug/dl, percent saturation 12.6%, and ferritin 198 ng/mL. The bone marrow was normocellular, with findings suggestive of anemia of chronic disease and borderline megaloblastic changes in the erythroid series, suggestive of a possible drug effect. The patient developed progressive renal insufficiency with creatinine reaching up to 1.8 mg/dL in June 2006. The patient had mild edema that persisted despite stopping steroids. A 24-hour urine showed albumin of 280 mg. The renal ultrasound did not reveal any obstructive uropathy. The patient was sent to Mayo Clinic for a second opinion. They reviewed all the data from his prior evaluation and suggested a laparoscopic omental biopsy to rule out Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD), in addition to a bone scan and bone survey. A laparoscopic biopsy done in October 2006 showed xanthogranulomatous inflammation compatible with Erdheim-Chester disease. Histiocytes, Touton giant cells, lymphocytes, and a few plasma cells diffusely infiltrated the omental tissue. Immunohistochemical stains showed that the histiocytes and Touton giant cells stained positively for CD68 and vimentin (Figure 1) . Some of the lymphocytes were B-cells (CD20 and LCA positive), and most were T-cells (CD3 and LCA positive). Cytokeratin and HMB 45 were not expressed.\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】Mutational analysis of the lesional tissue from the omentum was found to be positive for BRAF V600E. The immunohistochemical stain for BRAF V600E protein was positive in the Touton giant cells (Figure 2) . A bone survey showed numerous symmetrical small rounded sclerotic areas in the proximal humeri and proximal and distal femurs. A bone scan showed increased epiphyseal uptake in the knees, ankles, elbows, and shoulder joints. The patient was seen at MD Anderson in November 2006 and was started on Interferon alpha – 2A, one million units, three times a week. Repeat scans done after starting interferon showed decreasing omental thickening and less conspicuity of bone lesions. The patient’s CBC and renal function returned to normal.\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】The patient continued to do well with no symptoms, and the last scans done in April 2020 showed a normal CT scan and stable bone scans and bone survey with minimal disease. However, the patient’s platelet count dropped to 123,000/uL on July 2019 and was thought to be interferon-related. The CBC in January 2020 showed a platelet count of 62,000/uL. The patient also developed lymphopenia with a lymphocyte count of 1.1 k/uL, MCV of 101, with hemoglobin declining to 12 from 14 g/dL. The bone marrow showed hypo to normocellular bone marrow with a decreased myeloid, erythroid ratio, mildly dysplastic erythroid precursors, dysplastic megakaryocytes (Figure 3) , 8%–10% polytypic plasma cells with no increase in blasts. The FISH panel was positive for 5q-. The Myeloid molecular panel showed a pathogenic alteration of the TET2 gene and genomic alteration of uncertain significance in the SMC3 gene. The patient was diagnosed with 5q- MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) 13 years (156 months) after the diagnosis of ECD.\n\n【14】  \n\n【15】The patient was initially treated with Lenalidomide with a good response but subsequently progressed to Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts -1. The patient was then treated with Venetoclax with Azacytidine and received an allogenic stem cell transplant on December 20, 2022.\n\n【16】Resume ECD Diagnosis: The diagnosis of ECD was made, which was initially suspected to be Weber Christian disease based on the pathology from a hernia sac and thickened omentum that showed foci of submesothelial granulation tissue with inflammation and multinucleated giant cells. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis in May 2005 initially showed diffuse omental thickening and perirectal thickening. The patient was treated for suspected Weber Christian disease with corticosteroids. Repeat CT scans in February 2006 showed increased density of omental thickening, suggesting worsening disease. On subsequent visits, the patient developed progressive leukocytosis, worsening anemia, renal insufficiency, and some bone pain. A bone survey showed numerous sclerotic areas and increased epiphyseal uptake. A Laparoscopic biopsy of the omentum was done in October 2006, after the suggestion of Mayo Clinic, showing xanthogranulomatous inflammation and BRAF V600 E positive Touton giant cells compatible with ECD. The patient was started on Interferon alpha – 2A in November 2006, one million units three times a week, and repeat imaging showed decreasing omental thickening and less conspicuity of bone lesions. The patient’s CBC and renal function returned to normal. The patient continued to do well with no symptoms, and the last scans done in April 2020 showed a normal CT scan and stable bone scans and bone survey with minimal disease.\n\n【17】After the diagnosis of subsequent MDS was made, the patient’s platelet count dropped to 123,000/uL in July 2019 and then to 62,000/uL in January 2020, with lymphopenia, MCV of 101, and mildly dysplastic erythroid precursors. The patient’s bone marrow showed dysplastic megakaryocytes, polytypic plasma cells, and a positive FISH panel for 5q-. The patient was diagnosed with 5q- MDS and initially treated with Lenalidomide with good response but progressed to Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts-1. He received treatment with Venetoclax with Azacytidine and underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant on December 20, 2022.\n\n【18】Discussion\n----------\n\n【19】ECD is considered an inflammatory myeloid neoplasm (a clonal disorder of monocyte-macrophage lineage) \\[1\\] . ECD has ERK activation in 100% of cases due to BRAF V600E mutation as a driver mutation in about one-half of cases and activating mutations in other components of MAP kinase signaling pathway as well as ECDs associated receptor tyrosine kinase (including CSF1-R mutation, NRTK1 fusion, ALK fusion, NRAS Q61R, MAP2K1, and ARAF mutation) in the other half of cases. In addition, PI3K pathway mutations also cooperate in some cases \\[2–4\\] . ECD also has a unique inflammatory cytokine signature due to the involvement of immune-mediated mechanisms that contribute to disease development and progression \\[5\\] .\n\n【20】ECD occurs more commonly (about 75% of cases) in males and usually appears between 40 years and 70 years of age. The clinical presentation is highly heterogeneous, ranging from smoldering unifocal form to multiorgan life-threatening disease \\[4\\] . ECD usually presents as multifocal osteosclerotic symmetric long bone lesions involving only diaphyses and metaphyses (without epiphyseal involvement) and involvement of at least one non-osseous tissue, which can be almost any organ \\[6\\] . Omentum is rarely involved \\[4–8\\] . Our case’s presentation was atypical due to omental thickening and bilateral symmetric involvement of epiphyses of long bones.\n\n【21】An ECD Classification was proposed in 2014. It is based on clinical severity and organ system dominance. According to this classification, ECD can be divided into two major groups: asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic type and symptomatic type. Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic types can be further divided into cutaneous-dominant disease and minimal or asymptomatic bone disease. Symptomatic ECD can be further classified based on dominant organ involvement (CNS dominant, cardiac dominant, retroperitoneal dominant, orbital-craniofacial dominant, neuroendocrine dominant, pulmonary dominant, and multisystem ECD). Omentum has rarely been described as an organ that can have involvement but has never been mentioned as a dominant organ of involvement by ECD \\[8\\] .\n\n【22】Bone: ECD usually presents as multifocal, osteosclerotic, bilaterally symmetric, long bone lesions involving diaphyses and metaphyses (without epiphyseal involvement). Bone pain is present in half of the cases and usually manifests as mild, persistent juxta-articular pain, particularly in the lower extremities.\n\n【23】Cardiovascular: Cardiac involvement can be varied and includes valvular abnormalities, rhythm or conduction defects, and pericardial fibrosis. Pseudotumor of the right side of the heart and “coated aorta” due to fibrous encasement have been reported. Complications like myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and symptomatic valve disease can be a major source of morbidity and mortality from ECD.\n\n【24】Central nervous system (CNS): Neurologic involvement is seen in up to half of cases. Infiltration can involve the entire CNS, including intra-axial and extra-axial compartments. Pyramidal and cerebellar signs are the most common neurologic symptoms. Seizures, cranial nerve palsies, headaches, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognitive impairment have been reported. Exophthalmos, retro-orbital pain, oculomotor palsies, or blindness can result from orbital infiltration. ECD cells can infiltrate the dura, and pituitary involvement can lead to symptoms of central diabetes insipidus and other endocrinopathies. Maxillary and sphenoid sinus involvement are also common.\n\n【25】Cutaneous: Skin is involved in one third of the patients. Xanthelasma and papulonodular lesions are common.\n\n【26】Pulmonary: Pulmonary involvement may be asymptomatic or manifest as dyspnea and/or cough. Progressive fibrosis leading to respiratory failure can occur in severe cases.\n\n【27】Renal: Retroperitoneal fibrosis and histiocytic infiltration in the ureters can both lead to hydronephrosis and progressive renal insufficiency. A “hairy kidney” with rind-like involvement of the perinephric tissues has been reported.\n\n【28】Involvement of other structures (breast, thyroid, testis, gingiva, kidneys, and spleen) is rare.\n\n【29】Delayed diagnosis of ECD is common due to subtle involvement of organs, lack of too many symptoms for a long time, and nondescript inflammatory-fibrotic histomorphologic features in the biopsy specimens. It can take months to decades from symptom-onset to diagnosis \\[4,8\\] . The presence of Touton giant cells admixed with chronic inflammatory cells and fibrosis helps histologically suspect ECD \\[8\\] .\n\n【30】Progression of ECD to MDS, Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), or any type of Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) has been described \\[3,9,10\\] . According to Durham BH et al. the acquisition of TET2 mutation in the bone marrow stem cells or myeloid progenitors leads to clonal hematopoiesis. Secondary acquisition of the BRAF V600E mutation occurs, resulting in circulating monocytes and dendritic cells harboring BRAF V600E mutation derived from mutated myeloid progenitors. Migration of BRAF V600E-bearing dendritic cells or monocytes in tissue and differentiation into either CD1a+ langerin+ Langerhans cells (leading to Langerhans cell histiocytosis) or CD68+CD163+ foamy histiocytes (leading to ECD). The acquisition of the JAK2 V617F in the bone marrow cells/progenitors, promoted by underlying clonal hematopoiesis, leads to associated MPN/MDS. JAK2 V600E was the most common mutation identified in the study, followed by NRAS, TET2, ASXL1, and UA2F1 \\[3\\] . Moreover, recently, Ghobadi A et al. found the same BRAF V600E mutation in the bone marrow blasts of an AML patient and in ECD cells from the lung biopsy of the patient, who also had extensive involvement of organs other than lungs. Whole exome sequencing showed many shared mutations in the AML cells and the ECD cells and confirmed the origin of both AML and ECD from the same progenitor \\[9\\] . A single case of ECD with concomitant MDS showing BRAF V600E mutation in both the ECD cells and the MDS cells was identified in a recent study of 189 ECD patients with associated myeloid neoplasm in 23 patients \\[9\\] . Our case had ECD that later developed MDS with isolated 5q minus and TET2 mutation.\n\n【31】Treatment\n---------\n\n【32】A small proportion of patients may have an indolent course with no symptoms. In the absence of CNS involvement or symptoms, these patients can be observed.  \n\n【33】Targeted therapy: In symptomatic patients, targeted therapies based on the mutational analysis is the recommended treatment of choice. For example, in patients with BRAF V600 E mutation, Vemurafenib, which is a potent inhibitor of the kinase domain of the mutant BRAF, is approved by the US Food and Drug administration \\[11\\] .\n\n【34】In patients that have failed BRAF inhibition, MEK inhibitors have shown some promise. MEK inhibitors also hold promise for the treatment of ECD with mutations of other signaling molecules like NRAS, PIK3A, etc. Cobimetinib has been granted breakthrough designation for ECD \\[12\\] .\n\n【35】MTOR inhibitors have shown some promise in ECD \\[13\\] .\n\n【36】Interferon alpha: Interferon alpha is a treatment option for patients with no actionable mutations or those unresponsive to or intolerant of targeted agents \\[14\\] .\n\n【37】Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is usually reserved for symptomatic, fit patients refractory to the above therapies. Cladribine and low-dose methotrexate have been shown to have responses in some patients \\[15,16\\] .\n\n【38】Glucocorticoids: Glucocorticoids have demonstrated clinical activity in ECD but have not demonstrated a survival benefit. Glucocorticoids are generally reserved for patients who cannot tolerate more aggressive systemic therapies or who have very mild symptoms.\n\n【39】In summary, we have described a case of a patient who had undiagnosed ECD for a year due to a rare presentation, which involved predominately the omentum and epiphysis rather than diaphyseal/metaphyseal involvement. Unfortunately, the patient developed cytopenias, which led to the diagnosis of MDS, a condition that can occur in ECD patients after the initial ECD diagnosis. Therefore, we should bear in mind that when a lesion’s histomorphology shows fibrosis and foamy histiocytes with Touton-type giant cells, we should consider ECD as a possibility. Additionally, if cytopenias develop in an ECD patient, we should consider the possibility of MDS or other myeloid malignancies.\n\n【40】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【41】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

A full-thick flap had been laid from mandibular premolar to premolar, the papillae were intact following extractions, and an adequate tissue length was retained.

This modification improves the prognosis and enables future treatment options while minimizing the extent of anticipated surgeries.\n\n【7】Introduction\n------------\n\n【8】A 60-year-old male presented to the oral surgery department of the University of Maryland School for Dentistry for multiple tooth extractions and alveoloplasty in preparation for dentures. Clinical and radiographic evaluation disclosed numerous problems, including poor oral hygiene, missing teeth, ridge deformity, tooth migration, broken teeth, retained root tips, generalized severe chronic periodontal disease, teeth with endodontic involvement, severe caries, exposed dentin, loss of vertical dimension, non-restorable teeth, horizontal and vertical bone loss, poor crown-to-root ratio, and collapsed occlusion. After a general dental and prosthodontic consultation, the patient agreed to extract all existing teeth, followed by delivery of full upper and lower dentures. Medical history included a heart murmur diagnosed in 2019 and treated by reduced caffeine intake and borderline hyperlipidemia, for which the patient was put on atorvastatin for one month. In addition, the patient was taking aspirin (81 mg) for stroke prevention and had previously been treated with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for hepatitis C from 2017 to January 2020, when the viral count became undetectable. The patient was also taking gabapentin daily for pain in his feet from an episode of frostbite sustained in 2017, had a history of alcohol abuse for 47 years (currently sober), and was a current tobacco user (one pack a day) and allergic to penicillin.\n\n【9】The patient stated that he brushed his teeth only three times a week because of the associated discomfort and had a family history of cardiovascular conditions, tobacco use, congenital heart defects, and liver failure. Extraoral and intraoral parameters were all within normal limits, except for a small cyst on the right side of the neck that the patient stated had been there for the past 20 years, a 7 mm × 7 mm single pink, raised, smooth but firm plaque on the mid dorsum of the tongue, and a 7 mm single inward deviation on the anterior palate of the mouth, possibly from the cleft palate or resorption.\n\n【10】The patient had severely carious, non-restorable teeth, retained root tips, and ridge deformity (Figure 1–Figure 3) . The treatment options presented to the patient were full-mouth extractions and alveoloplasty for future complete maxillary and mandibular dentures or full-mouth extraction with a variation of implant-retained overdenture or hybrid dentures. Because of financial concerns, the patient elected conventional complete dentures and consulted with his primary care physician regarding tobacco cessation, liver function, contraindications to local anesthesia with epinephrine for surgical procedures, and bloodwork to determine coagulation ability. The physician confirmed the patient’s hemodynamic stability and no contraindication for the use of epinephrine, clearing the patient for extractions and alveoloplasty. A prosthodontist then took alginate impressions of the maxilla and mandible and created surgical reduction guides after the ideal reduction of undercuts made on casts. The overall treatment plan for the patient was complete maxillary and mandibular dentures following extractions and alveolar bone remodeling. However, once the extractions and alveoloplasty were complete, the defect on the mandible left no depth or width of an alveolar ridge for a mandibular denture following the conventional protocol. A modified treatment technique was therefore created to enable a complete mandibular denture.\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】The patient presented for extraction of all remaining teeth with alveoloplasty to remove undercuts, particularly on the maxilla in the maxillary right premolar region area. A full-thickness, non-displacing, papilla-preserving flap was made using a mid-crestal incision with a 15c blade followed by simple extraction. Alveoloplasty was completed using a mucoperiosteal flap, undercuts, sharp ridges, and infected tissue was removed by a combination of rongeurs, a bone file, 84-T/XF taper, and a fine-cut titanium nitride-coated carbide bur with the handpiece. The lack of depth or width of the alveolar ridge for a mandibular denture presented a problem; however, a full-thickness flap had been laid from mandibular premolar to premolar, the papillae were intact following extractions, and an adequate length of tissue was retained, so a modified procedure was performed instead to enable the fabrication of a complete mandibular denture. The flap was released past the mucogingival junction, allowing for greater mobility and therefore the use of an absorbable 4-0 polyglactin 910 suture to stabilize the mobile buccal periosteum by moving the suture in a lingual and inferior direction, coming out from the lip periosteum using the mentalis muscle via two simple interrupted sutures in the lower canines. The simple interrupted method of remaining free papillae was sutured to stabilize them back into orientation and create the desired scaffold for regeneration. This retained the original vestibule depth, enabling scaffolding for new tissue by primary and secondary healing intentions (Figure 4, Figure 5) . The patient presented for a 1-week follow-up with generalized erythema and soreness and was prescribed clindamycin (300 mg) q.i.d. for ten days. At the 1-month follow-up, no signs of inflammation were noted, and the vestibular sutures were removed. The patient then presented at three months for additional alveoloplasty, where the full extent of the treatment outcome was observed (Figure 6, Figure 7) .\n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Discussion\n----------\n\n【16】Conventional treatment in the dental community is to remove teeth and allow a normal healing process when socket preservation or ridge augmentation is not done. At best, a clinician may attempt to gain primary closure of the socket by removing crestal bone and papillae or compressing buccal and lingual bone to reduce the buccal-lingual dimension of the ridge. This results in a shallow mandibular vestibule that is not conducive to the placement of a functional prosthesis. A traditional vestibuloplasty was not indicated, as the initial incision began mid-crest of the mandibular ridge with a full-thickness flap, preventing a supraperiosteal extension in the vestibule to suture the tissue to the periosteum of the mandible. In addition, a transpositional flap technique (lip switch) was not indicated because of the initial incision, as this technique is stringent on the initial semi-lunar incision to allow for the extension of the vestibule and mucosal flap to cover the exposed periosteum \\[1\\] . Extensive ridge augmentation and free autogenous gingival grafts for guided tissue regeneration are alternative treatment options but can be expensive. The case required a personalized and predictable course of treatment that yielded a denture-bearing surface for prostheses; we used a modified vestibuloplasty and coronal advancement of the entire zone of attached gingiva from the mucogingival junction. This technique deepened the vestibule and increased the zone of the attached gingiva to induce the accumulation of tough, resilient, attached, and keratinized gingiva that will resist traumatic friction between the prosthesis and alveolar ridge and increase the patient’s quality of life. The technique achieved the desired outcome for both patient and practitioner at a low cost. It preempted the need for a stent to keep the tissue in place, similar to a traditional vestibuloplasty, enabling less plaque retention and better patient comfort while reducing the resorption experienced during the healing process \\[2\\] .\n\n【17】Chronic smoking can modulate inflammatory and cellular repair functions by decreasing blood flow and delaying healing \\[3\\] . Full-mouth tooth extractions and alveoloplasty for future complete-over-complete dentures can have unforeseeable consequences, and complex medical history can render even successful treatments unpredictable. A practitioner familiar with treatment options that prepare effectively and take the patient’s medical history and histology into account can reduce costs and improve patient satisfaction. Tissue quality, height, and width all assist in providing a functional and esthetic prosthesis with good plaque control \\[4\\] . A prospective 3-year clinical study of masticatory function in patients with conventional dentures and mandibular overdentures reported better function in participants with mandibular implant-stabilized overdentures rather than complete dentures \\[5\\] . Adequate attached gingiva in a fixed prosthesis enables an esthetic appearance, prolonged use of the prosthesis, and good oral hygiene practices. However, vestibuloplasty is required to deepen the maxillary and mandibular vestibule in preparing for a prosthesis, whether fixed or removable \\[6\\] . Histological attached gingiva have collagenous fiber bundles connected to the mucous membrane of bone, and the alveolar mucosa is smooth and loosely bound to the underlying periosteum; the mucogingival junction separates the two \\[7\\] .\n\n【18】Tissue healing occurs in three stages: Inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling \\[8\\] . During the inflammatory stage, initial vasoconstriction, and platelet activation occur to stop bleeding. Platelet activation produces vasoactive mediators and chemotactic factors that signal inflammatory cells. Vasodilation enables neutrophil and leukocyte transmigration as a primary defense, followed by granulocyte and macrophage action to remove debris and produce collagenase and lactase for proper healing. The proliferative stage involves the formation of granulation tissue (macrophages, fibroblasts, capillary networks, fibronectin, hyaluronic acid, and endothelial cells), which causes hypoxia and initiates angiogenesis and neovascularization. The final stage of healing is the formation of collagen from fibroblasts and other progenitor cells into myofibroblasts to provide matrix constriction \\[9\\] . These factors must be considered when formulating a treatment plan that would provide long-term predictable and functional outcomes. The goal, in this case, was to focus on generating abundant soft tissue to support the prosthesis affordably despite the patient’s complex medical history.\n\n【19】Following the traditional method of extraction and alveoloplasty, in this case, would have resulted in a poor treatment outcome, owing to a lack of ridge for mandibular seating dentures. This modification improves the prognosis: The patient now has an abundance of attached and mucosal gingiva to allow for a functional and esthetic prosthesis and future treatment options such as implant-retained overdentures or hybrid prostheses minimizing the extent of future surgeries. Despite the additional alveoloplasty required in the mandible, the available tissue allows for more options and better outcomes.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【21】The technique described in this article deepened the patient’s vestibule, created abundant soft tissue, simplified treatment, and healing, and assured that the patient would have present and future treatment options that were more affordable than conventional methods.  \n\n【22】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【23】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Bacterial arthritis of the ankle following an aortoenteric fistula has been previously reported. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) associated with bacteremia due to a Secondary Aortoenteric Fistula, as in this case report. Although rare, Secondary Aortoenteric Fistula should be considered when treating a prosthetic joint infection after aortic reconstructive surgery.  \n\n【7】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【8】EGD: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy; MRSE: Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis ; SAEF: Secondary Aortoenteric Fistula; TKA: Total Knee Arthroplasty; WBC: White Blood Cell  \n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Late infection after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is an infection that occurs in the joint replaced by TKA ≥1 year postoperatively \\[1\\] . The incidence of infection following primary TKA is reportedly between 0.7% and 1.0%, with 65% of infections occurring within the first postoperative year \\[2,3\\] . Joint infections after arthroplasty can result from the contiguous or hematogenous spread \\[4,5\\] . This article presents a rare case of late infection after TKA associated with bacteremia caused by Secondary Aortoenteric Fistula (SAEF).  \n\n【11】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】An 82-year-old woman, who had undergone right TKA 13 years ago, presented to our hospital with a 1-week history of worsening pain and swelling in the right knee. Her medical history also included an aortoiliac aneurysm treated with an aortic bifurcation graft and unstable angina treated with coronary stent placement three years earlier. Physical examination revealed a mild fever (37.6 o C) and joint effusion in the right knee, and no wound was seen around the patient’s knee. There were no abdominal symptoms or oral disease that could cause sepsis. However, inflammatory markers in the blood test were significantly raised. The White Blood Cell (WBC) count was 13,630/µL, the C-reactive protein level was 38.25 mg/L, and the ESR was 115 mm. Radiographs showed no hardware complications or osteolysis (Figure 1) . Late infection after TKA was suspected, and intravenous cefazolin (3 g/day) administration was initiated after collecting blood and joint fluid samples for microbiological analysis. The knee aspirate had a WBC count of 71,500/mm 3 . According to 2018 validated and score-based International Consensus Meeting (ICM) definition for PJI, this case did not meet the major criteria. However, blood tests showed elevated CRP and ESR and elevated leukocytes in the synovial fluid; thus, the patient was diagnosed with PJI according to that criteria \\[6\\] . Streptococcus anginosus , Haemophilusparain fluenzae , Neisseria species , and Veillonella species were isolated from the joint fluid, and Enterobacter cloacae from the blood culture. Intravenous cefazolin was changed to meropenem (2 g/day) due to the antibiotic sensitivity test results.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Irrigation and debridement were performed to treat the infection of TKA. Intraoperatively, extensive purulence was observed in the knee; hence, all components of TKA were removed, and antibiotic-loaded bone cement spacers were inserted (Figure 2) . Cement spacers were made using 40 g of cement containing 4 g of imipenem/cilastatin. Intraoperative tissue and joint fluid were negative for infection. After the operation, knee pain and swelling improved. However, following the initial surgery, the patient complained of fever and chilled several times (Figure 3) .\n\n【15】  \n\n【16】Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) was isolated from blood samples obtained on postoperative days 15 and 22 when the patient reported fever. We suspected other unknown infectious diseases, and contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal computed tomography was performed on postoperative day 24, revealing gas buildup within the aneurysm sac (Figure 4) . Emergency Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed due to suspected communication between the duodenum and the aorta. EGD revealed an ulcerative fistula to the aortic graft in the duodenum (Figure 5) .\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】The patient was diagnosed with SAEF. We performed primary closure of the duodenum, reimplantation of blood vessel prosthesis, and omentopexy. MRSE and Enterococcus faecium were isolated from the intraoperative tissue. Intravenous meropenem was continued until after cardiovascular surgery. After cardiovascular surgery, antibiotics were discontinued on post-operative week one.\n\n【19】Two months after the aortic re-replacement, revision TKA was performed (Figure 6) . Intraoperative cultures were negative. Meropenem (1.5 g/day) was used during the perioperative period of revision arthroplasty. No antibiotics were administered after the revision surgery. One month after the re-replacement operation, the WBC count was 5,610/µL, and the C-reactive protein level was 0.08 mg/L.\n\n【20】  \n\n【21】Five years after the revision TKA, the patient reported no clinical signs of recurring infection and could walk with a T-cane without pain. In addition, no evidence of loosening was seen in the radiographs.\n\n【22】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for print and electronic publication of this case report. In addition, this study was approved by our institution’s institutional review board and ethics committee.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Infection is one of the most undesired complications after TKA. To the best of our knowledge, this report presents the first case of late infection after TKA related to SAEF. Infection after TKA occurs as a result of contiguous or hematogenous spread \\[3\\] . Hematogenous spread seems to be caused by distant infective sources, with the most frequent sources of bacteremia being the skin (15%), teeth (11%), and gastrointestinal tract (9%) \\[7\\] . In this case, a bacterial culture of joint aspiration fluid showed positive findings for some bacterial species common to the normal flora of the oral cavity. The patient had no dental diseases. The source of bacteremia might be an intestinal fistula caused by a blood vessel prosthesis; however, the source of infection was difficult to determine. A previous study reported a case of ankle arthritis as a consequence of aortoenteric fistula \\[8\\] ; however, the current study is the first report of a late infection after TKA related to aortoenteric fistula. If clinicians suspect a bacteremia associated with a prosthetic joint infection after vascular replacement, the aortoenteric fistula should be considered a potential bacteremia source.\n\n【25】An aortoenteric fistula is a communication between the aorta and the intestinal tract. The incidence of SAEF is estimated to be between 0.6%–2.0% \\[9\\] . Therefore, SAEF can occur as a complication of an aortic reconstructive surgical procedure, regardless of the implantation of an aortic stent graft. The cause of SAEF is mainly attributed to chronic perigraft infection or prolonged pressure on the bowel by grafts \\[9–12\\] . Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most frequent symptom in most SAEF cases, and sepsis occurs in approximately half of the patients on first consultation \\[13–15\\] . On contrast-enhanced computed tomography, the following features can be considered evidence of graft infection: peri-graft or intraluminal gas, perigraft soft-tissue thickening or fluid, loss of tissue planes, disruption of the aneurysmal wrap, and pseudoaneurysm or extravasation of contrast material \\[9,16\\] . Since viewing the distal portion of the duodenum with a standard upper endoscope is challenging, a longer endoscope (an enteroscope) should be used to visualize this area \\[17\\] . Graft removal and axillobifemoral bypass or graft removal and reimplantation of artificial graft are commonly performed for SAEF. However, the perioperative mortality rate is relatively high (22%–42%) \\[13\\] . Endovascular therapy has also been used in recent years, but additional surgery is required for gastrointestinal lesions \\[18\\] .\n\n【26】The patient, in this case, received a cement spacer, and reimplantation of TKA was performed after diagnosis and treatment of the SAEF. Five years after TKA reimplantation, no signs of recurrent infection have been noted. The pathogenic bacteria, in this case, were S. anginosus , H. parainfluenzae , Neisseria species , and Veillonella species, which are unusual causative agents of infection after TKA; thus, the conventional treatment procedure for infection after TKA had to be selected.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【28】Late infection after Total Knee Arthroplasty might be associated with Secondary Aortoenteric Fistula. Clinicians should suspect SAEF in patients with bacteremia after implantation of cement spacers with antibiotics for infections of arthroplasty and aortic reconstructive surgery.  \n\n【29】Declarations\n------------\n\n【30】Ethics approval: This study was performed per the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by our institution’s institutional review board and ethics committee.\n\n【31】Consent for publication: Informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this case report.

An adapted fire needle therapy was tried. The fire needle therapy used was divided into two stages. In the 1st stage, a thick fire needle was used once a day for four days, four times total. During the 2 <sup><span>nd </span></sup> stage, a thin fire needle was adopted once every other day for six days, three times in total.

Therefore, an adapted fire needle therapy was tried. After receiving fire needle treatment for two weeks, a total of 7 times, the wound healed, and the patient recovered successfully. Considering the significant efficacy of fire needles and the absence of side effects, it is believed that fire needles could be a possible treatment for patients of postoperative non-healing wounds with no healing tendency after local debridement, anti-infection treatment, and complimentary replacement therapy.  \n\n【10】Practice Points\n---------------\n\n【11】1.  The postoperative non-healing wound is a common complication after surgery which is difficult to deal with.\n2.  Due to repeated infection and long-term healing characteristics, the effectiveness of traditional therapy is sometimes limited, and the wound needs special treatment.\n\n【12】Introduction\n------------\n\n【13】A non-healing wound is any kind of wound that cannot be repaired and achieve an anatomically and functionally complete state normally \\[1\\] . Postoperative non-healing craniocerebral trauma wound has a long treatment period, easy recurrence, and has a high disability rate, which brings mental and economic pressure to patients and their families \\[2\\] . Meanwhile, it consumes a lot of medical resources.\n\n【14】Currently, some therapies are used in wound healing, including ultrasound or biological debridement \\[3,4\\] , anti-infective dressing \\[5\\] , negative-pressure wound therapy \\[6\\] , and growth factor therapy \\[7\\] . However, some therapies are more suitable for hospitalized patients but not convenient for a clinical environment, so the clinical application is limited. Moreover, the effect of these treatments is sometimes limited too.\n\n【15】Fire needle therapy was first described in the Yellow Emperor’s Canon of Internal Medicine (475 BC–221 BC) over 2000 years ago, which was one of the alternative therapies of traditional Chinese medicine and a branch of acupuncture. Fire needle therapy has unique advantages in promoting wound healing and is often used in China for clinical wounds management. However, it has not been widely recognized in the rest of the world.\n\n【16】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【17】Chief complaints: A 67-year-old female patient suffered from a postoperative non-healing wound after craniocerebral trauma surgery.\n\n【18】History of present illness: In 2016, the patient suffered from craniocerebral trauma due to a car accident and underwent decompressive craniectomy, followed by an implanted titanium alloy bone plate to maintain skull stability. Six months ago, a repeated scalp infection appeared where the left titanium mesh was placed, and the local skin was ruptured. The patient received continuous local dressing changes and debridement, but the wound still failed to recover. On October 28, 2020, the patient underwent debridement and titanium mesh removal. After the operation, the patient’s head wound remained unhealed, and a series of surgical dressing changes, chemical local wet compress, and physical replacement therapy did not work at all.\n\n【19】Personal and family history: No data was available.\n\n【20】Physical examination: A 1.8 cm x 1.1 cm oval unhealed wound could be seen on the left side of the patient’s head (Figure 1) . The blood supply of the skin flap around the wound was poor, the color was pale, and there was no obvious exudation. The skin temperature of the wound’s local tissue was slightly higher, and the tenderness was obvious.\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】Laboratory examinations: October 29, 2020, Whole blood cell analysis: leukocyte count was in the normal range (the leukocyte count is 8.74 x 10^9/L, and the normal range is 4.0–10.0 x 10^9/L), the percentage of neutrophils increased (the percentage of neutrophils is 75.5%, and the normal range is 50%–70%), and C-reactive protein increased (the C-reactive protein is 10.08 mg/L, and the normal range is 1.0–10.0 mg/L). October 29, 2020, Glycated hemoglobin is 5.9% (the normal range is 4%–6%).\n\n【23】Imaging examinations: Changes after skull repair.\n\n【24】Final diagnosis: Diagnosis: Non-healing wound, wound infection; Prognosis: Poor.\n\n【25】Treatment: Intervention before fire needle therapy (October 29, 2020–November 14, 2020): According to the TIME (tissue nonviable, infection/inflammation, moisture, edge) principle of clinical wound care \\[8\\] , effective debridement and local anti-infection therapy had been applied:\n\n【26】1.  Debridement and surgical dressing: the local necrotic tissue was removed, and the wound was covered with 0.5% diluted iodophor. The dressing was changed every day until the wound no longer exuded and removed the necrotic tissue. After that, the dressing could be changed every 2 days–3 days.\n2.  Anti-infection wet compress: 1% Bromogeramine was used for local disinfection, and then local wet compress with Raceanisodamine Hydrochloride injection were applied. As long as the wound continued, exudate 0.16% gentamicin was applied externally to prevent infection.\n3.  Oxygen spray therapy and ozone disinfection water washing therapy: 75% alcohol was added into the oxygen humidification bottle, and a No. 14 catheter was used to spray oxygen on the wound. Oxygen flows 9 L/min for 15 minutes once a day. Meanwhile, an ozone disinfectant water spray tank with a concentration of more than 6 mg/L was used to rinse the wound once a day.\n\n【27】Laboratory examinations: November 11, 2020, Whole blood cell analysis: leukocyte count was in the normal range (the leukocyte count is 9.65 x 10^9/L), the percentage of neutrophils increased slightly (the percentage of neutrophils is 75.7%), and C-reactive protein was normal (the C-reactive protein is 7.3 mg/L).\n\n【28】The patient still has an obvious headache and no wound healing tendency, and the wound on the local scalp changes are not as obvious compared with the previous one. Hence, the patient began to accept fire needle therapy from November 15, 2020.\n\n【29】Fire needle therapeutic intervention (November 15, 2020–November 25, 2020): Based on the original local dressing change, fire needle therapy was added. The fire needle therapy was divided into two stages.\n\n【30】A thick fire needle was used in the 1st stage (once a day for four days, four times in total). Disinfection was performed on the edge of the wound with iodophor and deiodinated with 75% alcohol. A 1.1 mm diameter fire needle was used, and the needle tip and the lower section of the needle body were placed at the outer flame of the alcohol lamp for heating until it turned red. Then it was quickly pricked at the skin flap interspersed throughout the area 4 mm–5 mm from the wound, with a depth of about 2 mm–3 mm, and then quickly removed. The whole process of pricking and removing is about 1 second, and the time of contacting human skin is about 0.1 seconds–0.3 seconds. Prick eight needles on the skin flap 4 mm–5 mm around the wound per time. A small amount of congestion is released to eliminate the blockage and promote blood circulation. Precautions: Pay attention to avoid the wound’s inner edge injuries during fire needle therapy.\n\n【31】The 2 <sup><span>nd </span></sup> stage (once every other day for six days, three times in total) adopted a 0.5 mm thin fire needle. Disinfection was performed, and both the needle tip and the lower section were heated to red, similarly to the method used with the thick fire-heated needle. Then the thin needle was quickly pricked to the inner skin edge of the wound, with a depth of about 1 mm–2mm, and quickly removed. The whole process of pricking and removing is about 1 second, and the time of contacting human skin is about 0.1 seconds–0.3 seconds. Prick six needles on the inner skin edge of the wound per time. The aim was to remove necrotic tissue, promote the growth of new granulation tissue and accelerate wound healing.\n\n【32】Ethics and Informed Consent: This case report does not involve the patient’s personal information and privacy. The patient informed and agreed to publish the case as a case report.\n\n【33】Outcome and follow-up: Two weeks later, after fire needle therapy, the patient reported that the degree of headache decreased, and the tendency of wound healing was obvious (Figure 2) .\n\n【34】  \n\n【35】November 29, 2020, Whole blood cell analysis: leukocyte count, the percentage of neutrophils and CRP was normal (WBC 7.37 x 109/L, NEUT%, 67.3%, CRP 7.1 mg/L). After three months’ follow-up, the patient had no headache and the wound healed well.\n\n【36】Discussion\n----------\n\n【37】The postoperative non-healing wound can be divided into the patient’s own condition factors and local wound factors. The self-condition factors include body immunity, nutrition, etc. Local factors include poor blood circulation, poor drainage, and local infection. Studies have shown that biofilm infection exists in 75%–90% of chronic wounds. Therefore, chronic wound infection caused by bacterial biofilm has become the focus of wound management \\[9,10\\] . The patient in our case presented with the wound repeatedly infected and poor peripheral blood supply. The fire needle was applied to control infection by improving local blood circulation and regulating inflammation.\n\n【38】The fire needle is made of tungsten alloy, and burning is the key modality in this treatment. The needle must be heated until it turns red and then quickly pricked into the acupoints or parts of the human body and quickly removed. Research shows that the maximum temperature of the needle can reach 800 <sup><span>0 </span></sup> C after burning to red, and when pricking into the skin after 1 second, the temperature is close to 300 <sup><span>0 </span></sup> C \\[11\\] . The whole process of pricking and removing is about 1 second, and the time of contacting human skin is about 0.1 seconds. With strong penetration power and low resistance to the skin, a fire needle shortens the procedure’s time and reduces patients’ pain. In China, fire needle therapy is often used in clinical skin diseases, fascia and muscle diseases, orthopedic diseases \\[12\\] . Studies have also shown that fire needles can improve local blood circulation, localized inflammation and regulate immunity \\[13–20\\] , which may have a benign inducing effect on promoting wound healing.\n\n【39】Fire needle therapy stimulates acupoints and has a moxibustion effect simultaneously, with the effect of promoting the circulation of blood. In the clinical study of knee osteoarthritis treated with fire needle therapy, it is found that fire needles can improve the hemodynamic state, hemorheology, and microcirculation around the knee \\[13\\] . Clinical studies have also shown that fire needle treatment’s high temperature destroys inflammatory lesions and accelerates wound healing and exudation, promoting blood circulation and metabolism leading to tissue regeneration \\[14,20\\].\n\n【40】Fire needles can localize the inflammation and accelerate the skin barrier repair. Studies have shown that fire needles can mediate and limit inflammatory response by reducing serum interleukin-1 \\[15\\] . In the clinical application of treating skin diseases, fire needles can enhance the blood supply in local skin lesions, promote leukocyte exudation, and improve its phagocytic function to help the inflammation subside and localize the inflammation \\[16\\] .\n\n【41】Fire needle can regulate immunity and promote wound healing, and it is often used as a treatment for non-healing wounds after operation in China \\[18\\] . Animal studies show that fire needles can effectively promote the necrosis and liquefaction of wound lesions in bedsore mice, stimulate self-regulation mechanism, and release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other growth factors to promote the growth of granulation tissue and accelerate healing \\[17\\] . In addition, a study of non-healing wounds after gynecological laparoscopic surgery treated with a fire needle showed that fire needle could trigger a local inflammatory reaction, enhance non-specific immune defense functions, improve the number and phagocytic ability of phagocytes, and further promote wound healing \\[18,19\\] .\n\n【42】Advantages and Limitations: Currently, there are few case studies of a postoperative non-healing wound treated by fire needle therapy internationally. Fire needle is often used to promote postoperative wound healing in China, with significant efficacy. In this case, before receiving fire needle therapy, the patient adopted debridement, local dressing change, and complimentary replacement therapy, but none of these methods worked. Within two weeks after receiving fire needle therapy, the wound started improving and gradually healed. Indeed, though the wound healing tendency was obvious and no adverse events existed during fire needle therapy, we did not leave histological evidence to provide accurate histological information of wound healing.\n\n【43】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【44】This patient’s fire needle therapy led to substantial improvement of the postoperative non-healing wound. However, as a branch of acupuncture, fire needle has not been widely recognized globally. There are still few studies on fire needles in promoting wound healing. The investigators report this case in the hope of providing a new idea for the postoperative non-healing wound.  \n\n【45】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【46】Author contributions: Pei Yu is responsible for writing the manuscript.

Described clinical phenotypes include short stature, psychomotor delay, microcephaly, brachydactyly, and optic nerve hypoplasia. Here we report a 24-year-old female with 8050 kilobase deletion at 12p12.2p11.22, who has a history of sudden cardiac arrest secondary to cardiac arrhythmia. Cardiac features presented in our case have not been reported in 12p deletion patients. Among 40 OMIM genes in the deleted region, ABCC9 heterozygous deletion is one of the susceptible causes for the cardiac arrhythmia phenotype in this patient.\n\n【7】Introduction\n------------\n\n【8】Interstitial deletion of the proximal short arm (p) of chromosome 12 is a rare chromosome abnormality. To date, there are around 20 cases reported with chromosome 12p deletion overlapping and/or partially overlapping bands12p12p11 in the literature \\[1–9\\] . The common characteristic features reported among these patients overlap and include short stature, psychomotor delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, digital anomalies, skeletal anomalies, dental anomalies, optic nerve hypoplasia/atrophy, strabismus, and arterial hypertension. In addition, craniofacial dysmorphic has been described, including flattened nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, cleft lip, cleft palate, and low-set ears \\[4,6,9\\] . Reported organ anomalies include cystic kidney, horseshoe kidney, and cardiac anomalies \\[4,5\\] . In addition, some of the previously described patients with proximal interstitial 12p deletion had cardiovascular abnormalities, which include high blood pressure, right heat hypoplasia, small persistent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, and ventricular septal defect \\[3,4,9,10\\] .\n\n【9】Here, we report a patient with an interstitial deletion at 12p12.2p11.22 encompassing the ABCC9 gene (loss-of-function) who had cardiac arrest secondary to cardiac arrhythmia. The presented case possibly further extends the phenotypic spectrum of proximal 12p deletion with cardiac phenotype and suggests the role of ABCC9 in cardiomyocyte electrophysiology and function.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Our case is a 24-year-old Caucasian female who has a medical history of global developmental delay. She was the first child born to healthy and non-consanguineous parents. The family history and antenatal course were unremarkable. She was delivered at term. At birth, she was noted to have a cleft palate, which was repaired at age 10-month-old. The patient was globally delayed. She began to walk independently at the age of two years and speak at the age of eight years. At age 14 years, the patient was found to have a deletion of approximately 8050 kilobases in chromosome 12p12.2p11.22. She has been seen by a pediatric cardiologist since age 16 years for mitral valve prolapse, aortic root dilatation, and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). After a Holter revealed episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia at age 14, she underwent hemodynamic catheterization and electrophysiology study.\n\n【12】Aside from her modest mitral insufficiency and aortic root dilatation, she had reassuring hemodynamics, and her Electrophysiological (EP) study revealed no inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. She has been treated with atenolol 50 mg daily. At age 18 years, the patient had a cardiac arrest in her home and underwent resuscitation. She was found to be in ventricular fibrillation. She was intubated and given two defibrillator shocks, epinephrine, and amiodarone, before converting to sinus rhythm. One week later, the patient underwent Automatic Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (AICD) placement. She remained on oral amiodarone therapy for some time afterward due to persistent frequent ventricular ectopy and occasional ventricular tachycardia with the inability to stop amiodarone. In February 2018, she underwent an EP study for attempted ablation of some of her more prominent foci. However, her ectopy was suppressed under anesthesia and became very infrequent, but with seven different morphologies. Therefore, no ablation could be performed at that time. During the follow-up, she was noted to have continued frequent Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs), Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia (NSVT) (Figure 1) , Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP), and aortic root dilation. At about 23 years of age, she began to have sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation that were appropriately treated with her ICD. Attempts at management included adding atenolol to her antiarrhythmic treatment and adding an atrial pacing lead to her ICD system to prevent bradycardia-related VT/VF. A genetic cardiomyopathy panel was sent, showing VUS on ABCC9. So a trial of quinidine was given, which resulted in an increase in the frequency of her ventricular tachycardia as well as profound dermatitis. She was restarted on amiodarone, and her beta blocker was changed to nadolol.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】The patient has not had regression after cardiac arrest. MRI of the brain 3 months after cardiac arrest showed mild generalized cerebral atrophy. There was mild increase in size of the ventricular system and cerebral sulci when compared to previous exam prior to cardias arrest. Other medical problems include gastroesophageal reflux, gastric body and antrum hiatal hernia and conductive hearing loss, myopia, optic nerve hypoplasia, and a history of recurrent middle ear effusions as a child.\n\n【15】On examination at 24 years of age, her weight was 42 kilograms, height was 140 centimeters and head circumference was 51.5 centimeters. She had microcephaly, dysmorphic features including short palpebral fissures, bulbous nasal tip, flat nasal bridge, and attached earlobes. She was noted to have brachydactyly, brachytelephalanges, and brachymetatarsia of 3 rd , 4 th and 5 th toe (Figure 2) .\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】Results\n-------\n\n【18】Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) was performed using the Agilent 4x180K aCGH-SNP oligonucleotide array (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), which demonstrated an approximately 8050 Kb deletion in chromosome 12p12.3p11.22 between linear genomic positions 20,834,159 and 28,884,010 (GRCh37). This deletion encompasses 47 protein-coding genes, 40 genes of which are OMIM genes.\n\n【19】Arrhythmia and Cardiomyopathy next-generation sequencing panel analysis using Illumina technology and deletion/duplication analysis using hybridization-based technology were performed, which include 111 genes. The result revealed a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), c.8111C>T (p.Pro2704Leu) in the ALMS1 gene; a VUS, entire coding sequence deletion in the ABCC9 gene, and a VUS, entire coding sequence deletion in KRAS gene.\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】Among the cases with overlapping interstitial deletion at chromosome 12p12.2p11.2, our case represents common features of the chromosome 12p deletion, which include psychomotor delay, intellectual disability, brachydactyly, short stature, optic nerve hypoplasia, and craniofacial dysmorphism. In addition, our patient was noted to have MPV, aortic root dilation, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest. Cardiac features seen in our case have not been reported. Our case has 8050 Kb interstitial 12p12.3p11.22 deletion, which encompasses 40 OMIM genes (gene to gene). Among these 40 genes, ABCC9, KCNJ8, and KRAS are associated with cardiovascular abnormalities.\n\n【22】KRAS gene (OMIM\\*190070, Kirsten rat sarcoma) provides instructions for making protein K-Ras which is part of the RAS/MAPK pathway. The RAS/MAPK pathway is a well-studied signal transduction pathway that plays an important role in cell growth, division, and differentiation. KRAS gene alterations have been reported as a rare cause of Noonan syndrome and cardio-facial-cutaneous syndromes. Cardiac findings observed in these cases include Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), mitral and tricuspid valve prolapse, and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). Most pathogenic KRAS alterations (T58I, V14I, D153V, Y71H, and K147E) result in a gain-of-function effect and increased signal transduction down the RAS/MAPK pathway \\[11–15\\] . Loss of function deletion has not been reported in KRAS-related disorders.\n\n【23】KCNJ8 gene (OMIM\\*600935, Potassium inwardly-rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 8) encodes the Kir6.1 subunit ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP), allowing potassium to flow into a cell (NCBI Gene ID: 3764). Most of the publications showed evidence of gain-of-function alteration of KCNJ8 (p.S422L and p.C176S) associated with Cantú syndrome and Brugada syndrome \\[16–19\\] . Loss-of-function alterations of KCNJ8 (p.V346I and p.E332del) have been reported once as a potential mechanism in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) \\[20\\] . Furthermore, the deletion of chr12:21535966\\_21813767 (GRCh38), including KCNJ8 reported in one data entry as a polymorphism in the unaffected adult control group (DGV: nssv789559) \\[21\\] .\n\n【24】ABCC9 gene (OMIM\\*601439, ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C, member 9) encodes the regulatory subunit sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) of the KATP channel. It works with the pore-forming subunit Kir6.1 to regulate the potassium channel in cardiomyocytes, vascular smooth muscles, and endothelial cells \\[22\\] . Pathogenic variants in the ABCC gene are associated with Cantú syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy-1O, intellectual disability, and myopathy syndrome. Cantú syndrome is characterized by a coarse facial appearance, macrocephaly, hypertrichosis, and skeletal and cardiovascular anomalies \\[23\\] . The gain-of-function variants in the ABCC9 gene result in Cantu syndrome \\[24,25\\] . Additionally, gain-of-function variants (A355S, M941V, K1379Q, and H1305Y) were identified in 4 cases with sudden unexpected natural death \\[26\\] .\n\n【25】On the other hand, ABCC9 loss-of-function alternation (missense, frameshift, and deletion) has been described in 11 cases (Table) . However, 6 of 11 cases were noted to have homozygous splice-site mutation in the ABCC9 gene leading to an in-frame deletion of exon 8 \\[27\\] . Only two patients out of six patients showed cardiac function abnormality, including systolic dysfunction, dilated ventricles, and cardiac failure. Cardiac conduction defects were not reported in these patients \\[27\\] . Among 5 cases with heterozygous ABCC9 alteration, three cases had missense alteration in the ABCC9 gene. Two cases had a small deletion and insertion variant resulting in frameshift alteration. In 2004, Bienengraeber identified two variants of ABCC9 in three adults, c.4570\\_4572delTTAinsAAAT(p.1524fs) and c.4537G>A(p.A1513T) \\[28\\] . Both variants have been approved to cause a loss of function in the ABCC9 gene. All of the three patients showed severe dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachycardia. Zaytseva et al. reported the same ABCC9 variant, c.4570\\_4572delTTAinsAAAT(p.1524fs), in a 32-year-old female with ventricular fibrillation \\[22\\] . A missense variant, c.4640C>T(p.Thr1547Ile), was reported in a 53-year-old female who has a history of daily paroxysm of atrial fibrillation (AF) and showed an increased premature atrial ectopy in the presence of isoproterenol \\[29\\] . Even though this loss of function, ABCC9 variants in (Table) were classified as unknown significant according to the current database (ClinVar). These studies provided evidence of the relationship of ABCC9 loss-of-function alterations to cardiac phenotypes.\n\n【26】  \n\n【27】However, heterozygous deletion of KRAS, KCNJ8, and ABCC9 genes has not been seen in association with cardiac phenotypes. The pathologic mechanism behind our case’s cardiac phenotypes is unclear.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【29】This is the first case reported to date of interstitial 12p12.2p11.22 deletion with cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. These findings possibly expand the phenotypic spectrum of interstitial 12p deletion. However, more clinical data from other patients with proximal chromosome 12p deletion are needed.  \n\n【30】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【31】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Treatment may involve numerous materials, personnel, and procedures and be expensive. Multi-Tissue Platform (MTP) graft (Xcellistem, Stemsys Bio) is a regenerative Extracellular Matrix (ECM) derived from multiple ECM sources with diverse non-collagenous proteins fibronectin, elastin, and laminin.\n\n【7】Case Series: Ten cases of complex abdominal wounds were treated with MTP material at a single institution until properly healed. In each case, the original surgery involved the placement of a multi-tissue graft, and three patients were treated with bedside graft material in subsequent weeks. Wound outcomes were examined, analyzed histologically, and used to compare the cost of care to Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT). In one case, a biopsy was obtained two weeks after the MTP graft application; the microscopic analysis was presented.\n\n【8】Results: Each patient achieved healing without complication; the median treatment time was 2.5 weeks. Xcellistem was applied to a representative wound for two weeks and later sampled for histological analysis. The sample contained a remodeling neutrophil response with collagen deposition, neovascularization, fibroblast presence, and macrophage presence and lacked foreign-body granulomas. The average cost of materials is $520 per week, compared to 533$ per week for NPWT at our institution.\n\n【9】Discussion: Complex wounds represent a significant disability for patients as well as a challenging and costly treatment process. Similar to other studies, this case series found successful healing without complications, re-infection, or reoperation. Wound care with ECM materials may reduce the need for dressing changes, NPWT devices, and medical visits. The costs of MTP are lower than many bioresorbable materials or NPWT. The histological analysis illustrated a healing response that facilitated functional tissue remodeling instead of disorganized scarring.\n\n【10】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【11】ECM: Extracellular Matrix; NPWT: Negative Pressure Wound Therapy; MTP: Multi-Tissue Platform  \n\n【12】Introduction\n------------\n\n【13】Complex wounds (e.g., an acute or chronic injury to human skin tissue that does not respond to conventional treatments in a timely manner) present a clinical challenge to achieve complete healing and functional restoration. Wound cases that involve additional risk factors such as severe tissue necrosis, immunosuppression, tobacco abuse, Crohn’s disease, diabetes, and obesity pose increased risks of delayed healing, non-healing, reoperation, infection, and reinfection (i.e., when a person was infected, recovered, and later became infected again). In addition, the treatment of wounds is often costly, involving materials, personnel, and procedures. Xcellistem (Stemsys Bio) is a new regenerative extracellular Multi-Tissue Platform (MTP) graft matrix material derived from multiple Extracellular Matrix (ECM) sources. It has a diverse mix of ECM components, including substantial quantities of non-collagenous proteins such as fibronectin, elastin, and laminin \\[1\\] . Xcellistem has shown efficacy in facilitating the healing of wounds \\[1,2\\] . In this analysis, ten cases of complex abdominal wounds were treated with Xcellistem application at a single institution. The wound outcomes were examined, analyzed histologically, and used to compare the cost of care to Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT).\n\n【14】Case Series\n-----------\n\n【15】In this retrospective cohort analysis, ten complex abdominal wall wounds were identified that required surgical debridement and the use of advanced wound therapy. All patients were given information about treatment options, the surgery, and associated risks. The ten patients agreed to the surgery and treatment plan. The complex wounds consisted of post-surgical wounds with significant tissue necrosis, locations of hardware removal, and panniculectomy dehiscence. In each case, the wound was debrided in the operating room with irrigation, sharp debridement of devitalized tissue, and followed by an assessment of the dimensions of the wound. Each wound was then treated with sterile MTP graft material sourced from Stemsys Bio and on the shelf at our hospital, which was applied in the operating room.  \n\n【16】The dimensions of each wound and the patient characteristics are shown in (Table 1) . No patient experienced sepsis or required prolonged hospitalization. In addition, none of the wounds were tumor-bearing or actively infected.\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Results\n-------\n\n【19】During the initial surgery, wound debridement was performed, and the wound was assessed for its dimensions, depth, and any tunneling or recesses (Figure 1) . MTP graft powder material was applied into each wound (Figure 2) . The wound was then covered with Hydrogel or iodoform moist gauze, followed by a dry gauze dressing (Figure 3) . The Xcellistem material and dressing were left in place for one week until the office examination approved the removal of the dressing (Figure 4) .\n\n【20】  \n\n【21】In most cases, no further treatment was required, three-dimensional cavitary recesses exhibited a fill-in response, and a new dry gauze dressing was applied (Figure 5) .\n\n【22】  \n\n【23】The median healing time for these complex wounds using weekly Xcellistem xenograft material applications was 2.5 weeks. In two cases, the wound healed with the formation of granulation tissue depicted in the image, which required no treatment (Figure 6) . Patients’ safety was ensured by monitoring the long-term effects since each patient remained within our system. No patient required reoperation, antibiotics, or negative pressure devices, and none developed an infection. No patient is required to visit nurses, home wound care, visit additional wound centers, or the need to wear or carry a device. The cost for the material, including the initial graft and subsequent office treatments, was $520 per week.\n\n【24】  \n\n【25】In the same center, an analysis was undertaken to examine the costs of wound care materials when using NPWT for comparable wounds. The costs per week of material for the NPWT protocol, utilizing three-times-per-week changes, for the Small, Medium (Table 2) , Large, and Extra-Large systems are $410, $433, $782, and $932, respectively (excludes the cost of personnel labor).\n\n【26】  \n\n【27】Based on the aggregate size measurements and the expertise of the wound care nursing staff at our institution, the ten cases represented here would initially require two small NPWT systems, three large, and five medium systems. The mean weekly cost for NPWT materials would be $533 per week.\n\n【28】A biopsy of the wound that was in the process of healing was obtained from a single case/scar lesion two weeks after the placement of the MTP graft. The histological analysis illustrated a remodeling neutrophil response with collagen deposition, fibroblast, and macrophage presence, neovascularity, and lacking foreign-body granulomas (Figure 7) . Hematoxylin and eosin stains on high power show an absence of granuloma, with evidence of neovascularization, fibroblast features (e.g., spindle-shaped cells, basophilic cytoplasm, and surrounding collagen deposition), and macrophage presence (Figure 8) . Trichrome stains further illustrate the organized collagen deposition and functional tissue remodeling response (Figure 9) .\n\n【29】  \n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】In this study, treatment of a diverse array of complex abdominal wounds using MTP graft application resulted in successful clinical healing without complications, re-infection, or reoperation. Areas of cavitary recesses remodeled and properly healed. The microscopic analysis demonstrates a favorable healing response.\n\n【32】ECMs have demonstrated effective healing outcomes throughout a wide range of wounds, such as open pilonidal wounds \\[3,4\\] , infected wounds \\[2\\] , hidradenitis suppurativa wounds \\[5\\] , leg ulcers \\[6,7\\] , combat military wounds \\[8\\] , complex or chronic wounds \\[1,9–17\\] , and large traumatic crush injuries \\[18\\] . Collagen matrices and bioactive signaling peptides have influenced the host response to favorably affect tissue remodeling and improve tissue functionality and speed of tissue recovery. Prior histologic studies of tissues treated with ECMs demonstrate less granulomas and scars with more functional remodeling, laminar collagen, and M2 macrophage response \\[4\\] .\n\n【33】Current literature on innovative ECM treatments shows great promise in treating a wide variety of wounds. One study’s results demonstrate that patients treated with ECM material healed faster with a better success rate than historical controls for standard care \\[4\\] , while another study specifically found that 95.7% of patient’s wounds closed within 12 weeks compared to 46% of those treated with standard care \\[6\\] . Numerous studies had a large, diverse set of wound etiologies that were successfully treated with proper ECM treatment \\[9,14,16,18\\] . Research teams have found evidence that proper ECM materials and treatment allow and promote the development of granulation tissue \\[16\\] . Although chronic soft tissue defects, infected wounds, and pilonidal sinus disease are infamous for their difficulty in healing, results from studies \\[2,3,12\\] have provided evidence that ECM material may improve the healing process, minimize common complications, and provide promising long-term outcomes compared to standard treatment. Good cosmetic outcomes, functional outcomes, and patient satisfaction were achieved when ECM materials were used for reconstructing defects with exposed vital structure \\[10\\] or used for surgical reconstruction of chronic soft tissue defects via tissue flaps \\[12\\] . One research team found that an ECM-derived bioscaffold may be a viable treatment for Volumetric Muscle Loss after demonstrating improvement in strength and function \\[13\\] .\n\n【34】MTP powder has previously demonstrated effectiveness in achieving and accelerating wound healing across an array of tissues. The unique features of the multi-organ ECM include its potent chemotactic effect on host progenitor stem cells and macrophage M2 subtypes, which may play an essential role in the constructive remodeling of site-specific tissue \\[19\\] . In addition, MTP powder has been shown to be an effective wound treatment against wounds that have not responded to other treatments or are infected in a diverse range of wounds \\[1,2\\] .\n\n【35】In this series, patients who have undergone treatment of their wounds using Xcellistem xenograft material did not have to carry or wear cumbersome negative pressure devices or tubing. In addition, none of the patients needed to perform dressing care at home, none were required to make frequent trips to a wound care center, nor did they have visiting nurses. Although the main focus of this case report was to examine the costs of the materials involved, it is worth noting that patients experience a lower burden of travel, intrusions, physical encumberments, and visits when using Xcellistem for wound healing than they would be using NPWT at this institution. Indications for MTP are for open soft tissue wounds, and contraindications thus far would be if a specific allergy appeared clinically. Treatment notes are the direct application of the MTP powder to wound surfaces, followed by the application of a moist dressing.\n\n【36】In this case series, ten abdominal wall wounds were treated with MTP powder and healed quickly without complication. Histologic analysis of a wound two weeks after MTP application shows a favorable remodeling response. In this single-center analysis, the median cost of materials per week using MTP graft is less than that of the costs per week using NPWT, based on contracted pricing within the same facility. Using the NPWT method, transportation and more personnel costs further increase the overall cost burden. Utilizing an MTP graft instead, a weekly or even bi-weekly dressing change is performed in the wound clinic or in the physician’s office, usually by a mid-level practitioner. Reducing the frequency of wound treatment seems to have little to no negative impact when weekly MTP graft application is the intended treatment plan. Thus, less material and less manpower costs are utilized than with NPWT, with excellent wound healing results.\n\n【37】Moving forward, future studies should aim for greater participant size and use a randomized, prospective, controlled trial comparing wound treatment protocols with NPWT or other approaches vs. Xcellistem. Using a randomized controlled trial may shed further light on the most cost-effective strategies for treating complex wounds. Rather than compare finances, future studies can examine therapeutic effects which may hold greater clinical significance. Future studies may also be worthwhile to explore cell surface markers on a wound via immunohistochemical detection to understand further the mechanism of promoting healing. Other molecules of research interest are inflammatory factors and expression of wound healing protein factors and their specific role in wound healing.\n\n【38】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【39】Dr. Sasse serves on the Scientific Advisory Board of Regenerative Tissue Technologies Corporation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccrj_case", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Some scientists report that the oral and nasal mucosa is particularly affected during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, others report infrequent involvement of the oral mucosa. Unlike oral lesions, orofacial symptoms such as anosmia/hyposmia and/or ageusia/dysgeusia/hypogeusia are better documented. We want to describe oral lesions in a patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated comorbidities (i.e., reactive arthritis).\n\n【7】Case Presentation: We present oral symptoms and signs in a 57-year-old female patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient developed a milder clinical form of the disease in November 2020. Her medical history revealed that she had had reactive arthritis for the past nine years. Clinical oral examination showed bilateral erythema with multiple shallow erosions that were visible on the anterior part of the hard palate mucosa. There were no changes to the skin and other mucous membranes. For two weeks, she was prescribed local therapy with oral antiseptic and dexamethasone drops.\n\n【8】Conclusions: Erythema and erosions on the hard palate mucosa are oral manifestations of reactive arthritis triggered by immunosuppression during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The immune imbalance caused by COVID-19 requires a close long-term follow-up.\n\n【9】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【10】SARS-CoV-2: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2; ACE2 receptors: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 Receptors; COVID-19: Coronavirus Disease 2019; ReA: Reactive Arthritis; Real-time RT-PCR: Real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA: Ribonucleic Acid; CBC: Complete Blood Count; ANA: Antinuclear Antibodies; ENA: Extractable Nuclear Proteins; HLA: Human Leukocyte Antigen; HSV: Herpes Simplex Virus; SLE: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; OLP: Oral Lichen Planus; EM: Erythema Multiforme.\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】The amount of available scientific data on the oral lesions of the new coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is increasing every day. It is mainly presented through case reports and case series. A few recent systematic reviews have been published to provide us with accurate information on the association between oral lesions and the new coronavirus. The available scientific data is contradictory. Some scientists report that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, the oral and nasal mucosa is particularly affected because of a cytokine storm \\[1\\] . The new coronavirus binds to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors located on the epithelial cells of the oral mucosa and gingiva \\[2\\] . Others report infrequency involvement of the oral mucosa \\[3\\] and the absence of oral lesions in milder clinical forms of the disease \\[4\\] . Orofacial symptoms such as anosmia/hyposmia and/or ageusia/dysgeusia/hypogeusia are better documented than oral lesions. Therefore, they may raise the suspicion of early infection. It has been proven that anosmia and ageusia are caused by inflammation that occurred in COVID-19 \\[5\\] . The tongue is the most affected segment of the oral cavity due to the higher ACE2 receptors in its epithelial cells than the cheek mucosa or gingiva \\[2\\] .\n\n【13】Our case report describes an extremely rare oral (palatal mucosa) manifestation of Reactive Arthritis (ReA) triggered by SARS-CoV-2. This is a case report of a non-classical form of ReA.\n\n【14】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】We want to present oral symptoms and signs in a 57-year-old female patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (real-time RT-PCR) amplification of the viral RNA. The patient developed a milder clinical form of the disease accompanied by fever (39ºC), shallow breathing, headache, myalgia, joint pain, hypogeusia, and hyposmia. She was prescribed antibiotic therapy with azithromycin tablets (500 mg, once daily for three days) due to the high fever (39ºC) that persisted for five days, after which her general condition improved. The patient noticed “changes in the oral mucosa” accompanied by a burning sensation and pain two weeks after the COVID-19 diagnosis. The symptoms prevented her from eating and drinking normally. Because of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial effect, she rinsed her oral cavity with sage tea to no apparent effect.\n\n【16】She stated that “similar lesions used to appear before in periods of immunosuppression.” These lesions would resolve spontaneously without medical intervention within two weeks. She also denied possible mechanical, chemical, and/or thermal injuries. Therefore, she consulted an oral medicine specialist at the Dental Clinic (teaching base of the School of Medicine, University of Split, study of Dental Medicine, Split, Croatia) in November 2020. Her medical history revealed that she has been suffering from ReA for the past nine years and from chronic gastritis. An epidemiological history revealed that she had not been vaccinated. She was not taking any medications. She had no allergies as well as drug allergies. She was a non-smoker. Her results of Complete Blood Count (CBC), biochemistry, Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA), Extractable Nuclear Proteins (ENA), and urine culture were non-contributory. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing showed a positive finding of HLA B 27 antigen. She denied gastrointestinal and genitourinary problems. Clinical oral examination showed bilateral erythema with multiple, shallow erosions that were visible on the anterior part of the hard palate mucosa (Figure 1) . An oral mycological swab was taken, and the native preparation was negative. She was also referred for serological testing for Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) after three weeks due to possible asymptomatic primoinfection, although she denied recurrent HSV lesions. The results were also negative (Table) . IgM-HSV1/HSV2 and IgG-HSV1/HSV2 antibodies usually appear at the same time, 10 days to 21 days after infection \\[6\\] . Dermato-venerological examination revealed no changes to the skin and other mucous membranes. A rheumatologist examination was also performed at the Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Split, Split, Croatia. She was prescribed local therapy with oral antiseptic (0.12% Chlorhexidine Digluconate and 0.05% Cetylpyridine Chloride, 2x daily) and dexamethasone drops (10 drops three times a day) for two weeks. Oral lesions remission occurred in ten days ( Figure 2) .\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Discussion\n----------\n\n【19】ReA (previously called “Reiter’s syndrome”) occurs as a result of an abnormal immune response to one of the distant microbiological factors (i.e., gastrointestinal, genitourinary). _Shigella flexneri_ , _Shigella dysenteriae_ , _Salmonella enteritidis_ , _Salmonella typhimurium_ , _Chlamydia trachomatis_ , _Yersinia enterocolitica_ , _Campylobacter jejuni_ , _Clostridia difficile_ , _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ , and Ureaplasma urealyticum are well-known triggers. SARS-CoV-2 will certainly occur in the etiopathogenesis, and our case report makes a small scientific contribution. The association between ReA and SARS-CoV-2 needs to be established in further studies with more subjects. Case reports do not have much scientific value due to subjectivity and bias. The classical diagnostic triad for this syndrome consists of arthritis, non-gonococcal urethritis, and conjunctivitis, but most patients do not exhibit this typical clinical picture \\[7\\] .\n\n【20】Oral lesions occur in 20% to 40% of the cases \\[8\\] . Papules and ulcerations on the buccal mucosa, gingiva, lips, and geographic tongue are the most commonly described oral lesions \\[7,8\\] . According to available data, as an oral manifestation of ReA, palate lesions have been described in two studies \\[9,10\\] . The differential diagnosis is broad and includes Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE); oral allergic reactions (i.e., products containing cinnamon, volatile oils); oral bullous eruption caused by azithromycin; vitamin deficiency; Oral Lichen Planus (OLP); oral candidiasis; recurrent infections caused by HSV (herpes palati duri); mechanical, chemical and thermal injuries of the oral mucosa; erythroplakia; Erythema Multiforme (EM). We believe that bilateral erythema and shallow erosions on the hard palate mucosa in our patient are oral manifestations of ReA caused by the SARS-CoV-2 induced immunosuppression. Oral lesions occurred two weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is consistent with the time required for the development of ReA (several days to four weeks) \\[11\\] . Our patient also had a genetic predisposition, i.e., HLA B 27 antigen finding. Herpes palati duri mostly has unilateral localization. EM was excluded because the patient did not have the most common triggers (medications, HSV).\n\n【21】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【22】It is worth presenting this case of palatal lesions of Reactive Arthritis (ReA) because they rarely occur in everyday clinical practice. Therefore, they can easily be misdiagnosed and directly attributed to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the causative agent. Therefore, multidisciplinary collaboration, i. e., a collaboration of dermatovenerology, rheumatology, and oral medicine specialists, is important in making the final diagnosis of oral mucosal changes to provide patients with a timely therapeutic approach and eliminate unnecessary additional concern at the time of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\n【23】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【24】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  Informed consent was obtained for this publication.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccrj_case", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

As a result, dermatologists and laser surgeons have been leading the way to develop techniques and methods to remove tattoos in the fastest and safest possible way effectively.\n\n【7】Acoustic Shock Wave Therapy has been recently described as an adjuvant in enhancing tattoo clearance by increasing lymphatic drainage and increasing metabolic activity in the treated area, thereby accelerating the clearance of dermal pigment vacuoles produced by picosecond and Q-switched lasers.\n\n【8】We present a case series of 4 patients who underwent 1 to 3 combined sessions of picosecond laser and acoustic shock wave therapy on monthly intervals for tattoo removal, resulting in a faster clearing of the lesions without major side effects.\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】For decades, the removal of both professional and semi-professional tattoos has been sought in many different ways: from the salabrasion method published by Gary Manchester in 1973 \\[1\\] to the use of tannic acid in 1991 \\[2\\] and silver nitrate in 1995 \\[3\\] , with highly variable results.\n\n【11】With the introduction of Q-switched laser devices and, more recently, picosecond lasers, better outcomes are achieved, and side effects are less frequent \\[4,5\\] . In most cases, many sessions are required, and the time needed between sessions is the main factor that makes patients quit the treatment. Therefore, optimal laser tattoo removal in fewer sessions has been consistently investigated. Dermatologists and laser surgeons have been leading the way to developing techniques and methods to remove tattoos in the fastest and safest possible way effectively.\n\n【12】Acoustic Shock Wave Therapy has been recently described to be an adjuvant in enhancing tattoo clearance by increasing lymphatic drainage and increasing metabolic activity in the treated area, thereby accelerating the clearance of dermal pigment vacuoles produced by picosecond and Q-switched lasers \\[6,7\\] .\n\n【13】We present a case series of 4 patients successfully treated with combined sessions of a 1064 nm Nd: YAG picosecond laser (Discovery Pico, Quanta System, Milan, Italy) and acoustic show wave therapy (X-Wave, BTL Aesthetics, Czech Republic) for accelerated tattoo removal, without major side effects.\n\n【14】Case Presentations\n------------------\n\n【15】Case 1: A 38-year-old woman came to our clinic with a professional monochromatic black tattoo of 15 years of evolution on the right side of her buttock. To this date, she has not received previous treatments for tattoo removal. A test was performed on a small area for evaluating the skin reaction. The lesion was treated with three combined sessions of 1064 nm Nd: YAG Picosecond laser and Acoustic Shock Wave one month apart. The following parameters were used: 1064 nm wavelength, 3 J/cm <sup><span>2 </span></sup> , spot size 3 mm, 450 picoseconds, 10 Hz, two passes, one focused and one defocused, followed immediately by two passes of acoustic shock wave 2.2 Bar, 14 Hz, 2400 shots in total. Any discomfort was reduced with contact cooling. The patient reported minor side effects and described a significant analgesic effect during the use of the acoustic shock wave. One month after the last session, we could observe a remarkable fading of the tattoo (Figure 1) .\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】Case 2: A 35-year-old woman had a large professional polychromatic black/grey and yellow tattoo of 5 years on her right shoulder. She had not received previous tattoo removal treatments. The lesion was treated with two monthly combined sessions of Picosecond laser and Acoustic Shock Wave with the following parameters: 1064 nm wavelength, 3 J/cm <sup><span>2 </span></sup> , spot size 3 mm, 450 picoseconds, 10 Hz, two passes, one focused and one defocused on the black and grey ink and 532 nm wavelength, 1.3 J/cm <sup><span>2 </span></sup> , spot size 3 mm, 370 picoseconds, 10 Hz, one pass, focused on the yellow ink. Immediately after, we applied two acoustic shock wave therapy passes with the following parameters: 2 Bar, 14 Hz, 1000 total shots. Any discomfort was reduced with contact cooling. The patient did not refer to any significant side effects. One month after two sessions, the lesion had almost completely disappeared. The patient was satisfied with these results and decided to stop the treatment (Figure 2) .\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】Case 3: A 33-year-old woman came to our clinic with a professional monochromatic black tattoo of 3 years of evolution on her anterior right forearm. She had not received previous treatments. The tattoo was treated with three combined Picosecond laser and Acoustic Shock Wave sessions one month apart. The following parameters were used: 1064 nm wavelength, 3.5 J/cm <sup><span>2 </span></sup> , spot size 3 mm, 450 picoseconds, 10 Hz, two passes, one focused and one defocused, followed immediately by two passes of acoustic shock wave 2 Bar, 14 Hz, 1200 shots in total. The patient reported minor side effects and referred to a significant analgesic effect during the use of the acoustic shock wave. However, after one month of the last session, the lesion presented significant tattoo fading (Figure 3) .\n\n【20】  \n\n【21】Case 4: A 28-year-old female patient came to our clinic to remove a monochromatic red tattoo of 3 years of evolution on the left side of her anterior thigh. She had not received previous treatments. The lesion was treated with one single combined session with the following parameters: 694 nm wavelength, 3.6 J/cm <sup><span>2 </span></sup> , Spot size 3 mm, 30 nanoseconds, 3 Hz, one pass, focused, followed by 532 nm wavelength, 1.3 J/cm <sup><span>2 </span></sup> , Spot size 3 mm, 370 picoseconds, 10 Hz, one pass, focused. Immediately after the laser treatment, we applied two acoustic shock wave therapy passes with the following parameters: 2.4 Bar, 14 Hz, 2200 total shots. The patient did not report side effects and noticed an analgesic effect during acoustic shock wave therapy. She came to her follow-up appointment one month after the session. The lesion had almost completely disappeared, and the patient was very satisfied with the results and decided to discontinue the treatment (Figure 4) .\n\n【22】  \n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Since the elucidation of the concept of selective photothermolysis \\[8\\] , quality-switched lasers have been considered the gold standard for laser tattoo removal. The laser tattoo removal process results from selective photothermolysis and a photoacoustic effect to produce targeted destruction of tattoo pigment. Although these lasers effectively clear tattoos and have a good safety profile, certain limitations exist while targeting the exogenous pigment \\[9\\] . Incomplete clearance, long total treatment duration with the large interval between sessions, ink retention despite multiple sessions, treatment-associated side effects such as blistering and dyschromia are the main factors that limit the efficacy of laser tattoo removal \\[9\\] . The particles of black and colored tattoos in the skin may show various particle structures and sizes that influence any interaction with light. In particular, when heated up by laser radiation, such variations may lead to different fragmentation mechanisms and efficacies \\[10\\] .\n\n【25】In order to reduce the number of sessions needed and shorten the total duration of treatment time, different techniques were developed.\n\n【26】The R20 method of tattoo removal is based on the principle of repeated exposure of laser light in a single session. Kossida et al. used a novel technique in which they delivered four laser passes in a single session after waiting for 20 min between each pass \\[11\\] . The mechanism of action of this method is not well known. However, it was postulated that additional laser passes could penetrate deeper into the dermis after the subsidence of frosting, thus targeting more tattoo pigment. It could also fragment tattoo ink into smaller pieces, thus allowing faster clearance by macrophages \\[9\\] .\n\n【27】Another method to increase the efficacy of laser tattoo removal was proposed by Reddy et al., who reported the use of perfluorodecalin to reduce the frosting immediately to apply laser in quick succession without waiting for 20 min (R0 Method) \\[12\\] .\n\n【28】Picosecond lasers have been developed, potentially offering better targeting chromophores with less damage to surrounding tissue \\[13\\] . By narrowing down the pulse duration, the peak energy of the laser beam becomes very high. Theoretical considerations assumed that pulse durations shorter than nanoseconds allow even more effective fragmentation of tattoo particles \\[13\\] . In addition, the lymphatic elimination of these finer particles is assumed to be easier, resulting in faster clearing of tattoos \\[9\\] .\n\n【29】Tattoo treatment using a combination of pulsed Er: YAG or ultra pulsed CO2 with QS Nd: YAG, also known as rapid tattoo removal technique (RTR), has been suggested to require fewer sessions compared to QS Nd: YAG laser monotherapy \\[14\\] . Besides that, a case series on a combination of QS with fractional lasers also showed improved tattoo clearance and reduced incidence of side effects compared to QS alone \\[15\\] .\n\n【30】More recently, Acoustic Shock Wave Therapy (ASWT) has been described to be an adjuvant in enhancing tattoo clearance. ASWT is the application of mechanically generated external sound waves \\[7\\] . The biological effects of ASWT are mediated by an increase in mediators such as vascular endothelial growth factor, which increases local blood circulation \\[16–18\\] . In addition, repeated use stimulates angiogenesis and remodeling of collagen fibers \\[17\\] .\n\n【31】In a prospective clinical trial, Kaminer et al. demonstrated that the combination of an ASWT applied for 1 minute after a single Q-switched laser tattoo removal treatment dissipates the laser whitening and allows for additional laser passes. Enabling multiple Q-switched laser passes resulted in a statistically significant increase in tattoo fading in a single office laser tattoo removal session compared to the clinical standard single-pass Q-switched laser tattoo removal session. The authors conclude that with ASWT vacuole clearing, the loss of laser efficacy due to optical scattering is minimized, which results in more effective multi‐pass Q-switched laser tattoo removal in a single office treatment session \\[6\\] .\n\n【32】Vangipuram et al. reported accelerated tattoo removal with ASWT in conjunction with a picosecond laser and perfluorodecalin patch. The authors presented a case of 80% tattoo clearance with acoustic shock wave therapy in a patient with a 6-year-old professional black tattoo compared with 60% clearance with the picosecond 1064 nm Nd: YAG laser and perfluorodecalin patch alone. They hypothesize that acoustic shock wave therapy may enhance tattoo clearance by increasing lymphatic drainage and increasing metabolic activity in the treated area, thereby accelerating the clearance of dermal pigment vacuoles produced by the picosecond laser \\[7\\] .\n\n【33】The physical mechanisms for laser-tattoo interactions and the tattoo particle break-up process are still not well understood. To investigate these mechanisms, Ho et al. demonstrate via computer simulations that the laser breaks up tattoo particles mainly utilizing photoacoustic, and for the same amount of laser energy, a shorter pulse is more efficient \\[19\\] . However, these presumptions disregard the second major effect that plays a crucial role in tattoo removal: the transportation of fragmented pigment particles. The transportation of the particle fragments away from the skin into the human body is assumed to cause the fading of the tattoo color. However, this process is relatively unexplored so far \\[13\\] .\n\n【34】The atomic theory of Physicist Ernest Rutherford envisioned the atom as a miniature solar system, with electrons orbiting around a nucleus, much like planets revolving around the sun. This model described the atom as a tiny, dense, positively charged core called the nucleus, in which nearly all the mass is concentrated, around which the light, negative constituents, called electrons, circulate at some distance \\[20\\] .\n\n【35】The photoacoustic effect during laser tattoo removal can be heard when the laser beam aims at the nucleus of the ink particles. As the time exposure to the radiated energy progresses, it is possible to listen to how this sound becomes weaker, meaning that the photoacoustic effect is reduced. ASWT breaks this electromagnetic field created around the ink particles and allows the photoacoustic effect to occur again. Therefore, this permits the laser to continue the micronization of the ink particles on site. This effect can be observed under dermoscopy (Figure 5) .\n\n【36】  \n\n【37】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【38】Acoustic Shock Wave Therapy is a safe and novel adjuvant therapy that may enhance and accelerate picosecond laser tattoo removal of both monochromatic and polychromatic tattoos. This combination approach may reduce the total number of sessions required and the waiting time in between sessions, leading to improved convenience and efficiency and increased satisfaction for both patients and clinicians. Following the reviewed literature, we believe that ASWT may improve tattoo clearance by increasing lymphatic drainage and increasing metabolic activity in the treated area, thereby accelerating the clearance of dermal pigment vacuoles. Also, we suggest that ASWT break the electromagnetic field created around the tattoo ink particles during laser treatment and allow the photoacoustic effect to occur again. In our four cases, an analgesic effect of the ASWT was observed. Further studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this combination treatment approach for tattoo removal.\n\n【39】Conflict of Interests\n---------------------\n\n【40】None of the authors has financial conflict of interest related to this manuscript.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccrj_case", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In most cases, this condition results in fast deterioration of the patient’s heath involving multiple organ systems, raised inflammatory markers, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Our 10-year-old male patient presented at first with an illness suggestive of viral gastroenteritis. He had a history of COVID-19 exposure but did not meet the criteria for diagnosis of MIS-C. However, he was admitted to the hospital a month later due to hypovolemic shock, meeting MIS-C criteria. Therefore, our case aims to highlight the importance of maintaining a high degree of suspicion for MIS-C and close monitoring for deterioration of patients with a history of COVID-19 infection and gastrointestinal symptoms, knowing that early detection is key to treatment in most developing countries.  \n\n【7】Introduction\n------------\n\n【8】Most children affected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Therefore, only about 5%–10% of these children are hospitalized due to the severity of their symptoms \\[1\\] . This case report addresses one of these causes, temporally related to COVID-19 infection, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).\n\n【9】WHO defines MIS-C as \\[2\\] .\n\n【10】1.  For ages 0 year–19 years with fever > 3 days and two of the following:\n2.  Rash or conjunctivitis or mucocutaneous inflammation signs.\n3.  Hypotension or shock.\n4.  Features of myocardial dysfunction, pericarditis, valvulitis, or coronary abnormalities.\n5.  Evidence of coagulopathy (by PT, PTT, and elevated D-dimers).\n6.  Acute gastrointestinal problems.\n\n【11】Elevated inflammatory markers.\n\n【12】No other obvious microbial cause of inflammation.\n\n【13】Evidence of COVID-19 or likely contact with patients with COVID-19.\n\n【14】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】Our 10-year-old male patient presented with fever, large volume diarrhea, and colicky abdominal pain in the last seven days. His blood cell counts and inflammatory markers were in the normal range. Stool studies did not indicate any abnormalities. He tested negative for a nasopharyngeal swab test for COVID-19. However, he had been treated for COVID-19 infection a month back as a contact of positively tested parents. His inflammatory markers had been raised at that time.\n\n【16】Along with abdominal symptoms, he was also diagnosed with having mild right-sided pleural effusion on ultrasound. Hence suspicion of tuberculosis was considered but ruled out after a negative MTB TrueNAT Rif test.\n\n【17】On ileocolonoscopy, mild nodularity was seen in the colon, suggestive of Crohn’s disease, but with the absence of granulomas on biopsy and negative ASCA antibodies and ANCA biomarkers, diagnosis of Inflammatory bowel disease was ruled out. The patient’s ileal biopsy showed crypt atrophy, inflammatory destruction of crypt glands, and mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate in lamina propria, suggestive of celiac disease, but the possibility was made unlikely by a negative tissue transglutaminase IgA test.\n\n【18】Thus, the patient was treated as a case of possible infectious gastroenteritis with IV fluids, antibiotics, antiemetics, and antacids for two days and discharged in stable condition.\n\n【19】One month later, he presented to the hospital in hypovolemic shock and required ventilatory support (Table) . At this time, there was a rise in inflammatory markers (CRP: 44, IL-6: 70.3 pg/ml, D-Dimer: 447.8 ng/ml), lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and persistence of previous symptoms.\n\n【20】  \n\n【21】With the presence of multisystem involvement and raised inflammatory markers, attention was shifted to the possibility of MIS-C. This was unusual as MIS-C is noted to occur 4 weeks–6 weeks after a COVID-19 infection, unlike in our patient who presented two months after a history of contact \\[1\\] . He tested positive for the COVID-19 antibody, making the diagnosis likely \\[1\\] .\n\n【22】Treatment: The patient was treated with plenty of IV fluids, IVIG, and IV methylprednisolone \\[3\\] . He responded well to the IVIG and steroid treatment and was afebrile within 48 hours. His inflammatory markers decreased gradually, and ten days later, he was discharged. He was advised of regular outpatient follow-up for the next two weeks. His inflammatory marker levels receded to baseline, and his Echocardiogram results showed normal heart function.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】MIS-C diagnoses post COVID-19 infection emerged in the summer of 2020, with several case reports of children exhibiting a condition suggestive of Kawasaki’s disease or toxic shock syndrome. It was suggested that an immune response produced in children post COVID-19 infection ultimately led to systemic involvement and not a direct cellular injury by the virus itself. This is supported by the effectiveness of immunosuppressants in treating the condition \\[4\\] .\n\n【25】Although a patient of MIS-C may exhibit a range of symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms are more commonly observed than others. Gastrointestinal manifestations are now known to be present in almost 50% of patients of MIS-C \\[5\\] , most of which consist of abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, similar to our patient. This is because SARS-Cov-2 can infect enterocytes by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme two receptors, causing gastrointestinal symptoms \\[5\\] . Toubiana et al., in their study of 21 patients of Kawasaki, like multisystem inflammatory syndrome post-COVID-19 infection, reported that all of their patients had early gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting \\[6\\] .\n\n【26】This patient’s second admission and subsequent complication could have been avoided by keeping a high index of suspicion for MIS-C in a case of persistent diarrhea with a history of COVID-19 infection/ close contact, especially in view of a history of raised inflammatory markers \\[1\\] . These cases are rare but severe, which should require cases of prior COVID-19 infection and gastrointestinal symptoms to be monitored for deterioration after supportive treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms. Once MIS-C presentation sets in, patients’ symptoms often worsen quickly, and they require intubation and ventilatory support, equipment that is not easily available outside of large cities in developing countries. Therefore, a high index of suspicion for MIS-C is the need of the hour, especially in the presence of rising COVID-19 cases. This will facilitate early detection in low-level and mid-level income countries and lead to a favorable prognosis.\n\n【27】Important Points\n----------------\n\n【28】*   A study done by Natasha et al. determined that 84% of all children diagnosed with MIS-C had gastrointestinal symptoms. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32630212/\n*   The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was associated with a high incidence of a severe form of Kawasaki disease.

The laboratory analysis identified _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ in the ocular secretion, and treatment with third-generation cephalosporin was administered, with a favorable outcome. During the infant’s hospitalization, her mother was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease.\n\n【7】Gonococcal conjunctivitis generally affects newborns up to seven days old. Therefore, all the cases diagnosed out of this age range should raise suspicion of sexual abuse. However, the non-sexual transmission may also occur, such as accidental contact of the bacteria with the infant’s eyes due to poor hygiene.\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Gonococcal conjunctivitis is a severe hyperacute conjunctivitis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( N. gonorrhoeae ) and manifests as conjunctival hyperemia, abundant purulent secretion, palpebral edema, keratitis, corneal ulceration, and may lead to the severe corneal lesion with loss of visual acuity, requiring corneal transplantation in some cases \\[1,2\\] . In addition, in the initial phase of the infection, it can mimic periorbital cellulitis, which might delay the correct diagnosis, investigation, and treatment since the culture of ocular secretion is not routinely performed in periorbital cellulitis cases \\[3\\] .\n\n【10】N. gonorrhoeae is an aerobic immobile intra-cellular Gran-negative diplococcus, unable to produce spores \\[1,2\\] . It cannot tolerate dry environments and can be cultured with temperatures around 25 Cº to 37 Cº and a slightly basic (pH 7.2 to 7.6) microbiological culture medium, much like Thayer-Martin TM \\[1,2\\] .\n\n【11】The literature suggests that in all the cases when a sexually transmitted agent is diagnosed in a child, the suspicion of sexual abuse must be investigated \\[4\\] . This case report aims to describe the case of an infant with gonococcal conjunctivitis, which was not caused by sexual abuse, and to emphasize the possibility of other forms of transmission.\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】An eighteen-month-old female infant was taken to the Emergency Care Unit, presenting a one-day history of edema in the left eyelid, hyperemia, and copious purulent secretion in the left eye. The girl had a good general condition, and there was no fever or other symptoms related to the main complaint. However, she used to sleep in the same bed as her parents, and her mother reported genital secretion in both, which did not respond to the treatments previously prescribed in the Basic Care Unit.\n\n【14】The ophthalmology team of the University Hospital performed a bacterioscopy of the ocular secretion of the infant, revealing a great amount of Gram-negative intracellular diplococci. The patient was immediately submitted to hospitalization and serological tests for sexually transmitted diseases (HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and Syphilis), all returned negative results. The treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/day) was performed for seven days and oral azithromycin (20 mg/kg/day) for one day, with a favorable outcome. The culture of the ocular secretion confirmed the presence of N. gonorrhoeae sensitive to ceftriaxone.\n\n【15】During the infant’s hospitalization, her mother presented with a fever and severe pelvic pain. The gynecology team of the University Hospital diagnosed her with pelvic inflammatory disease. Consequently, the doctors prescribed her doxycycline and metronidazole, and for her husband, they prescribed ciprofloxacin.\n\n【16】Discussion\n----------\n\n【17】Pediatric gonococcal conjunctivitis usually occurs in newborns less than seven days old (ophthalmia neonatorum), caused by direct inoculation of the bacteria during the labor of infected parturients. However, the disease might also occur in older infants whose eyes were somehow exposed to infected secretion \\[1,5\\] . Determining the source of the gonococcal infection is imperative in children and infants since the most frequent form of transmission is sexual abuse. Therefore, the hypothesis of sexual abuse must always be considered \\[4–6\\] . However, the literature describes some non-sexual mechanisms of transmission of N. gonorrhoeae , such as the community use of towels, sharing of intimate clothing and bathtubs, interpersonal contact with contaminated hands of caregivers, and bed sharing with disease carriers, as demonstrated in orphanages outbreaks of gonococcal infection \\[2\\] .\n\n【18】The non-sexual transmission of N. gonorrhoeae is possible because of its ability to survive in humid environments within a temperature range from 25 Cº to 37 Cº degrees. Therefore, a wet towel containing contaminated secretion, kept at room temperature, may carry viable N. gonorrhoeae for about 24 hours. Other materials, such as glass, plastic, cellophane, wood cardboard, paper, swab, gauze, and cotton, are also capable of preserving viable N. gonorrhoeae strings in their surfaces, and one study has proved that those strings were recoverable from those fomites \\[2\\] .\n\n【19】Once gonococcal conjunctivitis is diagnosed in a pediatric patient, the literature recommends hospitalization and intravenous treatment with ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/day) for seven days in cases where there is a suspect of disseminated infection and with a prescription of azithromycin (20 mg/kg, single dose) in the cases where the possibility of coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis exists \\[1\\] . In the aforementioned case, both antibiotics were used since the source of the infant’s infection was probably her mother, who was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease. Ocular hygiene with saline solution is recommended during the treatment in order to remove the ocular secretion, and no further local treatment is considered necessary \\[1\\] .\n\n【20】In conclusion, gonococcal conjunctivitis outbreaks, accidental inoculations, and the recovery of N. gonorrhoeae strings from infected fomites are strong evidence that the non-sexual transmission of gonococcus can occur \\[2,6\\] . Therefore, that possibility must be considered when a gonococcal infection is diagnosed in a pediatric patient after the hypothesis of sexual abuse is discharged, avoiding psychological and social damage to all the individuals involved.\n\n【21】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【22】The authors recognize the great contribution of the Ophthalmology and Gynecology teams to the favorable outcome of the patient described in this case report.  \n\n【23】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【24】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Myeloperoxidase-antibody-associated glomerulonephritis is a type of glomerulonephritis characterized as a pauci-immune type of necrotizing and crescentic GN. We report two patients who developed ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis shortly after a COVID-19 infection. Both patients, previously healthy and not known with autoimmune diseases, presented with an acute kidney injury after a COVID-19 infection. Lab results revealed a high anti-MPO titer and significant proteinuria. Renal biopsy was consistent with pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, and induction therapy with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide was started. There was a favorable evolution with complete recovery of renal function in the first patient and partial recovery in the second. Recent literature suggests an association between SARS-CoV2 and anti-MPO vasculitis based on the underlying pathogenesis. Therefore, a renal biopsy can play an essential role in differentiating the mechanism of COVID-19-associated kidney injury.\n\n【7】Introduction\n------------\n\n【8】Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, there have been more than 500,000,000 confirmed cases, including 6,250,000 deaths \\[1\\] . Although pulmonary impairment is the most prevalent manifestation, the COVID-19 cytokine storm is known to affect multiple organs, including the kidneys \\[2\\] . Large observational studies revealed an incidence of up to 40% in hospitalized patients \\[3\\] . The pathophysiology of renal involvement is of high complexity \\[4\\] . Besides the indirect influences of hemodynamic changes and hypoxemia in the critical ill, direct changes such as cytokine release, endothelial injury, and activation of coagulation play important roles. Binding partners for the virus on the renal tubular cells have been described, but the role of renal viral tropism remains uncertain \\[4–6\\] . Renal biopsies learned that acute tubular injury is the most prevalent form of kidney damage in COVID-19, followed by a specific form of glomerular lesions in the population with APOL1 variant alleles, being a collapsing glomerulopathy \\[4,6\\] .\n\n【9】In addition, it is well known that some viruses play a role in vasculitis (called secondary vasculitis). However, to the best of our knowledge, only a handful of cases have been described of COVID-19 induced crescent glomerulonephritis worldwide \\[7–14\\] . Here, we describe two cases of COVID-19-induced ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Case 1: A 70-year-old woman was referred because of an acute kidney injury in the absence of symptoms. The serum creatinine at that moment was 2.2 mg/dl with an eGFR of 22 ml/min (CKD-EPI), whereas the month before, there was a normal serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dl with an eGFR of 68 ml/min (CKD-EPI). Subsequent urinary analysis revealed proteinuria of 2.05 g/g creatinine and positive sediment with leukocyturia (49/µl) and hematuria (615/µl).\n\n【12】Her medical history was brief, with a herpes zoster infection in 2021, SARS-CoV 2 infection two months before presentation, and pauci-symptomatic without fever or desaturation. In the weeks following her COVID-19 infection, there was increased fatigue, dyspnea, and anorexia. She lost 5 kg unintentionally, despite a good fluid intake of 1.5 L/day.\n\n【13】Medication was limited to the occasional use of Acetaminophen. There was no use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n【14】At the time of the first presentation at our clinic, the patient was completely asymptomatic. On examination, blood pressure was significantly elevated (160/111 mmHg), with a heart rate of 90/min. The patient appeared euvolemic without clinical signs of dehydration. Heart and lung auscultation were normal, and there was an absence of edema or skin rash.\n\n【15】A diagnostic work-up with an echography of the kidneys and renal vasculature proved reassuring, with a normal bipolar diameter of 12 cm and normal vascular flow. A urinary sample revealed proteinuria of 2.7 (P/C ratio) with positive sediment. Protein electrophoresis on the urine and blood was normal. Viral serology for hepatitis B, C, and HIV was negative. The other lab values were reassuring without signs of inflammation (no leukocytosis, CRP 5 mg/l) (Table 1) . ANCA-antibodies were positive with a high titer for anti-myeloperoxidase (anti-MPO antibodies).\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】A renal biopsy was performed, which showed crescentic pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, consistent with acute ANCA-mediated glomerulonephritis (Figure) .\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】Combination therapy with methyl-prednisolone and cyclophosphamide was started.\n\n【20】There was a favorable evolution with complete recovery of renal function (serum creatinine < 1 mg/dl) and disappearance of proteinuria.\n\n【21】Case 2: A 90-year-old patient was hospitalized for three days at the end of March 2022 because of a fever. There was some flank pain and moderate shortness of breath. She had no chest pain or palpitations. There was no dysuria. There was no skin rash or arthralgia. Her intake was preserved. Her medical history was limited for her age: a radical hysterectomy in 1974, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and an occluded Posterior Descending Coronary Artery (PDA).\n\n【22】On first examination, the patient had marked arterial hypertension of 170/80 mmHg with preserved oxygen saturation at rest (97% at ambient air). On auscultation, the patient had crepitations right basally, and there were bilateral pitting edemas. Chest radiography revealed moderate pulmonary congestion. SARS-CoV-2 Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasal swab was positive.\n\n【23】There was a significant amount of inflammation with a CRP of 107 mg/l and an increased sedimentation of 42 mm/h. The serum creatinine was elevated (2.1 mg/dl, compared with a baseline value of 1.05 mg/dl) with no electrolyte abnormalities (Table 1) . Urinary examination revealed important hematuria (363/µl) and leukocyturia (508/µl) with proteinuria of 2.2 g (P/C ratio). Urine culture was positive for Escherichia coli .\n\n【24】The diagnoses of a urinary tract infection with E. coli , a SARS-CoV2 infection, and an acute kidney injury were made. Despite antibiotic treatment (Levofloxacin) and intravenous fluid, there was an increase in inflammatory markers and a decrease in kidney function (Table 1) . The echography of the kidney was reassuring. An autoimmune screening was performed. There was a sharply increased titer for anti-MPO antibodies (ANCA). The tentative diagnosis of MPO-associated glomerulonephritis was made.\n\n【25】Because of the age and severe arterial hypertension, we decided not to perform a renal biopsy. Corticosteroids and Cyclophosphamide were started.\n\n【26】The immunosuppressive therapy had to be reduced due to side effects. We saw only a partial recovery of renal function.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】We present two cases of myeloperoxidase-antibody-associated crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN). One patient developed the GN during her COVID-19 infection, and the other patient after a latent period of 7 weeks. Both patients were not known with autoimmune diseases prior to their Covid-infection.\n\n【29】Last year, Ferlicot et al. released a multicentric retrospective case series of 47 kidney biopsies in Covid-associated acute kidney injury. A prevalent form of glomerular injury (36%) was collapsing glomerulopathy, in this context designated as ‘COVAN’ \\[6,15,16\\] . Similar results were found by Akilesh et. al \\[5,17\\] . No pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis was observed in those trials.\n\n【30】Nevertheless, a recent series of case reports described vasculitis-associated glomerulonephritis during/ after a recent COVID-19 infection (Table 2) . The question arises whether there’s a true causal association. Considering the high incidence of COVID-19 between 2020 and the present (14-day incidence of COVID-19 at the time of writing was 1156/100 000 p.) \\[18\\] , a coincident association is possible.\n\n【31】  \n\n【32】However, we suspect that causality might be the case when we take a deeper look at the underlying pathogenesis. It’s known that SARS-CoV-2 can provoke a cytokine storm, which dysregulates the adaptive immune system and increases the risk of auto-antibodies formations.\n\n【33】Becker et al. recently reviewed the immune function of microvascular endothelial cells and their response to COVID-19 injury. They showed a direct toxic effect of cytokines resulting in endothelial cell injury and neutrophil activation \\[19\\] . In COVID-19, the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) is increased and correlates directly with the severity of COVID-19. Neutrophils can produce extracellular traps (NETs), which play a central role in the immune response to COVID-19. As recently reviewed by Al-Kuraishy et al. SARS-CoV-2 can trigger the formation of NETs by cytokine release, ROS formation, and downregulation of ACE2, which inhibits neutrophil infiltration \\[20\\] . Myeloperoxidase is part of those NETs \\[19,20\\] . It’s presumed that NETs serve as a source of autoantigens presenting MPO to the immune system in genetically susceptible individuals. Multiple autoimmune disorders provoked by COVID-19 or vaccines have been described, as reported by Kronbichler et al. \\[21\\] .\n\n【34】In our patients, induction therapy with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide was preferred over rituximab because of the additional risk of the latter, as described in the literature \\[22\\] . However, despite the possible additional risk, the importance of adequate immunosuppressive therapy has been stated by Bruchfeld et al. \\[22\\] .\n\n【35】The two cases (along with a recent series of case reports) demonstrate the importance of further investigations into a COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury. If an underlying glomerulonephritis is suspected, a renal biopsy can be an important diagnostic tool to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and initiate correct therapy.\n\n【36】More (fundamental) research is required to explore the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and glomerulonephritis further.\n\n【37】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【38】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

The neurological examination objected to a flaccid muscle deficiency of the four limbs. Medullar MRI showed a hyperintensity on T2 from C2 to D2 with “Snake eye” in the axial view. The diagnosis of medullary ischemia was held. The patient was treated with Aspegic, and then she had discrete improvement (MRC testing = 1/5 in all limbs). Two months later, the appearance of a bilateral decrease of the visual acuity was more marked on the right side. An ophthalmological examination showed a severe decrease in visual acuity (right side = 4/10 and left side = 6/10). A VEP test objectified a bilateral retrobulbar demyelinating optic neuropathy.\n\n【8】(RABON). The diagnosis of NMOSD without AQP4-IgG was made according to the new criteria.

The evolution was marked with a clear improvement (Recovery of visual acuity and partial recovery of the motor force MRC testing = 4/5).\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO), or Devic’s disease, is a demyelinating disease affecting the Central Nervous System (CNS), predominantly the spinal cord and the optic nerves. Recently, the NMO concept was expanded into ‘NMO spectrum disorder’(NMOSD). When MRI reveals a longitudinally extensive cord lesion, the main diagnostics are acute transverse myelitis versus spinal cord ischemia \\[1\\] . It should not be forgotten that myelitis in NMSD can be abrupt onset \\[2\\] . The diagnosis of NMOSD is sometimes difficult due to several clinical and/or radiological features.  \n\n【11】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 17-year-old woman, without any history, presented on March 17, 2017 brutal tetraplegia with vesical sphincteric disorders. Two hours after the symptoms, the neurological examination objected to a flaccid muscle deficiency of the four limbs (medical research council (MRC) testing = 0/5 in all limbs) with C2–C3 sensory level and bilateral posterior cord syndrome. Medullar MRI, sagittal T2 weighted imaging showed a hyperintensity from C2 to D2 with “Snake eye” in the axial view (Figure A) , without enhancement in the T1 weighted imaging with gadolinium. Cerebral MRI was normal. The diagnosis of medullary ischemia was held in front of the sudden onset and the attack of the medullary gray matter in the axial view T1 weighted (Figure B) . Paraclinical explorations (cardiac echocardiography, angiography of the supra-aortic trunk, Thoracic CT with Contrast Injection, dosage of protein S, C, AT III , Homocysteine, Leiden Factor V and MTHFR mutation; CMV, EBV, VZV, Rubella, HSV1 and 2, VHB, VHC, HIV, syphilis, mycoplasma, NMO-IgG/aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody in the blood and CSF; SSA, SSB, nuclear, CCP, anti-endomysium, anti-transglutaminase anti-gliadin antibodies) was normal. Lumbar puncture was normal. The patient was treated with Aspegic.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Two months after, the appearance of bilateral decrease of the visual acuity. An ophthalmological examination showed a visual acuity (on the right = 4/10, on the left = 6/10). A VEP test objectified a bilateral retrobulbar demyelinating optic neuropathy. The diagnosis of NMOSD without AQP4-IgG was made according to the new criteria \\[3\\] . The patient was treated with methylprednisone one g/day for five days relayed with oral prednisone 1 mg/Kg/J for 30 days and Azathioprine 2 mg/kg/d. The evolution was marked with visual acuity recovery and partial motor force recovery (MRC testing = 4/5). However, she kept urinary incontinence.  \n\n【15】Discussion\n----------\n\n【16】Spinal cord infarction (SCI) is the first diagnosis to evoke in front of hyperacute muscle deficiency and severe radicular pain at onset \\[1\\] . That is why we considered this diagnostic in the beginning. Due to bilateral retrobulbar demyelinating optic neuropathy, NMOSD without AQP4-IgG was our diagnostic according to the new criteria. MRI is characterized by hyperintensity on T2-weighted sequences and by hypointensity on T1-weighted sequences more frequently in the cervical and the upper thoracic spinal cord segments with preferential involvement of the central gray matter \\[4\\] . These findings were also found in our case (Figure) . However, in some cases, it is challenging to distinguish SCI from spinal cord lesions found in NMOSD. Vascular ischemic lesions occurred in areas with poor collateral circulation as mid-thoracic cord and CONUS and were not seen in the upper cervical cord \\[1\\] . In contrast, spinal cord lesions found in NMO tended to cluster around ‘junctions,’ particularly the cervicomedullary and cervicothoracic junctions, because of important collateral circulation. Classic radiographic feature of SCI as “Owl eyes” (or “Snake eye”) appearance was common in NMO as SCI \\[1\\] .\n\n【17】Our patient was treated according to the protocol mentioned by Xu and al, with a clear improvement \\[5\\] .\n\n【18】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【19】It is necessary to evoke an NMOSD in front of any table of myelitis with brutal installation to institute an adequate treatment quickly and avoid the accumulation of the handicap after that.  \n\n【20】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【21】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  Informed consent was obtained for this publication.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccrj_case", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However, SFTs have been reported at any anatomical site. Solitary fibrous tumors occurred in patients over a wide age range with a median age of 60 years. Most SFTs have an indolent course, but 11% to 22% of the SFTs show a more aggressive behavior with distant metastasis and malignant transformation.\n\n【7】Here, we report a rare clinical presentation of a benign SFT in the right breast in a relatively young woman. We described the clinical, radiographic, histopathological, and immunohistochemical findings. Furthermore, we provide a brief literature review on differential diagnosis, prognostic factors, and treatment of SFTs.\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】A Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT) is a rare fibroblastic mesenchymal neoplasm. SFTs are characterized by haphazardly arranged spindled cells. The differential diagnosis of spindle cell lesions includes inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, nodular fasciitis, fibromatosis, reactive spindle cell nodule, leiomyoma, spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma, and myoepithelioma. Although SFTs occur most commonly in the visceral pleura, several anatomical sites of involvement have been reported.\n\n【10】This report described the clinical, radiographic, histopathological, and immunohistochemical findings of a 42-year-old woman with a mammary SFT. Only 30 cases of mammary SFTs have been described so far. Furthermore, we provide a brief literature review on differential diagnosis, prognostic factors, and treatment of SFTs.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 42-year-old woman with no medical history attended the outpatient clinic in February 2021. She recently discovered a palpable nodule in her left breast. A painless, firm, and mobile mass originating from above the nipple-areolar complex in the left breast measuring 1.5 cm in diameter was noted on physical examination and was highly suspect for a fibroadenoma. There were no palpable abnormalities in the right breast. Besides the palpable mass of the left breast, ultrasound examination and mammography also showed a mass measuring 3.6 cm in the medial inner quadrant of the right breast (Figure 1,Figure 2) (assessed as BI-RADS 3). The magnetic resonance imaging findings found a malignant mass with fast contrast enhancement. The mass was assessed as BI-RADS 5 (Figure 3) .\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Image-guided core needle biopsy of both masses was performed. The histologic diagnosis of the mass in the left breast favored a fibroadenoma. The histologic findings of the mass in the right breast showed hypercellular tissue built out of lumpish cells without any recognizable structure (Figure 4) . The cells showed no atypical nuclei or mitotic activity (Figure 5) . The immunophenotype was as follows: few weak enhancing nuclei in the endoplasmic reticulum, positive for CD34, RB1, and STAT6, negative for SMA, P63, calponin, CK5, CK14, S100, CD31 (expect the small vessels) and desmin. Based on the morphology, together with the strong nuclear STAT6 immunostaining (Figure 6) , a solitary fibrous tumor was diagnosed. Consideration was also given to a possible diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma, but there would be more mitotic activity and atypia in that case.\n\n【15】  \n\n【16】Computed tomography of the thorax was negative for lymph adenopathy and showed no signs of pulmonary metastases. Wide excision of the mass was performed. The final pathologic assessment confirmed the diagnosis of a (low-risk) SFT. Therefore, adjuvant therapy was not indicated. A follow-up by mammography 3 months and 7 months after surgical excision showed no recurrence in the right breast.\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】SFT is a rare fibroblastic mesenchymal neoplasm that most often arises from the visceral pleura. However, SFTs may occur at any anatomical site, including superficial and deep soft tissues and within visceral organs and bone (see Table 1) \\[1\\] . Although SFTs mostly emerge in the fifth to seventh decades, they may arise at any age.\n\n【19】  \n\n【20】Literature research in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Pubmed was performed. The search terms solitary fibrous tumor, mamma, and breast were used. A wide range of soft tissue neoplasm must be considered in the differential diagnosis of breast spindles cell lesions, such as an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, nodular fasciitis, fibromatosis, reactive spindle cell nodule, leiomyoma, spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma and myoepithelioma. Microscopically, fibroblasts and connective tissue are organized in a so-called patternless design that is characterized by a random distribution of spindle cells and collagen fibrils \\[2\\] . Immunohistochemistry is a useful tool to differentiate SFT from all these other tumors; (see Table 2) \\[3,4\\] . SFT typically shows a strong and diffuse expression of CD34 and nuclear STAT 6 \\[1,2\\] .\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】Jung et al. presented 2019 an overview of 27 cases of breast SFTs \\[5\\] . To our knowledge, three more case reports have been published since 2019 about SFT in the breast \\[6–8\\] . An overview of these 30 cases can be found in ( Supplementary Table ) . The median size is noted between 7 cm–10 cm, so SFTs of de breast are relatively small (90% < 5 cm). The age range of the patients is between 38 years to 88 years \\[7–19\\] .\n\n【23】This overview showed only 4 cases of breast SFT with a malignant course \\[5,7,8,16\\] . Most SFTs behave in an indolent clinical course; however, 10% to 22% SFTs have a malignant course \\[1\\] . Malignant behavior is characterized as an SFT with distant metastasis or local recurrence. Houdt et al. performed a retrospective analysis of 81 SFT patients who underwent surgical resection to analyze prognostic values, recurrence rate, and metastasis formation \\[17\\] . The local recurrence rate was 29%, with a median time to recurrent disease of 50 months. The metastasis formation was 34%, with a median time of 44 months to metastasis formation. Positive resection margins were the only factor significantly associated with the local recurrence rate \\[20\\] . Houdt et al. found that a high mitotic rate or a tumor size > 10 cm is associated with higher metastasis risk but not with local recurrence rate.  \n\n【24】In 2017 Demicco et al. developed a risk stratification model to predict metastatic risk for SFT incorporating patient age, tumor size, and mitotic activity to predict the risk of metastasis, (see Table 3) \\[21\\] . The case presented was a patient with low metastatic risk. Demicco et al. revealed no metastasis at 10 years in the low-risk group. The intermediate-risk group had only a 10% risk of metastasis at 5 years and 10 years, and the high-risk group had a 73% risk of metastasis at 5 years. However, no data was provided on the metastasis outcome at 10 years in the high-risk group. In fact, limited studies are available on the late recurrence of SFTs \\[22\\] , so prolonged follow-up (> 10 years) may be advisable.\n\n【25】  \n\n【26】Surgery is the first line of treatment for SFT, regardless of the risk profile. With a 10-year survival rate being reported between 54% and 89% after complete en-block surgical resection with clear margins. For the approximately 20%–30% of SFT cases at the limit of resectability, with distant metastasis or local recurrence, options for effective treatment are limited. Chemotherapy has typically been used in the advanced or metastatic setting. However, data on the activity of standard cytotoxic drugs are scarce. Anthracycline-based is the most investigated regimen with reported progression-free survival of 3 months–5 months and objective response rate ranging from 10.5% to 20% \\[23\\] . SFT cases could benefit from neoadjuvant Radiotherapy (RT). Haas et al. conducted a retrospective observational study of 549 SFT patients submitted to surgery alone or surgery plus postoperative RT with a median follow-up of 52 months \\[24\\] . Combining RT with surgery is significantly associated with a reduced risk of local failures after correction for the mitotic count and surgical margins (HR, 0.19: P = 0.029) but not with a longer overall survival (HR, 1.11: P = 0.704).\n\n【27】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【28】In conclusion, we report a rare case of a woman with a Solitary Fibrous Tumor of the breast with a low-grade risk for metastasis in the long term. Management of SFT in the breast should be discussed in a multidisciplinary soft tissue oncology board. Complete surgical resection is the gold standard of treatment, potentially followed with adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy in high-risk patients. Follow-up should be long-term concerning the paucity of recurrence risk studies.  \n\n【29】Declarations\n------------\n\n【30】Author contributions: Aarts F conceived of the presented idea.

The average age at onset of the disease is 42 years. We present a cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma case in a 26-year-old patient with hemophagocytic syndrome and simultaneous cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma manifestations.\n\n【7】Case Presentation: A 26-year-old patient has visited our emergency department several times with an abscess of the anterior abdominal wall. Biopsy of the abscess wall revealed primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma. Therapy started with the CHOEP protocol. Unfortunately, two months later, the patient manifested Hemophagocytic Syndrome (HPS) and cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma with the development of an intracerebral hemorrhage, which was fatal.\n\n【8】Discussion: Primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma (PCGD-TCL) is an aggressive variant of cutaneous lymphoma. The simultaneous development of a central nervous system tumor and hemophagocytic syndrome are rare findings that are commonly fatal. Most patients have a dismal prognosis, even with chemotherapy and radiation. Stem cell transplantation is an increasingly promising option for these patients. The medium survival of patients is 15 months.\n\n【9】Conclusion: PCGD-TCL should be suspected in patients with cutaneous manifestations that persist despite conservative treatment. Physicians who deal with patients with rapidly progressive, nonspecific resistance to therapy should maintain awareness of uncommon forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.\n\n【10】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【11】PCGD-TCL: Primary Cutaneous Gamma-Delta T-cell Lymphoma; HPS: Hemophagocytic Syndrome; DIC: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; CT: Computed Tomography; MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging; WBC: White Blood Cells; HB: Hemoglobin; PLT: Platelet Count; IHC: Immunohistochemistry Test; CNS: Central Nervous System; VEGF: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor; LDH: Lactate Dehydrogenase; FFP: Fresh Frozen Plasma; WHO-EORTC: World Health Organization-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer; CTCL: Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma; PET-CT: Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography  \n\n【12】Introduction\n------------\n\n【13】Primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma (PCGD-TCL) is a highly aggressive tumor defined as a clonal proliferation of mature gamma-delta T-cells with cytotoxic phenotypes \\[1,2\\] . PCGD-TCL has a characteristic immunophenotype (CD3+, CD2+, CD7+/–, beta F1–), where most cells express neither CD4 nor CD8, although in isolated cases, cells may be CD8 positive. This type of lymphoma can exhibit diverse histological patterns, including epidermotropism, dermal or subcutaneous involvement with extremity preference, and aggressive clinical course \\[3\\] .\n\n【14】The average age at the onset of the disease is 42 years \\[4\\] . Only two primary gamma delta T-cell lymphoma cases with hemophagocytic syndrome manifestation have been described \\[5,6\\] . We present a case report with the early onset of PCGD-TCL in a 26-year-old woman with the hemophagocytic syndrome and the simultaneous development of cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma.\n\n【15】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【16】A 26-year-old woman with a medical history of two miscarriages and overweight with complaints of weakness, periodic fever, headaches, and pain in the elbows and knees during the previous month was hospitalized in Emergency Department. An abscess of the anterior abdominal wall with a size 3 cm X 2 cm was incised. The patient was discharged to her home with a prescription for Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for seven days. Two weeks later, she returned with complaints of fever during the last three days, swelling and redness around the incised abscess, muscle pain, and shortness of breath. Examination of the patient revealed: a fever up to 39°C and tachycardia of 112 beats per minute. An abscess appeared on the side of the abdominal wall: fluctuation, edema, and a local increase in temperature around the previous incision. Enlarged lymph nodes in the left groin area were palpable. In blood tests - hemoglobin was 11.2 g/dL, leukopenia - 3.53 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, platelets - 90 X 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, and an increased Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) level to 1383 (U/L). Computed Tomography (CT) abdomen scan revealed splenomegaly with edema of the left anterior abdominal wall with a fluid accumulation, spreading to the left groin without the involvement of the lymphatic system (Figure 1) .\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】An abscess area was incised, and the clear, odorless liquid was extracted. Antibiotic therapy with Cefazolin was started without significant improvement in the clinical course. There was still no improvement after changing the antibiotics to extended-spectrum with Meropenem, Vancomycin, and Doxycycline. The surface of the wound remained with areas of necrosis and edema. Pancytopenia (WBC - 2.44 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, HB - 7.5 g/dL, PLT - 91 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with an increase in the level of LDH to 4000 were noted in blood tests. The growth of microorganisms in the fluid abscess was not detected. Tests for HIV and brucellosis were negative. In the absence of clinical improvement, we suspected a lymphoproliferative disorder. The patient refused a bone marrow biopsy.\n\n【19】Due to the significant deterioration of the patient’s condition and lack of pathological diagnosis, a biopsy of the abscess wall was performed. The immunohistochemistry test (IHC) revealed CD3, CD2, CD5, CD7, CD8, TIA1, Granzyme, and TCR gamma positivity. Ki67 proliferation index was as high as 75%. Diagnosis of primary cutaneous gamma delta T-cell lymphoma was confirmed (Figure 2) .\n\n【20】  \n\n【21】In looking for an extension of cutaneous lymphoma and involvement of the lymphatic system, Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET-CT) was performed, which confirmed the presence of local disease. The patient was transferred to the hematology department, and therapy was started according to the CHOEP protocol (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, and prednisone). Given the high level of ferritin - 25898 ng/ml (normal range 13 ng/ml –150 ng/ml), low-level NK activity -11% (normal range > 20%), fever, splenomegaly, and cytopenias, the patient was diagnosed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Dexamethasone was added to the treatment protocol. Due to the presence of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) and pancytopenia in the patient’s clinical course, she received blood products, including Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), vitamin K, and cryoprecipitate, thrombocytes, and packed cells.\n\n【22】In the following days, the patient complained of headaches and was later found in a stupored state. Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain were performed, where appeared a mass in the left cerebellar hemisphere 33 mm X 24 mm with hemorrhage, obstructive hydrocephalus, and herniation to the tentorial notch was presented (Figure 3) . The patient was transferred to the Neurosurgery Department, where she underwent cranial decompression and resection of the left cerebellar tumor. Morphological examination of removed tissue presented pilocytic astrocytoma with hemorrhage area.\n\n【23】  \n\n【24】CT head examination was repeated, showing repeated bleeding from the tumor region in the posterior cranial fossa. The patient underwent an intracerebral hematoma evacuation with an external ventricular drain insertion. In the postoperative period, the patient developed acute respiratory failure and died. The death occurred two months after the primary presentation of the disease.\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】Primary Cutaneous Gamma-Delta T-Cell Lymphoma (PCGD-TCL) is characterized by a clonal population of T-cells and rearrangement of TCR, which exists physiologically as a heterodimer of either alpha-beta (αβ) or gamma-delta (γδ) receptors \\[7–9\\] . PCGD-TCL accounts for less than 1% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas. It consists of an abnormal clonal proliferation of mature, activated gamma-delta T cells expressing the γδ heterodimer of the TCR. The γδ phenotype is expressed by 5% of circulating T cells and up to 30% of the total number of T cells in some organs, including the skin \\[10\\] . The updated 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification divided PCGD-TCLs into epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous forms based on the location of the neoplastic infiltrate and differences in clinical courses \\[11\\] .\n\n【27】In September 2018 was updated of the World Health Organization-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (WHO-EORTC) classification for primary cutaneous lymphomas and eight various types of Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) were described, including PCGD-TCL \\[12\\] . PCGD-TCL may produce a wide range of clinical manifestations. Occurring primarily in adults, the lesions may be highly variable and range from patches and plaques to deeper subcutaneous nodules progressing to ulceration and necrosis. Extremities are preferentially involved with a relative sparing of the trunk. Systemic symptoms such as fever and night sweats are not rare findings in these patients \\[13,14\\] . This disease is typically confined to the dermis, invades deep subcutaneous areas, or may have systemic involvement (e.g., ocular, adrenal, and lymph node), but rarely invades the central nervous system (CNS) \\[10,15\\] . In the literature described, there were only five cases of cutaneous γδ T-cell lymphoma with CNS manifestations \\[5\\] . Only two patients have been described with brain involvement and died due to disease progression. Accompanying hemophagocytic syndrome was also observed in both cases. The average clinical course from the initial presentation to CNS manifestations was 17.2 months. There were no cases of simultaneous manifestation of cutaneous lymphoma with cerebellar astrocytoma.\n\n【28】In our case, the clinical course was characterized by a simultaneous development of intracerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma within one month from the initial appearance of PCGD-TCL. The described PCGD-TCL phenotype was highly aggressive (Ki67 - 75%). Guitar et al. showed that Granzyme B strongly correlates with a shorter survival time, and TIA-1 is associated with overall mortality \\[5\\] . In this case, both Granzyme and TIA-1 were positive.\n\n【29】Our patient’s disease had a rapid course which clinically was masked as an abscess of the abdominal wall. The patient died two months after the onset of the disease. Histopathologically, the disease was presented with a panniculitis-like pattern. The panniculitis-like pattern of involvement of the subcutaneous fatty tissue raised the possibility of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. However, the cases expressing gamma-delta t-cell receptors according to the WHO Classification of Tumors of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues should be excluded and classified as primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma.\n\n【30】The literature describes a strong relationship between panniculitis-like PCGD-TCL and hemophagocytic syndrome \\[7,16\\] . Hemophagocytic syndrome may be congenital or associated with viral infections or malignancy. The literature mainly describes children with primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis \\[17\\] . In these children, central nervous system involvement is characterized by a histiocytic leptomeningeal and variable tissue infiltration with prominent astrogliosis \\[6\\] . The cause of our patient’s death was likely his neurological decline because of erythrophagocytosis and infiltration of the brain by gamma delta T-cells \\[3,16\\] . Considering the patient’s age, pain in the joints, the presence of miscarriages, and inhibition of three hematopoietic lineages, we do not exclude the presence of concomitant SLE in the patient, which was not diagnosed.\n\n【31】Our patient’s histopathological study of brain involvement discovered an intracerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma. This finding raises a logical question regarding the existence of a natural connection between PCGD-TCL and pilocytic astrocytoma. Hickman and co-authors are the only ones who have described a cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma with the involvement of B lymphoblastic leukemia in the astrocytoma tissue. They speculate that the chemotactic migration of leukemic cells to the pilocytic astrocytoma may be partly mediated through Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptors \\[18\\] . It is interesting to note that there is evidence of VEGF expression in peripheral T-cell lymphoma \\[19\\] .\n\n【32】Considering the expression of TCR-γ in cutaneous T-cells, it might be associated with different clinical settings (lymphomatoid papulosis type D, mucous fungoides, and cutaneous γδ T-cell lymphoma). Therefore, it is critical to identify cutaneous T-cells that express TCR-γ or lack expression of TCR-βF1 when TCR-γ stain is unavailable \\[5\\] . The classic immunophenotype of PCGD-TCL includes expression of CD2, CD3, CD56, and TCRγ, whereas CD4, CD5, and CD6, are negative. CD8− positivity is uncommon in this entity, having been reported in only a few cases \\[10,20,21\\] . Given the CD8− positivity in our case, the differential diagnosis also included primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma.\n\n【33】Treatment options include a combination of radiation, immune therapy, and multiagent chemotherapy, but remission is not typically sustained with these treatment modalities \\[10\\] . Stem cell transplantation is becoming an increasingly promising option for patients with cutaneous lymphomas. A recent series shows increased survival in patients with PCGD-TCL after allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation \\[22\\] . Rapid diagnosis is crucial, given its aggressive clinical course with a 5-year survival rate of 20%–33% \\[23\\] . The median survival is 15 months after diagnosis \\[1\\] . It is interesting to note that a month passed from the onset of the disease to the establishment of a morphological disease in our case.\n\n【34】Our case highlights the importance of clinical alertness and the need for histopathologic and immunophenotypic diagnosis in case a lack of correlation of supposed disease with the clinical picture. In our patient, there was a distinctive early onset of PCGD-TCL at 26 years of age, disguised as an abscess of the abdominal wall; an aggressive course of disease (Ki67-75%); the presence of hemophagocytic syndrome, CD8− positivity with a concomitant intracerebellar manifestation of pilocytic astrocytoma, which subsequently led to intracerebral bleeding and the patient’s death two months after the onset of the underlying disease.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【36】Primary Cutaneous Gamma-Delta T-Cell Lymphoma (PCGD-TCL) should be suspected in patients with nonspecific skin manifestations that persist or multiply despite conservative treatment. This disease can have a rapid, aggressive course with systemic manifestation. Despite the great rarity of this disease, the physician must have a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis of PCGD-TCL if clinical progression is inconsistent with the usual course of the supposed disease. Initial biopsies are often nondiagnostic. This type of cutaneous lymphoma often requires multiple rebiopsies with immunohistochemical analysis that became necessary to make the correct diagnosis. Further multicenter scientific studies of this pathology are required because of the high rate of progression, low survival rate, and high resistance to therapy, making PCGD-TCL one of the most insidious types of cutaneous lymphoma.  \n\n【37】Funding\n-------\n\n【38】The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, or publication of this article.  \n\n【39】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【40】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

We report the first observation of a Malagasy patient in Madagascar to incite physicians to evoke it in front of an association of hypokalemia and a neurological deficit.\n\n【7】Case Presentation: This was a 45-year-old woman, hypertensive, admitted to the emergency room for a sudden motor deficit of the four limbs, predominantly right, evolving since the day of her admission. She had a history of a similar episode in the left lower limb but no similar family history. The physical examination showed asymmetric tetraparesis. There was no sensory deficit. The examination of the cranial pairs was normal. Osteotendinous and cutaneous-plantar reflexes were absent. Thyroid workup, muscle enzymes (creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase), and brain scan were normal. However, she had hypokalemia with electrical repercussions such as prolonged QT. The diagnosis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis was evoked. Potassium supplementation by intravenous infusion was instituted. The evolution was marked by a complete recovery of muscle strength within 24 hours, concomitant with the normalization of the kalemia.\n\n【8】Conclusion: Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a rare disease but should be known by physicians. The diagnosis is made based on hypokalemia not explained by secondary causes associated with a neuromuscular deficit and confirmed by genetic testing. Treatment is based on the correction of hypokalemia and avoidance of triggering factors.\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) or Westphall’s disease is a genetically inherited autosomal dominant channelopathy causing transfer hypokalemia \\[1\\] . It is a rare disease but the most frequent of the periodic paralysis, its precise prevalence is not known, but it would be about 1/100000 \\[2,3\\] . We report this first case to encourage physicians to evoke it before the association of paralysis and hypokalemia.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】This was a 45-year-old hypertensive woman on dual therapy (Perindopril 10 mg/d and Amlodipine 10 mg/d) and a normal diet. She was admitted to the emergency room for a sudden deficit of the right limbs in an apyretic context, without any notion of hypertensive attack, occurring after an unusual physical exercise. A stroke diagnosis was evoked at first, but the cerebral scanner was normal.\n\n【13】She reported a previous episode in the left lower limb one week before. There was no similar family history.\n\n【14】The hemodynamic status was stable and apyretic on physical examination with blood pressure at 130/80 mmHg, heart rate at 80 beats/min, respiratory rate at 16 cycles/min, oxygen saturation ( SpO 2 ) at 96% on room air, and apyrexia at 36.7°C. The neurological examination showed asymmetric tetraparesis with flaccid paralysis of the right lower limb (muscle score of 0/5), mild paresis of the left lower limb at 4/5, and predominantly distal paresis of the upper limbs with a muscle score of 4/5. There was no sensory deficit. The examination of the cranial pairs was normal. Osteotendinous and cutaneous-plantar reflexes were absent. The rest of the clinical respiratory and cardiovascular examination was unremarkable.\n\n【15】On biological examination, severe hypokalemia of 2.2 mmol/l was observed. Creatinine (89 umol/l), uremia (4.4 mmol/l), initial determinations with controls of LDH and CPK enzymes, and thyroid workup were normal. Genetic testing was not feasible in our country. The urinary ionogram revealed a kaliuresis of 14 mmol/l.\n\n【16】The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sinus rhythm with a QT prolongation with corrected QT 753 ms related to hypokalemia (Figure) .\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】The diagnosis of hypokalemic paralysis was evoked.\n\n【19】Correction of hypokalemia by intravenous infusion of 2 g of KCl (potassium chloride) over eight hours was instituted. The evolution was marked clinically by the progressive recovery of muscle strength and the complete disappearance of the deficit at the 24 th hour. Concomitant with the normalization of the kalemia and paraclinical, the kalemia was 3.7 mmol/l with a kaliuresis of 60 mmol/24h, and the ECG had returned normal.\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】PPH is a rare pathology whose pathophysiology is still poorly understood. It involves genetic mutations occurring in the genes of the α subunit of a voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel (CACNA1S) in 70% of cases or the genes of the α subunit of the muscle sodium channel (SCN4A) in 10% \\[4\\] . This pathology presents triggering factors such as the intake of food rich in carbohydrates or salts, alcohol, strong emotion, and rest after intense or unusual physical exercise, as in the case of our patient \\[4\\] . It generally apart during the second decade and is characterized, in its most frequent form (75%) by the occurrence of iterative episodes of tetraplegia or flaccid paralysis lasting from a few hours to a few days, sparing the respiratory, oculomotor, and bulbar muscles and the heart \\[4,5\\] . In our case, it was predominantly right tetraparesis with flaccid paralysis of the right lower limb. In the face of this picture of sudden neurological deficit, stroke should be ruled out in the first instance by brain imaging. The diagnosis of PPH is clinical and biological but can be confirmed by genetic analysis, the negativity of which does not eliminate the diagnosis \\[6,7\\] .\n\n【22】Hypokalemia is most often between 0.9 mmol/l and 3 mmol/l \\[4,5\\] , which is the case for our patients. The ECG more frequently shows the classical signs of hypokalemia, namely ST-segment depression, T-wave depression or inversion, increased U-wave amplitude, and QT prolongation, as in our patient.\n\n【23】Although rare, the most formidable complication of a PPH attack is the occurrence of a threatening intraventricular conduction disorder of ventricular fibrillation \\[8\\] .\n\n【24】Treatment consists of careful correction of hypokalemia, not exceeding a dose of 10 mmol/hr, as too rapid correction exposes the risk of hyperkalemia \\[9\\] .\n\n【25】Thus, regular surveillance by physical examination and monitoring of kalemia is essential.\n\n【26】In addition, therapeutic education focused on avoiding triggers is important to prevent the occurrence of seizures.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【28】PPH is a rare disease, but the physician should know it. The diagnosis is made based on hypokalemia not explained by secondary causes associated with a neuromuscular deficit and confirmed by genetic testing. Treatment is based on the correction of hypokalemia and avoidance of triggering factors.  \n\n【29】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【30】*   Dr. Ida Marie Rahantamalala, USFR Internal Medicine, CHU Anosiala Antananarivo, Madagascar.\n*   Dr. Solofo Andriambelo Ralamboson, USFR Internal Medicine, CENHOSOA Antananarivo, Madagascar.\n*   USFR Internal Medicine, CHUJRB of Antananarivo, Madagascar.\n\n【31】Authors’ contributions: All authors contributed to the conduct and completion of this work.  \n\n【32】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【33】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

It is most often found on the palate.\n\n【7】We report a case of parotid localization that simulated necrotizing sialometaplasia.\n\n【8】Observation: The patient was MS, 24-year-old male who underwent surgery for necrotizing sialometaplasia of the left parotid gland, and it recurred three months after surgery. Reoperated for recurrence of a large left parotid mass. The histological reading of the surgical specimen concluded with a necrotizing sialometaplasia of the left parotid gland with doubtful deep borders. However, immunohistochemistry confirmed the doubtful diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the parotid gland. Without further treatment, he died of hemorrhage.\n\n【9】Conclusion: Necrotizing sialometaplasia is a rare benign tumor of the salivary glands, most often located on the palate. Parotid localization can be the revealing mode of a squamous cell carcinoma whose diagnosis and treatment must be early.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Salivary gland tumors are rare and account for approximately 3% of all head and neck tumors \\[1\\] . Most of these tumors affect the parotid gland in 25% of cases \\[2\\] . Squamous cell carcinoma of the parotid gland is a rare malignancy that accounts for less than 1% of all salivary gland neoplasms \\[3\\] . Parotid gland cancer is of great interest due to the diversity of clinical presentation and histologic and evolutionary features, which causes diagnostic difficulties and controversies in therapeutic treatment \\[2\\] . This study aims to describe a case of squamous cell carcinoma of the parotid gland, a histologic examination of which revealed necrotizing sialometaplasia, and to draw the attention of practitioners to this rare clinical entity.\n\n【12】Medical examination: The patient is a 24-year-old male with multiple sclerosis, a history of conservative total parotidectomy of the left parotid gland, surgery performed at Piquinet Hospital for left parotid gland edema at nine months of its evolutionary continuation in the ENT department of the Idrissa Pouye General Hospital in Senegal with a histological result favoring necrotic sialometaplasia of the parotid gland. Clinical examination revealed a poly lobular left parotid-temporal mass infiltrating the skin opposite and filling the external auditory canal, which reappeared three months after surgery (Figure 1A, Figure 1B) . The opposite parotid gland appeared healthy, and the lymph nodes were free. CT of the cervical spine showed a left parotid-temporal process measuring 58 mm x 41 mm x 22 mm with temporal bone lysis (Figure 2) . A left parotidectomy with a homolateral triangular incision and transection of the temporomandibular branch of the facial nerve was performed (Figure 3A1, 3A2, Figure 3B) . The postoperative course was complicated by a purulent infection, which was controlled with dual therapy for ten days. Histologic examination (Supplementary Figure) of the surgical material showed that the left parotid gland had necrotizing sialometaplasia with questionable deep borders. However, the case was submitted for PCR, and the decision to perform immunohistochemistry was important. Two blocks sent to the pathology laboratory of the European Hospital in Paris \\[CK5/6 (+) and P40/P63 (-)\\] confirmed the suspected diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the parotid gland. Without further treatment, a year later, the disease progressed (Figure 4A, Figure 4B) , and the patient died due to bleeding.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Discussion\n----------\n\n【15】The parotid gland’s Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is a rare malignancy with an estimated incidence of less than 1% of all salivary gland neoplasms \\[3\\] . This disease usually occurs in the sixth or seventh decade of life, mainly in men \\[4,5\\] . The literature reports an average age of 64 years and 72 years, with a male-to-female ratio 2:1 \\[6,1\\] . However, the peculiarity of our study is the occurrence of this tumor in a young patient in the second decade of life. This is contrary to the data presented in the study by Sahabi SM et al. in 2017 \\[1\\] , where the average age of patients was 42 years, and there were almost 4 times more men than women. We did not find any risk factors for cancer in our patient. This is similar to the study by Bouaity B et al. \\[7\\] in 2016 in Morocco, who found no specific history in their patients. There is a clear difference in the study by Allouch I et al. in 2021 \\[8\\] in Rabat, who found that 15 patients (14%) had a risk factor for tobacco intoxication. In the 2013 study by Huang MW et al. \\[9\\] , in most cases, parotid carcinoma manifests as a hard, painless mass that can be fixed or mobile, although about one-third of patients have a painful mass with or without facial paralysis. As in our case, the clinical examination revealed a painful mass infiltrating the surrounding skin without palpable adenopathy or facial paralysis that appeared nine months after the initial surgery, leading us to suspect a malignant rather than benign tumor. Contrary to the histologic result, which was in favor of necrotizing sialometaplasia of the parotid gland, which is an inflammatory ulcerative-ischemic necrotic lesion, it is most often localized in the palate, i.e., in 79% of cases, and only in 12% of cases - in the main salivary glands \\[10\\] .\n\n【16】Three months after the start of treatment, a CT scan of the cervical spine was performed, which revealed a process in the parotid and temporal bone on the left without objective bone lysis. From a therapeutic point of view, given the continued progression and doubts about the histologic result and temporal bone lysis, we performed a left parotidectomy with a homolateral triangular incision. Macroscopically, the lesion appeared as a whitish poly lobular mass with a firm consistency surrounded by a highly inflammatory area similar to the consistency of wet sugar. Excision of the skin opposite showed lysis of the temporal bone with exposure of the dura mater of the temporal bone, affecting the cartilaginous auditory canal with the temporo-facial nerve, which was more or less carcinological confirmed. As in the literature, the treatment is radical surgery, postoperative radiation therapy, and follow-up périodique \\[6\\] . Despite proper treatment, preoperative facial nerve damage is an unfavorable prognostic factor: the recurrence rate within five years ranges from 10% to 25% \\[4\\] .\n\n【17】Due to significant postoperative tissue loss and the suspicious nature of the tumor, the option of treating the wound by targeted excision was chosen.\n\n【18】The surgical material was re-submitted for pathologic examination, again concluding that it was necrotizing sialometaplasia with questionable deep borders and lack of margins. However, this condition may mimic a malignant lesion; clinically, at the ulcer stage, one may think of squamous cell carcinoma, but also the histological aspect very often leads to confusion with carcinomatous lesions in the background of areas of squamous cell metaplasia, which often appear as a continuity with epithelial ridges \\[11\\] . We found the same hypothesis in our surgical specimen, which was an infiltrating epithelial component on trabeculae of epidermoid cells in contact with extensive areas of ischemic necrosis.\n\n【19】In view of these diagnostic doubts, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed, which showed a positive result for cytokeratin CK5/6 and P40/P63(-), confirming the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the parotid gland. A year later, the patient experienced a tumor recurrence. However, total parotidectomy does not prevent further progression of the tumor due to its multiple growths. Postoperative radiation therapy is also recommended as it improves local disease control \\[4\\] . In our case, due to the patient’s low income, he was unable to take advantage of additional treatment. This led to tumor recurrence and decreased survival rate to 1 year in our patient. This is in contrast to the literature, where the five-year survival rate remains at 25%–30% \\[6\\] .\n\n【20】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【21】Sialometaplasia is a benign hard palate lesion with an exclusive parotid location. However, it can be a manifestation of squamous cell carcinoma of the parotid gland, a malignant tumor with aggressive potential.

Benralizumab is a humanized, interleukin (IL)-5Rα-specific monoclonal antibody that effectively ameliorates asthmatic episodes by inducing rapid and nearly complete depletion of eosinophils.\n\n【7】Case presentation: The patient was a man in his 70s who had a history of bronchial asthma since his 30s and of heavy smoking for 70 pack years.

The asthma exacerbations have disappeared. During the three years, he has had an exacerbation only once because of pneumonia. No significant change in renal function or liver function occurred during this period.\n\n【8】Conclusions: It is extremely important for physicians to be aware that in elderly patients, various organ functions are generally impaired, including both hepatobiliary and renal functions; as in this case, biologics can definitely be administered safely.\n\n【9】Background\n----------\n\n【10】In recent years, several new biologics, such as benralizumab, have been developed to treat patients suffering from asthma poorly controlled by high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting bronchodilators. Benralizumab is a humanized, interleukin (IL)-5Rα-specific monoclonal antibody that effectively ameliorates asthmatic episodes by inducing rapid and nearly complete depletion of eosinophils \\[1,2\\] . Dupilumab is an IL-4 receptor alpha antibody and a biologic that blocks both IL-4 and IL-13. Recently, evidence of anti-IL-5 efficacy in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has also been shown \\[3\\] , and benralizumab is shown to be effective in patients with adult-onset asthma with peripheral blood eosinophilia rather than the phenotype of childhood-onset, allergic asthma. The administration of biologics to a wide range of phenotypes and rigid phenotypes is becoming increasingly recommended, and the administration of biologics in the real world is becoming increasingly important. In fact, we have recently identified a distinct phenotype of severe eosinophilic asthma with greater Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) responsiveness to benralizumab in a real-world setting \\[4\\] , which included aged smokers, as the case reported here. This report presents a patient with COPD complicated by severe eosinophilic asthma who was unsuitable for systemic steroid administration because of repeated pneumonia. In addition, he had Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and cirrhosis due to the hepatitis C virus. A hepatic physician treated him with pibrentasvir, which can also be used for impaired renal function associated with cirrhosis.  \n\n【11】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】The patient was a man in his 70s who had a history of bronchial asthma since his 30s and of heavy smoking for 70 pack years. He was treated with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-agonists and also took anti-leukotriene antagonists. Systemic steroids were introduced several times a year when he had an asthma attack. However, he was not taking them regularly because of frequent infections. Benralizumab (30 mg/body) was started in 2018 because of the risk of systemic steroids to control asthma attacks. At the time of the drug’s commencement, the eosinophils were 200-300/µL, FeNO was 30-60 ppb, and IgE was within the normal range. There was no liver damage at that time, and the renal function was 1.5 mg/dL–2.5 mg/dL for serum creatinine, 20 mg/dL–30 mg/dL for blood urea nitrogen, and 20–30 for the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR). In the year before starting benralizumab treatment, he had had four exacerbations due to pure asthma attacks and infections such as pneumonia.\n\n【13】Benralizumab was administered monthly for the first three months and once every two months thereafter. (Figure) shows the disease status immediately before treatment and one year after treatment. To date, he has been taking biologics for about three years, including the time when he temporarily switched to dupilumab at his request. The asthma exacerbations have disappeared. During the three years, he has had an exacerbation only once because of pneumonia. No significant change in renal function or liver function has occurred during this period. The asthma control test has increased from 15 points to 22 points. The asthma symptoms are very stable, and only symptoms of general malaise and edema associated with cirrhosis and renal dysfunction remain.\n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Discussion\n----------\n\n【16】Here, we have shown that asthma exacerbations were successfully controlled by using benralizumabin in the elderly person with the eosinophilic phenotype of chronic airway diseases and a number of chronic malady. Small-molecule biologics such as benralizumab are administered subcutaneously and then carried systemically by diffusion, so basically, the dose does not need to be adjusted even in patients who are older or have renal or liver disorders \\[5\\] . Patients who are not suitable for systemic steroids, such as the patient, in this case, may be overlooked as being trapped in the typical asthma phenotype, even though biologics should be very effective. In this case, reducing inhaled steroids by controlling allergic inflammation of the respiratory tract with biologics that do not make it vulnerable to infectious diseases may also be a factor in reducing the exacerbations caused by infectious diseases.\n\n【17】It is extremely important for physicians to be aware that in elderly patients whose various organ functions are generally impaired, including both hepatobiliary and renal functions, as in this case, biologics can definitely be administered safely. Therefore, it is hoped that a large study will prove that biologics for severe asthma are sufficiently valuable even in high-risk cases, such as the case presented here, rather than just in adjusted cases, such as being enrolled in a clinical trial.\n\n【18】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【19】We thank Flaminia Miyamasu, Medical English Communications Center, University of Tsukuba, for grammatical revision.

We present a case of a 60-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis with cellulitis. Two weeks after the surgical treatment of the abscess, he presented one episode of hematemesis. The upper endoscopy revealed a black mucosa with circumferential necrosis of the esophagus and duodenal ulcers. The patient was managed with supportive care and proton pump inhibitors, but unfortunately, he died two days later.\n\n【7】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【8】AEN: Acute Esophageal Necrosis; DKA: Diabetic Ketoacidosis; EGJ: Esophagogastric Junction; EGD: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy; PPI: Proton Pump Inhibitor  \n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Acute Esophageal Necrosis (AEN) is a rare multi-name disorder, also called necrotizing esophagitis, black esophagus, or Gurvits syndrome. It is the consequence of the combination of factors that promote ischemia of the esophagus, acid reflux, and alteration of mucosal defenses. The incidence of AEN is approximately 0.01%–0.28% of patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy \\[1,2\\] . We report a case of a diabetic patient with necrotizing esophagitis.  \n\n【11】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A male patient, in his sixties, with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus) and mild chronic kidney insufficiency presented to the Emergency Ward with a left inguinal cellulitis with surface necrotic tissue complicated by a subcutaneous abscess. An incision and drainage of the abscess were performed. A bacteriological examination of pus found Staphylococcus aureus . Two weeks later, he presented an episode of hematemesis (Table) . The hemoglobin levels decreased from 7.2 g/dL to 5.9 g/dL. He received an intravenous normal saline infusion and blood transfusion. Intravenous omeprazole infusion was also started.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Urgent gastroscopy showed diffuse circumferential ulcerations and black mucosa affecting the esophagus from his proximal portion (Figure 1) to his distal portion, at 20 cm to 35 cm from the incisor teeth. The lesions progressively worsened. The lesions ended at the eso-gastric junction (Figure 2) . Erosions and small ulcerations were detected in the duodenum as well.\n\n【15】  \n\n【16】In this case, the treatment was based on the use of antibiotics and a high-dose proton pump inhibitor associated with the management of ketoacidosis. Even if there was good glycemic control using insulin therapy and there was no rebleeding, the patient, unfortunately, subsequently succumbed to a septic shock after two days.\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】This clinical syndrome usually affects males with an average age of 67 years \\[3\\] . It generally develops within the framework of severe systemic disease as a result of a combination of tissue hypoperfusion, gastric reflux, and altered defenses of the mucosa. Several risk factors have been identified, like cardiovascular risk factors (including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia), congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, and liver cirrhosis. There are other risk factors less frequent such as malignancies and post-operative status \\[2,4\\] . Diabetic ketoacidosis may unleash AEN. DKA can cause low circulatory volume on its own by osmotic diuresis leading to a deep loss of fluid. In addition, DKA may induce gastroparesis, causing an increase in gastric reflux and subsequent mucous lesions.\n\n【19】It should be noted that COVID-19-related thrombosis can contribute to ischaemic lesions in the distal esophagus. Therefore COVID-19 infection can be added to the list of AEN risk factors \\[5\\] . Schizas et al. study showed that the distal esophagus is almost constantly affected (92.9%), with frequent progression of the disease to the middle part of the esophagus (64.3%) \\[6\\] .\n\n【20】The distal third of the esophagus is the most vulnerable and easily affected segment because of its lower blood supply. Duodenal lesions might also be noticed because of the presence of common branches depending on the coeliac plexus \\[3\\] .\n\n【21】The classic clinical signs are hematemesis and/or melena with abdominal pain, which may be associated with other signs like dysphagia and vomiting \\[7\\] . The development of AEN is thought to be rapid; that is why clinicians should consider AEN and carry out timely EGD if a diabetes patient with a severely elevated glucose level complains of unendurable heartburn, even when signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding are absent or a recent EGD was unremarkable \\[8\\] .\n\n【22】The classic endoscopic presentation is the black appearance of the distal esophagus with a clear limit of esophageal necrosis at the gastroesophageal junction. Ulcerations and esophageal necrosis are often seen after ingestion of the irritant and caustic product, which is why proper questioning should be undertaken to rule out this possibility. The biopsy of observed lesions may be useful to confirm the diagnosis by excluding other etiologies of similar appearance \\[3\\] .\n\n【23】The treatment is initially based on supportive care with digestive tract rest and PPIs \\[2\\] . Therapeutic management consists in correcting anemia by blood transfusion with resuscitation measures for hypoperfusion and relieving the pain. Enteral nutrition should be avoided. Parenteral nutrition can be used until the resumption of oral feeding \\[9\\] .\n\n【24】The use of high-dose IPPs within the initial phase and even after remission is recommended to reduce the risk of late complications. The use of antibiotics is not systematic and should be handled with caution, as publications have reported the potential for AEN development after using some antibiotics such as Clindamycin \\[10\\] . Antifungal and antiviral drugs can also be used, according to the indications. The placement of a nasogastric tube on an injured mucosa must be avoided because of the risk of perforation.\n\n【25】The uncomplicated AEN evolves in two phases. The initial phase is characterized by the blackish appearance of the distal esophageal mucosa. In contrast, the second phase is the healing stage, and it is characterized by friable pink mucosa surmounted by necrotic pseudomembranes with some residual black spots \\[1\\] . The esophagus usually regains its normal endoscopic appearance approximately 7 days to 14 days later. The delay of complete remission varies according to the patient’s overall condition \\[3\\] .\n\n【26】Perforation is the most lethal complication of necrotizing esophagitis and, luckily, is extremely rare. It is required surgical treatment \\[11\\] . Stenosis formation is also observed in the chronic stage of the disease in some patients.\n\n【27】AEN mortality rate is about 32% \\[12\\] ; this high rate is probably due to severe underlying diseases. So the estimated specific mortality of AEN is approximately 6% \\[7\\] .\n\n【28】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【29】AEN is an unusual cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and can be life-threatening. It concerns mostly elderly patients with multiple comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney insufficiency. The treatment is based on the management of the underlying condition associated with high-dose proton pump inhibitors and supportive care.  \n\n【30】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【31】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Treatment options depend on the stage of the disease, with systemic therapy reserved for locally advanced and metastatic disease. Cemiplimab, an anti-PD 1 monoclonal antibody, has proven efficacy against this highly immunogenic tumor, increasing evidence of its usefulness in unresectable, metastatic, and locally advanced diseases.\n\n【7】A 78-year-old female with no pertinent past medical history, a former 50-pack-per-day smoker, presented to the hospital for a large ulcerated right facial mass, weight loss, and anorexia. Physical exam showed a large 10 cm x 8 cm ulcerated, exophytic lesion with few areas of bleeding, involving the entire right side of the face with cervical erythema without fluctuance. A CT scan of the neck demonstrated a large heterogeneous ulcerated facial mass measuring approximately 9 cm x 10 cm x 3 cm, extending superiorly to the superior margin of the right orbit, inferiorly to the level of the maxilla, medially to the right nasal wall, and posteriorly to right maxillary sinus anterior wall with involvement of the infraorbital foramen with mildly prominent lymph nodes. A biopsy of the mass confirmed invasive, ulcerated, and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body nuclear bone scan was negative for distant metastatic disease. After a multidisciplinary meeting, the patient was deemed a poor candidate for surgical resection given the high morbidity or chemoradiation given the disease’s extent. A decision was made to administer Cemiplimab with the goal of tumor size reduction and eventual surgery. The patient received Cemiplimab 350 mg IV every three weeks, which was tolerated well with no reported side effects. The patient received 13 doses of Cemiplimab with a resolution of the mass and is pending a PET scan to assess for residual disease.\n\n【8】The above case illustrates the possibility of using Cemiplimab as a sole therapeutic option without the need for complementary reconstructive surgery or radiation therapy.\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a malignant neoplasm of the skin, characterized by aberrant proliferation of keratinocytes with a high mutation burden \\[1\\] . It is the second most common non-melanoma neoplasm after basal cell carcinoma with increasing incidence and estimated mortality rates comparable to renal, oropharyngeal carcinomas, and melanomas in the southern and central United States \\[2\\] . Risk factors for the development of cSCC include ultraviolet exposure, old age, and immunosuppression \\[3\\] . Complete surgical resection is the recommended treatment for localized disease, with radiotherapy being performed for a non-resectable tumor or in patients who are poor surgical candidates or who decline surgery. Systemic therapy is reserved for locally advanced and metastatic (local and distant) cSCC, which cannot be treated with curative intent with either surgery and/or radiotherapy. Currently, given the lack of prospective randomized phase 3 trials comparing the efficacy and safety of chemotherapeutics, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, and anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies, no systemic therapy has been approved for the treatment of locally advanced and/or metastatic disease \\[4\\] . Cemiplimab is a highly potent, high-affinity monoclonal antibody directed against (PD-1), which has shown efficacy in highly immunogenic advanced cSCC \\[5\\] . It showed an overall response rate of 50% in phase I / II trials, with a durable response exceeding six months in 57% of the responders \\[6\\] . There is increasing evidence to support its use as a sole agent for curative intent, as cases of complete remission after isolated treatment with Cemiplimab have been described in the literature \\[5,7\\] . We present a case of locally advanced cSCC of the face, with an excellent near-complete sustained response to Cemiplimab therapy without concurrent or subsequent treatment.  \n\n【11】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】An 80-year-old frail female, with no pertinent past medical history, former 50 pack-per-year smokers, presented to the hospital for a large ulcerated right facial mass ( Figure 1) , weight loss, and anorexia. History started one year before her presentation when she noticed a small lesion above the right nasolabial fold, rapidly growing over the last four months. Physical exam showed a large ulcerated, exophytic lesion, measuring approximately 8 cm x 8 cm (by measuring tape), with few areas of bleeding, involving the entire right side of the face, associated with cervical erythema without fluctuance or induration. A nasal speculum examination was performed and was limited because of the extrinsic compression of the nasal cavity but failed to reveal invasion of the mass into the nasal cavity.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Admission laboratory studies were significant for iron deficiency anemia (Hemoglobin 7.8 g/dL \\[12 g/dL – 16 g/dL\\]) treated with a 3-day course of IV iron sucrose.\n\n【15】A CT scan of the head and neck demonstrated a large heterogeneous ulcerated facial mass measuring approximately 9 cm x 10 cm x 3 cm, extending superiorly to the superior margin of the right orbit, inferiorly to the level of the maxilla, medially to the right nasal wall, and posteriorly to right maxillary sinus anterior wall with involvement of the infraorbital foramen with mildly prominent lymph nodes (Figure 2) .\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】A biopsy of the mass was performed, and pathology reported invasive, ulcerated, and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining was focally positive for CK7, CD10, and CK5/6/P63 and was negative for S100, Melan A, MART-1, CK20, synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD56, ER, PR, GCDFP-15, and PAX-8.\n\n【18】Further workup with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body nuclear bone scan was negative for distant metastatic disease.\n\n【19】After a multidisciplinary meeting, the patient was deemed a poor candidate for surgical resection followed by reconstructive surgery given the high morbidity or chemoradiation given the disease’s extent. The decision was made to administer immunotherapy with Cemiplimab with the goal of tumor size reduction and eventual surgery. The patient was started on Cemiplimab 350 mg IV every three weeks and tolerated well with no reported side effects. After her fourth cycle, her tumor was significantly smaller in size (Figure 3) .\n\n【20】  \n\n【21】At this publication, the patient had received 23 doses of Cemiplimab with near resolution of the mass. A plan to repeat a PET scan to assess residual disease is currently on hold as the patient was lost to follow-up.\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】Most patients diagnosed with Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma have a limited-stage disease that is easily resectable at the time of diagnosis. Consequently, the condition is characterized by an elevated 5-year survival rate approaching 90%. However, despite the encouraging statistics, a clinically significant locally advanced disease is present in a significant subset of patients \\[8\\] .\n\n【24】In our case, the patient presented with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma with extensive infiltration of facial structures, making facial reconstructive surgery a poor therapeutic option because of the anticipated high risk of recurrence and the associated high peri-operative morbidity. Similar cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma exist and are not amenable to standard curative treatments used for limited-stage diseases such as surgical resection, cryotherapy, and radiation therapy. Immunotherapy has been studied for this category of patients. One of the first categories of agents studied was EGFR inhibitors. Hillen et al. related the results of a retrospective study performed in 24 centers in Germany and Austria that included data from 190 patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The study showed that only two patients achieved complete response; however, a much higher proportion had a partial response and disease stabilization (27% and 43%, respectively) \\[9\\] . The advance of immune checkpoint inhibitors and their proven efficacy in treating other cancer types have led to their study as potential therapeutic options for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Cemiplimab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to Programmed Death 1 (PD-1), preventing interaction with Programmed-Death Ligand 1 (PDL-1). It was approved in 2018 for the treatment of cSCC in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation \\[10\\] . The most popular ongoing study is the EMPOWER-CSCC1 phase 2 trial. It has been observed that Cemiplimab treatment was associated with a clinically objective response rate across two groups of patients: patients with locally advanced cSCC and patients with metastatic cSCC. It has been observed that responses appear durable and associated with a relatively good safety profile. The primary analysis shows that out of 78 patients, ten patients had a complete response after treatment with Cemiplimab \\[11\\] . Hermel et al. performed a retrospective analysis of 8 patients treated with at least one cycle of Pembrolizumab. Out of 8 patients that met inclusion criteria, 4 achieved a partial response, and 2 had stable disease \\[12\\] . It is worth noting that Cemiplimab is clinically useful for patients with locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in which curative surgery or radiation therapy are either impossible or, if performed, would lead to devastating cosmetic consequences. The literature has increasingly described cases of complete remission following Cemiplimab treatment. The most supportive study is a pilot phase II trial presented by Ferrarotto et al. that concluded that neoadjuvant immunotherapy in locoregionally advanced resectable cSCC is associated with a high pathologic response rate \\[13\\] .\n\n【25】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【26】Based on this case report, we conclude that if a complete response to Cemiplimab is reported in the context of locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and considering its relatively safe profile. It can potentially be considered as a sole therapeutic option without the need for complementary reconstructive surgery or radiation therapy if further data from randomized controlled trials support this conclusion.  \n\n【27】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【28】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  Informed consent was obtained for this publication.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccrj_case", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is involved in nitroglycerin metabolism and reduces oxidative stress, thereby suppressing vasospasm. However, it is unclear whether a change in the expression level of human ALDH2 in the blood correlates with the regulation of vasospastic angina.\n\n【7】Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients who had undergone coronary angiography (CAG) owing to angina; 2,326 patients underwent CAG, and 195 underwent an intracoronary ergonovine provocation test because of suspected vasospastic angina symptoms and no significant stenosis on baseline CAG.\n\n【8】Results: Vasospastic angina was present in 39% of the subjects, as determined by the ergonovine provocation test. The difference in ALDH2 concentration before and after the provocation test was much larger in the positive provocation group (−10.002 ± 4.53, p = 0.03 vs. −4.486 ± 3.469, p = 0.199).\n\n【9】Conclusions: The concentration of human ALDH2 in the blood is associated with vasospastic angina.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】In 1959, Prinzmetal et al. described 32 cases of a variant form of angina characterized by rest pain associated with transient ST-segment elevation. The angina episodes often recurred, frequently waking the patient \\[1\\] . In addition, coronary spasm has been shown to play a key role in several cases of variant angina \\[2,3\\] .\n\n【12】The prevalence of variant angina is apparently higher in East Asian populations than in their Western counterparts \\[4,5\\] . For example, in a recent study of 2,129 patients in the VA-Korea (Vasospastic Angina in Korea) registry, the positivity rate of ergonovine provocation was 21.3% \\[6\\] .\n\n【13】The pathogenesis of coronary spasms is multifactorial and heterogeneous among different populations. Several studies have reported that the parasympathetic nervous system may play a role in the pathogenesis of coronary spasms and coronary vascular smooth muscle hyperactivity \\[7,8\\] . Endothelial cell dysfunction and deficiency in nitric oxide activity also contribute to the pathogenesis of coronary spasms \\[3\\] . Environmental factors such as smoking, insulin resistance, and alcohol consumption might also be considered pathogenic contributors \\[5,9\\] .\n\n【14】East Asian variants of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) ALDH2\\*2 genotypes are associated with vasospastic angina \\[10\\] . Two main variants of ALDH2 in East Asian populations; arise from replacing glutamate (Glu) at position 487 with lysine (Lys). The Glu allele (also designated ALDH2\\*1) encodes a protein with normal catalytic activity, whereas the Lys allele (ALDH2\\*2) encodes an inactive protein. As a result, Lys/Lys homozygotes have no detectable ALDH2 activity. Furthermore, because the Lys allele acts semi-dominantly, ALDH2 Lys/Glu heterozygotes have far less than half the ALDH2 activity of Glu/Glu homozygotes; in fact, the reduction in ALDH2 activity in heterozygotes is more than 100-fold \\[11\\] . Genetic variants of ALDH2 are commonly found in as many as 35%–45% of East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Taiwanese) but are rare or absent in other ethnic populations worldwide \\[12,13\\] .\n\n【15】Human ALDH2, one of 19 functional ALDH genes, has the chromosomal locus 12q24 and encodes a 517-amino acid polypeptide with mitochondrial subcellular localization \\[11,14\\] .\n\n【16】ALDH2 plays a key role in oxidizing endogenous aldehyde products that arise from lipid peroxidation under oxidative stress, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as environmental aldehydes \\[15,16\\] .\n\n【17】The cardiac protective effects of mitochondrial ALDH2 during cardiac ischemia and reperfusion injury in models of ethanol-mediated cardiomyopathy and heart failure have been demonstrated by using a variety of ALDH2 transgenic mice \\[17,18\\] . In summary, the positive role of ALDH2 in reducing oxidative stress by detoxifying reactive aldehydes may contribute to cardiac protection.\n\n【18】Moreover, ALDH2 is involved in the metabolism of nitroglycerin when it is used as a vasodilator. ALDH2 plays an essential role in the bioconversion of nitroglycerin to nitric oxide to achieve its vasodilating effects \\[4,19\\] . Therefore, ALDH2 is expected to play an important role in vasospastic angina. However, little active research has been undertaken on the role of ALDH2 in disorder.\n\n【19】To date, only studies on the genetic deficiency of ALDH2 have been undertaken, and the quantitative investigation of human ALDH2 expression levels in the blood has not yet been carried out. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether a change in the human ALDH2 expression level in the blood plasma correlates with the regulation of vasospastic angina.\n\n【20】Our aims were:\n\n【21】1.  To compare and analyze the characteristics of the positive and negative cases of vasospastic angina revealed by intracoronary ergonovine provocation tests.\n2.  To determine the blood plasma human ALDH2 concentration in vasospastic angina cases.\n3.  To investigate the correlation between ALDH2 and vasospastic angina.\n\n【22】Materials and Methods\n---------------------\n\n【23】Study design and participants: This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) in Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital between June 2011 and October 2014. Of those patients, 2,326 underwent CAG, and 203 underwent an intracoronary ergonovine provocation test because of suspected vasospastic angina symptoms and no significant stenosis on baseline CAG. One hundred and eighty-five patients for whom medical history and blood sample diagnosis information were available were included as study subjects (Figure 1) .\n\n【24】  \n\n【25】The included subjects completed a survey and submitted a blood sample that met the diagnostic criteria for coronary artery disease. In addition, arterial blood samples were collected via a trans-radial catheter to compare ALDH2 concentrations before and after the ergonovine provocation test. The plasma was extracted from the blood samples by centrifugation and was stored at −72°C. The patient records were subsequently reviewed to investigate vasospastic angina’s prevalence and relevant risk factors.\n\n【26】Ethics statement: The study protocol was approved by the Cardiology Ethics Committee, the institutional review board of Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital (IRB No. 2017-36). The IRB confirmed informed consent.\n\n【27】CAG and provocation test for vasospastic angina: Diagnostic CAG was performed via the trans-radial approach. After confirming the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis, incremental doses of ergonovine were infused into the left coronary artery. Ergonovine was then injected in the following order: E1 (20 µg), E2 (40 µg), and E3 (60 µg), with 2-minute intervals between consecutive doses. CAG was performed 2 minutes after completion of the injection. In the event of an ischemic change on the electrocardiogram (ECG) or a chest symptom, angiography was performed at the time of onset. In the event of a negative provocation test result, a right coronary provocation test was performed 5 minutes later. Coronary spasm during the ergonovine provocation test was defined as “transient, total, or subtotal occlusion (stenosis of > 90%) of a coronary artery with signs of myocardial ischemia (angina pain and ischemic ST changes)” \\[20\\] . Once coronary spasm had been induced, a sufficient dose of nitroglycerin was administered to each coronary artery, and angiography was performed while the coronary artery was maximally dilated. Aortic pressure, O2 saturation, and ECG signals were recorded during the procedure.\n\n【28】Classification of negative and positive provocation test results: A classic definition of a positive provocative test result for coronary artery spasm is that the test must induce all of the following responses to the provocative stimulus: (i) reproduction of the usual chest pain, (ii) ischemic ECG changes, and (iii) vasoconstriction of > 90% on angiography. The test result is considered equivocal if the provocative stimulus does not induce all three components. The consensus from the Coronary Vasomotion Disorders International Study Group (COVADIS) symposium was that vasoconstriction of > 90% is the angiographic threshold for the diagnosis of inducible spasm \\[21\\] . In this study, the provocation test results were classified into four groups as follows: negative, positive, equivocal positive, and mixed positive. Except for the mixed positive group, none of the groups had significant coronary artery stenosis on baseline CAG. The mixed positive group had 50%–70% coronary artery stenosis without stent implantation. The four groups are described as follows:\n\n【29】1.  The negative group: insignificant stenosis (stenosis of < 50%) with luminal narrowing of < 50% after an intracoronary ergonovine provocation test with or without atypical chest symptoms and signs.\n2.  The definite positive group: insignificant stenosis (stenosis of < 50%) with luminal narrowing of > 90% after an intracoronary ergonovine provocation test with ischemic chest symptoms or signs.\n3.  The equivocal positive group: insignificant stenosis (stenosis of < 50%) with luminal narrowing of 70%–90% after an intracoronary ergonovine provocation test with ischemic chest symptoms or signs.\n4.  The mixed positive group: coronary artery stenosis (stenosis of 50%–70% without stent implantation) with luminal narrowing of > 90% after an intracoronary ergonovine provocation test with ischemic chest symptoms or signs. The positive provocation group included both the positive group and the equivocal positive and mixed positive groups. This classification was considered suitable for determining therapeutic approaches by a clinician (Figure 2) .\n\n【30】  \n\n【31】Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for ALDH2: A double-sandwich ELISA was performed to determine human ALDH2 concentrations. All the experiments were performed using commercially available ALDH2 kits (Cusabio, Hubei, China), following the manufacturer’s protocols. Standards and samples were added to the precoated well and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C, then removed from the well. Biotin antibody was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The well was washed three times with a wash buffer. A horse radish peroxidase-avidin conjugate was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The well was washed five times with a wash buffer. A tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution was added to each well and incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C in the dark. A stop solution was then added to each well. Optical density was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a filter-based microplate photometer (Multiskan TM FC, Thermo Scientific TM , Massachusetts, USA).\n\n【32】Data analysis: R language version 3.1.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for all statistical analyses. The differences between pairs of groups, analyzed and divided according to baseline characteristics and provocation results, were determined. The data obtained are expressed as mean ± SD or median for continuous variables and number (percentage) for categorical variables. One-way analysis of variance with a T-test was performed on the positive provocation group, which comprised the definite positive, the equivocal positive, and the mixed positive groups. Chi-square or Fisher exact test was performed to test the hypothesis of the association between categorical variables and vasospastic angina, defined according to the provocation test results. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n【33】Results\n-------\n\n【34】Demographic attributes and clinical parameters of the subjects: As described earlier, the final analysis included 195 subjects (119 men and 76 women), excluding those in which the human ALDH2 level could not be measured. The positive group accounted for 39% of the study subjects (76/195), and the negative group accounted for 61% (119/195). There were no significant differences between the groups’ risk factors for coronary artery diseases and medical history (Table 1) .\n\n【35】  \n\n【36】Analysis of human ALDH2 concentration using the intracoronary ergonovine provocation test: Blood sampling via a radial catheter was performed before and after the intracoronary ergonovine provocation test with CAG. In the negative group, the ALDH2 concentrations before and after CAG were 13.73 ± 36.18 and 9.24 ± 24.76 ng/mL, respectively (Table 1) . In the positive group, the ALDH2 concentrations before and after were 19.79 ± 41.13 and 9.79 ± 21.38 ng/mL, respectively. Moreover, in the positive provocation group, the change in ALDH2 concentration was greater than in the negative provocation group (standard error of the mean: −10.002 ± 4.53, p = 0.03 vs. −4.486 ± 3.469, p = 0.199; Table 2 ).\n\n【37】  \n\n【38】Discussion\n----------\n\n【39】The human ALDH2 gene, one of 19 functional ALDH genes, is expressed in many tissues, especially in the liver, kidney, and muscle. It is also present in organs with abundant mitochondrial content, including the heart and brain \\[22\\] . Guo et al. reported that ALDH polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, possibly because of interfering high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and endothelial asymmetric dimethylarginine levels \\[10,23\\] . Xu et al. reported that ALDH polymorphisms could be considered a genetic risk marker for the acute coronary syndrome \\[24\\] . Recent studies have shown that ALDH2 polymorphisms that inactivate ADLH2 may contribute to cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of ALDH2 in the cardiovascular system has not yet been ascertained. Moreover, human ALDH2 plasma levels have not been elucidated.\n\n【40】This is the first study investigating the ALDH2 concentration in human vasospastic angina.\n\n【41】According to the intracoronary ergonovine provocation test, the study showed that vasospasm was induced in 39% of the subjects. The baseline human ALDH2 concentrations differed between the negative and positive provocation groups. The mean baseline ALDH2 value was higher in the positive provocation group than in the negative provocation group (mean ± SD, 19.79 ± 41.13 _vs._ 13.73 ± 36.18; Figure 3 ).\n\n【42】  \n\n【43】The difference in ALDH2 concentration was much larger in the positive provocation group than in the negative provocation group (−10.002 ± 4.53 _vs._ −4.486 ± 3.469; Table 2 ). This result could be due to the higher baseline ALDH2 concentration in the positive provocation group compared with that in the negative provocation group.\n\n【44】The human ALDH2 concentration in the peripheral blood after the provocation test was not significantly different because there is a large amount of mitochondrial ALDH2 in the liver and heart, and ALDH2 has rapid metabolic activity in these tissues.\n\n【45】In summary, if a stimulus is applied to the cardiovascular system, serum ALDH2 is consumed to stimulate reactions. Thus, in a short time, the serum ALDH2 level is reduced to a lower level than is normal. Then, over time, a large amount of ALDH2 is activated and secreted into the circulating blood from mitochondrial tissue. When repeated, this cycle became a factor contributing to the elevated baseline ALDH2 level in the positive provocation group owing to coronary vasospasm (Figure 4) .\n\n【46】  \n\n【47】Several limitations of the present study should be mentioned:\n\n【48】1.  The study was based on retrospective data.\n2.  We did not perform the ELISA test repeatedly for accurate measurement of mitochondrial ALDH2 concentration in the plasma.\n3.  Blood samples were stored for a long time, and the ELISA test could not detect deterioration of the plasma. Despite these limitations, this analysis could provide helpful information about the clinical features of patients who underwent the ergonovine provocation test and the investigation of human ALDH2 concentration.\n\n【49】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【50】ALDH2 concentration levels were more elevated in the positive provocation group than in the negative provocation group, and the difference in ALDH2 concentration was much larger in the positive provocation group.  \n\n【51】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【52】The authors thank Dr. Jin Seo Yang, Department of Neurosurgery, Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, College of Medicine, Hallym University for his assistance with illustrations.\n\n【53】Author contributions: Conceptualization: Kyu Tae Park,  Hyun Hee Choi, and Kyung-Soon Hong; Data curation: Kyu Tae Park; Formal Analysis: Kyu Tae Park, Hyun Hee Choi, and Kyung-Soon Hong; Investigation: Kyu Tae Park, Hyun Hee Choi, and Kyung-Soon Hong; Methodology: Kyu Tae Park, Hyun Hee Choi; Project Administration: Kyu Tae Park, Hyun Hee Choi, and Kyung-Soon Hong; Writing – Original Draft: Kyu Tae Park and Kyung-Soon Hong; Writing – Review & Editing: Kyu Tae Park, Hyun Hee Choi and Seok Jun.\n\n【54】Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this report in accordance with the journal’s patient consent policy.\n\n【55】Ethics statement: The study protocol was approved by the Cardiology Ethics Committee, institutional review board of Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital (IRB No. 2017-36).

Rarely, infliximab has been associated with Drug-Induced Aseptic Meningitis (DIAM), a potentially serious side effect.\n\n【7】Case presentation: A 43-year-old woman with a medical history of Crohn’s disease was treated with infliximab for ten months. She developed headaches, fever, and confusion 24 hours after the last infliximab infusion. Her neurological examination and the complete laboratory work-up were compatible with infliximab-induced aseptic meningitis. Infliximab was discontinued, and the symptoms resolved within ten days post-infusion.\n\n【8】Conclusion: Infliximab-associated meningitis is a rare disease that mimics infectious meningitis.\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Infliximab (IFX) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNFα) used to treat moderate to severe Crohn’s disease (CD) \\[1\\] . Although it is generally well tolerated in most patients, IFX has been associated with Drug-Induced Aseptic Meningitis (DIAM), a rare but serious adverse event. There have been only nine previously reported cases \\[2–9\\] .  \n\n【11】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 43-year-old woman presented with fever, headache, and confusion during treatment for a CD with IFX. Symptoms developed 24 hours post-infusion. The patient experienced muscle weakness, nausea, and vomiting two days after each of the previous IFX infusions (5 mg/kg every eight weeks). Monotherapy with IFX was initiated ten months before, and the patient was in remission. The brain’s neurological examination and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was normal.\n\n【13】The Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) examination revealed elevated white blood cell count (10 cells/μL) with lymphocytic predominance (90%), normal protein, and negative bacteriological cultures. Serum and CSF tests for viruses, bacteria, tuberculosis, syphilis, West Nile Virus (WNV), and encephalitis were all negative (Table) . The Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed generalized spike and slow wave discharges (Figure) . Anticonvulsant treatment with levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily was initiated, and the symptoms resolved after ten days. CSF analysis and the resolution of symptoms raised the diagnosis of DIAM.\n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Discussion\n----------\n\n【16】The number of patients treated with IFX is growing rapidly around the world. Over 2.8 million people were exposed to this drug from 1998 to 2018 \\[1\\] . A very rare but significant side effect of IFX is DIAM. A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE to identify studies reporting on IFX-induced meningitis revealed only nine previous cases. Six cases were reported in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) \\[8\\] , two with rheumatoid arthritis \\[3,9\\] , and one with psoriatic arthritis \\[10\\] . The duration of therapy with IFX varies between cases. Most of them, including our case, were treated with IFX for less than a year before the onset of DIAM.\n\n【17】The time interval between drug exposure and DIAM symptoms ranged from a few hours up to two weeks \\[2–9\\] . Symptoms are headache and fever accompanied by neck stiffness, arthralgia, and myalgia. The resolution of symptoms ranged from one to two weeks.\n\n【18】The patient, in this case, reported having an acute reaction after each of the IFX infusions, with symptom resolution 48 hours post-infusion. According to reported cases, there are three more patients that described self-restricted adverse reactions after IFX infusion \\[4,5,8\\] . All patients had a milder acute reaction to an earlier dose that was compatible with a serum sickness reaction. In 2004, a large clinical trial described that 2.8% of patients had serum sickness reactions with IFX \\[10\\] . Moreover, the previously described cases were on co-treatment with steroids. In contrast with, our patient and did not develop DIAM until steroids were tapered or stopped. The contribution of steroids in preventing DIAM is debatable, but it can give us an idea of possible future treatment.\n\n【19】The diagnostic workup of DIAM requires infectious and other causes to be excluded. CSF analysis is crucial. A review of the literature showed that examination of CSF demonstrates neutrophil-predominant pleocytosis (10 cells/mm 3 –1000 cells/mm 3 ), normal to low glucose, and increased protein. By way of exception, our case is the third in total, which is excluded from the average by having predominantly lymphocyte-type cells.\n\n【20】We are proposing the following criteria to be met for the diagnosis of DIAM: patients with underlying autoimmune disease (e.g. Inflammatory Bowel Disease), relevant medical history, CSF pleocytosis (> 5 cells/mm 3 ), which can be neutrophil-predominant, negative cultures, MRI of the brain and whole-body Computed Tomography (CT) scan for the exclusion of paraneoplastic syndrome, negative autoimmunity-related antibodies, resolution of symptoms on drug withdrawal and absence of any other explanation. Moreover, our case introduces an additional criterion in the diagnosis of DIAM, the need for EEG. The above examination, despite the absence of symptoms, indicated pathological findings and mandated the administration of anti-convulsant prophylaxis.\n\n【21】The exact pathophysiological mechanism of DIAM is unknown. The two proposed mechanisms are inhibition of TNF-α and hypersensitivity reaction to the drug \\[1\\] . In view of peripheral inhibition of TNF, it could enhance the action of brain-derived TNF-α and lead to side effects in the central nervous system. Alternatively, DIAM may be related to an atypical form of an immune complex-derived allergic reaction (type III reaction) as it occurs several days to weeks after the administration of the drug. In light of this hypothesis, serum sickness reactions are reported in one-fourth of patients who received infliximab after at least a 2-year treatment interval, and affected patients develop high titers of anti-infliximab antibodies \\[1\\] . Most likely, then, the mechanism of serum sickness is hypothesized to be the prevailing one.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【23】This case calls attention to a rare and unusual occurrence of aseptic meningitis in a patient on anti-TNFα. Initially, our case emerges a rare observation that CSF analysis demonstrates lymphocytic-predominant pleocytosis. Given the key role of tumor necrosis factor in the innate immune response, patients receiving treatment with IFX are probably susceptible to neurological diseases with a lymphocytic type of CSF like Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Syphilis, Viral Encephalitis (WNV, Herpes Simplex Virus) and Malignancies-Lymphomas. On close analysis and appraisal, we highlight the need for the exclusion of previously mentioned diseases in order to diagnose DIAM. Moreover, we emphasize the importance of performing an EEG in every patient with DIAM suspicion and the administration of anticonvulsants for pathological findings. The fact that our patient appears to have serum sickness symptoms in response to prior infusions, without steroids co-therapy as in the mentioned cases, represents a part of the hypersensitivity phenomenon. Considering the perceived documents, the pathophysiology of infliximab-induced DIAM could be attributed to an immune-mediated process.\n\n【24】To conclude, we suggest that clinicians should be aware of IFX side effects. Headaches can go unrecognized if the clinician is not aware of the DIAM possibility. Given the possible implications in the clinical practice of IFX, administration by a maintenance regimen rather than episodic treatments, avoidance of prolonged drug holidays, and steroids as pretreatment are warranted.\n\n【25】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【26】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

We review the available literature regarding the fruit and betacyanins and offer clinical pearls to aid in differentiating this benign occurrence from more common and dangerous causes of red-colored stools.  \n\n【7】Introduction\n------------\n\n【8】Haematochezia is the most common presentation of lower gastrointestinal bleeding and is a frequent diagnosis resulting in admission or outpatient attendance to gastroenterology and colorectal services. Common causes of per rectal bleeding include diverticular bleeding, hemorrhoids, colorectal malignancy, colonic and rectal polyps, colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, anal fissures, and vascular malformations \\[1,2\\] . Less common causes include hemorrhagic enteritis, bacterial or amoebic dysentery, vasculitides such as Henoch-Schonlein purpura, intestinal amyloidosis, and blood dyscrasias such as hemophilia or leukemia \\[3\\] . Known mimics of haematochezia with red discoloration of stool include ingestion of beets, red food coloring, cherry syrup, and medications such as cefdinir or rifampicin \\[3,4\\] .\n\n【9】About half of patients with per rectal bleeding presenting to the emergency department are admitted, and 80% of lower gastrointestinal bleeding stops spontaneously. Overall mortality ranges from 2% to 4%, and the mean length of stay for admitted patients varies from 5.4 days to 7.2 days \\[1,2,5\\] .\n\n【10】The red dragon fruit ( Selenicereus costaricensis , previously Hyloreus costaricensis ), also known as the Costa Rican pitaya fruit, belongs to the climbing Cactaceae family and most often takes on an oval shape (Figure 1) . Several varieties of dragon fruit are grown – the pulp of the fruit may be red or white in color, and the skin can be red or yellow. The seeds of the fruit resemble that of the kiwifruit and are embedded within the fruit pulp \\[6\\] .\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】The dragon fruit is cultivated and consumed worldwide due to its sweet flavor and increasing interest in pharmaco-therapeutic benefits as a “wonder fruit” \\[6,7\\] . The postulated activity of the fruit’s phytoconstituents includes nutraceutical (vitamins B1, B2, B3, and C), anti-oxidant (gallic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, lycopene, β-carotene), anti-microbial (betacyanin), anti-cancer (β-amyrin, β-sitosterol, stigmast-4-en-3-one) and anti-diabetic effects (flavonoids) \\[6–12\\] . In addition, Pitaya fruits are rich in micronutrients such as calcium and zinc while also containing high concentrations of betacyanin within the pulp and peel of the fruit \\[6\\] .\n\n【13】To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first case report documenting hospital admission with a benign presentation of blood-red stools following red dragon fruit ingestion. We review the available literature regarding the fruit and betacyanins and offer clinical pearls to aid in differentiating this benign occurrence from more common and dangerous causes of red-colored stools.\n\n【14】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】Our patient is a 74-year-old Chinese gentleman who was admitted to our hospital’s colorectal department with red-colored stools for evaluation of per rectal bleeding.\n\n【16】He reported a one-day history of bloodred water discoloration in his toilet bowl after painless defecation of formed stools (Figure 2) The patient did not notice the passage of fresh red blood or maroon stools. He denied anal pain, constipation, changes in bowel habits, tenesmus, abdominal pain, fever, or constitutional symptoms such as weight loss and anorexia. He reported that his urine appeared concentrated and orange in color but denied any bloodred urine. The patient reported a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension and ischaemic heart disease with previous percutaneous coronary intervention eight years ago. He was on aspirin anti-platelet therapy at 100 milligrams every morning and was a teetotaller and non-smoker. A colonoscopy performed nine years ago was unremarkable, and the patient had rubber band ligation performed for hemorrhoids in the same setting. He did not have any previous abdominal surgery or personal or family history of malignancy. The patient did not have a history of bleeding diathesis or hematological disorders. On closer review of his history, it was noted that the patient had consumed about three whole red dragon fruits in the preceding day as he had read that it would help with the prevention of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Abdominal examination was negative for tenderness, peritonism, masses, hernia, or surgical scars. On inspection of the perineal region, there was no anal fissure, perianal abscesses, or fistula tracts. There were red stains on digital rectal examination but no rectal masses or altered blood. Proctoscopy revealed congested internal hemorrhoids in the left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior columns, but there was no blood, contact bleeding, or stigmata of recent hemorrhage.\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】The patient was hemodynamically stable in the ward without tachycardia, hypotension, or fever. His initial hemoglobin was normal at 13.0 g/L and remained stable on a repeat reading the following morning. Platelet count and coagulation tests were within normal range. Urinalysis and microscopy did not reveal any haematuria. The patient was allowed a diet and discharged on the second day of admission without the need for fluid boluses or transfusion of blood products. Stool occult blood testing was not performed as the patient’s clinical picture was not suggestive of significant gastrointestinal bleeding, and early endoscopy had been arranged. The patient reported another episode of passing red stools on the day of discharge from the hospital but returned to the passage of brown-formed stools on day three of his initial presentation.\n\n【19】Outpatient colonoscopy revealed only two descending and sigmoid colon sessile polyps of two- and three-millimeter size, respectively (Figure 3) . Notably, there was no colonic diverticula or cancer seen. Pathological assessment after polypectomy confirmed complete removal with clear margins of two tubular adenomas containing low-grade dysplasia.\n\n【20】  \n\n【21】He remained well at follow-ups 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after his admission. Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of his case and relevant clinical and endoscopic images for the purposes of research and medical education.\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】Studies have demonstrated that the red-fleshed variety of dragon fruit has a high concentration of betacyanins, ranging between 25.6 milligrams to 49.9 milligrams per kilogram of fruit, depending on the location of origin \\[12\\] . Beetroots contain even higher concentrations of betalains, which are a heterogeneous group of readily water-soluble compounds, including red-violet betacyanin and yellow betaxanthins. In red beetroots, betanin and its isomer C15 betanin are the most prevalent betalains and give the fruit its typical red color. The concentration of betanin typically measures up to 300 milligrams–600 milligrams per kilogram of fruit \\[13\\] . As a result, 10%–14% of the general population develops beeturia or the excretion of red-colored urine after consumption of red beetroot fruit or juice \\[14\\] . The red discoloration results from the urinary excretion of betalains and their metabolites \\[15\\] . Studies have demonstrated that beeturia is more common in iron deficiency and co-ingestion of oxalate-rich food due to increased intestinal uptake of betacyanins \\[14,16\\] .\n\n【24】While there have been no studies on the mechanism of stool discolouration with red dragon fruit ingestion, there have been two post-mortem case reports of purple colonic discoloration attributed to the ingestion of large amounts of beetroot \\[17,18\\] . The purple discoloration of the colon was deepest on surfaces exposed to intra-luminal fecal content. It was removed with dialysis, suggesting coloration by an ingested compound readily soluble in water, such as betanin. In addition, liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry confirmed three ingredients of beetroot in the colonic tissue – betanin, isobetanin, and aglycone betanidine \\[17\\] .\n\n【25】With the growing recognition of dragon fruit as a “wonder fruit” due to the myriad of phytoconstituents and postulated pharmaco-therapeutic benefits \\[6–12\\] , it is very likely that consumption of the fruit will continue to increase worldwide as the number of people seeking alternative strategies for the treatment of conditions such as cancer and diabetes increases alongside growing health literacy, including the patient in our case report.\n\n【26】It is thus valuable to recognize the potential presentation of red dragon fruit ingestion with red-colored stools, as described in our case report. While the patient in our case report was found to have congested internal hemorrhoids on a background of anti-platelet therapy for ischaemic heart disease, an alternative cause for his presentation is suggested by the following reasons:\n\n【27】1.  Short one-day history of symptoms with a strong temporal relation to ingestion of significant volumes of red dragon fruit.\n2.  Absence of a preceding history of cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease, diverticular bleeding, or recent bleeding hemorrhoids.\n3.  Absence of hemodynamic instability, the necessity of fluid boluses or blood transfusion, decreased hemoglobin level on repeat phlebotomy, or frank passage of altered blood to suggest diverticular bleeding or massive upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding.\n4.  Absence of contact bleeding of hemorrhoids or stigmata of recent hemorrhage upon bedside proctoscopy.\n5.  Presence of formed stool and visible dragon fruit seeds in a photograph taken by the patient of his toilet bowl shortly before presenting to the hospital (Figure 4) .\n6.  Confirmation of an absence of diverticula, cancer, and vascular malformations during eventual outpatient colonoscopy.\n\n【28】  \n\n【29】  \n\n【30】Nevertheless, the authors recommend a thorough history and examination, including digital rectal examination and proctoscopy, hemodynamic and biochemical monitoring in a setting appropriate to the patient’s medical condition, and consideration of the patient’s symptom constellation and medical history when faced with admission or consult for per rectal bleeding. While early recognition may potentially spare the patient from invasive investigations such as endoscopy, red stool discoloration from significant ingestion of betacyanin-rich food such as red dragonfruit or beetroot remains a benign condition that should not be a forefront competitor of other more dangerous and insidious pathologies. Quantitative measurement of betalains such as betanin in serum, urine, or stool to support this benign diagnosis remains challenging and unlikely to see widespread employment in the clinical setting due to a complicated extraction process and the need for high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection \\[19\\] . Fecal occult blood testing was not performed on our patient as the clinical picture was inconsistent with significant gastrointestinal bleeding, and an early endoscopy had been arranged for him. While red dragon fruit has not been described to be among the peroxidase-rich fruits which confound guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing, the use of modern fecal immunohistochemistry testing will be useful in excluding true per rectal bleeding, should it be available \\[20\\] . Colonoscopy remains essential in colorectal cancer screening and in the diagnostic evaluation of haematochezia \\[1,2,5\\] . This was performed for the patient in our case report with the finding of benign colonic adenomas.\n\n【31】Declarations\n------------\n\n【32】Funding: No funding was involved.\n\n【33】Ethics Approval: No ethics review board or ethics approval was sought for this case report as the patient had provided consent and there was no human experimentation involved.\n\n【34】Consent to Participate: The case patient has given written and verbal consent for the publication of images and medical information for the furtherance of medical research and education.\n\n【35】Consent for Publication: The case patient has given written and verbal consent for the publication of images and medical information for the furtherance of medical research and education.\n\n【36】Availability of Data: Not applicable.\n\n【37】Code Availability: Not applicable.\n\n【38】Authors Contributions\n---------------------\n\n【39】Leong EKF was responsible for literature review, writing and paper revision.  \n\n【40】Yew A was responsible for literature review, paper revision and critique.\n\n【41】Lin NS was responsible for formulation of the article, paper revision, critique and quality assessment.\n\n【42】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【43】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

We prioritize patients’ wishes at our hospital. Herein, we report the current situation along with reports of five patients who were treated with hyperthermia combined with extremely low-dose chemotherapy with in over 6 years. Five patients in their range of 42 years–72 years were histologically diagnosed with prostate cancer. The Gleason scores of the patients were 3 + 4, 4 + 4, 5 + 5, 8, and 5 + 5, respectively. No metastasis was observed in any case. The treatment interval was once a week immediately after the commencement of treatment, six cycles were administered as one course, and after 2–3 courses, the therapy was continued at a frequency of approximately once a month. Outpatient treatment was performed for up to 15 years, and the level of prostate-specific antigen was stable at approximately 1 ng/mL in four cases and 4 ng/mL–6 ng/mL in one case. Our treatment appears to be effective in patients with a high probability of developing Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer as it suppresses disease progression over a long period.\n\n【7】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【8】IPSA: Initial Prostate Specific Antigen; CAB: Combined Androgen Blockade Therapy; IMRT: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy; WW: Watchful Waiting; CDDP: Cis-Diammine Dichloro-Platinum (II); DXT: Docetaxel; GnRH: Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone; CRPC: Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer; mEHT: Modulated Electro-Hyperthermia  \n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】The goal of cancer treatment is to eradicate cancer through surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy completely. The other goal is to live with cancer for a long period while suppressing cancer symptoms and controlling exacerbations, even without a complete cure.\n\n【11】Hyperthermia as a form of therapy has been used since the 1950s \\[1\\] and has long been used to treat various malignant tumors. Its effectiveness has been reported in combination with radiotherapy and anticancer drugs \\[2–4\\] . On the other hand, magnetic hyperthermia, which acts inside the cells directly, has also been tried previously and applied to various cancer types \\[5,6\\] . However, this treatment is an adjuvant therapy with an image as the treatment of choice at the patient’s request. Although the available facilities are gradually increasing, they are still limited. On the other hand, this treatment is one of the low-aggressive therapies with minimum side effects, does not decrease the effectiveness of the combination of low-dose anticancer drugs, and can be used for a long time. Furthermore, several patients request this treatment.\n\n【12】Insurance coverage for hyperthermia treatment was expanded in April 2020 in Japan, making it financially easier to receive treatment. Moreover, the need for hyperthermia treatment is gradually increasing owing to the rapid spread of information through the Internet. Therefore, in recent years, new models have been developed, and this therapy has entered a new generation.\n\n【13】In April 2021, we introduced a new model, “ASKF 8” (Shonai Creative Industry Co., Ltd. Japan) (Figure) , in addition to the “Thermotron RF8” (Yamamoto VINITOR Co., Ltd. Japan), which we have been using for a long time, to make thermotherapy available to meet the needs of our patients. When localized, prostate cancer is considered a good indication for hyperthermia therapy. There have been reports in Japan since the 1980s \\[7\\] and several basic and clinical reports worldwide \\[8–11\\] . Herein, we report the cases of five patients with prostate cancer who were treated with hyperthermia in combination with extremely low-dose chemotherapy for more than 6 years. We also present the current status of treatment for cancer patients at our hospital.\n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【16】We managed five histologically diagnosed prostate cancer cases in patients aged 42 years–72 years, and the age at the commencement of treatment was used. The Gleason scores of the patients were 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 4 = 8, 5 + 5 = 10, 8 (no description given), and 5 + 5 = 10, respectively, and the initial Prostate Specific Antigen (iPSA) ranged from 4.9 ng/ml to 10.5ng/mL. None of the patients had metastases at diagnosis. Combined Androgen Blockade Therapy (CAB) was used as pretreatment in four patients, and Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) was administered to one patient.\n\n【17】The background for introducing hyperthermia was as follows: in one patient, watchful waiting was initially performed owing to the patient’s refusal of hormone therapy. The patient later accepted hyperthermia at the recommendation of his physician, who had been in charge of the patient since the initial diagnosis. The patient also underwent IMRT and CAB simultaneously. The other four patients were not convinced of the recommendation for drug therapy other than surgery or hormonal therapy and requested hyperthermia because they were concerned about the side effects of aggressive therapy. The second patient still received a combination of chlormadinone acetate, and his PSA levels were measured. The other three had not received hormonal therapy since the onset of hyperthermia therapy. All patients were treated with cis-di ammine dichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP), docetaxel (DTX), or both in alternating extremely low doses (CDDP, DXT 5 mg/body each), two patients were treated with IMRT, and one was treated with cyberknife (Table) . Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) was not administered to any of the patients.\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】In all but one case, the imaging diagnosis was based on CT and other imaging modalities that were regularly performed at our hospital. In addition, the third patient underwent periodic PSA and CT examinations during follow-up after IMRT at another hospital.\n\n【20】Results\n-------\n\n【21】After two or three courses, treatment was continued once a month, and the highest priority was given to the patient’s wishes. The duration of treatment was 9, 8, and 6 years in cases 1, 3, and 5, respectively, and two patients were treated as outpatients for > 15 years. During the treatment period, none of the four patients developed distant metastasis, their general condition was stable, and no side effects of anticancer drugs were observed.\n\n【22】Although accurate quality of life scores was not obtained, all five patients confirmed that their quality of life did not decline after treatment and that they were able to continue treatment for more than six years.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】At our institution, we administer low-aggressive cancer treatment in line with the patient’s wishes. Although this was a retrospective study and the number of patients was small, this report of five patients with prostate cancer confirmed that all patients had made satisfactory progress without developing Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). Although hyperthermia alone is not sufficient to achieve the desired effect, many studies have reported its use in combination with other therapies.\n\n【25】In 2006, Baronzio et al. reported that hyperthermia improves the immune system of patients with cancer, in addition to the previously reported relationship between heat shock proteins and immunotherapy. They described it as a complex effect on cancer involving many immune response systems \\[12\\] . In 1995, Tanaka reported in detail the significance and role of hyperthermia in combination with radiation therapy \\[13\\] , and in 2008, he reported its usefulness in the Hyperthermia Cancer Thermotherapy Guidebook \\[14\\] . In particular, there have been many reports on the usefulness of hyperthermia in combination with radiotherapy for the management of prostate cancer \\[9–11\\] . Regarding concomitant therapy with anticancer agents, Imada reported that concomitant therapy with low doses of anticancer agents in the same guidebook had fewer side effects and maintained its efficacy. However, he emphasized that localized disease is an important condition for useful effects \\[15\\] .\n\n【26】In 2020, Oei et al. reviewed the mechanisms of hyperthermia, combined with clinical and experimental results \\[16\\] . They reported that the mechanisms of hyperthermia included inhibition of various DNA repair processes, direct and indirect reduction of hypoxic tumor cell percentages, enhancement of drug uptake, and increased perfusion and oxygen levels. As more research will be performed, a multidisciplinary approach with different modalities, including hyperthermia, might further increase antitumor effects and diminish normal tissue damage in the future.\n\n【27】This is a great advantage for outpatient treatment facilities, such as ours, that do not have inpatient wards, as it allows for less aggressive treatment with reduced patient burden and schedules according to the patient’s preference. In the same guidebook, Ueda states that prostate cancer is a good indication for patients with localized disease, good radiosensitivity, and concerns about the side effects of anticancer drugs and hormone therapy \\[17\\] . We have used hyperthermia therapy in combination with low-dose anticancer drugs for more than 6 years in patients with cancers other than prostate cancer, and compliance has been excellent. In particular, patients with prostate cancer are very sensitive to DTX, and the five cases that were administered DXT in this report were individual cases; therefore, we cannot make conclusions regarding the usefulness of DTX in these patients. However, none of the five patients has developed CRPC so far. Moreover, we believe that we can respond adequately to patients with CRPC who wish to receive less aggressive treatments.\n\n【28】In addition, Kanamori et al. reported a new concept of oncothermia (Modulated Electro-Hyperthermia, mEHT) in hyperthermia cancer therapy in detail \\[18\\] . Oncothermia, also known as mEHT, is a new treatment method for cancer hyperthermia. It is important to consider thermal effects and non-thermal effects (independent of temperature rise), such as inducing programmed cell death (apoptosis) of tumor cells and using low-power radio frequency to reduce side effects, such as burns. This therapy is a useful option for cancer treatment in combination with other therapies while reducing side effects as much as possible. Several recent studies on prostate cancer have also described the effectiveness of hyperthermia combined with other treatments \\[19–21\\] . However, in Germany, a 14-year study on prostate cancer focal treatment (23,677 cases) showed that hyperthermia accounts for a very small percentage (< 3%) and has not increased \\[22\\] .\n\n【29】Many patients wish to avoid anticancer drug regimens and immuno-oncology drugs, which may cause unpredictable side effects. Given the ever-increasing number of patients who request so-called low-aggressive therapies, we are confident that their demand for hyperthermia therapy will increase in the future.\n\n【30】We sincerely hope that the number of facilities that provide hyperthermia therapy will gradually increase through the use of thermotherapy and that the environment in which patients can receive low-aggressive treatment will expand.\n\n【31】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【32】We have reported five cases of hyperthermia in combination with extremely low-dose chemotherapy for over six years. Our treatment appears to be effective in patients with a high probability of developing CRPCas it suppresses disease progression over a long period.\n\n【33】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【34】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

The WHO’s Strategy Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization recommended use for all age groups 18 and above. However, after the ChAdOx CoV-19 vaccine rollout, allergic reaction following ChAdOx CoV-19 vaccination was reported, causing vaccine hesitancy. Although a heterologous prime-boost strategy could be used in those who have had such an allergic reaction, the safety and vaccine efficacy of such a strategy remains controversial. Instead, it may be safer for such patients to be re-vaccinated with the same vaccine associated with allergic reactions. Thus, we report seven cases of successful safe re-vaccination in individuals who had previously experienced immediate/delayed urticaria/angioedema following vaccination with the ChAdOx CoV-19 vaccine.\n\n【7】Introduction\n------------\n\n【8】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination is one of the strategies used to mitigate the disease severity during the worldwide pandemic. Vaccination is encouraged in all populations since it is proven effective in preventing disease. However, some adverse events following immunization are of concern, including allergic reaction \\[1,2\\] – rash, burning skin sensation, and red welts on the face and lips. In addition, vaccine hypersensitivity can harm the vaccine and affect the decision to receive the next vaccination dose.\n\n【9】The AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 (ChAdOx CoV-19) vaccine is a viral vector vaccine that was approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use in February 2021 \\[3\\] . After vaccine rollouts, rash, angioedema, and anaphylaxis associated with COVID-19 vaccination were reported \\[4–6\\] . The unknown mechanism is believed to be due to either IgE or non-IgE mediated hypersensitivity. Due to the situation in Thailand, the ChAdOx CoV-19 vaccine was the main vaccine available, and mRNA vaccines, along with most other platforms, were unavailable. Thus, re-vaccination was considered in case of a negative skin test for polysorbate.\n\n【10】Polysorbate 80, a potential allergen, is an excipient in the ChAdOx CoV-19 vaccine \\[7\\] . A previous study found that polysorbate 80 could cause severe nonimmunological anaphylaxis \\[8\\] and cause type IV hypersensitivity \\[9\\] . Also, cross-reactivity between Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and polysorbate has been reported \\[10\\] . It has been suggested that patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to polysorbate should avoid vaccination with the ChAdOx CoV-19 vaccine. The mRNA vaccine may be a preferable option \\[11\\] . However, there is a lack of data on the vaccine efficacy of using a heterologous prime-boost strategy. Vaccine types are limited in some countries with governmental strategic plans for mass vaccination. Allergology work-up by allergists and sharing decision-making with patients should be performed. According to the ENDA/EAACI position paper’s recommendation, re-vaccination may be considered in individuals with a negative skin test to the excipients and those assessed as medium risk \\[12,13\\] .\n\n【11】Pre-medication with an antihistamine remains a controversial issue because it may mask the initial symptom of systemic reactions, causing delayed diagnosis. However, pre-medication may be considered in individuals with a history of mild allergic reactions \\[13\\] .\n\n【12】Thus, we describe a case series of the vaccination outcomes in individuals who experienced urticaria/angioedema following vaccination with the ChAdOx CoV-19 vaccine, the subsequent skin testing results, and the re-vaccination outcomes.\n\n【13】Materials and Methods\n---------------------\n\n【14】A prospective study was conducted in the Allergy Unit of Ramathibodi Hospital, a tertiary university hospital of Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Ethical approval was granted by the Ramathibodi HospitalInstitutional Review Board (MURA2021/641). Inclusion criteria were individuals who had urticaria/angioedema following vaccination with the ChAdOx CoV-19 vaccine at any time of reaction onset after vaccination between July 1, 2021, and September 30, 2021. Informed consent was obtained from the included patients. Individuals who denied signing the consent form or were pregnant mothers were excluded. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n【15】Patients’ demographic data, characteristics of reactions, and underlying diseases were collected. The reaction was classified by time-to-onset the reaction. An immediate reaction was defined as occurring within two hours of vaccination \\[14\\] , and a delayed reaction was defined as occurring more than two hours after vaccination. Allergology skin testing of polyethylene glycol 1500 (PEG 1500), polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000), and polysorbate 80 were performed. The reference concentration was applied according to the method of a previous study \\[13\\] . Full-dose re-vaccination with/without antihistamine premedication was performed. The outcomes of re-vaccinations were recorded.\n\n【16】Results\n-------\n\n【17】The characteristics of the seven patients, all of whom were female and had urticaria/angioedema, are shown in (Table) . Five patients developed delayed onset urticaria/angioedema reactions following vaccination with the ChAdOx CoV-19 vaccine. In contrast, one participant developed urticaria within 30 minutes following vaccination, and another participant could not identify the onset of reaction. The skin lesions are shown in (Figure) . In addition, two patients experienced the urticaria and angioedema while three participants had the angioedema reaction, and two participants had an urticaria reaction. The time-to-resolution of these reactions ranged from one hour to five days.\n\n【18】Four patients with negative results performed skin tests for PEG and polysorbate 80 (Table) . In addition, antihistamine premedication was applied in two patients before full-dose re-vaccination with the ChAdOx CoV-19 vaccine.\n\n【19】All participants safely completed the vaccination series; only one participant had a mild reaction, which was urticaria, at 40 hours following re-vaccination.\n\n【20】  \n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】The mechanism of allergic reactions is still unclear \\[15\\] . In the present study, the evidence of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to the vaccine’s excipients could not be confirmed, and skin tests for PEG and polysorbate were negative. However, the basophil activation test was not performed. In a prior study, 2 of 25 patients with allergic reactions had positive evidence of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, implying that non-IgE mediated could be the main mechanism of hypersensitivity reactions following immunization \\[16\\] . In addition, previous studies have shown that polysorbate has the potential to induce urticaria and anaphylactoid reactions \\[8,17,18\\] .\n\n【23】Individuals who have had a negative skin test can probably be re-vaccinated safely. In the present study, we successfully administered full-dose re-vaccination to all seven individuals who had experienced only urticaria/angioedema at any onset following vaccination with the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine. None of these patients had a reaction within 24 hours after vaccination. However, one of the seven patients had urticaria at 40 hours following vaccination. This delayed urticarial rash was resolved by oral antihistamine treatment. This descriptive case series suggests that individuals who had only urticaria/angioedema following vaccination with the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine are not contraindicated to complete a vaccine series. Furthermore, due to the skin test result, this study might confirm that the mechanism of urticaria is not IgE-mediated hypersensitivity.\n\n【24】Premedication with the antihistamine may be considered in patients suspected of mild allergic reaction to the vaccine \\[13\\] . In the present study, we administered premedication of antihistamine to two subjects. Daily use of the antihistamine should be suggested for an individual who has chronic spontaneous urticaria, and the dosage should be adjusted to control the urticarial symptom. However, antihistamine premedication should be avoided in patients suspected of severe allergic reactions because it may mask the systemic reaction, causing delayed diagnosis \\[19,20\\] . Following EAACI 2022 guidelines, a patient with delayed urticaria might not need to have a skin test, and premedication might be considered.\n\n【25】Our study has the limitation of a small sample size because of the change in relevant government policy concerning the recommended vaccine guidelines and the arrival of mRNA vaccines, which precluded further recruitment under our eligibility criteria.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【27】Re-vaccination could be performed safely after diagnostic work-up in individuals who had only urticaria/angioedema at any time of onset following vaccination with the ChAdOx CoV-19 vaccine? Premedication with an antihistamine may be considered in individuals with mild allergic reactions.

The estimated prevalence of ocular manifestations in patients with CD is 3.5%–6.8%, with uveitis, episcleritis, and scleritis comprising most of these cases. Orbital Myositis (OM) is an exceedingly rare ocular EIM which has also been reported. We present a case of a 22-year-old female patient with CD on ustekinumab monotherapy in clinical remission, which was found to have bilateral orbital myositis as an EIM of her CD.\n\n【7】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【8】CT: Computed Tomography; CD: Crohn’s Disease; EIM: Extra-Intestinal Manifestation; OM: Orbital Myositis; c-ANCA: Cytoplasmic Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies; p-ANCA: Perinuclear Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies; IgG-4: Immunoglobulin-4; ACE: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Crohn’s Disease (CD) is a complex inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, which can be associated with extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs). The estimated prevalence of EIMs in patients with CD is 25%–70% \\[1–3\\] . EIMs are commonly musculoskeletal but also include dermatologic, hepatobiliary, and ocular manifestations \\[2\\] . The estimated prevalence of ocular manifestations in patients with CD is 3.5%–6.8%, with uveitis, episcleritis, and scleritis comprising the majority of these cases \\[3\\] . Orbital myositis (OM)—characterized by inflammation of the extra-ocular muscles resulting in periorbital pain worse with eye movement, eyelid swelling, conjunctival chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia—is a rare ocular EIM associated with CD \\[4–7\\] . We describe a case of a patient with CD believed to be in clinical remission on ustekinumab who was diagnosed with bilateral, sequential OM without any evidence of gastrointestinal luminal disease activity. Management implications of CD in a patient with OM, which is not historically known to mirror disease activity, are unclear.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 22-year-old female with colonic Crohn’s Disease (CD) on ustekinumab monotherapy every eight weeks for maintenance of remission presented to the emergency department with three days of right eye swelling and pain with eye movement. She had been diagnosed with CD four years prior. She was initially treated with infliximab as well as azathioprine, which was added to reduce immunogenicity. Her azathioprine was eventually discontinued after one year. After about two years of therapy and one year prior to this presentation, she was transitioned to ustekinumab due to infusion reactions with infliximab. While in the emergency department, a Computed Tomography (CT) of the orbits was performed. Minimal pre-septal tissue swelling of the right orbit without evidence of orbital cellulitis was reported. She was started on Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and sent home from the ED without an ophthalmology consultation. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ophthalmology clinic with a resolution of her right eye symptoms but new, similar symptoms in her left eye. Exam findings demonstrated mild restriction of lateral and medial gazes, painful eye movement, and chemosis of the lateral conjunctiva. She denied gastrointestinal symptoms concerning a Crohn’s flare or other EIMs. The oculoplastic surgeon reviewed the initial orbital CT images, and subtle enlargements of multiple extra-ocular muscles in the right orbit were noted (Figure 1,Figure 2) . At this time, the diagnosis of bilateral, sequential OM was made. After a discussion with her gastroenterologist, she was started on prednisone 40 mg daily, resulting in a complete resolution of her symptoms at her one-week follow-up visit.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Further work-up for her OM revealed a positive Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, stimulating thyroid hormone, and free T4, Cytoplasmic Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (c-ANCA), Perinuclear Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (p-ANCA), Immunoglobulin G-4 (IgG-4), and an Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) level were normal. She continued ustekinumab maintenance therapy as she remained in clinical remission without evidence of other EIMs. She completed the steroid taper and was informed of the high recurrence rate of CD-associated OM.\n\n【15】Discussion\n----------\n\n【16】Orbital myositis is an inflammatory condition that is most commonly idiopathic but can occur in the setting of autoimmunity, neoplasm, trauma, or infection \\[5,9\\] . Acute, idiopathic OM usually has a quick onset and similarly rapid response to oral steroids without clinical, laboratory, or radiographic evidence of other causes. Contrast-enhanced imaging will show involvement of the myotendinous junction in most cases. Autoimmune conditions associated with OM include Thyroid Eye Disease (TED), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), IgG4-related disease, sarcoidosis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and ANCA-associated vasculitides \\[9\\] . Several drugs have been implicated in causing OM, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, alemtuzumab, bisphosphonates, and statins \\[9\\] . Paraneoplastic OM has been reported in breast cancer patients seminoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as lung and gastric malignancies \\[9\\] . The most common infectious etiology for OM is herpes zoster ophthalmicus \\[9\\] . Lyme disease, Whipple disease, Coxsackie virus, COVID-19, and cysticercosis have also been implicated \\[9\\] .\n\n【17】Distinguishing between IBD-associated OM and OM due to other causes requires careful attention and investigation. A literature review revealed that most patients with IBD-associated OM have bilateral eye involvement \\[9\\] . Our patient had bilateral, sequential orbital involvement and a negative laboratory evaluation for thyroid disease, vasculitides, sarcoidosis, and IgG4-related disease. The positive ANA, which in itself is a highly non-specific finding, is believed to be most likely a consequence of the patient’s inflammatory bowel disease, as over 20% of females with IBD may have positive antinuclear antibodies. History of treatment with anti-TNF therapy, in particular, has also been shown to increase the probability of seroconversion to ANA positivity \\[21\\] . Given our ultimate findings, we strongly suspect that our patient’s OM is an EIM of her CD.\n\n【18】CD-associated OM is believed to arise from immune complex-mediated cross-reactivity between colonic mucoproteins and orbital muscles \\[8,10\\] . The muscle most commonly affected is the medial rectus muscle \\[9\\] . A literature review revealed that OM occurs independently of gastrointestinal luminal disease activity, with multiple case reports of OM occurring in active disease but also during clinical remission, as well as years before any reported gastrointestinal symptoms \\[8,11,12\\] .\n\n【19】Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for acute OM \\[13\\] . Typically, 1 mg/kg/day of oral prednisone for 1 week–2 weeks is recommended, followed by a slow taper over 6 weeks–12 weeks \\[13\\] . Our patient was already on immunomodulatory therapy, so she received a lower prednisone dose. Taper duration is based on the initial severity of the disease and clinical response \\[14\\] . In most cases, there is recovery and remission within days to weeks after initiating steroid therapy \\[13\\] . In severe cases of compromised vision, pulse-dosing with intravenous methylprednisolone is recommended \\[15\\] . Despite successful clinical response to steroids in at least 60%–70% of cases \\[16\\], there is a disease recurrence in over a third of patients \\[17\\] . Resistance to steroids is common in patients with IBD-associated OM \\[9\\] . In both steroids, non-responsive and recurrent diseases and alternative therapies include antimetabolites, alkylating agents, rituximab, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors \\[9,18–20\\] . Our patient’s symptoms resolved immediately after starting corticosteroids, and escalation of therapy was not required.\n\n【20】In summary, this case illustrates orbital myositis, a rare CD EIM that occurred bilaterally and sequentially in a patient whose CD was in clinical remission. The list of potential causes of OM is long, and a multidisciplinary effort is crucial to complete a thorough evaluation and determine the proper treatment. Because OM does not mirror gastrointestinal luminal disease activity and the patient was still in clinical remission, therapy adjustment was not pursued. This case reiterates the importance of establishing a timely diagnosis, completing a comprehensive evaluation with assistance from other subspecialty providers, and coordinating close follow-up to ensure continued clinical remission and prevention of recurrence.\n\n【21】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【22】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

We retrospectively evaluated the clinical features and the outcome of these renal transplant recipients.\n\n【9】Results: The overall incidence of kidney cancer in our series was 0, 83%. Three patients developed cancer of the native kidney, and one patient had allograft cancer. The main histological type was papillary carcinoma. The tumors were discovered by Routine ultrasounds in all cases. Radical nephrectomy was performed on the native kidney in three cases. One patient underwent partial nephrectomy, then later on radical nephrectomy of the allograft due to recurrence and progression of cancer. One patient died after the main follow-up of 2 years due to hepatic metastasis.\n\n【10】Conclusion: Kidney cancer after kidney transplantation is associated with multiple complex risk factors. Radical nephrectomy is the treatment of choice with minimization or discontinuation of calcineurin inhibitors and the subsequent introduction of mTORi. However, routine and lifelong screening of both native and renal transplant allografts would allow earlier diagnosis and management of this malignancy.\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). It improves survival and quality of life \\[1\\] . However, kidney transplant recipients have a 2 to 5-fold risk of developing malignancy due to the long-term use of immunosuppressive agents for preserving graft function \\[2\\] . Malignancy contributes to mortality in 9% to 16% of renal transplant recipients \\[3\\] . Urinary tract cancer is reported as the third most common malignancy after kidney transplantation \\[4\\] . Studies demonstrated that the incidence of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is 15 times higher in the native kidneys of Renal Transplant Recipients (RTR) than in the general population \\[5\\] . Here, we report our experience treating four kidney cancer cases after renal transplant and its management.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Between June 1998 and December 2020, 480 patients underwent kidney transplantation at our institution. Of these, four patients (0, 83%) developed a tumor on the native or graft kidney. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical features and the outcome of these renal transplant recipients. This study was approved by the local Ethics committee (Protection committee for Sud Persons, approval number CPP/SUD: 220/2021).\n\n【15】Statistical analysis was not performed in our study. However, informed consent was obtained from all our patients of their close family members.\n\n【16】Results\n-------\n\n【17】The baseline characteristics of the patients with RCC are summarized in (Table) .\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】Case Presentation 1\n-------------------\n\n【20】A 71-year-old male with ESRD since 1996 secondary to nephrosclerosis received a deceased donor renal transplant in November 2002. The immediate post-transplant period was marqued by acute obstructive renal failure due to a blood clot in the ureter with favorable outcomes after surgery. At follow-up, his baseline creatinine levels varied in the range of 100 µmol/L–140 µmol/L. A routine abdominal ultrasound in October 2016 demonstrated a heterogeneous mass in the left native kidney. A Computerized Tomography scan (CT scan) was performed, which revealed a 3 cm × 3.1 cm × 3.3 cm mass in the left native kidney. A nephrectomy of the left native kidney was performed, and a Histopathology Examination (HPE) confirmed papillary RCC Type 1 grade 1 with negative margins. The postoperative period was uneventful. He was switched to Rapamune instead of tacrolimus. Four-year later, in December 2020, the detection of cancer recurrence or extension was negative: CT scan of the abdominopelvic region was normal. In his last follow-up in May 2021, he was doing well, and his creatinine ranged from 90 µmol/L–110 µmol/L.\n\n【21】Case Presentation 2\n-------------------\n\n【22】A 57-year-old male suffering from ESRD secondary to familial nephropathy received a renal transplant from an unrelated living donor in June 2006. At follow-up, his baseline creatinine varied in the range of 80 µmol/L–110 µmol/L. In September 2015, during a routine abdominal ultrasound, he was incidentally diagnosed with a renal mass in the lower pole of the left native kidney. CT scan confirmed a solid enhancing lesion that measures 6.5 cm × 5 cm. In October 2015, a radical nephrectomy of the left native kidney was performed. The postoperative period was uneventful. The HPE confirmed a 7 cm clear cell RCC, grade 2/4 PT1b, with negative margins. He was switched to Rapamune instead of ciclosporin. His baseline creatinine post-transplant was maintained in the range of 80 µmol/L–100 µmol/L. He was lost to follow-up for two years and then died in 2018 due to hepatic metastasis.\n\n【23】Case Presentation 3\n-------------------\n\n【24】A 72-year-old male suffering from ESRD secondary to chronic interstitial nephropathy received a renal transplant from a related living donor in February 2006. The abdominal ultrasound before the renal transplant showed multiple cortical cysts in the native kidney, the largest of which is 2 cm. Post-transplant, his baseline creatinine varied in the range of 150 μmol/L–167 μmol/L. He was treated for four urinary tract infections. A retrograde cystography showed a grade four Vesicoureteral reflux on the graft and a significant post-voiding residue, and a diverticula bladder. Bladder augmentation and ureteral reimplantation were performed in 2016 with a favorable outcome.\n\n【25】In May 2019, during a routine abdominal ultrasound, he was incidentally diagnosed as having a renal mass measuring 7 cm. CT scan confirmed a solid enhancing lesion that measures 7 cm × 6.8 cm. In June 2019, a radical nephrectomy of the native kidney was performed. The postoperative period was uneventful. The HPE confirmed a 7 cm papillary RCC Type 1 grade 1 with negative margins. He was switched to Rapamune instead of ciclosporin. During his last follow-up in February 2021, he was doing well. His baseline creatinine post-transplant was maintained in the range of 100 µmol/L–120 µmol/L.\n\n【26】Case Presentation 4\n-------------------\n\n【27】A 49-year-old female suffering from ESRD secondary to undetermined nephropathy received a renal transplant from a deceased donor in February 2006. The donor was a 40-year-old male with a history of alcohol and tobacco consumption.\n\n【28】The postoperative period was uneventful, and her post-transplant baseline creatinine varied in the range of 100 μmol/L–150 μmol/L. In July 2008, a routine abdominal ultrasound was normal except for increased renal resistive index. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was then performed to detect a Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis (TRAS), and it did not show any abnormalities. In December 2008 (13 months after the renal transplant), the patient was hospitalized for acute obstructive renal failure with creatinine levels = 1000 μmol/L treated by a percutaneous nephrostomy. An abdominal CT scan showed a small solid enhancing mass located at the pyelo ureteral junction of the renal graft. The treatment consisted of uretero-pyelotomy with ureteropyelic anastomosis. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the creatinine level was back at 150 μmol/L. BK virus status was checked and came back negative. The HPE confirmed a 2 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative margins. She was switched to Rapamune instead of tacrolimus. In Mars 2009, the patient underwent a radical nephrectomy of the renal graft due to recurrence and extension of the tumor (bone metastases). She also received carboplatin-based chemotherapy. At the last follow-up in our unit in 2014, she was doing well. There was no locoregional recurrence with stabilization of bone metastases. Since then, the patient has been lost to follow-up.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】RCC is the most common solid-organ malignancy after kidney transplantation \\[1,6\\] . Many studies showed that kidney transplant recipients have a relatively increased risk of 5 to 10-fold for RCC compared with an aged-matched general population \\[7–9\\] . In the current series, the incidence of de novo renal tumors is 0, 83%. The prevalence varies between 0.34% and 5.8%, and this disparity depends on whether screening is performed \\[10\\] . Chewcharat et al. \\[1\\] found in a meta-analysis of 22 articles, including 320.190 kidney transplant recipients, an incidence of 0.7% of RCC after renal transplantation.\n\n【31】In our series, the median time from transplantation to the onset of RCC was 111 months (12 months–168 months) which is a longer time than that reported in the literature. However, in other studies, the time between transplantation and the development of graft RCC is variable (9 months–228 months), similar to our study. A short period of time following the transplantation suggests that it is transmitted from the donor \\[11–13\\] .\n\n【32】RCC usually occurs in native kidney transplants (0.7%), but it can also occur in the allograft (0.2%). In our case series, we only reported one case of adenocarcinoma of the allograft. RCC after transplantation is more frequent in younger male individuals as compared to the general population \\[13\\] . This can be explained by surveillance bias. In our study, three out of 4 patients were males, and two patients were under the age of 60-year-old at the onset of RCC.\n\n【33】The most frequent type of cancer is papillary RCC compared to the general population and dialysis patients. It accounts for more than 30% of cases suggesting a role of immunosuppression in the development of this type of cancer \\[14–16\\] . In our series, papillary de novo RCC on the native kidneys was the most frequent type of tumor, occurring in two out of four patients.\n\n【34】Most RCC in kidney recipients are incidental low–stage, low–grade tumors with a good prognosis \\[12\\] . These tumors are generally small and asymptomatic. Therefore, they are usually diagnosed upon routine imaging, as seen in our study.\n\n【35】Many risk factors have been reported in post-transplant RCC, such as older age, male gender, excess body weight, smoking, positive family history, arterial hypertension, previous RCC prior to kidney transplantation, and longer pretransplant dialysis duration. However, Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease (ACKD) is one of the main risk factors that has been reported \\[17\\] .\n\n【36】Findings from the USRDS \\[18\\] suggest a higher incidence of RCC after deceased kidney transplantation than after living transplantation, highlighting the importance of dialysis duration as a relevant risk factor.\n\n【37】The association between malignancies and immunosuppression in kidney transplants is well established. Calcineurin inhibitors promote tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis due to aberrant production of cytokines and overproduction of TGFβ \\[19,20\\] .\n\n【38】In our study, our patients had many risk factors as described in studies. In fact, they were all on calcineurin inhibitors, and 3 out of 4 patients were males. In addition, the duration in HD was over five years in 3 cases, and the age of the onset of the tumor was over 60 in 3 cases.\n\n【39】Some studies suggest that patients with glomerular diseases are at higher risk of RCC \\[21,22\\] . In fact, the loss of podocytes that envelope glomerular capillaries can often lead to renal cysts \\[28\\] . In contrast, patients with ESRD secondary to diabetes or autosomal polycystic disease have a lower risk of RCC. In addition, repeat kidney transplantation and kidneys from older or male donors are also risk factors for RCC \\[9,23,24\\] .\n\n【40】Thus, some risk factors are modifiable such as the duration of dialysis, which can be shortened by earlier planning of transplantation and encouraging living kidney donation and preemptive transplantation. In addition, immunosuppressive treatment can also be adjusted through level monitoring of immunosuppressive drugs.\n\n【41】The standard surgical treatment for native kidney carcinoma is radical nephrectomy \\[25\\] . Radical nephrectomy on the native kidney was performed for three patients in our study. In the series conducted by Tillou et al. \\[12\\] , 48% of patients who developed allograft malignancies underwent a total graft nephrectomy, 44% nephron-sparing surgery, 6% radiofrequency ablation and the overall estimated malignancy-free survival was 0.4%. In our series, Nephron sparing surgery in patient 4 was not a good alternative to total graft nephrectomy in small tumors of the graft. We noted a recurrence and extension of the tumor shortly after, and the patient had to undergo a radical nephrectomy of her allograft. However, in many case series, this attitude showed good results with no tumor recurrence and allowed to preserve allograft to function at the same time \\[26\\] .\n\n【42】The management of immunosuppression after diagnosis of RCC is not well established, and to our knowledge, there are no specific recommendations in the literature concerning the management of anti-rejection therapy. Mycophenolate mofetil does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of any malignancy \\[19,27\\] . Thus, in de novo low-stage low-grade RCC without metastasis, reduction of anti-rejection therapy with close follow-up is wise. In contrast, switching to a free calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressive regimen in aggressive and metastatic forms of RCC is a reasonable option. Sirolimus and its derivatives are promising therapeutic agents with both immunosuppressant and anti-tumor properties. Many authors have demonstrated that the incidence of cancers was low in patients receiving mTOR inhibitors (mTORi) \\[28\\] . Therefore, the switch from a calcineurin inhibitor regimen to an mTOR regimen could be an interesting alternative option for patients with de novo renal malignancies after transplantation. This was the case for all our patients who were switched from a calcineurin inhibitor regimen to sirolimus.\n\n【43】Systematic kidney transplant recipients screening by annual abdominopelvic US or CT scan is recommended in France, but the American KDIGO clinical practice guidelines and the American Society of Transplantation guidelines do not recommend such screening \\[29\\] .\n\n【44】However, considering the risk of mortality and morbidity, kidney transplant recipients should benefit from a regular ultrasound screening. Likewise, patients with a longer duration of pretransplant dialysis should benefit from more frequent ultrasound monitoring. At our center, an annual ultrasound screening of allograft and native kidneys is performed.\n\n【45】Malignant tumors are theoretically more aggressive in transplant patients compared to the general population and dialysis patients due to the immunosuppressed state. However, the potential aggressivity depends on the grade and size of the tumors.\n\n【46】Usually, the prognosis of low-stage RCC in the native kidneys of renal transplant recipients is favorable \\[21\\] . In contrast, metastatic RCC has a very poor prognosis \\[30\\] . However, in a large French multicenter study, they found better survival in transplant patients with RCC compared to a dialysis cohort. This can be explained by the smaller size of tumors and early diagnosis \\[14\\] .\n\n【47】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【48】The overall incidence of kidney cancer after kidney transplantation was 0, 83%. It is associated with multiple complex risk factors. Identifying modifiable risk factors is of great importance allowing the prevention or at least delaying the occurrence of this complication. Radical nephrectomy is the treatment of choice with minimization or discontinuation of calcineurin inhibitors and the subsequent introduction of mTORi.

Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) is considered the most severe complication of AOSD. Management of bouth diseases poses several challenges, including difficulty in diagnosis and limited therapeutic options.\n\n【7】In this review, we present a case report of a patient treated with AOSD associated with MAS, with the aim of providing a better understanding of the factors involved in poor outcomes and proper care.\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】AOSD is a kind of systemic inflammatory disease with unknown etiology, with a global incidence rate of (0.16–0.40)/100,000 and an estimated prevalence rate of (1-34)/1,000,000 \\[1,2\\] .\n\n【10】The typical clinical manifestations of AOSD include Fever (60%–100%), arthritis or arthralgia (70%–100%), and maculopapular red rash (60%–80%) \\[2\\] . Other reported symptoms include myalgia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, serositis, pharyngitis, and abdominal pain \\[2,3,8\\] . Laboratory tests are characterized by elevated White Blood Cell (WBC), transaminase changes, and elevated Serum Ferritin (SF). Importantly, elevated SF is meaningful for diagnosis, especially SF increased more than 5-fold \\[3\\] . AOSD is primarily diagnosed by excluding other diseases because of the absence of markers for specific diagnosis. Yamaguchi criteria have the highest diagnostic sensitivity of 92% \\[2\\] , including on major criteria \\[Fever ≥ 39°C persisting for ≥ 1 week, arthralgia/arthritis for ≥ 2 weeks, typical nonpruritic salmon-pink skin rash and white blood cell count ≥10×10 9 /L (> 80% neutrophils)\\] and minor criteria \\[sore throat, lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly, abnormal liver function tests and negative IgM rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies (immunofluorescence assay)\\]. For the diagnosis, ≥ 5 criteria must be met, including ≥ two major \\[4\\] , requiring the exclusion of other clinical conditions that may mimic AOSD, including infection, malignancy, and other rheumatologic disorders such as autoimmune diseases and systemic vasculitis \\[4–6\\] .\n\n【11】MAS is one of the most common complications of AOSD, with an incidence rate of over 10% \\[2\\] . It is characterized by a cytokine storm, haemophagocytosis, and multi-organ damage \\[3\\] . Its pathogenesis involves the activation of key innate immune pathways, including IL-1, IL-6, and IL-18, leading to systemic inflammation \\[3\\] . MAS is a group of clinical manifestations with high Fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, decreased blood cells, abnormal liver function, elevated serum ferritin (SF), and high triglycerides (TGs) \\[3,7\\] . MAS can increase the mortality of AOSD. Previous studies have shown that the mortality of patients with AOSD-MAS and the mortality of patients with AOSD is 52.9% and 9.5%, respectively \\[3,7\\] .\n\n【12】Given the severity of MAS, early diagnosis and adequate management are essential in cases of AOSD. This review discusses a case report of a patient diagnosed with AOSD associated with MAS, with the aim of promoting a better understanding of the factors involved in poor prognosis and proper care.\n\n【13】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 48-years-old woman was hospitalized with fever ≥ 39°C that started one month earlier associated with pruritic confluent macropapular rash on upper limbs, trunk and back and polyarthritis on hands, knees and ankles and asymmetrical polyarthralgia of small and medium-sized joints starting 2 weeks ago. Serologies were performed for viral hepatitis, HIV, syphilis, arboviruses, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis, and all results were negative. Other infections, including endocarditis and negative cultures (blood and urine cultures), were excluded. Laboratory results show leukocytosis (26.740 μL) with > 80% neutrophils, hyperferritinemia (17.150 μL), increased liver enzymes, and negative rheumatoid factor and antinuclear factor. The clinical and laboratory findings confirmed the diagnosis of Adult-onset Still’s Disease.\n\n【15】The patient was treated with 1 mg/kg of oral prednisone to attenuate the systemic condition. Later evolved with pancytopenia and daily fever, suggestive of MAS, and was confirmed with a red bone marrow biopsy which showed granulocytic hyperplasia and hemophagocytic syndrome (Figure) . Furthermore, the immunophenotypic study identified T lymphocytosis at the expense of CD8 T lymphocytes, without phenotypic and polyclonal aberrations to TRBC1, in addition to the absence of CD25, which may correspond to a condition secondary to an inflammatory/infectious process. After ten days, she returned with daily fever and worsening laboratory findings, which improved after pulse therapy of methylprednisolone 1 g/day for three days.\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】AOSD is a rare systemic inflammatory condition that is poorly recognized. Significant advances have been made in understanding the disease’s pathogenesis, but important unmet needs related to diagnosis and optimal management remain \\[5\\] . There is a paucity of robust epidemiological data on AOSD, and the true disease burden is difficult to estimate owing to the lack of disease registries and prospective databases and considering that most of the published data are retrospective in nature \\[5\\] .\n\n【19】Chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18, play a crucial role in the progression of illness, resulting in the development of innovative targeted therapeutics \\[6\\] .\n\n【20】AOSD poses many diagnostic challenges as it presents a combination of nonspecific symptoms that a wide variety of other diseases can cause. The lack of pathognomonic serologic or clinical disease markers exacerbates diagnostic delays and disease complications \\[5\\] .\n\n【21】Patients with AOSD experience life-threatening complications, which may rapidly evolve into multiple-organ failure and death. These patients frequently developed MAS, a secondary form of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). The latter is characterized by continuous high fever, extreme hyperferritinemia, pancytopenia, and histopathological evidence of hemophagocytosis by activated macrophages, typically in the bone marrow \\[8\\] .\n\n【22】The characteristics of MAS are very similar to those of AOSD, so it is very difficult to diagnose AOSD with MAS early. Because of its nonspecific clinical characteristics, MAS is not easily distinguished from other diseases, such as systemic infection and malignancy \\[3\\] .\n\n【23】There are no treatment guidelines for AOSD due to its rarity, absence of controlled research, and lack of a standard definition for remission and therapy objectives. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), Corticosteroids (CS), and Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) are used in AOSD treatment. Biological therapy, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, and IL-17 inhibitors, as well as TNFα or Janus-Kinases (JAKs) inhibitors, is administered to patients who do not react to CS and csDMARDs or achieve an inadequate response \\[6,9\\] .\n\n【24】In general, the prognosis of AOSD is favorable, but there is still a mortality rate of 3%, and some serious complications can also lead to death, such as MAS (12%–14%) \\[2,6\\] .\n\n【25】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【26】Early recognition of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) in Adult-onset Still’s Disease (AOSD) patients still remains diagnostically challenging as there is no diagnostic test or even a set of uniform disease diagnostic criteria to differentiate MAS from the underlying systemic inflammatory condition. Although the understanding of AOSD has evolved over the last decade, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of its diagnosis, most useful biomarkers, and treatment approach. Future research in this disease area should aim for the identification and validation of tools for the early diagnosis of AOSD and optimized treatment to prevent chronic articular inflammation as well as irreversible joint damage.\n\n【27】Multiple recent lines of evidence have suggested new insights into AOSD pathogenesis with new therapeutic targets highlighted, thus possibly improving AOSD management in the next future.\n\n【28】AOSD is a rare disease that is challenging to treat but even more difficult to diagnose. This report highlights a case of AOSD associated with MAS that was refractory to oral corticotherapy. The successful use of pulse therapy emphasizes the importance of timely and appropriate management of AOSD and MAS, which can present as a cause of fever of obscure origin and can have fatal consequences if not properly treated.\n\n【29】Limitations\n-----------\n\n【30】Overall, there were some limitations in this case report concerning the quality of the data found in the literature. The majority of the articles were case reports, case series, and cohort or case-control studies. In addition, heterogeneity was evident among the articles owing to a lack of standard assessment parameters.  \n\n【31】Ethical Approval\n----------------\n\n【32】This case report was carried out following the recommendations of the ethics committee of the Cassiano Antonio Moraes University Hospital - HUCAM, Brazil.  \n\n【33】Consent\n-------\n\n【34】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.  \n\n【35】Conflict of Interest\n--------------------\n\n【36】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.
