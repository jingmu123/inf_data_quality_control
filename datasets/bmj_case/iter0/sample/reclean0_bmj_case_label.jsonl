Recurrent relapses result in increasing disability and, therefore, prompt and aggressive treatment is usually necessary. Pathogenic antibodies to aquaporin 4 (AQP4) are expressed in the majority of patients with NMOSD. 1 Rarely, AQP4-positive NMOSD can be a paraneoplastic phenomenon, usually driven by a solid tumour, and the timing between diagnosis of the neoplasm and NMOSD is variable. 1 We present a case of NMOSD, associated with an underlying follicular lymphoma.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A woman in her late 60s reported a 6-week history of progressive bilateral lower limb weakness, paraesthesia and numbness spreading proximally. She also noted a month of abdominal bloating and 1 kg of unintentional weight loss. Examination showed reduced power at hip flexion medical research council muscle power assessment grade 2/5 in the left and 3/5 in the right. Lower limb reflexes were absent and her plantars mute. There was a pinprick sensory level to T4 and impaired proprioception to the ankles. Upper limb and cranial nerve examination was normal. The remainder of her physical examination was normal.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】An MRI of the spine showed longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis extending from C2 to T5, with associated swelling and cord expansion at T2 level . MRI brain was normal. Serum analysis was positive for anti-AQP4 antibodies and hepatitis B core antigen and negative for anti-MOG (Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) antibodies, HIV and syphilis serology. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed normal range white blood cells, lactate, no oligoclonal bands and no elevated immunoglobulins. A diagnosis of NMOSD was made, and as part of her further work up, CT imaging identified extensive para-aortic and pelvic side wall lymphadenopathy, a bulky multifibroid uterus and an adjacent enhancing nodule raising concern of an ovarian lesion. MRI pelvis showed fibroids, with well-visualised and normal appearing ovaries. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan showed an FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose)-avid conglomerate of lymph nodes in the left para-aortic, common iliac, internal iliac, external iliac, right supraclavicular and bilateral subpectoral regions. Subsequent histology of a CT-guided lymph node biopsy identified small to medium-sized lymphoid cells arranged in a vague nodular pattern. Immunohistochemistry showed lymphoid cells positive for CD20, CD79a, CD19, BCL-2, CD10 and BCL-6 and confirmed a low-grade follicular lymphoma. Cyclin-D1 was negative and Ki-67 stained less than 5% of all cells. The patient had a follicular lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI) score of 4 (based on age >60-years old, greater than four nodal sites, haemoglobin of <120 g/L and stage 3 disease).\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【17】(A–C) Sagittal MRI T2 weighted images of upper spine at different stages. Initial images were acquired on presentation and prior to any therapy (A) and show extensive intramedullary high signal from C2-T5 with some cord oedema; there was no pathological enhancement (not shown). Subsequent images taken 4 weeks and 3 weeks after intravenous Methylprednisolone and plasmapheresis, respectively, (B) show regression of the intramedullary high signal and improvement of the cord oedema and further imaging after the third chemotherapy cycle (C) shows further improvement and some subtle cord thinning at T3 level.\n\n【18】Treatment\n---------\n\n【19】The patient was initially treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone at presentation, followed by oral prednisolone. She had a poor clinical response and was transferred to a tertiary neurology centre for a 5-day course of plasma exchange. A repeat MRI spine 3 weeks after plasma exchange showed that the cord lesion had regressed and was visible from C4/5 to T5 , but there was no significant clinical recovery. On discussion between the haematology and neurology teams, it was concluded that the NMOSD was a likely paraneoplastic phenomenon and it was decided to treat the lymphoma, rather than manage her with active observation. Obinutuzumab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (O-CVP) immunochemotherapy was initiated.\n\n【20】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【21】She tolerated two cycles of O-CVP well and repeat neurological assessment performed prior to her third cycle showed an improvement in power (3/5 in hip flexion bilaterally), recovery in hallux proprioception, brisk lower limb reflexes and up-going plantar reflexes. Repeat imaging performed following the patient’s second cycle showed further regression of the longitudinal spinal cord signal change, being barely perceptible on repeat imaging .\n\n【22】During her admission, she received active rehabilitation and following her first cycle of treatment was transferred to an inpatient neurorehabilitation unit for ongoing therapy. Following her third cycle of O-CVP the patient developed neutropenic sepsis requiring an intensive care unit admission, after which no further cycles of treatment were given. A PET-CT scan performed 3 months following cessation of treatment showed a complete metabolic response of her follicular lymphoma and she was subsequently managed with an active observation strategy. Following recovery from neutropenic sepsis, she underwent a further 10 weeks in an inpatient neurorehabilitation unit before being discharged home, with ongoing community rehabilitation.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are ‘neurological disorders that can affect any part of the nervous system, often presenting with stereotyped clinical manifestations, that occur in association with cancer and have an immune-medicated pathogenesis’. 2 AQP4 antibodies are defined as a ‘lower risk’ antibody for association with cancer, 2 and approximately 5% of patients with NMOSD are thought to have an underlying paraneoplastic cause. 1 3\n\n【25】Unlike some other types of PNS, existing reports of paraneoplastic NMOSD have identified no typical underlying malignancy. A wide range of malignancies have been reported, most commonly solid tumours, including breast and lung. 1 Patients with paraneoplastic NMOSD tend to be older at presentation (median age of 55 compared with 40) and are more likely to be men than in non-paraneoplastic NMOSD, although the majority in both groups remain women (29.4% vs 6.6%). 1\n\n【26】Rarely, paraneoplastic NMOSD has been reported in association with B-cell lymphomas. 4–6 Of these, there is one AQP-4 positive case described of suspected follicular lymphoma (where identification of the primary site was not possible). 4 6 In this case, the patient was treated with pulsed methylprednisolone before being commenced on R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy and, after two cycles, there was an improvement in cord inflammation, as shown via MRI, in serum AQP4 levels and in the patient’s symptoms.\n\n【27】Acute treatment of NMOSD involves high-dose steroids, with plasma exchange if required to achieve remission, followed by maintenance immunosuppression with oral immune modulatory agents such as azathioprine or rituximab. As with all paraneoplastic conditions, treatment is tailored to include treatment of the underlying malignancy. Follicular lymphoma treatment depends on the staging and whether the cancer is symptomatic and ranges from active observation to immunochemotherapy induction, followed by subsequent immunotherapy maintenance. Given that our patient had stage 3 follicular lymphoma, with neurological sequelae, treatment was warranted. The FLIPI score is used to guide treatment decisions. The GALLIUM trial, a phase III open-label randomised control trial has shown that in patients with a high risk of premature mortality (FLIPI ≥2), obinutuzumab increases progression-free survival, although with an unclear effect on long-term survival, 7 and has subsequently been approved by the national institute of clinical excellence (NICE) for treatment in this group.\n\n【28】Our patient met the requirements for treatment with obinutuzumab with chemotherapy. While rituximab has a well-characterised role in NMOSD treatment, the decision was made to treat with O-CVP as we felt that the neurological sequelae would be better controlled with aggressive lymphoma control, and we were reassured by the common target of both monoclonal antibodies (CD20 inhibition). Furthermore, obinutuzumab is a type II CD20 antibody, which differs from rituximab, a type I CD20 antibody, resulting in enhanced antibody-dependent and complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. 8\n\n【29】An additional consideration was the site of B-cell activity in NMOSD and whether the drugs can cross the blood–brain barrier. PNS can be the result of epitope expression by the cancer, or by autoantibody production. Unfortunately, we did not have the facilities available to determine which was the mechanism driving anti-AQP4 in our patient. However, regardless of the underlying mechanism, the pathogenesis of NMO is well understood. AQP4 is a water channel highly abundant in the central nervous system, particularly in the end-feet of glial cells bordering the blood–brain barrier. Antibodies to this protein cause blood–brain barrier disruption, inflammation and often damage to the surrounding neurons. It is an ongoing question of research whether anti-AQP4 antibodies are produced intrathecally or within the blood, and studies indicate that blood production is more likely. 9 This peripheral anti-AQP4 production, together with blood–brain barrier disruption in NMO, suggests that a requirement to cross an intact blood–brain barrier is not required for NMO therapies. Consistent with this, there is evidence that rituximab is not effective at crossing the blood–brain barrier. 10 There are no studies to date on the ability of obinutuzumab to do so.\n\n【30】In summary, this case of follicular lymphoma associated with AQP-4-positive NMO reinforces the importance of looking for a neoplastic process in patients with NMOSD; particularly those who are older. While prior case reports have demonstrated the use of rituximab in treating patients with this association, we report the efficacy in this case of using an alternative treatment strategy with an obinutuzumab chemotherapy-based regime, in paraneoplastic NMOSD.\n\n【31】### Learning points\n\n【32】   Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) can rarely be a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome.\n\n【33】   Although unusual, the underlying cancer responsible can include follicular lymphoma.\n\n【34】   A high index of suspicion is needed to identify patients with paraneoplastic NMOSD, which is more likely in elderly patients.\n\n【35】   Treatment of our patient’s NMOSD, by treating the underlying follicular lymphoma with obinutuzumab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone, resulted in a good radiological and neurological outcome.\n\n【36】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【37】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【38】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Symptoms were similar to an episode of travel-provoked pulmonary embolism 3 years prior. She denied chest pain, cough, fever, extremity complaints and symptoms at rest. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, her healthcare system was using secure telemedicine to evaluate non-critical complaints. During the initial video visit, she appeared well, conversing normally without laboured breathing. An elevated serum D-dimer prompted CT pulmonary angiography, which identified acute lobar pulmonary embolism. After haematology consultation and telephone conversation with the patient, her physician prescribed rivaroxaban. Her symptoms rapidly improved. She had an uneventful course and is continuing anticoagulation indefinitely. The pandemic has increased the application of telemedicine for acute care complaints. This case illustrates its safe and effective use for comprehensive management of acute pulmonary embolism in the primary care setting.\n\n【2】   pulmonary embolism\n   venous thromboembolism\n   general practice / family medicine\n   health informatics\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Little research attention has been directed on pulmonary embolism management in the primary care setting. 17–19 How the recent expansion of telemedicine in primary care can be applied to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute pulmonary embolism has not been well studied. We explore the utility of telemedicine in a case of comprehensive clinic-based outpatient pulmonary embolism management using video visit, telephone follow-up and secure messaging in a health system with an integrated electronic health record.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A healthy, active woman in her 70s with a remote history of provoked pulmonary embolism presented to her primary care physician (PCP) with 2–3 months of dyspnoea on exertion during the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient is an active open-water swimmer and initially noticed reduction in exercise tolerance, both in the water and when walking up inclines, which she attributed to deconditioning. She also endorsed palpitations and occasional dizziness, but denied chest pain, cough, fevers, syncope and dyspnoea at rest. She had no recent surgery, periods of reduced mobility or known history of malignancy. However, she had a history of provoked pulmonary embolism in the setting of air travel 3 years prior, for which she had completed 3 months of dabigatran. The initial evaluation for this current episode was conducted through secure video visit as in-person visits were limited during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Through video, the PCP noted no acute distress and no laboured breathing.\n\n【13】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【14】Initial outpatient laboratory work-up was ordered on day 1 and completed on day 3. It showed normal complete blood count, thyroid stimulating hormone and elevated D-dimer of 2.41 µg/mL (normal <0.49 µg/mL). Results were transmitted to the patient, who sent a secure message to her PCP reporting mild improvement in symptoms and inquiring about next steps. They discussed by messaging the likelihood of pulmonary embolism. He ordered advanced imaging by CT pulmonary angiography. It was performed the next day (4 days after presentation) and demonstrated new partial filling defects of the distal right upper lobe pulmonary artery. Prior hypercoagulable work-up was negative. COVID-19 testing was declined based on self-assessed low-risk exposure from strict social distancing adherence.\n\n【15】Treatment\n---------\n\n【16】At the end of the imaging study, the patient waited on campus while the radiologist called the PCP with the results. The PCP then spoke by phone with haematology, who advised indefinite anticoagulation therapy in the setting of recurrent pulmonary embolism. Age-appropriate cancer screening and COVID-19 testing were also recommended. The PCP called the patient, discussed the results and directed her to the pharmacy on campus to pick-up the rivaroxaban he ordered. He also submitted a referral for a haematology appointment.\n\n【17】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【18】The pharmacy-led anticoagulation management service provided next-day patient education by telephone and supplemental instructions sent by secure messaging. She had a secure video visit with haematology 1 week after her pulmonary embolism diagnosis. This second haematologist agreed with the earlier recommendation of indeterminate anticoagulation. After 1 month of rivaroxaban, the patient learnt that its reversal agent was less accessible in many hospitals than idarucizumab, the agent designed for dabigatran reversal. She then requested switching to dabigatran, with which she has continued treatment. She has experienced no bleeding complications nor recurrence of venous thromboembolism.\n\n【19】Discussion\n----------\n\n【20】The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the utilisation of telemedicine as healthcare systems grappled with restrictions on in-person evaluation. 20 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the US Department of Health and Human Services have also incentivised telehealth with waivers related to reimbursement and liability. 21 22 One cross-sectional analysis found a 35.3% increase in telemedicine use along with a 21.4% decrease in office visits and fewer laboratory testing during the second quarter of 2020, suggesting both structural changes in healthcare delivery and associated challenges. 23\n\n【21】### The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in primary care\n\n【22】Many professional societies recommend evidence-based, high-value diagnostic strategies for the evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism using validated clinical prediction rules (eg, Wells criteria) and selective probability-driven D-dimer measurements. 24–27 Such a risk-stratified approach has been externally validated in the primary care setting. 28 29 The PCP in our case followed this internationally endorsed approach.\n\n【23】The time from initial presentation in primary care to diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism varies widely. The evaluation can be prolonged if a pulmonary embolism diagnosis is not pursued until after diagnostic tests for other conditions (eg, chest radiographs for pneumonia) fail to explain the symptoms. Most in-person work-ups for acute pulmonary embolism (starting with the initial presentation) are completed within 7 days, though about 25% run longer. 30 31 We would not expect a telemedicine approach to greatly differ in duration. Our patient’s diagnostic evaluation was completed within 5 days, which is within the normal range of in-person work-ups described in the literature. The British Thoracic Society guideline recommends that ‘patients with suspected (pulmonary embolism) should, where reasonably practical, undergo investigation on the same day of presentation to exclude a diagnosis of (pulmonary embolism).’ 14 US guidelines across multiple specialties do not include similar temporal parameters. 24 26 32–34\n\n【24】### Eligibility for telemedical care of acute pulmonary embolism\n\n【25】Telemedicine for pulmonary embolism management in the primary care setting has not been well described in the literature. Our case sheds light on this novel approach. This patient was particularly well-suited to video-based outpatient diagnosis and treatment because of her familiarity with technology, established PCP relationship, access to advanced imaging and laboratory testing, as well as prior pulmonary embolism and anticoagulation experience. Additionally, the patient’s ready access to close follow-up and her PCP’s timely responses via secure messaging and telephone both facilitated outpatient management.\n\n【26】Although the PCP did not document any formal risk evaluation in the electronic health record, the patient appears to have met low-risk criteria for outpatient management from the American College of Chest Physicians: ‘clinically stable with good cardiopulmonary reserve; no contraindications…; expected to be compliant with treatment; and the patient feels well enough to be treated at home.’ 13 She also likely met outpatient criteria of the Hestia clinical decision rule, if we assume that continued ocean swimming and absence of dyspnoea at rest suggest haemodynamic stability and pulse oximetry ≥90%, though this correlation has not been studied. 35\n\n【27】Home measurement of her vital signs would have helped complete her outpatient eligibility assessment. Obtaining heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature at home have been possible for many years. The ability to accurately measure pulse oximetry at home is a more recent development, following the advent of reliable portable devices. 36 Smart phones may also soon be used for pulse oximetry measurements. 37 The increasing availability of reliable home vital sign measurements may open the door for research on selective in-home use of risk stratification triage tools, like the Hestia decision rule and the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index. 9 35 38 Some insurance companies cover the costs of remote patient monitoring devices, such as pulse oximeters and blood pressure monitoring devices. Reimbursement may continue to expand with the modernisation of telehealth.\n\n【28】### Comprehensive primary care-based pulmonary embolism management\n\n【29】This case report adds to the emerging literature describing comprehensive pulmonary embolism management in the primary care setting, including 3 in-person cases. 17–19 All 3 patients did well and developed no recurrent venous thromboembolism or bleeding complications. These cases met Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index and Hestia eligibility criteria for outpatient management. As in our current case, their PCPs also had ready telephone access to on-call haematologists and pulmonologists for consultation. The patients received prompt anticoagulation therapy with supplemental education and long-term monitoring by pharmacy-led anticoagulation management services, a centralised model adopted by many institutions. 39\n\n【30】### The promises and limitations of telemedicine\n\n【31】The scope of telemedicine has progressed since the American College of Physicians 2015 recommendation on telemedicine use in primary care citing the technology’s potential to improve access to care and patient satisfaction and to reduce cost. 3 As the COVID-19 pandemic catalysed telemedicine’s rapid expansion from niche to necessity and revolutionised the structure of primary care, 23 40 important limitations including access, quality and adoption must be considered. While telemedicine aims to increase access to care, particularly in rural and underserved areas, persistent inequities exist, including age, socioeconomic status, disability, level of education, smart device literacy, bandwidth and broadband access. 4 41–43 Systematic reviews and meta-analyses reveal that telemedicine is likely comparable with in-person visits for certain services, such as mental health and rehabilitation, although is likely less effective for others, such as dermatology. 44\n\n【32】With regard to acute pulmonary embolism management, the current literature is sparse on using telemedicine to evaluate acute complaints in general. 45 46 The benefits of quick access via telemedicine are pitted against the absence of a complete physical examination. For this patient, missing critical objective components include a complete set of vital signs and detailed cardiopulmonary and extremity examinations. While additional testing including a 12-lead ECG and two-view chest radiograph may partly remedy initial examination shortcomings, these are predicated on timely access to diagnostic testing. As discussed above, the emergence of reliable tools for home vital sign measurements may help broaden the capacity of telemedicine. Elements of a proposed pathway for the telemedical evaluation of possible deep vein thrombosis may be adaptable for a similar pulmonary embolism pathway. 47\n\n【33】Telemedicine expanded in 2020 as a convenient means of providing healthcare without increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Given an eligible patient in the right care setting supported by adequate resources and infrastructure, this case raises the possibility that telemedicine may be used safely and effectively to diagnose and manage select cases of acute pulmonary embolism without the need for transfer to a higher level of care. However, one case report cannot justify wholesale a new pattern of care. Research should be undertaken to establish the safety and effectiveness of this approach and to identify patients who are best suited for telemedicine management. How well triage tools like the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index and the Hestia criteria might perform to identify patients with acute pulmonary embolism eligible for telemedical care without complete physical examination data is unknown. Expanding these questions beyond acute pulmonary embolism to other acute care conditions raises questions about which patients with which complaints in which care settings are eligible for comprehensive telemedical care. More research is needed to help us understand the possibilities and limitations of telemedicine in the management of patients with high-acuity complaints, including pulmonary embolism, and to ensure equitable patient access and outcomes. Preference for using telemedicine will likely remain higher after the pandemic, but the degree to which it is used or useful in a non-pandemic period is not yet clear.\n\n【34】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【35】I loved the flexibility of speaking with my PCP in a video visit. Having the visit virtually was convenient and by far the safer approach in a pandemic, many months before COVID-19 vaccinations were available. I was especially glad to avoid a trip to the emergency room — at no point did I have that ‘dread’ feeling that compels one to hightail it to the ER.\n\n【36】### Learning points\n\n【37】   Telemedicine, including real-time patient–physician video visits, and asynchronous secure message exchange, was used to successfully coordinate outpatient primary and specialty care for a patient with acute pulmonary embolism without transfer to the emergency department or hospital.\n\n【38】   This virtual approach to low-risk pulmonary embolism management is a particularly convenient means of providing healthcare without increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure or the burden on the emergency department.\n\n【39】   This novel approach to the management of acute pulmonary embolism has never been studied and is not ready for broad clinical application. More research is needed to help us understand the possibilities and limitations of telemedicine in the management of patients with acute pulmonary embolism and other acute care complaints and diagnoses.\n\n【40】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【41】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【42】Obtained.\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank our patient for her enthusiastic participation.

The true incidence of these cysts may be higher, as corroborated by various autopsy series (0.064%–0.18%), as most of them are clinically silent. 1 2 They often present with non-specific clinical and radiological findings and are thus usually incidentally diagnosed. When large, they may present with mass effects resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms. Though rarely associated with malignant changes, they may carry clinically detrimental consequences if misdiagnosed. Cystic adrenal lesions exhibit a broad histomorphological spectrum, ranging from pseudocysts, endothelial cysts, epithelial cysts and parasitic cysts. Pseudocysts are the most frequently identified cystic lesions in surgical series, and endothelial cysts account for the most in autopsy series, up to 45%. 3 Here we discuss the case of a left-sided adrenal pseudocyst in a young woman, presenting to our department.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A young woman in her 20s, with no known comorbidities, presented to our department with left-sided vague abdominal pain on and off over a period of 3 months. The pain was associated with intermittent episodes of nausea and generalised weakness. There was no history of fever, abdominal distension, weight loss, diarrhoea, constipation, jaundice, haematemesis or melaena. The patient never had similar symptoms in the past, and there was no evidence of similar symptoms in any other members of the family. On clinical examination, she was stable haemodynamically with no palpable organomegaly.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】Laboratory investigations revealed a haemoglobin level of 133 g/L, total leucocyte count of 7.0 x 10 <sup>99 </sup> /L and platelet counts of 147 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Her viral markers were all negativend her coagulation profile was within normal limits. Liver function tests, renal function tests, C reactive protein, plasma and urinary fractionated free metanephrines, anti-citrullinated antibody, rheumatoid factor assay, anti-p-ANCA and anti-c-ANCA were all within the normal range.

The lesion was superior to the upper pole of the left kidney just abutting the left adrenal gland and posterior to the tail of the pancreas.

On macroscopic histopathological examination of the specimen, the specimen had a smooth outer surface, with a focally attached adrenal gland and cut surface showed a unilocular cyst. On microscopic examination , normal adrenal tissue was seen along with a fibrous cyst wall having focal areas of dystrophic calcification. Some areas showed small foci of large round polygonal cells projecting into the lumen and adherent to the cyst wall. The cells showed abundant cytoplasm with small pyknotic nuclei and condensed chromatin. Also, haemosiderin pigment was identified and no evidence of atypia or malignancy was seen. Further immunohistochemistry evaluation showed polygonal cells to be positive for CD68 and negative for inhibin and synaptophysin. Hence, the diagnosis of adrenal pseudocyst was made. The patient is currently asymptomatic at 9 months of follow-up.\n\n【26】<img/>\n\n【27】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【28】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3</u>\n\n【29】Multiple sections with normal adrenal tissue along with a fibrous cyst wall having focal areas of dystrophic calcification.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】A cystic lesion of the adrenal glands was first described in 1670 by Greselius, an Austrian anatomist when it caused death in a patient following the rupture of more than 4 kg of blood and fluid content of the cyst. 4 Since then, multiple case series and reports have described these lesions with an incidence ranging from 5% to 6% in surgical adrenalectomy specimens, which was lower than in other autopsy series. Adrenal ‘incidentalomas’ identified on imaging may be seen in 5%–9% of the general population, of which an estimated 4%–22% are adrenal cysts. 5 6 Most of the adrenal cysts are unilateral but around 8%–15% can present bilaterally. 2 They are most common in the third to fifth decade with a female preponderance (2–3:1) and a size ranging from a few millimetres to as large as 50 cm in some case reports. 7 8 The larger lesions are traditionally associated with symptoms of a mass effect, displacing the adjacent abdominal organs. They often present with a palpable flank mass, gastrointestinal symptoms, and more commonly, vague abdominal pain as was seen in our case. Larger lesions also have the risk of massive haemorrhage, rupture, cyst infection or arterial hypertension despite negative hormonal status, which is due to distortion of renal vessels and neuroendocrine/vasoactive stimulations. 2\n\n【32】Cystic adrenal lesions are often associated with a variety of syndromes, including polycystic renal disease, 9 Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, 10 Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, 11 schwannomas, aortic aneurysms, abdominal neuroblastomas and rarely with pregnancy. 12 Infrequently, metastasis from other organs like the breast, pancreas, lungs and colon can present as cystic adrenal lesions, which need to be evaluated accordingly. 13\n\n【33】Cystic lesions of the adrenal glands have a wide morphological spectrum, as a result of which, multiple classifications have been attempted. The earliest of these was in 1906 by Terrier and Lecene, 14 which included haemorrhagic cysts, endothelial cysts, congenital retention cysts, cystic adenomas and parasitic cysts. Further modifications by Abeshouse et al 3 in 1959 and subsequently by Foster 15 in 1966 from an autopsy series have delineated four different subtypes: pseudocysts (39%), endothelial cysts (45%), epithelial cysts (9%) and parasitic cysts (7%). However, when compared with a surgical series of 41 patients by the Mayo Clinic, pseudocysts (78%) were the most frequently identified cystic adrenal lesions. 16 Both pseudocysts and endothelial cysts are types of vascular-origin cysts, whereas the other two are non-vascular. Also, there exists controversy regarding the classification of the cystic neoplasms arising from the cortex or medulla as some authors argue that they should be classified as pseudocysts owing to the inner cyst wall being devoid of any lining, whereas other authors believed them to have epithelial/neuroectodermal derivation.\n\n【34】Pseudocysts are the second most common subtype of adrenal cysts as per autopsy series (39%), but many surgical series describe them to be the most common. 3 They are complex cysts, resulting from haemorrhage into the adrenal parenchyma due to trauma, toxins or infections. Other causes include uraemia, pregnancy, Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, acute trauma, burns, adrenal vein thrombosis, syphilis, leukaemia and incompatible blood transfusions. 15 There may be anomalous vascular and lymphatic channels surrounding them. They are usually unilocular, encapsulated and devoid of inner wall lining, as seen in our case. Sixty per cent of the cases may show calcification within the fibrous capsules. The cyst cavity usually contains blood clots and proteinaceous materials, and no necrotic debris is usually present. A series by Foster describes around 7% association of pseudocyst with neoplastic lesions including adenomas, haemangiomas, pheochromocytomas or malignant haemangioendothelioma. 15 Other smaller series have estimated it to be as high as 18%–44%. 17 The pseudocyst usually results from degenerative necrosis and haemorrhage within these tumours. The appearance on imaging in these lesions can vary with the stage of disease progression and is difficult to differentiate from tumours, metastases or abscesses. 18 There may be septations, blood or a soft tissue component, but these organise with time and evolve into a homogeneous thin-walled collection with eventually an absence of solid components. MRI can also be used in cases with active intracystic haemorrhage, with acute bleeds seen to be isointense and subacute bleeds hyperintense on T1—both being low intensity on T2. 19\n\n【35】Endothelial adrenal cysts account for 45% of all the cysts as per autopsy series, but the incidence drops to 2%–24% in surgical series, signifying its more incidental nature. 3 16 They are simple cysts, usually less than 2 cm in diameter, and are thought to arise from pre-existing vascular malformations or ectatic lymphatic channels subsequent to some obstruction. 3 20 Accordingly, they are subclassified as hamartomatous, angiomatous and lymphangiomatous subtypes. These lesions have a smooth, flattened and non-proliferating endothelial lining, with clear fluid content (usually in lymphangiomatous cases), and are rarely associated with malignancy. Angiomatous cysts are rarer, with only four case reports to date. 1 On imaging, they are unilateral thin-walled lesions with smooth borders. Lymphangiomatous subtypes may usually have internal septations. Any rim enhancement on CECT may be due to the peripheral compressed adrenal tissue. 8 19 MRI shows findings similar to simple cysts of other organs, with homogeneous lesions having low T1/high T2 intensity. 5\n\n【36】Epithelial cysts are true cysts with a reported incidence of around 6%–9%. 21 They are subdivided into 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> glandular or retention cysts due to the presence of displaced urogenital tissue, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> cystic adenomas and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> embryonal cysts. 17 22 They are thought to have a mesothelial origin due to positive mesothelial immunostaining. They are differentiated from other simple cysts by the true epithelium lining the flattened wall. Imaging is similar to simple cysts and it is rare to find calcification or enhancement in the walls. 8\n\n【37】Parasitic cysts are usually echinococcal in origin, and rarely associated with leishmaniasis. 7 They are commonly associated with hydatid cystic lesions in other organs too. The cysts are thick walled and may or may not have wall calcification, depending on the stage of the lesion. The usual complications seen with liver or spleen hydatid lesions are also seen with adrenal hydatid lesions. The imaging is also typical with the appearance of echo-free cysts, hydatid sands, floating membranes or daughter cysts. 8\n\n【38】Functional cystic adrenal lesions have also been described in the cortex as well as medulla, and owing to severe implications with pheochromocytoma, a thorough evaluation is a must. About 15% of incidentalomas are functional, with an even lesser number of cystic incidentalomas being functional. 6 A cystic pheochromocytoma can have negative hormonal screening but CECT shows tumour rim enhancement with a central cystic mass. Also, MRI shows hyperintense lesions in T2 imaging, also called the ‘light bulb sign’. 5 In cases with a diagnostic dilemma, metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy has 95% specificity for pheochromocytomas. 13 18\n\n【39】The cysts with solid components can harbour neoplastic lesions ranging from benign adenomas to malignant carcinomas. The risk of malignancy is less than 6% in lesions less than 6 cm in size, 13 and there is a reported incidence of around 7% typically within pseudocysts. 1 Most malignant cysts are usually metastasis (95%), followed by pheochromocytoma and adrenal cortical lesions. 23 CECT is the preferred modality for differentiating these lesions from simple cysts, with MRI beneficial in adrenal adenoma cases. 5 Hyperattenuating lesions with wall thickness >5 mm, wall enhancement, thick rim or central stippled calcification may suggest malignancy. 8 18 The 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography can also help in distinguishing adenomas from malignancy. 13 Table 1 describes the radiological and histological characteristics of common differentials of cystic adrenal lesions.\n\n【40】View this table:\n\n【41】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【42】Table 1\n\n【43】Comparison of various radiological and histological characteristics of cystic adrenal lesions\n\n【44】Owing to the relatively low incidence of cystic adrenal lesions and the usual lack of preoperative pathological diagnosis, ambiguity exists regarding the preferred management for these. Various modalities have been tried, including fine-needle aspiration (FNA), sclerotherapy, surgical resection or cyst marsupialisation. 1 7 The management includes ruling out the functional status, evaluation for the risk of malignancy by imaging and weighing the benefits of conservative management against potential complications, especially in large cysts. 23 24 A general agreement exists that cysts larger than 5 cm should be resected due to the potential risk of haemorrhage and secondary complications. Studies recommend surgical resection for lesions, which are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> symptomatic, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> functional, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> greater than 5 cm, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> heterogeneous in nature suggestive of malignancy, 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> parasitic cysts and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> cysts associated with other anomalies like superior vena cava syndrome. 2 7 Other small asymptomatic lesions can be followed conservatively with imaging by CECT, MRI or ultrasound, but no consensus exists regarding the surveillance protocol. 7\n\n【45】Percutaneous FNA has a sensitivity of around 85% for detecting malignancy in adrenal cysts. Haemorrhagic aspirate, positive cytology or irregular cyst lining on examination should prompt surgical excision of the lesion. Some lesions might regress completely following aspiration and require only surveillance, but the fluid may reaccumulate in about 30%–50% of cases even after sclerotherapy. 1 2 Decortication or marsupialisation of the cyst can be done with open or minimally invasive techniques, similar to those done in renal cysts. 25 There is a small theoretical risk of malignant spread or seeding, but it has not been corroborated in any study. Surgical excision can be done with simple enucleation of the cyst, which is the procedure of choice for simple cystic lesions. 21 In some cases, partial or total adrenalectomy may also be required. Minimally invasive cyst excision can be done laparoscopically or robotically, and have low morbidity and with less blood loss, short hospital stay and better cosmesis. 26–30 Resection can also provide a specimen for pathological examination, giving a definitive diagnosis and guiding further follow-up.

However, diagnosis and management can be challenging due to their heterogeneous appearance and difficulty in ascertaining the pathological subtype on routine imaging. It is essential to rule out malignancy and functional status when managing these lesions. Any functional lesion, potentially malignant lesion or lesion more than 5 cm should be surgically managed, while other cases can be managed conservatively. Owing to advances in surgical techniques and minimally invasive options, the morbidity and mortality associated with these lesions have been significantly reduced, even when detecting malignancy by imaging is difficult.\n\n【51】### Learning points\n\n【52】   Uncommon group of lesions which are clinically silent in most cases.\n\n【53】   Exhibit a broad histomorphological spectrum, ranging from pseudocysts, endothelial cysts, epithelial cysts and parasitic cysts.\n\n【54】   Ruling out malignancy and functional status is vital to the management.\n\n【55】   Have a heterogeneous appearance based on the pathological subtype, which can be difficult to ascertain on routine imaging.\n\n【56】   Any functional lesion, potentially malignant lesion or lesion more than 5 cm deserves surgical management, whereas others can be managed conservatively.\n\n【57】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【58】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【59】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

He had a history of corrosive oesophageal injury with surgery done to the oesophagus 30 years ago, details were unknown. On examination, he had a palpable bowel loop on the anterior chest wall . A barium swallow study showed a proximally dilated oesophagus with narrowing of the distal oesophagus and gastro-oesophageal junction, likely due to a stricture. An oesophageal bypass reconstruction is also seen in the anterior midline with bowel connecting the cervical oesophagus and stomach showing free flow of barium . A CT scan with oral contrast confirmed a distal stricture in the native oesophagus with a patent oesophageal bypass reconstruction/conduit showing no abnormal wall thickening or enhancement . Endoscopy showed a side-to-side anastomosis just below the upper oesophageal sphincter. The native lumen  had narrowing at the distal end while the reconstructed lumen  showed a colonic loop opening into the distal stomach with normal appearing gastric mucosa. The patient was treated with oral proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and had symptomatic improvement. True incidence of corrosive gastrointestinal injuries is unknown worldwide. Prevalence is higher in children due to accidental ingestion and in developing countries. 1 Ingestion of alkalis causes rapid and extensive oesophageal injury due to liquefactive necrosis compared with acids where upper respiratory tract and distal stomach injuries are common. 2 The transmural nature of injury in alkalis predisposes to stricture formation, usually in 3–8 weeks duration. Endoscopic dilation using Savary–Gilliard (SG) dilators or ‘through-the-scope’ (TTS) balloon dilator is the mainstay of these oesophageal strictures. 3 Risk of complications like perforation is slightly higher in dilatation of caustic strictures (0.4%—32%) compared with other benign causes (0.1%—0.4%). 4 Surgery is generally limited to patients who have failed endo-therapy. Routinely performed surgery includes gastric pull-up (GPU) and colonic interposition (CI). GPU is the most widely performed with least complications and failure rates, but avoided in cases where stomach is injured due to the corrosive agent. Colon is next preferred organ due to its vascular anatomy, long length and resistance to acid injury. 5 CI surgery involves using a colonic segment as the conduit and is performed through posterior mediastinal, retrosternal or antesternal approaches. The preferred is grafting the colon in the posterior mediastinum after excising the diseased oesophagus, this is advantageous as it is the shortest route; however, this space is not available in conditions with scarred mediastinum. The retrosternal approach is preferred when the oesophageal bed is not available and it is easy for dissection. Disadvantages include long route, angulations at thoracic inlet and xiphoid level and cannot be performed with prior cardiac surgery. The antesternal approach (subcutaneous route) without oesophagectomy is not technically very demanding, quicker and does not require a thoracotomy. 6 Although antesternal approach is easy to perform, the function of the colon is poor in the subcutaneous position and patients often have to massage food down to improve colonic conduit emptying. Also, it is less popular as it leaves behind diseased oesophagus with a very small risk of malignancy, 7 available case reports in literature mention squamous cell carcinoma after approximately 40–50 years postcorrosive ingestion and is less cosmetic. This case was unique as antesternal CI surgeries are rarely encountered in modern clinical practice. Performing endoscopy was technically challenging because of the difficulties encountered in negotiating the endoscope into the native and reconstructed lumens. Both lumens were carefully intubated under vision through the side-to-side anastomosis just distal to the upper oesophageal sphincter.\n\n【5】### Learning points\n\n【6】   Endoscopic management is the current standard of care in treatment of postcorrosive oesophageal strictures.\n\n【7】   In spite of advancements in the management of corrosive oesophageal injury, a few sections of patients need oesophageal replacement surgery.\n\n【8】   The three routes of the colic interposition include the following:\n\n【9】       Oesophageal bed approach after oesophagostomy.\n\n【10】       Retrosternal tunnel.\n\n【11】       Antesternal approach.\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【15】Large antesternal mass with a bowel loop as contents.\n\n【16】<img/>\n\n【17】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【19】Barium swallow study showing native oesophageal lumen (arrow-head) and reconstructed lumen with side-to-side anastomosis (asterisk) parallel to each other at (A) proximal and (B)mid-oesophageal levels with free flow of barium suspension.\n\n【20】<img/>\n\n【21】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3</u>\n\n【23】Barium swallow study demonstrating oesophageal bypass reconstruction with large bowel showing haustral folds (arrow) connecting the distal stomach (asterisk).\n\n【24】<img/>\n\n【25】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【26】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4</u>\n\n【27】Ct sagittal view showing antesternal colonic loop (white arrow) with haustral folds and narrowed native oesophagus (red arrow).\n\n【28】<img/>\n\n【29】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【30】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5</u>\n\n【31】Endoscopic images of native oesophageal lumen showing (A)distal narrowing secondary to stricture and (B)creconstructed colonic conduit containing few solid food residues (STAR) entering into the distal stomach (arrow).\n\n【32】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【33】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【34】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

He also presented with motor and sensory disturbances of the right upper extremity and was suspected of having a brachial plexus injury. After undergoing mechanical ventilation due to multiple traumas, he was extubated. However, he developed acute respiratory failure and required reintubation. Respiratory symptoms were not clear until just before reintubation. The diagnosis of right diaphragm paralysis was made using point-of-care ultrasound with no other findings that could cause respiratory failure. MRI led to the diagnosis of brachial plexus injury, which likely caused diaphragm paralysis. Point-of-care ultrasound provided a clear visualisation and rapid bedside diagnosis of diaphragm paralysis, which can be challenging to diagnose while ruling out other causes of respiratory failure.\n\n【2】   adult intensive care\n   trauma\n   lung function\n   orthopaedics\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

In general, It is diagnosed using radiography or fluoroscopic ‘sniff test’. 3 However, a radiograph alone cannot provide a definitive diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis. 4 In addition, the sniff test is difficult to conduct in critically ill patients.\n\n【13】We encountered a case of a patient with respiratory failure due to diaphragm paralysis with brachial plexus injury that was rapidly diagnosed using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). The ultrasound findings were also reported in this study.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A 55-year-old man presented to our tertiary medical care centre following a motor vehicle accident. On arrival, he was in hypovolaemic shock with impaired consciousness. The chief complaint was abdominal pain associated with motor and sensory disturbances in the right upper extremity. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage, liver injury and fractures of the rib, right clavicle, right scapula and right femur. The coronal view of the enhanced CT showed that the continuity of the diaphragm was maintained. The motor and sensory deficits in the right upper extremity were not explained by direct injury. Therefore, a brachial plexus injury was considered possible. After being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient was intubated due to multiple trauma.\n\n【16】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【17】In the ICU, radiographic imaging revealed occasional and temporary diaphragmatic elevation . Therefore, we considered the elevation of the diaphragm was caused by pleural effusion or atelectasis. The patient had a successful spontaneous breathing trial after undergoing mechanical ventilation for 6 days, and he was extubated.\n\n【18】<img/>\n\n【19】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【21】Chest radiograph in the intensive care unit. Right diaphragm elevation was present (A) on some days and absent (B) on other days.\n\n【22】One day after extubation, the patient suddenly developed dyspnoea. He was tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of about 50 breaths per min and was reintubated. Arterial blood gas under 3 L oxygen via nasal cannula revealed a pH of 7.410, partial pressure of oxygen of 74.4 mm Hg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 41.4 mm Hg and bicarbonate level of 25.9 mmol/L.\n\n【23】Since the carbon dioxide concentration was normal despite tachypnoea, the carbon dioxide excretion was decreased. Bedside POCUS revealed that the right diaphragm exhibited significantly less respiratory movement than the left, and the distance of the right diaphragm movement was shortened ( video 1 ).\n\n【24】Video 1\n\n【25】Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure secondary to diaphragm paralysis.\n\n【26】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【27】POCUS also revealed no signs of pneumothorax, massive pleural effusion and acute heart failure.\n\n【28】Chest radiography showed that the right diaphragm was elevated compared with the left. Atelectasis was considered, but there was no clinically significant sputum accumulation on bronchoscopy immediately after reintubation. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed no pulmonary embolism, diaphragm injury or severe pneumonia. In particular, the diaphragm injury was ruled out due to the lack of segmental diaphragm defects by CT on days 1 and 7. Thereafter, no abnormalities were noted in the follow-up imaging studies.\n\n【29】A neck MRI scan revealed root avulsion injury of C5 and C6, which likely caused diaphragm paralysis .\n\n【30】<img/>\n\n【31】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【33】MRI scan on STIR sequence: White arrows show the injury to the right C5 and C6 nerve roots.

Although he had dyspnoea for approximately a month after extubation, the arterial blood gas showed no hypoxaemia or carbon dioxide retention. The frequency of dyspnoea decreased over time. The patient was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation, and nerve grafting was considered for brachial plexus injury treatment.\n\n【41】Discussion\n----------\n\n【42】In our case, the brachial plexus avulsion injury was associated with diaphragm paralysis, and POCUS aided in the diagnosis.\n\n【43】In general, diaphragmatic dysfunction is difficult to diagnose with certainty without direct observation, either by laparoscopy or laparotomy. For example, diaphragmatic injury is one of the differential causes of diaphragmatic dysfunction and requires special attention because it may be asymptomatic immediately after injury. Chest X-ray fails to reveal abnormalities in 20%–50% of patients with diaphragmatic injury.\n\n【44】The gold standard for diagnosis is an examination by CT, which has been reported to have high diagnostic accuracy with a sensitivity of 61%–87% and a specificity of 72%–100%. A segmental diaphragmatic defect is a common finding, with a reported sensitivity of 95.7%, and accuracy is further improved by combining sagittal and coronal views.\n\n【45】However, slight abnormalities in diaphragm thickness or small diaphragmatic defects cannot be noted, especially when a major distracting abnormality is nearby. Furthermore, in ventilated patients, positive pressure may mask diaphragm elevation, which can make diagnosis difficult. 5 In our case, the initial CT and follow-up CT images over time did not show any findings suspicious of diaphragmatic injury.\n\n【46】The diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve, which originates from the C3 to C5 nerve roots. In most cases, the C4 root is integral to diaphragmatic function. 4 The brachial plexus is composed of the C5-Th1 nerve roots, and the C4 and C5 roots are fibrously connected . 6 When the C5 root is avulsed and damaged, C4 is also damaged, resulting in diaphragmatic dysfunction.\n\n【47】<img/>\n\n【48】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【49】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4</u>\n\n【50】Anatomical schematic diagram of the brachial plexus. The grey arrow indicates the direction of the external force, and the figure shows the mechanism by which a root avulsion injury to C5 causes a simultaneous stretching of C4 and damage to the phrenic nerve. This figure is illustrated by WY, the corresponding author. CECT, contrast-enhanced CT; IVR, interventional radiology; POCUS, point-of-care ultrasound.\n\n【51】Phrenic nerve injury has reportedly occurred in 10%–20% of brachial plexus injuries. 7 8 However, to the best of our knowledge, only Franko et al have reported a case of diaphragm paralysis following brachial plexus injury who developed acute respiratory failure. 9 Although chest radiography revealed unilateral diaphragm elevation on hospital day 5, pleural effusion was primarily suspected. The diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis was not made until an ultrasound was performed to evaluate the pleural effusion.\n\n【52】In our case, the diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis was also difficult because the radiologic finding of diaphragm elevation was not always apparent. The reason for the rarity of similar case reports may suggest that diaphragm paralysis may have been overlooked because of the difficulty of diagnosis.\n\n【53】The sniff test on fluoroscopy and X-ray was reportedly helpful in diagnosing unilateral diaphragm paralysis. 3 However, its application to critically ill patients remains controversial. The sniff test requires the patient to control spontaneous breathing and move to the examination room. Unilateral diaphragm elevation on radiography is a suggestive finding, but it has low specificity (sensitivity: 0.90, specificity: 0.44). 4 In our case, unilateral diaphragm elevation was occasionally seen on radiography. However, the respiratory symptoms had only occurred just before the patient required reintubation. Although diaphragm paralysis lacks specific findings, it is essential to diagnose it immediately because it has serious consequences.\n\n【54】Point-of-care diaphragmatic ultrasound was reportedly useful in evaluating critically ill patients. Ultrasonography is noninvasive and highly reproducible, allowing bedside assessment within approximately 5–15 min, 10 11 which can simultaneously assess findings of abnormalities in the thorax that may cause respiratory failure. The ultrasound findings of diaphragm paralysis are documented as a loss of diaphragmatic excursion, paradoxical excursion during deep breathing and sniffing, and a respiratory variation of diaphragm thickness of <20%. 10\n\n【55】In this patient, the right diaphragm motion was significantly less than that of the left diaphragm, and the right diaphragm excursion disappeared ( video 1 ), which led to the rapid diagnosis of diaphragm paralysis. Video 1 shows that there was little respiratory variability on the right diaphragm despite tachypnoea, while the left diaphragm moves along with the breathing. Moreover, no other abnormal findings could have caused the respiratory failure. Therefore, even a rare disease like this case could be diagnosed easily. This case highlighted that POCUS plays an important role in diagnosing the cause of severe respiratory failure.\n\n【56】### Learning points\n\n【57】   Diaphragm paralysis associated with brachial plexus injury is rare but can cause severe respiratory failure.\n\n【58】   The specificity of hemidiaphragmatic elevation on X-ray is low, and diaphragm paralysis may be overlooked and mistaken for pleural effusion or atelectasis.\n\n【59】   Point-of-care ultrasound provided a clear visualisation and rapid diagnosis for causes of respiratory failure at the bedside.\n\n【60】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【61】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【62】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

With the advancement of percutaneous coronary interventions in a timely manner, incidence of post MI VSR has declined remarkably. However, the COVID-19) pandemic-related late hospital presentations with AMI increases the possibilities of a potential upward shift in the incidence of post MI VSR.

On further questioning, he reported that he had several episodes of self-limiting chest discomfort 2 weeks prior to the presentation day. During these episodes, the patient did not seek any medical attention due to fear of contracting COVID-19. On presentation, the patient was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 60/40 mm Hg, tachycardic with a heart rate of 140 beats per minute and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 85%. Other vitals were within normal limits. Physical examination was remarkable for jugular vein distension, a holosystolic murmur on the left sternal border, bilateral crackles at lung bases, cold and clammy extremities. ECG in the field was consistent with acute inferior STEMI and ventricular tachycardia . Blood work on presentation was as follow: Blood urea nitrogen 49 mg/dL, creatinine 1.89 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 239 U/L, alanine transaminase 135 U/L, venous lactic acid 11.4 mM/L, troponins 13.4 ng/mL and B-type natriuretic peptide 173 pg/mL. Presenting ECG and rhythm in the field are shown in figures 1 and 2 . Left ventriculogram (LVG) showed findings suggestive of ventricular septal rupture (VSR) ( videos 1 and 2 ). Coronary angiogram showed a total occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) at the mid portion. The other coronary arteries had non-obstructive stenosis .

In the presence of STE in the inferior leads on 12-lead ECG and ventricular tachycardia in a pre-elderly man, inferior myocardial infarction is the most likely diagnosis. Additionally, haemodynamic instability and abnormal examination findings indicating reduced tissue perfusion are suggestive of acute cardiogenic shock. Moreover, pansystolic murmur in the left sternal border on auscultation raises suspicion for AMI-related complications such as post MI VSR or papillary muscle rupture. Therefore, LVGs in the right anterior oblique and left anterior oblique projections were immediately performed that showed the basal, mid and distal inferior wall hypokinesis with evidence of shunt from the left ventricle to the right ventricle at systole. TTE confirmed the defect in the mid portion of the interventricular septum (IVS). Bilateral selective coronary angiogram revealed a total occlusion of the RCA at the mid-level that was the culprit lesion for AMI.\n\n【41】Overall, the patient’s presentation was consistent with cardiogenic shock due to complicated AMI. Given ventricular tachycardia leading to haemodynamic compromise, a successful cardioversion was performed. In addition to intravenous vasopressors, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted for the purpose of percutaneous mechanic circulatory support (PMCS) due to cardiogenic shock. The case was discussed with the cardiothoracic surgery team and emergent repair of VSR was declined due to high-risk features. Therefore, the decision was made to proceed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the culprit lesion. After pre-dilatation of the index lesion, two drug-eluting stents were inserted to the mid RCA with no complications.\n\n【42】On the first day post cardiac catheterisation, he remained in cardiogenic shock and pulmonary oedema despite intravenous vasopressors, IABP counter-pulsation therapy and mechanical ventilation. Given severe upper and lower peripheral vascular disease, percutaneous mechanical circulatory support with axial or centrifugal flow was not feasible at our institution. The patient was eventually transferred to a larger centre for advanced PMCS and surgical closure of the VSR. He was placed on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) on arrival at the accepting centre and underwent surgical closure on VA ECMO 4 days after the transfer. Over the next several days, VA ECMO was successfully decannulated. However, the patient continued to require increasing pressure support and oxygen requirements that eventually progressed to persistent hypotension on maximum pressure support. The patient eventually had a cardiac arrest and expired within 10 days of surgery.\n\n【43】Global health problem list\n--------------------------\n\n【44】The incidence of the COVID-19 has been up trending globally with increasing morbidity and mortality since the outbreak was officially confirmed in 2019.\n\n【45】The overall mortality rate has risen worldwide, especially in the USA which was 20% higher between March and August 2020 in comparison with all-cause mortality from previous years since 2014.\n\n【46】Since public health measures have been announced globally to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19, late presenting cases from cardiac and non-cardiac conditions became more prevalent due to the inability to reach designated healthcare centres on time for multitude of reasons including the contagious nature of the virus, stay home orders, strict hospital policies for preventing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic as well as overburdened healthcare systems.\n\n【47】This global pandemic has a likely positive correlation with the increased proportion of late presenting fatal cardiac emergencies especially mechanical complications post AMI.\n\n【48】Global health problem analysis\n------------------------------\n\n【49】Post MI VSR results from a complete occlusion of a coronary artery supplying blood to a territory of the IVS. 5 Latham first recognised VSR as a complication of AMI in an autopsy report in 1847. 6 Although, the incidence reported is somewhere between 1% and 3% historically, the current data has shown a marked decrease in incidence by about 10-fold primarily due to the advancement of early reperfusion strategies for the last few decades. 7 Despite the advent of percutaneous and surgical techniques in the closure of post MI VSR, it still remains a devastating complication with grim prognosis. In the published series, the mortality rate varies at 18.4% with the delay of surgery up to 7 days, 58.4% with emergent repair and 94% if left untreated by day 30 post presentation. 8 9 Therefore, high index of suspicion is required for early recognition and treatment optimisation in a timely manner.\n\n【50】Universal risk factors of this fatal complication are advanced age, female gender, history of stroke, ST-segment elevation on ECG, elevated cardiac markers, higher heart rate, lower blood pressure, higher Killip classification and delayed or lack of reperfusion. The data also shed light into a negative correlation between the presence of atherosclerotic risk factors and post MI VSR. 5 Our case was classical for the late presentation of acute inferolateral MI complicated by VSR. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors were relatively less present which was consistent with the current data.\n\n【51】The anterior IVS is supplied by the left anterior descending (LAD) artery as opposed to a dominant RCA generally provides a blood supply to the inferior IVS. As a result, apical VSRs are seen in the presence of total occlusions of the LAD whereas infarcted dominant RCAs usually result in basal VSRs. Moreover, RCA-related VSRs are more likely to be large and associated with intra-myocardial dissection and involvement of the free wall. 8 10 In our case, the defect interestingly was located in the mid portion of the IVS. This may be explained by the RCA being dominant and supplying such a large territory in the IVS from the base to the mid portion.\n\n【52】When it comes to timing of surgery, the mortality rates have been reported lower in patients with delay of the closure than those who underwent early repair within 1 week or treated conservatively. 5 10 Despite medical treatment, PMCS and a successful PCI of the infarct-related artery with an optimal door-to-balloon time, cardiogenic shock remained persistent. Our patient remained on ECMO for 10 days and underwent a surgical closure of the VSR on day 10. He transiently recovered from shock but unfortunately developed cardiac arrest and expired in the same hospitalisation.\n\n【53】Since the global health organisations announced the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, the whole world has started operating interventions to mitigate the spread of the virus using public health measures including self-isolation, social distancing and wearing facial masks. Despite this global effort, symptomatic patients from COVID-19 have surged to the hospitals and COVID-19 positive admission rates reached to historical high numbers in 2020. However, the fear of contagion made some patients with angina or equivalents to present to the facilities either very late or did not present at all. Furthermore, universal efforts to inhibit the spread of the virus have resulted in unwanted deviations in the STEMI guidelines. The donning and doffing process of the protective personal equipment (PPE) and the absence of negative pressure systems in the most cardiac catheter laboratories have required additional steps and tests prior to initiating emergent percutaneous coronary interventions. Therefore, large delays have been seen in symptom onset to hospital time as well as door-to-balloon time due to contemporary hospital disinfection protocols. 2\n\n【54】Conversely, the total number of non-COVID-19 hospitalisations in 2020 declined remarkably in comparison with the hospitalisations in 2019. 11 12 A retrospective analysis from Italy showed that COVID-19 negative STEMIs experienced approximately two times longer door-to-balloon time in 2020 as compared with the door-to-balloon time in the pre-COVID years. Also, the major adverse cardiac events were more likely to be seen in the study group. 13 At the beginning of the outbreak, there was a significant reduction in acute cardiac admissions and length of stay concerning about disruption in acute care of cardiovascular conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. 11\n\n【55】In terms of non-COVID-19 non-cardiac emergencies, delayed care seeking due to disruption in the healthcare utilisation has resulted in increased morbidity and mortality. An observational prospective study enrolling a total of 185 patients has shown that 50% of the acute surgical cases who tested negative for the COVID-19 experienced service delay in healthcare and presented late with stage IV cancer as underlying aetiology. 14\n\n【56】According to a nationwide, web-based 1-week survey between June 24 and June 30 2020, 41% of the US adults were found to have avoidance of medical care during the pandemic due to concerns about COVID-19. Medical care delay was more prevalent in non-Hispanic black population, young adults, aged 18–24 years, disabled persons and those with chronic conditions. The percentage of individuals who denied seeking emergent/urgent care was about 12% based on the survey. Approximately one-third of the survey population reported delay in routine care in regards to a degree of fear and worry in the general population. 15\n\n【57】Despite the outbreak-related delays in acute cardiac care, primary PCI still remains the cornerstone treatment strategy for patients who had a STEMI at PCI-capable hospitals when it could be provided in a timely manner, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated cardiac catheterisation laboratory (CCL). In order to prevent late door-to-balloon time in STEMIs, several actions have been recommended by cardiac societies across high-impact regions in the USA. These actions include a quick screening for COVID-19, the use of ultra-rapid COVID-19 testing if available, rapid classification of patients with STEMI into COVID-19 positive/probable or COVID-19 possible groups and transferring COVID-19 positive or probable STEMIs to dedicated CCLs. 16\n\n【58】The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to AMI and its complications is largely unknown since the data are lacking. Additionally, large delays from diagnosis to treatment in this context have become ordinary during the pandemic and it is unclear the amount of impact on morbidity and mortality rates due to increased risk of developing post-MI complications. Moreover, patients who had an AMI who chose not to seek medical attention could probably have been affected the most.\n\n【59】Our case signals a potential shift in the characteristics of patients who had an AMI with regards to the pandemic. It also highlights the importance of educating our patients and the population in general about the devastating complications from acute medical emergencies and the essence of timely presentation to the hospital to avoid such complications.\n\n【60】### Learning points\n\n【61】   Late presenting myocardial infarction (MI) cases increase due to COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n【62】   High index of suspicion for MI-related complications especially post MI ventricular septal rupture (VSR).\n\n【63】   Physical examination is the crucial step to suspect post MI VSR.\n\n【64】   Use of percutaneous mechanic circulatory support to bridge surgery if feasible.\n\n【65】   The importance of optimal timing of surgery in the management of post MI VSR.\n\n【66】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【67】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【68】Consent obtained from next of kin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The pain was diffuse, dull aching and non-radiating. Rest pain was present. It was aggravated with activity and decreased partially with analgesics. She had no other joint pains. No history of trauma, fever, loss of weight or appetite was noted. She had no previous medical conditions. On examination, she was found to have medial joint tenderness. Her knee range of movement was upto 110° of flexion. No other significant finding was noted. Standing radiographs of the knee  at first glance showed medial joint space narrowing. On careful inspection, abnormal areas of lucency were noted in the medullary cavity of the distal end of femur, surrounded by inconspicuous sclerosis. No periosteal reaction or soft tissue changes were noted. This radiograph was seen earlier by two orthopaedic surgeons who the patient had consulted, and she was told to have arthritis changes only. We performed an MRI , which showed a serpiginous lesion involving the medullary cavity of the distal end of femur and proximal end of tibia. It was noted to involve the metaphyseal and epiphyseal regions, extending till the articular surface. The lesion was hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 and STIR sequences.

It occurs due to ischaemia, resulting in destruction of bone architecture. 1 The possible aetiology suggested include trauma, caisson disease, sickle cell disease, long-term steroid use, alcoholism and dyslipidaemia. 2 In our case, no risk factor could be identified. The association between arthritis of the knee joint and bone infarct has not been studied earlier. It usually involves the metaphyseal region and is located around the knee joint. It is often asymptomatic. It can be diagnosed on radiographs by the presence of metaphyseal, medullary lesion with a serpiginous border. 3 MRI shows a hypointense lesion with a rim of hyperintensity on T2 weighted sequences. An important finding to note in MRI is that the central signal remains that of normal marrow. 4 This helps differentiate it from its closest differential diagnosis of enchondroma, in which the central marrow signal is absent. 5 Though predominantly benign, it is important for this condition to be identified and followed up, as be associated with secondary malignancy. 6 7 In our case, the lesion was atypically involving the epiphysis as well, extending until the articular surface. No such cases have been reported in literature. The association with arthritis of the joint also remains unexplored. Its occurrence in a young adult with no other risk factors suggests its aetiology is still to be fully understood. The fact that the radiograph findings were inconspicuous and missed by two other surgeons, while the MRI had such large lesions suggests that the lesion could very often pass undiagnosed.\n\n【14】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【15】I have been having this knee pain since 3 months. I consulted two orthopaedic doctors previously and they both asked for X rays. They had said X rays showed some age-related changes. Only after coming to this hospital, I was told that there is some destruction in my bone and I will need to follow-up regularly with X rays.\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】   Bone infarct can be a rare cause of pain around the knee joint.\n\n【18】   Smoke up the chimney appearance on imaging is characteristic.\n\n【19】   On MRI, central signal intensity similar to marrow is an important finding to differentiate it from enchondroma.\n\n【20】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【21】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【22】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The patient denied any recent trauma or neck manipulation. Neurological and ophthalmological examinations were unremarkable. Notably, the patient had no family history, medical history or clinical signs of connective tissue disease, such as joint hypermobility, easy bruising or poor wound healing that might suggest underlying vulnerability to vascular dissection. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (104 mm/hour) and C reactive protein (19.6 mg/L) were markedly elevated. CT angiogram showed tortuosity and ectasia of the cervical internal carotid arteries with septa suggestive of past dissections . Brain MRI was unremarkable. A few months earlier the patient had suffered acute renal failure and was found to have obstructive uropathy due to retroperitoneal fibrosis. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed hypermetabolic soft tissue thickening along the aorta and iliac arteries . MRI showed slight bilateral lacrimal gland enlargement . Serum IgG4 concentration was twice the upper limit of normal. There was no cryoglobulinemia, leucopenia or eosinophilia, and tests for autoantibodies were negative. Biopsy of the retroperitoneal tissue was not pursued as it was considered unsafe. Even in the absence of histopathology, the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) based on the recently revised criteria. 1 The patient was treated with prednisone for IgG4-RD and aspirin for the carotid dissection with normalisation of the IgG4 levels and no further episodes of vision loss. IgG4-RD is a systemic inflammatory disorder characterised by matted infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and fibrosis in multiple tissues. 2 The most frequent neurological manifestation is hypertrophic pachymeningitis, and the most common carotid-associated pathology is atherosclerosis, but arteritis is described in up to 30% of patients. We cannot be certain that there had not been prior dissections, but in the absence of a history of trauma, clinical signs of connective tissue disease, evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia in other vessels or other identifiable risk factors for carotid dissection, we suggest that the patient’s arterial dissections are likely a manifestation of IgG4-RD with vasculitis presenting as amaurosis fugax. 3 4 IgG4-RD is an increasingly recognised disorder with cerebrovascular consequences and thus should be considered among the causes of vasculitis.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Multiplanar reconstruction image of the CT angiogram with coronal (A, B) and axial views at the corresponding dashed lines (C, D, respectively).

We describe the case of a 49-year-old woman, on immunsuppressive therapy for multiple sclerosis, who presented with a 3-month history of debilitating back pain. She had a recent episode of periodontitis, and was under regular dental review. Her MRI scan demonstrated findings suggestive of L2–L3 spondylodiscitis. Her CT-guided biopsy yielded negative cultures and the patient failed two courses of empirical antibiotic treatment. With clinical and radiological disease progression, she underwent a percutaneous disc washout and biopsy, which subsequently grew F. nucleatum . Treatment with clindamycin and metronidazole was commenced orally for 6 weeks. She improved gradually, and at 1 year follow-up was asymptomatic. The diagnosis of spondylodiscitis caused by F. nucleatum is challenging. The perseverance on identification by surgical biopsy, minimally invasive washout and targeted antibiotics are the mainstay of effective treatment.\n\n【2】   multiple sclerosis\n   bone and joint infections\n   dentistry and oral medicine\n\n【3】http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-239664\n\n【4】Statistics from Altmetric.com\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】   multiple sclerosis\n   bone and joint infections\n   dentistry and oral medicine\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】The last three decades have seen a significant increase in the incidence of pyogenic spondylodiscitis due to a number of multifactorial reasons—most importantly increased life expectancy, chronic diseases, rise in the prevalence of immunosuppressed patients, intravenous drug abuse and an increase in spinal surgery with instrumentation. 1 On the other hand, improved radiological investigative sensitivity and techniques with microbiological diagnoses contribute to greater accuracy. 1 2 The common causative organisms of spontaneous pyogenic spondylodiscitis are Staphylococcus aureus , Enterococci , Streptococcus species and gram negative bacilli. Only 3%–4% of spondylodiscitis is caused by rare anaerobic pathogens like Propionibacterium acnes and Bacteroides fragilis . 2\n\n【8】Poor oral hygiene has been traditionally associated with a higher incidence of postoperative spinal infections, 3 which encompasses gum issues commonly known as ‘periodontal disease’, normally affecting about 20%–50% of global population. 4 Recent studies have evidenced a causal association between chronic periodontitis and multiple sclerosis in female patients. 5 The best treatments in this vulnerable age group are prevention and thorough hygiene, which provide satisfactory results and improve the quality of life. 6 In patients unable to carry out effective oral hygiene, dental treatment should be performed by dental hygienists and/or dentists to prevent dental caries and periodontal disease. 6\n\n【9】Fusobacterium nucleatum is an important commensal oral pathogen with a well-defined role in pathogenesis of the periodontal disease. Patients with multiple sclerosis and more importantly, those on immunomodulators, are at a higher risk of developing a spinal infection, which may be caused by atypical pathogens spread haematogenously from the oral source. Such low-virulent organisms present a diagnostic challenge to clinicians and require a keen eye of suspicion, acknowledgement of dental history and more aggressive invasive methods of diagnosis and treatment with surgical biopsy and appropriate antibiotic therapy. We hereby present a rare case of F. nucleatum spondylodiscitis in an immunosuppressed patient known to have multiple sclerosis with a background of chronic periodontitis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 49-year-old female patient was admitted to a medical ward in our hospital, with chest pain and severe back pain of mechanical nature. The pain was worse while mobilising, with a visual analogue score of 10/10. There was no neurological deficit and her bladder and bowel function was intact. Her body temperature was normal and the blood samples taken on admission showed normal white blood cells, normal liver and renal function; C reactive protein (CRP) was mildly raised to 48 mg/L (0–10 mg/L).\n\n【12】The patient had been diagnosed 8 years previously with multiple sclerosis and had been on dimethyl fumarate 240 mg two times per day (Tecfidera, Biogen, Cambridge, MA, USA) for many years, a disease modifying medication. Further, only 25 days earlier, she had been admitted to another hospital because of severe back pain and fever. The blood cultures taken at previous hospital were negative but her CRP was raised to more than 200 mg/L. An MRI of her lumbar spine showed an infective/inflammatory process involving the L2/L3 disc space . She was treated empirically with intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g once a day and 220 mg of gentamicin every other day. Her fever, degree of pain and inflammatory markers responded to the treatment. A new MRI before discharge from the previous hospital showed some improvement in the radiological appearance of her infective/inflammatory process and after 2 weeks of inpatient antibiotics she was discharged home with co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) 625 mg, three times a day.\n\n【13】<img/>\n\n【14】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【16】(A) Sagittal T2 STIR 通用删除1(英):<u>(Short-TI Inversion Recovery)</u>-weighted sequence and (B) sagittal T1 sequence of the initial lumbar spine MRI performed at another hospital, showing mild involvement of the L2/3 disc space but significant prevertebral collection.\n\n【17】As a result of the presence of her chest pain and shortness of breath, she was referred to the respiratory and cardiology teams in our hospital. An echocardiogram revealed of mild pericardial effusion of 0.4 cm but ruled out the presence of endocarditis. The cardiologists recommended 400 mg of ibuprofen three times a day. However, a lumbar MRI did confirm a worsening radiological picture of the L2/L3 disc space pathology and increased prevertebral collection  with a CRP of 16 mg/L. Her case was discussed with the spinal and microbiology teams and a CT-guided biopsy of L2/L3 disc space was recommended . Despite a good sample by a senior musculoskeletal radiologist, the result was negative for bacteria, fungi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Further, the histological examination did not reveal the presence of any infection (including granulomas).\n\n【18】<img/>\n\n【19】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【21】(A) Sagittal T2 STIR通用删除1(英):<u>(Short-TI Inversion Recovery)</u>-weighted sequence and (B) sagittal T1 sequence of the lumbar spine MRI performed at our hospital before the CT-guided biopsy, showing an increase of the disc involvement as well as expansion of the infective process to the vertebral bodies.\n\n【22】<img/>\n\n【23】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3</u>\n\n【25】CT-guided biopsy showing optimal positioning of the needle in the involved area of the L2/L3 intervertebral disc.\n\n【26】Subsequently, her clinical presentation did improve and she was sent home on ibuprofen as per the advice of the cardiologists without antibiotic therapy because of the lack of evidence of a confirmed infection and only a mildly raised level of CRP to 20 mg/L. Unfortunately, she re-presented 3 weeks later with worsening back pain and this time was admitted to our spinal unit. A new MRI scan showed progression of the L2/L3 spondylodiscitis with bone destruction, an increase in size of the prevertebral collection and bone marrow oedema involving the majority of the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies . Her CRP was markedly raised at 62 mg/L but her white cell count remained normal. This time the decision was to take a more aggressive approach with a percutaneous minimal invasive intervertebral disc biopsy at L2/L3 and washout. Before the procedure, the presence of endocarditis, lung and urinary tract infection or any recent traumatic/invasive procedure was ruled out. F. nucleatum was isolated from the sample and to the patient was administrated clindamycin 450 mg oral four times a day and metronidazole 400 mg three times a day for 6 weeks orally.\n\n【27】<img/>\n\n【28】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【29】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4</u>\n\n【30】(A) Sagittal T2 STIR通用删除1(英):<u>(Short-TI Inversion Recovery)</u>-weighted sequence and (B) axial T2 sequence of the preoperative MRI showing an increase in size of the intervertebral abscess and the involvement of almost the entire vertebral bodies of L2 and L3.\n\n【31】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【32】The combination of the raised CRP value and the radiological investigations were crucial to understand the dynamics of the spinal low-grade infection. The progression from her initial MRI scan  performed in another hospital to the subsequent MRI  performed in our hospital confirmed disease progression but we believe that the administration of ibuprofen from the cardiologists kept her CRP levels down to 16 mg/L.\n\n【33】From the diagnostic point of view, biopsy is the gold standard procedure to obtain microbiological and histopathological diagnoses in spinal infections. In our opinion, the negative result after a technically correct CT-guided biopsy  was likely due to the recent usage of antibiotics as well as to the smaller amount of abscess which reduced bacterial load in the sample.\n\n【34】Fluoroscopic and CT-guided spinal biopsies have been shown to have comparable accuracy ranging from 16.1% to 92.3%. 7 This variability is probably related to multiple factors such as local anatomy, spinal level, operator experience, biopsy approaches and needle sizes as well as the timing and the accuracy of the microbiological workup. 8 In a very recent prospective study, the accuracy of spinal biopsy for fluoroscopic-guided spinal biopsy and CT-guided spinal biopsy for spinal infections was similar at 59% and 61%, respectively. 9\n\n【35】The last MRI scan before the surgical treatment scan showed bone destruction, an increase in size of the prevertebral collection progression  making the microbiological diagnosis mandatory and the surgical intervention inevitable in order to establish diagnosis and facilitate her treatment.\n\n【36】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【37】The presence of back pain with rapidly progressive radiological vertebral end-plate changes is highly suggestive of an infective process in the lumbar spine. 1 2 The main differential diagnosis considerations are aseptic or necrotic changes, but rapid progression combined with the lack of chemotherapy or radiotherapy minimise such a possibility. Thus, the infective process was the main working diagnosis and our challenge was to obtain a good sample and to isolate the causative agent. The history of dental cleaning 4–5 weeks before the onset of the back pain, the negative blood cultures, the low levels of CRP and the fact that the patient had been on long-term immunomodulators and recently on ibuprofen highlighted the possibility of dealing with a rare microbial agent with low virulence, causing atypical spondylodiscitis and even pericardiditis.\n\n【38】Treatment\n---------\n\n【39】Our patient underwent a percutaneous minimal invasive intervertebral L2–L3 disc biopsy and disc washout.\n\n【40】Under general anaesthesia, the patient was placed prone on a radiolucent table and the C-arm fluoroscope was positioned to clearly identify the L2–L3 disc space. The discographic approach was used to percutaneously insert two Jamshidi biopsy needles, one either side, directed into the disc space . Care was taken to position both needles in the centre of the involved L2–L3 disc. A 20 mL luer lock syringe was attached to both the Jamshidi needles and used to aspirate the disc content sequentially. The aspirated sample, consisting of a white-yellowish colour high viscosity fluid, was sent for microbiological analysis. The aspirated disc material was sent for histological examination.\n\n【41】<img/>\n\n【42】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【43】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5</u>\n\n【44】(A) Intraoperative C-arm imaging Antero-Posterior (AP) and (B) lateral projections showing good placement of the Jamshidi needles to the targeted lesion in both antero-posterior and lateral view. (C) Intraoperative picture with good positioning of the Jamshidi needles during the process of washout highlighting the different colours of the syringes due to the saline flow (right needle for injection of saline and left for aspiration).\n\n【45】Following this, a new 20 mL syringe containing normal saline was attached to the Jamshidi needle on one side and an empty syringe on the opposite side. The disc was then washed out with normal saline solution from one needle, which was aspirated and collected in the empty syringe on the opposite side . The first 10 mL of saline disc washout was sent for an additional microbiological evaluation, and the remaining washout fluid was discarded. Interestingly, active suction with the empty syringe was not required as the injected saline pressure from one side filled up the empty syringe on the other side. This process was then repeated and reversed until the fluid ran clear and at least 500 mL of normal saline has been flushed through the disc space. The needles were withdrawn, the stab incisions were closed with 3–0 ethilon sutures and sterile dressings applied. There were no perioperative surgical complications.\n\n【46】This technique (not too dissimilar to a discography approach) can be performed under local anaesthesia or conscious sedation and is very cost effective as only a C-arm image intensifier and two Jamshidi needles are required. The access to the disc space through soft tissue provides more freedom and better positioning of the needle to the disc space, allowing debridement of the disc space and decrease of the bacterial load through the continuous washout. The aspiration on one side is performed while saline is injected from the opposite side. Further, the discographic approach avoids the penetration of the bone elements of the posterior arch and the spinal canal, reducing the risk of posterior spread of the infection and other complications. If considered appropriate, local antibiotics can be injected at the end of the procedure. Finally, this simple technique is technically less demanding and can be easily adapted to different hospital settings. 10\n\n【47】The microbiological samples isolated F. nucleatum and based on the drug sensitivity patterns, with advice from the microbiology team, the patient was started on clindamycin 450 mg orally four times a day and metronidazole 400 mg orally three times a day for 6 weeks.\n\n【48】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【49】Immediately after the surgery, the patient’s pain improved by more than 50%. The CRP decreased to half its preoperative value 2 days after the procedure, and was back to normal at 2 weeks postoperatively. She was discharged from the hospital on oral antibiotics. She was subsequently seen regularly at 6 weeks, 6 months and a year after the procedure. Her symptoms gradually improved, with no back pain and her inflammatory markers all remained within the normal range throughout the course of treatment and follow-up. A follow-up MRI performed at the end of the 1 year follow-up  showed excellent resolution of the infection, with only a minimal residual marrow oedema; our patient was entirely asymptomatic and discharged from the spinal team.\n\n【50】<img/>\n\n【51】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【52】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6</u>\n\n【53】(A) Sagittal T2 STIR通用删除1(英):<u>(Short-TI Inversion Recovery)</u>-weighted and (B) sagittal T1 sequence of the lumbar spine MRI performed one year postoperatively, showing excellent response with significant resolution of the reactive oedema and improvement of the infective process affecting the L2/L3 intervertebral disc.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】We speculated that, during the process of professional dental cleaning, our patient sustained some bleeding from her gum and this most likely caused a temporary bacteremia, which was then propagated to a distant intervertebral space. In fact, her back pain started 4–5 weeks after the oral cleansing. Moreover, the patient suffered from a concomitant pericarditis and is not unlikely that, both her spondylodiscitis and pericarditis to have been caused by the same pathogen. The pericarditis caused by anaerobic bacteria is a rare but well-known entity with the first case of pericarditis caused by Fusiform nucleatum reported by Truant et al . 11 12\n\n【56】Our patient was on dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera, Biogen, USA), a pleiotropic immunomodulatory medication of the immune system. The main adverse effect is the reduction in the amount of lymphocytes, although only about 4% (1 in 25) of patients treated with Tecfidera develop a more serious drop in lymphocyte count, resulting in lymphopenia. The most serious adverse effect are progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and Fanconi syndrome, which are considered very rare. 13 Dimethyl fumarate which had not caused lymphopenia, but in any case was stopped after the suspicion of infection.\n\n【57】More than 700 bacterial species or phylotypes, of which over 50% have not been cultivated, have been detected in the oral cavity. 14 Among them, Fusobacterium is a genus of anaerobic filamentous gram-negative rods that are members of the phylum Fusobacteria . They can be divided into 13 species that inhabit the oral, gastrointestinal, upper respiratory tract and vaginal mucosa. F. nucleatum is the species most commonly described causing human infection and Lemierre’s syndrome is the best known infection associated with it. 15 Although, recently, Laurencet et al , reported a case of Lemierre’s syndrome caused by F. nucleatum and co-existing L4/L5 spondylodiscitis. 16\n\n【58】To our knowledge, only 18 cases of vertebral spondylodiscitis due to the Fusobacterium species have been described in the literature. 16–18 Of those, 12 cases were exclusively caused by F. nucleatum . In approximately 1/3 of cases, the diagnosis was based on the blood cultures and in 2/3 of the cases on disc aspirates. All samples required prolonged incubation at least 3 days but in one case, PCR followed by 16S rDNA sequencing was required to detect the pathogen. 18 Seven of 18 patients detected in the literature (39%) had significant history of oral problems: five with periodontitis and two with dental root abscess. In some cases the oral pathology was completely asymptomatic and the correlation between the spinal infection and oral flora was made after the cultures. 17\n\n【59】The hallmark in the successful management of spinal spondylodiscitis is the isolation of the causative agent. Medical treatment remains the first-line management but the presence of neurological compromise with or without vertebral collapse and failure of conservative management are the two main indications for surgical treatment.\n\n【60】In the majority of cases, the treatment of the spondylodiscitis caused by F. nucleatum is medical, with a combination of antibiotics. In only 4 out of 18 cases, the treatment was surgical with open surgery to drain the abscess and/or to stabilise the spine performed. 16–18\n\n【61】We preferred the minimal invasive percutaneous biopsy and washout because of several reasons. 19 First, the amount of the pus in the most recent MRI was greater, giving us a confidence in achieving a good representative sample. Second, in immunocompromised patients, a minimal access approach is advantageous to reduce the chances of postoperative complications associated with larger (open) surgeries. Finally, alongside the biopsy, we performed surgical irrigation and debridement in order to maximise the treatment.\n\n【62】### Learning points\n\n【63】   Fusobacterium nucleatum , although a normal commensal of oral flora, can cause pyogenic spondylodiscitis especially in susceptible immunocompromised population.\n\n【64】   Taking an accurate history of oral hygiene and possible dentistry procedures is crucial when dealing with the possibility of distant infections such as spondylodiscitis and cardiac infections.\n\n【65】   Accurate microbiological diagnosis and drug-sensitive antibiotic therapy are effective in treating infection in the absence of neurological symptoms.\n\n【66】   CT-guided biopsy may be insufficient in providing adequate sample to isolate the pathogen and a low threshold for a surgical biopsy should be maintained. This enables an adequate sample for microbiological and histopathological diagnoses to be obtained, reduces the bacteriological load providing immediate postoperative relief of symptoms and improves the antibiotic penetration and efficacy.\n\n【67】   The importance of a multidisciplinary team effort and awareness is highlighted. Dentists should be aware of the risk of haematogenous spread of commensal oral flora in patients suffering with periodontitis; neurologists should recognise the possibility of atypical distant systemic infections in patients with multiple sclerosis on immunomodulators; microbiologists should maintain a high index of suspicion for low-grade atypical infective pathogens and ensure adequate culture techniques are employed to isolate these organisms; lastly, spinal surgeons should persist in obtaining an accurate sample from the infective site, and in the presence of low-virulent infections, adopt a more aggressive approach with minimally invasive methods of percutaneous disc biopsy and washout.\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors are particularly grateful to Dr Vivienne Weston, consultant microbiologist and Dr Yuriy Arlachov, consultant radiologist for their crucial help throughout the treatment of this challenging case.

She was referred for cardiac examination with the progressive dyspnoea on exertion for the prior 8 months, with symptoms on less than ordinary physical activity (New York Heart Association class 3). She now presented to our clinic with an episode of syncope while on her evening walk. Physical examination was significant for a slow-rising pulse, a heaving apex impulse and a late-peaking, grade 3 ejection systolic murmur best heard at the left second intercostal space with no radiation to the carotids.\n\n【6】Baseline blood investigations demonstrated a normocytic, normochromic anaemia (haemoglobin 97 g/L), subtherapeutic vitamin D <sub>2 </sub> (7 ng/mL) and elevated parathyroid hormone levels (108 pg/mL), with normal calcium and phosphate levels. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated dense MAC with haemodynamically significant mitral stenosis (with an estimated mitral valve area by the continuity method of 1.0 cm <sup>2 </sup> ) and mild mitral regurgitation with estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures of 55 mm Hg (consistent with moderate pulmonary hypertension). The presence of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with a preserved systolic function prompted a close search for a pathology increasing the left ventricular afterload.

Pharmacological therapy (beta blockers and calcium channel blockers) is first line as they improve obstructive symptoms by decreasing the heart rate and prolonging diastolic fill time, elevating their quality of life. 4 Septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation are available for severe cases with the goal of decreasing the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction gradient and restoring proper flow. 4–6 There have also been a small number of cases using covered stents to occlude septal perforators—due to collateralisation, there has been mixed long-term results. 7–10\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A woman in her 60s was evaluated following an abnormal echocardiogram, indicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Symptoms were progressively worsening for 6–18 months and included severe exertional dyspnoea, exertional chest pressure, exertional dizziness and resting dizziness, which worsened while dehydrated. History of cerebrovascular accident, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. No family cardiac history including no sudden death. Brief smoking history 35 years ago. Medication included 100 mg/day metoprolol. Physical examination showed a body mass index (BMI) of 34.39 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> BMI and a 2/6 aortic area systolic murmur, which increased to 3/6 with Valsalva and standing.\n\n【13】The original echocardiogram  showed ejection fraction of 70%–75%, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with dynamic subaortic stenosis and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (156 mm Hg gradient with provocation) and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Cardiac MRI  displayed a severe ostial tract obstruction (130 mm Hg gradient with provocation) and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation with systolic anterior motion. Myectomy or alcohol septal ablation were offered. Investigatory coronary angiogram found mild-to-moderate non-obstructive coronary artery disease involving the right coronary artery and a significant subaortic outflow tract gradient of >100 mm Hg with spike and dome pattern—alcohol septal ablation was planned.\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【17】Echocardiograms prestent placement (top) and poststent placement (bottom).

A 0.14 coronary wire was placed into the second septal perforator. A 2.0 balloon occluded the second septal perforator’s origin and dye was injected distally. There was no extravasation or backflow in the left anterior descending; however, dye was seen within the right ventricle—confirmed echocardiographically with the presence of Definity contrast agent in the right ventricle . Wiring of the third and fourth septal perforators was then attempted. During which, a flow-limiting dissection of the mid-left anterior descending was identified. Due to these procedural findings, the alcohol septal ablation was not performed. Instead, a Papyrus 3.5 × 20 mm covered stent was placed at the origins of the third and fourth septal perforators overlapping distally with a Xience 2.75 × 12 mm drug-eluted stent . This resulted in thrombolysis in myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3 flow and improvement of the left ventricular outflow tract gradient from 90 to 30 mm Hg with provocation, measured intraoperatively. On follow-up evaluation, her symptoms had drastically decreased and an echocardiogram showed a significantly improved left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 35–49 mm Hg with provocation (original echocardiogram showed 156–158 mm Hg).

Two months postoperation, their symptoms remained decreased.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】The present case used a covered stent since the original plan of alcohol septal ablation was abandoned due to mid-left anterior descending dissection and communication of the second septal perforator with the right ventricle. Stent placement over the origins of the third and fourth septal perforators resulted in a significantly decreased left ventricular outflow tract obstruction gradient as well as improved symptoms. While this is an atypical approach, it has been used previously. 7–10\n\n【35】The first successful case of treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with a covered stent was published in 1999. A covered stent was used to cover the origins of three septal perforators since balloon occlusion of each perforator individually only led to a partial gradient decrease. The intervention led to a ‘complete reduction’ in the gradient and after 4 months, the patient remained asymptomatic. 10 In 2003, an alcohol septal ablation was unable to be performed due to the branch angle of the first septal perforator so a stent was placed occluding the origin. This resulted in 6 asymptomatic months with a decreased gradient (21 mm Hg) before collateralisation from the right coronary artery resulted in recurrence of symptoms and gradient (97 mm Hg); myectomy was then performed. 7 In 2004, a covered stent was used due to the inability to cannulate the first septal artery; collateralisation from the right coronary artery led to symptom recurrence after an undisclosed period of time. 8 Finally, in 2006, a woman with coronary artery disease and an alcohol septal ablation 6 months prior had a covered stent placed after symptom recurrence due to 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending and D1. Twelve months after placement, her gradient remained low and she was asymptomatic. 9 These cases display the varying reasons for covered stent placement to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy along with their results over a relatively short follow-up period.\n\n【36】Our patient remains improved 2 months postprocedure, which is consistent with previous cases. However, two of the four previous cases ultimately resulted in symptom recurrence due to collateralisation and the two that did not either had a previous alcohol septal ablation performed or was only 4 months postprocedure. With that said, since alcohol septal ablation was contraindicated due to the risk of leaking through the dissection or ablating a portion of the right ventricle through the communication, the covered stent was a satisfactory backup for this unique patient. Additionally, with the limited data available, it seems that treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by occluding the origins of septal perforators with a covered stent provides short-term symptom relief and a reduced gradient. Nevertheless, long-term results are uncertain at this point and more data is needed to draw further conclusions.\n\n【37】### Learning points\n\n【38】   To understand how using a covered stent to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction can be considered in cases where alcohol septal ablation is either difficult or contraindicated.\n\n【39】   To recognise that while this case shows short-term efficacy, long-term conclusions should not be drawn due to varying results with previous case reports and no long-term follow-up.\n\n【40】   To acknowledge that more scientific data must validate this approach before it is routinely considered concomitantly with alcohol septal ablation or myectomy.\n\n【41】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【42】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【43】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

LMS is considered a subtype of spindle cell sarcoma and resemble smooth muscle cells with atypia and increased mitoses, unlike benign leiomyomas. 9 10 Cutaneous LMS presents as slow growing and either as a circumscribed nodular tumour or a poorly defined induration of the skin. 11 According to Begum and Hossain, the standard guidelines recommend performing a soft tissue ultrasound scan to confirm the mass and show the plane of the mass. 12 Ultrasonography has been found to be more sensitive compared with palpation for identifying lipohypertrophy (98% and 70%, respectively). 13 In addition, executing an immunohistochemistry (IHC) of a biopsy sample of the mass would reveal prominently actin positive, desmin positive and is CD34 negative. 14 Specifically, the CD34 staining would be able to distinguish cutaneous LMS from lipomas, which are strongly positive for CD34. 15 Using these standardised approaches when suspecting a cutaneous LMS would lend to a more accurate differential diagnosis. 16 This case study is one example of the repercussions of the underlying challenges of the US healthcare system in a medically underserved community negatively impacting a person on LMI.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 67-year-old cisgender woman with T2DM and obesity presented to her primary care physician with a mass on her left proximal arm . Her history of poorly controlled T2DM was exacerbated by challenges in continuity of healthcare due to her rural location and further compounded by socioeconomic factors, including poverty and access to appropriate nutritional support. The patient first noticed the lump on her arm 4 years before attending her family physician with this complaint . The lump was situated at the site of where she injected herself with insulin. The patient described the lump as soft, non-painful and had been gradually increasing in size. At that point, a clinical diagnosis of lipoma was made by the primary care physician without biopsy or histological confirmation to exclude malignancy or infection. Due to a combination of lack of resources in the rural setting and limited patient health literacy, no further action was taken at that time. Subsequently, the mass increased in size and rapidly enlarged becoming firm and painful. Imaging was ultimately obtained, with an ultrasound and MRI revealing a mass suspicious for neoplasia. The patient attributes this delay from presentation to diagnostic imaging to limited access to quality healthcare resources in her rural community due to financial constraints, physical accessibility and miscommunication between members of her healthcare team.\n\n【13】<img/>\n\n【14】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【16】Prior to rupture of the tumour due to intralesional pressure (A, B), postrupture (C) and postsurgical resection (D).\n\n【17】<img/>\n\n【18】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【20】Timeline outlining the patient’s clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes.\n\n【21】The mass grew to approximately 12×15 cm, causing purple discolouration and skin breakdown . The patient’s pain had become more pronounced, radiating up her neck, with additional numbness and tingling in the tips of her four fingers and thumb. Open biopsy followed, confirming a high-grade pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma. The mass was Murine Double Minute 2 (MDM2) negative, which indicated it was not a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The patient’s care team, which is not involved in the production of this case report, did not perform any additional IHC to further characterise the tumour at that time. Copious hematoma-like fluid was also obtained, and reaccumulated in the surgical cavity at the primary tumour site. A CT pulmonary angiogram was negative for metastases, and she received a course of preoperative radiotherapy. Shortly after radiotherapy, the tumour filled with fluid and erupted due to pressure, prompting urgent surgical resection of the mass .\n\n【22】The histopathology report of the resection described a 12.5×8.3×5.4 cm tumour, of which 60% was considered postradiation necrotic material. Microscopically, the tumour was pleomorphic, with spindle cell features and high-grade cytological atypia and high mitotic activity. CD34 levels were not assessed. Malignant samples were strongly positive for SMA and desmin, and negative for S-100, CD31, AE1/AE3, CD10 and MNF116, classifying the tumour as a high-grade LMS, with pathological staging of ypT3. The margins were uninvolved, but the surrounding soft tissue was oedematous and fibrotic, with areas of haemorrhage and necrosis.\n\n【23】The patient engaged in postoperative outpatient occupational therapy (OT), where an occupational analysis and subsequent care plan addressing the patient’s barriers to postsurgical care was conducted. The care plan involved the person, environment and occupation by addressing the underlying diseases of T2DM and obesity. The focus of OT was her activities of daily living as well as supportive services needed to address the patient’s current concerns relative to engaging in daily life. Moreover, the OT provided physical rehabilitation including lymphoedema management, scar mobilisation and strengthening of the affected arm. On discharge postoperative outpatient OT, the patient obtained satisfactory strength and range of motion in the affected arm which allowed her to return to work and maintain independent living.\n\n【24】Multiple MRI and CT imaging postresection demonstrated no recurrence of disease. Since her last primary care visit, the patient developed a similar mass on her contralateral shoulder and it has yet to be evaluated, imaged, or biopsied. The patient continues to reside in a rural, medically underserved area, with the nearest urban healthcare resources approximately 225 km (140 miles) away. Her ongoing socioeconomic and medical access barriers have been compounded by COVID-19 and continued to delay her follow-up care. The patient endured psychosocial despair and limited social support during COVID-19. As a result, the patient was unable to again obtain timely follow-up diagnostics.\n\n【25】Global health problems list\n---------------------------\n\n【26】1.  Increase of T2DM and obesity in rural USA and low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC).\n\n【27】2.  Lack/delay of accessible medical care in rural USA and LMIC.\n\n【28】3.  Health literacy and agency for patients living in rural areas.\n\n【29】### Global health problem analysis\n\n【30】#### Increase of T2DM and obesity in rural USA and LMIC\n\n【31】Rates of obesity continue to rise in the USA and globally. Initially, urbanisation was thought to be an important root of this increase; however, higher obesity prevalence is seen in rural communities when compared with urban areas in the USA as well as many other countries. 17 18 Consequently, there is a rising disparity in the incidence and treatment of obesity-related disorders, including T2DM, in rural communities as compared with urban communities. The rate of T2DM in rural America is about 17% higher than in urban areas. 19 In addition, mortality related to T2DM is almost 3–5 times higher in rural areas. 20 Factors contributing to this increased mortality include being on LMI, limited access to endocrinology specialists, mistrust of larger urban healthcare facilities and providers, and lack of transportation. 21 22 Globally, T2DM and T2DM-related morbidity and mortality rates in rural communities increased markedly, especially with COVID-19. 23 24 The COVID-19 pandemic underscored how the combination of being on LMI, diabetic, rural, low health literacy and obesity are a recipe for worsening clinical outcomes in LMIC compared with rural areas in high-income countries (HIC). 25\n\n【32】The patient described in this case report attended her primary care clinic every 6 months for the management of her diabetes. She had a different provider every visit, which limited her continuity of care. She obtained her insulin from her local pharmacy, outside of the clinic she was seen for her diabetes. Furthermore, the patient lived alone and was solely responsible for injecting herself. The patient’s mass was first noticed by a phlebotomist during a routine blood test. The phlebotomist recommended that the patient seek medical evaluation of the non-healing mass.\n\n【33】#### Lack/delay of accessible medical care in rural USA and LMIC\n\n【34】The aetiology of the LMS should not be the focal point of this case study. The focus here is on differentiating a lipoma versus LMS using standardised approaches. Correct diagnosis and effective treatment were delayed in this patient because of the multifactorial failures in US healthcare system and lack of support for people on LMI. According to the World Bank and WHO, half of the world’s population does not have access to essential health services. 26 In addition, rural US communities experience other barriers to healthcare disproportionally, including increased distance travelled to access healthcare services, lack of reliable transportation, poor health literacy, social stigma and privacy concerns. 27 Rural areas are often medically underserved lacking both primary and specialist care clinicians and other healthcare workers. 28 29 Brouns et al reported doctor delay occurred in 27 of 100 patients with the most frequent reason being a misdiagnosis from the start, leading to no or inadequate investigation. 30 The main reason for patient delay in STSs was attributed to the lack of specific and severe symptoms. Of the total incorrect initial diagnoses of lipoma, none were misdiagnosed as LMS. Those initially diagnosed as a lipoma were finally diagnosed as a liposarcoma and synovial sarcoma. 30\n\n【35】##### Histopathology services\n\n【36】Cutaneous LMS can only be confirmed via histopathological examination, making IHC an instrumental tool in arriving at a definitive diagnosis. 31 Histopathology is an essential part of healthcare and must be accessible to ensure effective medical care. From diagnosis and staging through guiding and monitoring treatment, every step requires the support of histopathology investigations. Many regions, however, including those considered HIC, face an extreme shortage of histopathology services. 32 Rural US communities are faced with closing rural hospitals and their associated laboratory medicine and histopathology support. While a few centres in LMIC have adequately equipped laboratories, most have poor infrastructure, are inadequately equipped and experience shortages of trained personnel and pathologists. 33 34 Pathologist availability in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, is less than one per 500 000–1 million people, compared with more than 60 per million in the USA. 35 Scarcity of histopathology services in these regions results not only in frequent misdiagnoses but also long turn-around times, both of which may hinder appropriate and timely treatment of patients. Thway and Fisher found that most of the major discrepancies were due to differing opinions in categorisation, suggesting that unfamiliarity of pathologists with certain tumours is a major contribution to diagnostic discrepancies; whereas no discrepancies were reported between a lipomas and LMS. 36\n\n【37】Our patient’s mass was not biopsied at initial or subsequent presentation, but ultimately addressed when the mass began causing symptoms secondary to mass-effect and severely compromising her quality of life. In the medically underserved community this patient resides in, there are no STS specialists, nor are histopathological services readily available.\n\n【38】##### Radiological imaging\n\n【39】Even in LMICs, ultrasound scan is often the first modality used when imaging a soft tissue lipoma because it is inexpensive, available and relatively sensitive and specific. However, the fibrous capsule in superficial lipomas cannot be appreciated on ultrasound of intramuscular lipomas because the capsule cannot be distinguished from the muscle that envelops it. 37 Studies have shown that access to radiology services are disproportionally lower in rural and small hospitals in the USA. One contributing factor is related to difficulty in recruiting and retaining radiologists. The lack of rural radiologists can lead to an inability to meet the service demands when compared with non-rural healthcare centres. 38 39 To address this issue, significant effort is being placed on developing teleradiology services in rural areas. Interestingly, the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed institutions to explore teleradiology, evaluate the technological limitations, and address regulatory concerns that appear to be the main barriers to using technology more widely in rural communities. 40\n\n【40】The patient resides in a rural, medically underserved community, where radiology services are limited due to the overall patient burden on the healthcare system. The patient reported that scheduling her radiology appointments and the limited technical skill of radiology technicians in obtaining adequate imaging served as additional barriers to her diagnostic workup and ultimately delay in her care. These additional barriers to care exacerbate the social determinants of health that already had complicated her access to healthcare.\n\n【41】##### Access to specialist care\n\n【42】Just as access to radiology and pathology healthcare providers creates challenges for rural patients, access to specialised oncology care is also an issue. Approximately 20% of the US population resides in rural areas, but only 3% of oncologists practice in these areas, and over 70% of USA counties do not have oncologists. 41 Rural patients with cancer tend to be diagnosed later and have higher mortality. 42 In 2019, the American Society of Clinical Oncology found that rural patients are less likely to receive stand-of-care treatment, follow-up or supportive services than urban patients. 43 This disparity can further compound the treatment of rare cancers such as STSs.\n\n【43】There is one comprehensive cancer centre with a multidisciplinary sarcoma team to serve five states in the Pacific Northwest. While this centre is only 150 miles from our patient’s location, poverty, lack of transportation, poor health literacy and difficulty navigating urban areas precluded her from readily taking advantage of the expertise at this centre.\n\n【44】##### Interaction between STS specialist centres and rural healthcare providers\n\n【45】There have been several strategies purposed to address the challenges of rural cancer care. Rural oncology clinics can partner with larger urban cancer centres to provide access to oncologists and allow patients to receive treatments, such as chemotherapy, closer to home. 44 Again, telehealth options for conferencing with cancer specialists or having virtual tumour boards may allow rural oncology clinics to provide an elevated level of care. 45–47 These solutions often require complex coordination, training, access to broadband internet and differing state regulations. Finally, while reimbursement for telemedicine services is possible through Medicare and Medicaid, the payments may be limited and it may be unclear as to how to divide the payments to collaborating institutions. 48\n\n【46】#### Health literacy and agency for patients living in rural areas\n\n【47】This case report focuses on an LMS clinically misdiagnosed as a lipoma. While LMSs are rare malignant sarcomas, the reasons for a delay in diagnosis are regrettable. The barriers of rural medicine and access to care for patients with LMI, T2DM, and obesity are crucial global concerns. The emotional and stressful toll of the patient not being believed that something was seriously wrong independently worsened the quality of her life. This case clearly demonstrates the need for accountability to standardised protocols and a call to action for all members of the healthcare team as bestowers of quality care for all.\n\n【48】Health literacy is seen as the cognitive and social skills that motivate and enable individuals to gain access to healthcare and allow them to understand and use information to maintain good health. 49 If the patient had a high level of health literacy and was engaged in patient-centred care regarding her T2DM practices, the attending physician would have ascertained that the patient rotated injection sites, rested the affected site and performed the injection technique accurately. 50\n\n【49】Several studies have found that rural populations have a lower health literacy than urban populations. 51 However, there is a debate as to whether lower health literacy is related to living in a rural location or related to other factors. For example, when known confounders were controlled for, some studies no longer found a difference in health literacy between urban and rural individuals. 52 Factors that can negatively impact an individual’s health literacy include living in poverty, lower level of education, race/ethnicity, age and disability. 53\n\n【50】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【51】Before I was diagnosed with cancer, my local doctors were not quite sure what was wrong. The tumour on my arm kept growing for 3 years and my doctors kept telling me it was a fatty tumour. Finally, the nurse who draws my blood said I needed to see a specialist because the tumour was becoming large and hard. She told another co-worker at that time and I got a call the same day referring me to Seattle to see a cancer specialist but it is very hard for me to travel there. In order to travel the 3 hours to Seattle, I need to take time off work, save money for gas, and schedule a ride with my sister and brother-in-law. Once I was seen by the cancer specialist, I felt like I was treated very well. They gave me many tests and a treatment plan. My treatment took place at my local cancer centre, so I did not need to travel to Seattle. The cancer teams in Yakima and Seattle worked really well together. I received radiation first to try to shrink the tumour before surgery. While receiving radiation, my tumour filled with fluid and it burst. The cancer doctor in Yakima quickly communicated with my doctor in Seattle and they scheduled my surgery immediately.\n\n【52】The hardest part of this whole process has been a lack of follow through with insurance, imaging departments, other medical professionals, office workers, and schedulers. More than once, I would have an MRI, ordered by my cancer doctor, only to find out it was incorrect or incomplete. I would then have to have another MRI to make up for the incorrect one. Each time, I would have to wait for results, take time off from work, wait for an open appointment, and pay out-of-pocket for the co-payments. In terms of scheduling, often weeks would go by without an appointment or I would be scheduled with another doctor who did not know anything about me. Sometimes it felt like the office helpers had an attitude and did not want to work with other schedulers or offices. I think everyone needs to remember that patients trust receptionists and other healthcare members and everyone should work together.\n\n【53】My advice to doctors and medical students is: know who your helpers are. Know who works for you and know what they do and do not do for your patients. Those that are working with you need to follow through otherwise your patients will suffer. Also, it is really hard to keep switching primary care doctors. I felt like I fell through the cracks, so please know your workers and trust that they will follow through for your patients when you leave. The whole team needs to work together, like the body, if one part is not working, the whole thing will not work right. People who are in charge of medications, nurses who take blood pressure, and people who clean the exam rooms are all equally important and their role should be recognised. If I can inspire somebody else about the importance of continuity of care, then I will be happy.\n\n【54】### Learning points\n\n【55】   In differentiating a lipoma versus leiomyosarcoma using standardised approaches, imaging, pathological analysis and subsequent immunohistochemistry proved to be critical in the correct diagnosis for this patient.\n\n【56】   While biopsies carry risk, there are specific markers, including CD34, that quickly discern lipomas from a rarer soft tissue sarcoma.\n\n【57】   This case report illustrates how a person with a low or moderate income, type 2 diabetes mellitus, low health literacy, obesity and reduced access to quality healthcare agency may unnecessarily increase a patient’s morbidity and mortality.\n\n【58】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【59】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【60】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thank you, Dr. Michele McCarroll, for your invaluable contribution to this team in the process of compassionately capturing this patient’s story.

Of these, only 5% have popliteal artery injury. 1 Injury to the popliteal artery can be a limb-threatening condition because of poor collateral circulation. 2 However, the incidence of popliteal artery injury in a knee dislocation case is around 1.6%–30%. 3\n\n【5】A teenage boy presented to our emergency department with a history of injury to his right knee 12 hours earlier, following a road traffic accident. Initially, he was treated in a local hospital with an above-knee slab and referred to our centre for further management. On examination, the right knee was in 45° flexion with the posterior sag of the tibia. There was no external wound. There was swelling and tenderness around the knee joint with reduced passive range of movement. Distally, the affected leg, ankle and foot were cold compared with the other side. The anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery were not palpable. There was delayed capillary refilling time as noticed with a pinprick, reduced sensation in the L5 and S1 dermatome region, and a foot drop. The patient was immediately sent for an X-ray and colour Doppler of the affected limb. Radiographs showed a Salter-Harris (SH) type II physeal separation of the proximal tibia with posterior dislocation of the tibial metaphysis . A Doppler showed a void in flow at the distal superficial femoral artery. An urgent CT angiography of the right lower limb was done as vascular surgeons were consulted. CT angiography confirmed a popliteal thrombosis . The patient was taken to theatre and under spinal anaesthesia, physeal separation reduced under fluoroscopy and pinned with smooth cross Kirschner wires . A knee spanning external fixator was reinforced to provide stability. The vascular surgeons retrieved a thrombus of size 1 cm from the distal femoral artery. Postoperatively, the patient was started on injection heparin and gradually shifted to oral anticoagulants, and the patient was discharged home after 10 days . The fixator was removed in 6 weeks, and range of movement exercises started. At 6-month follow-up, the limb had survived, but the foot drop persisted.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【9】X-ray picture showing type II physeal injury with posterior subluxation of tibia (A).

The limb is surviving at 3-week follow-up (B).\n\n【14】Physeal injuries (PIs) are rare in the proximal tibia accounting for only 1% of all PIs. 1 The mechanism is usually a hyperextension injury around the knee joint with or without valgus force, which causes a posterior displacement of the tibial metaphysis with physeal separation. 4 SH type II is the most common type of hyperextension injury, as was our case. 5 Seven to ten per cent of these PIs are associated with a vascular compromise. 6 The vascular insufficiency could arise due to either direct pressure on the vessel due to displaced fracture fragment, tight compartment (compartment syndrome), an associated arterial injury or a developing thrombosis. Yadav et al described a case of proximal tibial PI where the vascularity returned after closed reduction and pinning. 7 Clement and Goswami described a case of proximal tibial type II PI, where they had a vascular compromise due to compartment syndrome and required four-compartment fasciotomies in addition to reduction and pinning. 8 Guled et al reported a case of proximal tibial and fibular PI causing vascular injury, compartment syndrome and associated peroneal nerve injury. 9 The posterior tibial trunk was transacted, which was repaired after relapse of compartment syndrome. McGuigan et al and Shinomiya et al reported a slowly progressive popliteal artery thrombosis due to proximal tibial PI. We also had a thrombus in our case, which was retrieved. 6 10 Shelton and Canale, Bertin and Goble, and Wozasek et al have the most extensive series of proximal tibia PI where they have noted some patients develop vascular compromise or compartment syndrome, unfortunately leading up to amputation in few. 11–13 These are always surgical emergencies that need immediate closed reduction and pinning if unstable. The open reduction should contemplate removing the interposed tissue if there is a persistent displacement >2 mm. SH type III and IV injuries may also require an open reduction. 14 CT angiography is the best modality of investigation to detect any vascular damage though an ultrasonographic colour Doppler can be helpful. Ligamentous injuries around the knees and traction injuries to the peroneal nerves are also found in these patients. 7 Guled et al could salvage the limb, but foot drop persisted as in our case. 9 Finally, extended follow-up may be required as PI can cause limb length discrepancy or angular deformities in 25% of cases, necessitating a follow-up to skeletal maturity. 15 16\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】   Physeal injury of the proximal tibia associated with vascular injury is a rare condition.\n\n【17】   Careful local neurological and vascular examination should be carried out during evaluation.\n\n【18】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【19】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【20】Parental/guardian consent obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Physical examination showed a body temperature of 39.1°C, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/65 mm Hg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Laboratory data exhibited the following: aspartate aminotransferase, 86 U/L (reference range: 13–30 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 35 U/L (reference range: 10–42 U/L); C reactive protein, 8.03 mg/dL (reference range: 0.00–0.14 mg/dL); WBC, 3800/µL (neutrophils, 96.0%; lymphocytes, 2.5%; reference range: 4000–9000/µL); platelets, 42 000/µL (reference range: 1 58 000–3 48 000/µL); and myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; 1.1 IU/L (reference range <3.5 IU/L).

While the accompanying symptoms other than fever and chills may be unremarkable, they are often fatal. 3 As seen in this case, an infiltrative erythema with a 5–15 mm long black eschar at the site of the infected chigger bite can be often found on physical examination. Approximately 80% of patients have an eschar, which is of high diagnostic value, but patients themselves do not often notice the presence of the eschar, which may be found in obscure sites such as the pubis, axilla or lower legs; therefore, careful physical examination is necessary. 4 For a definitive diagnosis, PCR of a serum or eschar sample is useful. If appropriate treatment, that is, tetracyclines or macrolides, 5 is not administered early, the incidence of severe complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation generally becomes high, 4 although the outcome in immunocompromised patients such as those on dialysis and on immunosuppressants is not well understood. In conclusion, when fever develops after farming or gardening in late autumn in Orientia tsutsugamushi \\-rich regions, careful examination for a possible eschar is of significance for early diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【10】### Learning points\n\n【11】   Scrub typhus is transmitted by the bite of a tick larva, called chigger, and after an incubation period of 7–10 days, symptoms such as headache, myalgia and rash are observed besides fever and chills.

In this case report, we diagnosed type A dissection based on the presence of an ascending aortic intimal flap and aortic valvular regurgitation noted by sonographic investigation that was missed with CTA. The bedside sonographic assessment predicated the decision for operative intervention.\n\n【7】### Supplemental material\n\n【8】\\[bcr-2022-253577supp001.pdf\\]\n\n【9】A patient with known connective tissue disorder and prior type B aortic dissection presented to the emergency department following cardiac arrest after three prehospital defibrillations with return of spontaneous circulation.

As the current hospital did not have invasive cardiothoracic surgery capability but could medically manage type B dissections, the inconsistency of CTA results to the clinical picture presented a challenging dilemma. Point-of-care echocardiography was immediately performed by the emergency medicine team, demonstrating aortic regurgitation and an extension of a flap towards the aortic valve cusp in the area of an aneurysmal thoracic aortic root ( video 1 ). The case was presented to the receiving invasive cardiothoracic surgical consultant with communication of both sonographic and CTA imaging. The radiology attending of record performed a review of the imaging and did not feel their report showed a type A component. In consideration of the point-of-care ultrasound findings, the patient was transferred for emergent operative intervention and noted to have type A dissection with extension and subsequent aortic valve cusp rupture. The patient survived to discharge.\n\n【16】Video 1 Transthoracic echocardiography shows extension of an intimal flap with aortic regurgitation\n\n【17】The identification of direct sonographic signs, such as the presence of intimal flap or intramural haematoma with thickening of aortic walls greater than 5 mm, or indirect signs including ascending aorta enlargement 4 cm or greater, pericardial tamponade or effusion, or aortic valve regurgitation, can augment clinical decision making. 5 As this case report proves, situations where the CTA misses the type A component of an aortic dissection are notable. Although ECG-gating, a recent CTA innovation, improves image quality by reducing pulsatile motion during the cardiac cycle, 6 its similar diagnostic performance (ie, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) to non-ECG-gating CTA for especially for ascending aortic dissection. 7 Therefore, this creates a novel situation where bedside ultrasound may be the only diagnostic tool that saves a patient’s life. As emergency physicians further mature the application of bedside ultrasound as part of their practice, we implore cardiothoracic surgical consultants to use bedside sonographic findings when considering cases for transfer or intervention.\n\n【18】### Learning points\n\n【19】   In the Stanford classification of aortic dissection, type A involves a tear in the ascending aorta that extends from the heart and can be immediately life-threatening, while the more chronic type B occurs in the descending aorta beyond the arch and farther away from the heart 通用删除1(英):<u>( online supplemental figure )</u>.\n\n【20】   The gold standard for type A aortic dissection is CT angiography but is not always accurate.\n\n【21】   Direct sonographic sign of type A aortic dissection is the presence of intimal flap or intramural hematoma while indirect sonographic signs of type A aortic dissection are aorta enlargement, pericardial effusion or tamponade and aortic valve regurgitation.\n\n【22】   Review bedside ultrasound images and clips as part of the whole clinical picture in less straight forward cases.\n\n【23】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【24】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【25】Not applicable.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Kiran Prabhu, a high school student from Canada, for creating the aortic dissection classification figure.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

MRKH syndrome is associated with urinary tract, skeletal and auditory abnormalities. 1\n\n【11】In MRKH syndrome, there is no normal endometrium development in the rudimentary uterus, and complications such as uterine fibroids and adenomyosis are rare. 2 Therefore, when uterine fibroids or adenomyosis is suspected in the rudimentary uterus, it is essential to differentiate these from a solid ovarian tumour. 3–8\n\n【12】Here, we present the case of a patient with known MRKH syndrome who was incidentally found to have elevated tumour marker levels and asymptomatic bilateral pelvic solid tumours noted on transabdominal ultrasound. Laparoscopic surgery led to a definitive diagnosis of uterine adenomyoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of MRKH syndrome complicated with uterine adenomyoma.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A single woman in her 40s initially presented to our hospital with primary amenorrhoea at the age of 25 years and was diagnosed with MRKH syndrome. She had a complete vaginal defect but did not wish to undergo vaginoplasty. Urinary tract and ovarian functions were normal, and she was under observation without periodic visits.\n\n【15】Recently, during a general physical examination, two solid pelvic masses were noted on transabdominal ultrasound examination. She was referred to our hospital for further examination. Blood test results showed elevated tumour marker levels (CA19-9, 113.6 U/mL; CA125, 88.3 U/mL). Although an increase in the CA19-9 level was observed, she had previously undergone colonoscopy at the health examination centre when she had a general physical examination, and there were no abnormal findings. Therefore, we did not conduct another colonoscopy at our facility. MRI revealed two substantial tumours of different sizes (3 cm and 4 cm on the left and right sides, respectively) in the bilateral adnexal regions . The presence of normal ovaries on both sides and a rudimentary uterus in the pelvic cavity led to a preoperative diagnosis of bilateral ovarian solid tumours or uterine fibroids. Laparoscopic surgery was performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【16】<img/>\n\n【17】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【19】(A) MRI T2 sagittal view.

Corpus uteri were absent, and rudimentary uterine horns were observed, fused medially and extending laterally along the pelvic wall. The round ligament was attached to the rudimentary uterine horn. The bilateral adnexa were unremarkable and attached to the rudimentary uterine horns on each side. A solid tumour was observed on both sides, between the round ligament and fallopian tube, covered by the peritoneum .

The patient was discharged from the hospital after 3 days without any complications. She was able to resume daily activities within a few days after discharge. At the 2-week postoperative follow-up examination, she had no complications and was in a good condition. She returned to work at 2 weeks postoperatively and was followed up at 1, 6 and 12 months postoperatively, with no recurrence of adenomyoma observed on ultrasound. At the patient’s request, the follow-up was completed at 12 months.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】The uterus in patients with MRKH syndrome is hypoplastic, and a functional endometrium is rarely seen. 2 9 Generally, invasion of the endometrial tissue into the myometrium results in the development of uterine adenomyosis. 2 However, the endometrium is often absent in patients with MRKH syndrome. Alternatively, the pathogenesis of adenomyosis in MRKH syndrome may be attributed to ectopic endometrial growth in the myometrium of the uterus. 10 Adenomyotic lesions in the uterus that develop in a focal and localised manner are defined as adenomyomas. 11 In this case, the origin of the lesion could not be identified, as the rudimentary uterus had not been removed. However, as the patient had no menstruation-related symptoms, we assumed that the focal growth of the adenomyoma was caused by the ectopic endometrial tissue that had developed in the rudimentary uterus, as hypothesised above.\n\n【35】The diagnosis of pelvic tumours associated with MRKH syndrome is often difficult in the absence of a normal uterine corpus. 3–8 12 13 Non-invasive imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, CT and MRI, are the first choices for the diagnosis of pelvic tumours. 12–14 However, in cases of uterine fibroids arising in a rudimentary uterus, the tumour may be located very close to the adnexa, often making evaluation based on imaging findings alone difficult and necessitating surgical intervention. Laparoscopic observation is an effective means of diagnosis. 4 7 12 In our case, it was challenging to differentiate between uterine myoma and ovarian tumours using imaging alone, because the tumours were accompanied with elevated tumour marker levels and were located close to the bilateral adnexa. Direct observation of the pelvic cavity using laparoscopy enabled us to confirm that the tumours originated from the rudimentary uterus and not from the ovaries, thus resulting in appropriate treatment.\n\n【36】Regarding the treatment of myoma and adenomyosis in MRKH syndrome, previous reports have recommended surgery for symptomatic cases, including differentiation from ovarian tumours. However, currently, there is no consensus on the treatment methods. In the most cases, resection of the entire uterus in asymptomatic patients to prevent recurrence 15 16 and removal of the entire uterus in symptomatic patients are preferred. In addition to our case, only four other cases of tumour removal alone have been reported. 12 17 18 Anatomical structures may differ in women with MRKH syndrome; therefore, there is a risk of surgical complications, such as damage to the surrounding blood vessels, ureter and bladder, when removing the rudimentary uterus. We consider that tumour removal alone is sufficient, especially when there are no symptoms or suspicion of malignancy.\n\n【37】However, some cases of MRKH syndrome complicated with malignant ovarian tumours have been reported despite the condition being rare. 19–23 Their findings indicate that if prior findings of suspected malignancy are observed on imaging, total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be considered.\n\n【38】In conclusion, this is the first report of a uterine adenomyoma in a patient with MRKH syndrome. In uterine adenomyomas, similar to other pelvic tumours in MRKH syndrome, laparoscopic surgery and histopathology can facilitate a diagnosis when imaging studies alone are insufficient.\n\n【39】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【40】I already knew that I do not have a uterus and vagina but have normal ovaries due to my condition. When I was told that there were tumours in my pelvic cavity that looked like ovarian tumours, I was worried that I would lose my ovaries too. However, after surgery, I was relieved to know that the tumours originated from the uterus and not from my ovaries. In addition, I learnt that adenomyomas in MRKH syndrome are rare. Therefore, I wanted to help in making medical advancements in this field by agreeing to publish the findings of my case.\n\n【41】### Learning points\n\n【42】   This is the first reported case of uterine adenomyoma associated with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.\n\n【43】   Similar to other pelvic tumours in MRKH syndrome, uterine adenomyomas may be difficult to diagnose using imaging alone, and diagnostic laparoscopy may be useful.\n\n【44】   Direct observation of the pelvic cavity using laparoscopy could confirm that the tumours had originated from the rudimentary uterus and not from the ovaries, leading to appropriate treatment.\n\n【45】   Histopathological findings showed endometrial tissue inside the myoma nodules, indicating that the tumours were adenomyomas of the rudimentary uterus.\n\n【46】   Tumour removal alone is sufficient, especially when there are no symptoms or suspicion of malignancy.\n\n【47】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【48】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【49】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Editage for English editing.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Work-up revealed positive serology for SLE (positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) and antidouble-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies). Her complete blood count, urine analysis and urinary protein-creatinine ratio were within normal limits. She was started on hydroxychloroquine and prednisone 60 mg/day. Weeks later, she presented with worsening of her skin rash that extended to involve her whole body, tingling and numbness of her hands and feet, which was not present at the time of the initial presentation. On clinical examination, she had diffuse hair thinning and arthritis involving her wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints and knees. Her face showed diffuse erythema with nodular lesions on the cheeks and chin. Her trunk and extremities also showed diffuse erythematous nodular skin lesions , and she had diminished sensation in all extremities. Based on her serology and physical findings, she fulfilled the Systemic Lupus International Collaboration Clinics classification criteria for SLE; however, nodular skin lesions were not typical of SLE or worsened on immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, she was referred to the dermatology department for assessment. A skin biopsy was obtained, and pathology revealed diffuse infiltration of the dermis with foamy histiocytes, and Ziehl-Neelsen stain demonstrated acid-fast bacilli within the macrophages . The diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy was confirmed with a skin biopsy, and the rheumatological manifestations and positive serology were attributed to leprosy. Hydroxychloroquine was discontinued, and prednisone was tapered over a period of 6 months. Antimycobacterium therapy with rifampin, dapsone and clofazimine was given for a year. During her follow-up, she had significant improvement in her skin nodules and arthritis.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Erythematous nodular skin lesions involving the face, trunk and extremities.\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【12】Skin biopsy: (A) demonstrating diffuse infiltrate of foamy histiocytes in the dermis separated from the epidermis by a green zone (H&E stain at 100× magnification), (B) dermis showing foamy histiocytes (H&E at 400× magnification) and (C) Ziehl-Neelsen stain at 400× magnification demonstrating acid-fast bacilli within macrophages, some of which are clumped (globi) (arrow).\n\n【13】Leprosy classically presents with neurological and skin manifestations followed by musculoskeletal involvement as Charcot’s arthropathy and symmetrical polyarthritis. 1 Other reported manifestations include fever, vasculitis, epididymitis, glomerulonephritis, pericarditis and pleurisy. 2 Less common, yet clinically diverse presentations of leprosy include haemolytic anaemia, alopecia, photosensitivity, generalised lymphadenopathy, glomerulonephritis, serositis and Raynaud’s phenomenon. Leprosy also includes a wide spectrum of laboratory manifestations because of the various immunological responses; a variety of autoantibodies can be detected in leprosy patients such as ANA, anti-dsDNA, antimitochondrial antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antineutrophil cytoplasmic and antiphospholipid antibodies. It has been hypothesised that ANA presenting in leprosy patients results from weak cross-reactivity with complexed nucleic acids and nucleoproteins exposed after cell destruction in chronic inflammation. 3 Other pathogenic mechanisms include molecular mimicry, and some studies reported shared idiotypes among antibodies derived from patients with leprosy and SLE. 4\n\n【14】Previously published case reports of leprosy mimicking SLE, where the patients fulfilled classification criteria for SLE, however, worsened on immunosuppressive treatment, the diagnosis of leprosy was eventually proven through skin biopics, and patients clinically improved on the multidrug therapy for leprosy. 2 3 Conversely, there are also reports of leprosy infection triggering lupus flare, in the form of arthritis, skin rash, lupus nephritis, pulmonary haemorrhage and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. 5\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】   Chronic infections as leprosy, tuberculosis, HIV can induce positive antinuclear antibody, which is not necessarily an indication of autoimmune disease.\n\n【17】   Leprosy should be in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with rash and neurological manifestations, whether sensory or motor, especially in endemic areas or travellers from endemic countries.\n\n【18】   Delayed diagnosis of leprosy may lead to a patient suffering irreversible structural damage.\n\n【19】   Immunosuppressive therapy has a role in the management of rheumatological manifestations of leprosy, but it must be given in conjunction with the standard multidrug therapy for leprosy.\n\n【20】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【21】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【22】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

(D) Direct communication between the choroidal and vitreous cavities through a ‘sinkhole’.\n\n【13】PCC (formerly peripapillary detachment in pathological myopia or intrachoroidal cavitation) is an anatomical choroidal modification (53% unilateral) typically associated with axial myopia (−9 to −12.5 D, AL ~27 mm), although emmetropia/hyperopia accounts for ~7%. 2–4 High myopia (≤−6 D) is associated with younger PCC presentation. 3\n\n【14】The classic en face appearance is a non-elevated yellow-orange peripapillary area most often inferior to a tilted ONH. 2 3 PCC may affect up to 50% of high myopia and 10% of low myopia. 3 5 6 OCT has been instrumental in delineating the anatomical layer responsible for the en face appearance. 3 A hyporeflective appearance is seen at the level of the choroid, with posterior scleral deformation and/or a full-thickness neurosensory retina/retinal pigment epithelium defect contiguous between the choroidal and vitreous cavities (16%–25%). 2 3 Multiple choroidal schises can be noticed alongside cavitations potentially representing a precursor lesion. 5 Early hypofluorescence on fluorescein angiography confirms absence of choroidal tissue/circulation unless choroidal neovascularisation is present where OCT angiography may help delineate the neovascular complex. 5 7 Other pathological myopia features may be present, including tilted ONH (69%), peripapillary atrophy (98%), posterior staphylomata (40%), myopic maculopathy (14%–37%), peripheral retinal degenerations/breaks, PVD and glaucoma (38%–70%). 3 5\n\n【15】Clinically, these cases may be referred for concern of amelanotic choroidal nevus/melanoma; however, multimodal imaging helps to clarify their ‘cystic’ rather than solid nature. Although thought to be acquired rather than congenital lesions, PCC development is gradual (no change over 6-year follow-up). 8\n\n【16】The pathogenesis may be related to myopia (ie, increased AL influences angle of optic nerve entry) and ageing (few PCC cases described <30 years of age). 3 Loss of choroidal adhesion (ie, tissues of Jacoby/Elschnig) to underlying sclera/ONH may be exacerbated by tractional/liquefactive effects of vitreous humour and increased susceptibility to physiological IOP leading to PCC. 2 3 Other factors include dural traction causing peripapillary suprachoroidal detachment in areas of staphyloma with tilted ONH which is promoted by adduction (ie, reading). 9\n\n【17】Similarities to coloboma-adjacent choroidal changes have been suggested with potential genetic links (eg, ABCB6 , PAX2 , cadherin family), although myopia-associated genes are equally implicated (eg, ABCC6 , PLOD1 , collagen family). 10\n\n【18】Although PCC may cause concern to the referring clinician, it is a benign lesion requiring no treatment; however, associated features of myopia warrant careful assessment±treatment.\n\n【19】### Learning points\n\n【20】   Peripapillary choroidal cavitation (PCC) is prevalent in those with high myopia (up to 50% in some series).\n\n【21】   Novel studies show PCC development is influenced by tractional (optic nerve sheath, dura mater, vitreous) forces on predisposed areas (eg, thinned choroid/sclera at borders of peripapillary staphylomata, tilted optic nerve head, gamma-peripapillary atrophy).\n\n【22】   It is a benign lesion, but may be associated with choroidal neovascularisation or treatable features of pathological myopia.\n\n【23】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【24】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【25】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

M. hominis lacks a cell wall and can be difficult to identify with standard culture methods posing difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. We describe a case of M. hominis pneumonia in an immunocompetent man in his early 40s without any risk factors presenting with a cavitary lesion who developed empyema and necrotising pneumonia requiring surgical debridement. Identification of M. hominis and subsequent modification of antibiotic therapy led to favourable outcome. M. hominis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with treatment resistant pneumonia especially in patients with trauma, intracranial injury, lung transplant or if immunocompromised. While M.

Among cited infections of the respiratory tract, many of the reports are in patients with manipulation of the urogenital tract, concurrent trauma, intracranial injury, transplant patients or otherwise immunocompromised patients. 1–6 Outside of the respiratory tract, M. hominis has been implicated in cases of mediastinitis, meningitis, joint infection and endocarditis. 7–11\n\n【10】M. hominis is a common coloniser of the urogenital tract where it was originally discovered along with other genital mycoplasmas such as Ureaplasma urealyticum . 12 M. hominis can be found in the urogenital tract of up to 53% of sexually active asymptomatic women, with slightly less incidence in men. 13 While these organisms are thought to be commensal colonisers, they have been implicated in infections of the urogenital tract, pregnancy complications, neonatal infections and infertility. 14–17\n\n【11】M. hominis may often go under recognised as a cause of infection due to its fastidious growth requirements, difficulty growing and being recognised using standard blood culture methods, or the difficulty to see the colonies it forms on standard cell culture. 2 3 12 18 While culture remains the gold standard for identification and is important for susceptibility testing, PCR methods have also been used to identify cases.\n\n【12】As mycoplasma species do not have a cell wall, they are inherently resistant to antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis such as beta-lactams, cephalosporins and glycopeptides. M. hominis also demonstrates resistance to commonly used macrolides such as erythromycin but is generally susceptible to fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines, although some resistance to different agents has been noted. 19–21\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A man in his early 40s presented with 5 days of worsening fever, body aches, sore throat, shortness of breath and productive cough with accompanying pleuritic pain. He was hypotensive and tachycardic. He had increased work of breathing with diminished lung sounds in the right lung field. He had leucocytosis of 13.6/mm <sup>3 </sup> (normal range 4–11/mm <sup>3 </sup> ) and neutrophil count of 12.7/mm <sup>3 </sup> , and procalcitonin was elevated to 9.46 ng/mL (normal range <0.05 ng/mL). Chest radiograph (CXR) and CT imaging of the chest revealed a mass-like 5.2 cm cavitary lesion in right upper lobe, left lower lobe consolidation and small left pleural effusion . SARs CoV-2 testing was negative via nasopharyngeal PCR swab, and there were no sick contacts. He had a history of well-controlled asthma on combination long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch for weight loss 14 years prior, and was on emtricitabine-tenofovir for pre-exposure prophylaxis.\n\n【15】<img/>\n\n【16】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【18】(A and B) The chest radiograph at time of initial presentation (A) demonstrating the cavitary mass in the right upper lobe measuring about 5.2 cm in diameter, left lower lobe consolidation and small left pleural effusion.

Official read also commented on mass-like nature of the lesion and elevated concern for likely atypical infectious or inflammatory aetiology.\n\n【19】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【20】Initial infectious work up included strep swab and throat culture, HIV testing, blood cultures, Legionella urine antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae urine antigen which were all negative. Infectious disease was consulted and recommended further investigation with cryptococcus blood antigen, histoplasma urine antigen, sputum culture and PCR testing for respiratory viruses and bacteria, 通用删除7(英):<u>(1,3)</u>-β-D-Glucan and Aspergillus Galactomannan antigen which were all subsequently negative. Over the subsequent days, the patient had clinical improvement with decreased oxygen needs, symptomatic improvement and decreased procalcitonin to 2.18 ng/mL. While bronchoscopy was considered, this was not pursued at initial presentation due to his improving clinical course. Ammonia level, zinc or selenium were not checked throughout the evaluation.\n\n【21】Nine days following his initial presentation, he was found to be hypotensive with diminished left lung sounds despite lack of symptoms while receiving his daily antibiotic infusion at an outpatient infusion centre. On evaluation in the emergency department with this second presentation, there was a new leucocytosis of 19.5/mm <sup>3 </sup> , and CXR was notable for large left hydropneumothorax with signs of tension .\n\n【22】<img/>\n\n【23】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【25】(A–D) Chest radiograph at time of readmission (A and B) demonstrates large left hydropneumothorax with evidence of tension demonstrated by midline shift and also persistence of right upper lobe cavitary lesion. CT of the chest obtained at the time (C and D) of readmission demonstrating increase in cavitary lesion size, multifocal opacities, subcutaneous emphysema, chest tube and mediastinal gas at various levels.\n\n【26】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【27】Two cultures from pleural fluid were collected at the time of his second presentation. One noted growth of M. hominis in the thioglycolate broth only and was reported out by the lab 5 days after chest tube placement. Blood cultures remained negative. Fungal cultures, silver stain and cytology performed on pleural fluid also remained negative. Sputum cultures with acid-fast bacilli with Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA direct probe PCR were all negative. Serum IgG, IgA and IgM were all within normal limits.\n\n【28】Treatment\n---------\n\n【29】He was initially treated empirically with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. Following improvement during initial presentation, antibiotics were transitioned to intravenous ceftriaxone and oral metronidazole with a plan to complete 4 weeks of this therapy outpatient and repeat imaging towards the end of this course. At initial discharge, he was noted to have cavitary lesions without empyema and did not have any indication for surgical treatment.\n\n【30】Following chest tube placement at second presentation, 2 L of purulent material were drained. CT imaging at this time again demonstrated mass-like cavitary lesion in right lung in addition to an interval increase is opacities of the left upper and lower lobe, significant bilateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema likely secondary to chest tube placement and mediastinal gas on the right. Antibiotic therapy was broadened to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at this point. Following clinical improvement, he was transitioned to vancomycin and cefepime and later restarted on intravenous ceftriaxone and oral metronidazole. Identification of M. hominis from pleural fluid prompted addition of oral doxycycline 100 mg two times per day to the antibiotic regimen.\n\n【31】Repeat CT imaging 1 week into this hospitalisation showed some improvements in pneumomediastinum, noted stable cavitary areas and raised new concerns for bronchopleural fistula due to subcutaneous gas with possible signs of infection. Thoracic surgery was consulted with consideration of video-assisted thoracoscopic decortication.\n\n【32】Initial findings in the operating room included a large chest wall abscess under serratus anterior muscle, necrosis of serratus and intercostal muscles as well as the overlying fascia, loculated pleural effusions, dense adhesions with thick pleural rind and other purulent material. This was debrided and irrigated extensively before the wound was packed. No clear sign of bronchopulmonary fistula was noted during initial decortication. The patient would require two more trips to the operating room for irrigation, debridement, and finally wound vac placement.\n\n【33】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【34】Due to concern for possible tetracycline resistance and with M. hominis susceptibility testing still pending at an outside lab, the patient was discharged on a 6-week course of oral levofloxacin to cover M. hominis and oral metronidazole for empiric anaerobic coverage. Susceptibility testing at an outside laboratory did demonstrate susceptibility to clindamycin, tetracycline and levofloxacin. Follow-up imaging demonstrated resolution of the hydropneumothorax.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】We have described a case of M. hominis pneumonia presenting with a cavitary lesion and progressing to empyema and necrotising pneumonia in an immunocompetent adult without clear risk factors. While M. hominis has been noted to cause severe disease with progression to necrotising pneumonia, it has not been associated with cavitary lesions previously. Our case also reinforces challenges noted in similar cases in that empiric antibiotics commonly used to treat pneumonia are ineffective against M. hominis , identification can be difficult as it is a fastidious and slow-growing organism, and recovery can depend on transition to appropriate antibiotic therapy. We feel that the unique aspects of this case add to previously reported cases of M. hominis pneumonia in immunocompetent patients.\n\n【37】Identification of the organism is a crucial step in the clinical course of patients with M. hominis so that appropriate modifications to therapy can be made. M. hominis can be lysed or killed by saline, the wooden shaft of collection swabs or sodium polyanethol sulfonate found in blood culture bottles. 2 12 M. hominis has also been noted to not cause visible change in blood culture bottles or turbidity due to its small size 12 22 and may require subculture for detection as was done in two of the cases reviewed. 2 6 The colonies that grow on agar are also small with a classically described ‘fried-egg’ appearance due to the clear pinpoint centre and translucent surrounding which can be difficult to identify with the naked eye. 2 23 Despite this, culture remains the gold standard for identification of M. hominis as it can help guide therapy with susceptibilities, with increasing resistance to antibiotics typically used to treat. Similar to other cases, M. hominis was not identified in our case until 14 days after his initial presentation and 5 days after chest tube placement and drainage of a pulmonary empyema.\n\n【38】PCR methods, usually targeting 16S rRNA, can also be used to identify M. hominis . 13 In one of the cases reviewed, eubacterial PCR was used to identify the organism, and culture was later used to yield susceptibilities. 5 Identification with PCR may be less useful to demonstrate clinically significant disease in the urogenital tract as it is a commensal organism commonly found there but could be more useful in extragenital locations.\n\n【39】The biology of M. hominis informs antibiotic treatment and its inherent resistance to numerous classes of antibiotics. As Mycoplasma species lack a cell wall, they are naturally resistant to therapies that target peptidoglycan synthesis such as cephalosporins, beta-lactams and glycopeptides as well as demonstrating resistance to other classes of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides, sulfonamides and trimethoprim. 22 Unlike M. pneumoniae , M. hominis exhibits resistance to commonly used macrolides such as azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin. 6 20 21 The most commonly recommended antibiotics for treatment of M. hominis include tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and clindamycin.\n\n【40】Early case reports have expressed concern about increasing resistance to tetracycline in association with the tetracycline-resistant element (tetM). 19 20 Resistance to tetracycline seems widely variable based on geography with some areas of the USA having tetracycline resistance as high as 50%, and there is susceptibility to doxycycline even in stains resistant to tetracycline. 12 24 Fluoroquinolones have been cited as better treatment options with lower resistance rates, except in China. Resistance to fluoroquinolones is due to changes in quinolone resistance-determining regions which are coding regions for DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV, the drug targets. 25 Two studies demonstrating the high rates of fluoroquinolone resistance in China reported 52/57 and 11/13 of M. hominis samples were resistant, with comparisons showing higher resistance to ciprofloxacin over levofloxacin. 25 26\n\n【41】In Samra et al , looking at rates of resistance in M. hominis samples in Israel found 9/110 resistant to doxycycline with higher resistance to tetracycline, while noting none of the samples had resistance to levofloxacin. 21 In Krausse et al , 290 M . hominis and Ureaplasma samples collected over a 20-year period in Germany found doxycycline to be most effective against both but noted 10% of M. hominis samples were resistant to doxycycline. Of these samples, 7.9% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and less than 2% were resistant to oxfloxacin. 27 Finally, in Morris et al , when using international set thresholds by Clinical Laboratory Science Institute, only 1/100 of collected samples from Wales demonstrated resistance to tetracycline, while 0/100 demonstrated levofloxacin resistance. 21 28 Clindamycin is also commonly used and effective, which may present great option for neonatal or perinatal infections. 19\n\n【42】Our review of previous case series and case reports of M. hominis pneumonia in immunocompetent patients yielded 14 patients spanning three decades. 1–6 22 29 30 Among the four patients who died, none of them had modification of therapy, although one patient from Garcia et al withdrew due to worsening of illness and significant comorbidity. 2 4 30 Two of the earlier cases recovered despite no change in therapy or the inadequate change to erythromycin. 6 22 Other patients were noted to have significant improvement after identification of M. hominis and transition to a fluoroquinolone and/or tetracycline antibiotic. Common associations or risk factors identified in some of these patients included two patients with pneumonia in the peripartum period 1 29 and five patients who suffered trauma or closed head injury. 3 4 6 30 Four cases also identified co-infection with another bacterial source. 1 4 22 30\n\n【43】Many of the other various extragenital infections had found a large proportion of cases involve immunocompromised patients or transplant patients emphasising lower cell-mediated immunity and hypogammaglobulinaemia. 31 M . hominis and U. urealyticum have been implicated as possible aetiology of non-hepatic hyperammonemia which should prompt antibiotic coverage of these organisms in such cases to prevent further complications. 32 Our patient did not have any immunoglobulin deficiencies identified. M. hominis can also progress to very severe illness such as other reviewed cases in which patients developed empyema requiring drainage with chest tube, but other cases did not describe the extent of surgical intervention required in this case.\n\n【44】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【45】Our patient added with his consent form, ‘Thanks so much again for all you did to help me get better!’\n\n【46】### Learning points\n\n【47】   This case demonstrates that Mycoplasma hominis can cause severe respiratory infection and cavitary lesion in an immunocompetent adult despite lack of previously identified risk factors.\n\n【48】   M. hominis should be considered on the differential of patients with treatment resistant pneumonia or other infection especially in patients with trauma, intracranial injury, lung transplant or if immunocompromised.\n\n【49】   Institutions should consider availability of PCR testing for M. hominis or broader eubacterial PCR testing to help identify offending organisms quickly.\n\n【50】   Cultures should be collected for further use in monitoring susceptibility patterns with increase in resistance to tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones.\n\n【51】   We recommend levofloxacin or other fluoroquinolone to most effectively treat, while doxycycline would be a potential alternative.\n\n【52】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【53】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【54】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank our patient for allowing us to present this case.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Following multiple investigations, this clinical presentation was proven to be dermatomyositis as a paraneoplastic phenomenon, a rare diagnosis with cervical cancer.\n\n【2】Improvement of the presenting symptoms followed commencement of radical chemoradiation to the primary tumour plus administration of high dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins.\n\n【3】As demonstrated in this case, and accompanying literature review, dermatomyositis is a rare complication of cervical cancer but should be considered as urgent treatment of the underlying malignancy is imperative. Involving members of the multidisciplinary team, including dieticians and physiotherapists, is of utmost importance to optimise the patient’s recovery from such a debilitating diagnosis.\n\n【4】   Gynecological cancer\n   Dermatology\n   Cancer intervention\n   Musculoskeletal syndromes\n   Screening (oncology)\n\n【5】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【6】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

In the majority of paraneoplastic cases, DM precedes the neoplasm. 2\n\n【12】A Scandinavian multinational study encompassing 198 cases of paraneoplastic DM 通用删除7(英):<u>(2001)</u> found only two were associated with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix. 2 A further cohort study of 1012 patients with DM, in Taiwan between 1997 and 2007, revealed only three patients with an incidence of cervical cancer. 3\n\n【13】We present, here, a rare case of DM diagnosed as a paraneoplastic phenomenon 3 weeks post-diagnosis of human papilloma virus associated SCC of the cervix.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A female in her 70s presented with postmenopausal paravaginal bleeding alongside slowly progressing weakness in her shoulders.\n\n【16】Following urgent investigation, she was diagnosed with stage IIIC SCC cervix with a 5 cm cervical tumour and 3 cm internal iliac lymph node. She was deemed performance status 1 and planned for radical chemoradiotherapy.\n\n【17】Three weeks following this diagnosis, the patient presented acutely with poor oral intake secondary to dysphagia, plus, difficulty living independently as a result of significant proximal muscle myopathy.\n\n【18】On arrival, she appeared dehydrated, her voice was hoarse and speech slowed. Examination revealed a macular rash of purple/red discolouration over the metacarpophalangeal joints, outer thighs and knees bilaterally, muscle wasting of shoulder girdles and marked proximal muscle weakness; MRC (Medical Research Council) power grade 2/5 in shoulder abduction and hip flexion bilaterally. There was no stridor or cough. Cranial nerves I–VIII and XII were grossly normal. Tone, reflexes, light touch, proprioception and pain were normal throughout. The patient was unable to stand from a chair, brush her hair nor climb the stairs without assistance.\n\n【19】Prior to this admission, the patient lived independently in a two-storey home. She required no assistance with activities of daily living, ate a normal varied diet and continued to enjoy hobbies, including riding a bicycle up to 5 km on a weekly basis.\n\n【20】Medical history included osteoporosis and hypothyroidism requiring Alendronic Acid once weekly, Calcichew D3 supplements and Levothyroxine on a daily basis. There is no personal or family history of any further autoimmune conditions.\n\n【21】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【22】### Haematology and biochemistry\n\n【23】A routine blood panel on admission highlighted multiple raised inflammatory markers, those most notable are listed in table 1 .\n\n【24】View this table:\n\n【25】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【26】Table 1\n\n【27】Haematology and biochemistry results\n\n【28】Serum vitamin D, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, free T4, B12 and folate were replete.\n\n【29】Serum immunology results are shown in table 2 .\n\n【30】View this table:\n\n【31】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【32】Table 2\n\n【33】Serum immunology results\n\n【34】### Imaging\n\n【35】MRI of thighs bilaterally: diffuse heterogeneous, predominantly high T2 signal throughout the pelvic girdle and thigh muscles associated with marked subcutaneous fat stranding and oedema.

No dysplasia or malignancy seen.

Throat clearing on both consistencies—straight away with each water sip, throat clearing started after eighth spoon of yoghurt and then periodically during rest of trial increasing towards the end. Clear voice post throat clears.\n\n【45】Hypothesis is that throat clearing is protective, and patient is sensate to possible penetration±aspiration.\n\n【46】### Lung function assessment\n\n【47】A baseline lung function assessment was performed shortly after admission. There were no concerns regarding breathing at this point but given the possibility of deterioration, secondary to DM, it was deemed important to establish the patient’s baseline for comparison.\n\n【48】Result: Mild reduction in vital capacity (VC Max). Spirometry suggests no significant airflow limitation.\n\n【49】Treatment\n---------\n\n【50】The patient commenced oncological treatment involving 28 fractions of radiotherapy (50.4 Gy to the pelvis and 56 Gy to a presacral node) and five cycles of once weekly Carboplatin. Subsequent brachytherapy was planned but abandoned due to difficult access to the uterus and so phase 2 external beam radiotherapy was given instead.\n\n【51】On advice of rheumatology, the patient received 5 days of intravenous immunoglobins and a 4-week course of prednisolone 40 mg once daily. Methotrexate was also considered but given the patient was receiving platinum-based chemotherapy it was deemed of more risk than benefit to give two agents with immunosuppressive potential concurrently.\n\n【52】The patient remained inpatient for a total of 59 days. During this time, she received multiple reviews from the speech and language team who cautiously assessed swallowing capabilities and amended feeding regimens accordingly to reduce risk of an aspiration pneumonia. As swallowing remained an issue for a number of weeks, dietetic involvement became crucial. The patient’s weight decreased dramatically following diagnosis and maintaining/gaining weight was imperative while receiving chemotherapy. A nasogastric tube was inserted for a short period to assist with this.\n\n【53】Physiotherapy and occupational therapy input was invaluable; initially goals were to maintain muscle strength and avoid further muscle wasting in affected myotomes, then later build up muscle lost.\n\n【54】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【55】There was progressive improvement in symptoms throughout admission; by day 27 all cutaneous lesions, namely Gottron’s papules and Holsters sign, had resolved and the patient was again independent of personal care.\n\n【56】Dysphagia led to an extended period as an inpatient given the need for assistance with oral intake and to minimise aspiration risk. Fifty-five days post admission, she was deemed medically fit and safe for discharge to her own home.\n\n【57】On review 1 month post-discharge, the patient had good movement in her arms and, although still very fatigued, was mobilising well. She returned to her usual diet with no swallowing difficulty and no evidence of cutaneous changes were found on examination. Prednisolone was continuing to be reduced.\n\n【58】On further review 3 months post-discharge, steroids were now discontinued and symptoms continued to improve, so much so the patient was back to undertaking activities as per pre-diagnosis. Imaging with MRI and CT-PET showed a complete oncological response to treatment and so regular clinical surveillance continued via 3 monthly assessments.\n\n【59】Discussion\n----------\n\n【60】DM is a rare, acquired, autoimmune condition. It presents with symmetrical proximal muscle weakness and various dermatological lesions, including but not limited to; Gottron papules, heliotropic rash, facial erythema, Holsters sign and calcinosis cutis. These presentations are thought to be brought about by pathophysiological activation of complement factor 3 (C3) cascading the formation of a membrane attack complex which deposits on vascular walls resulting in inflammation. This causes hypoxic injury, atrophy and necrosis of muscle fibres. 4\n\n【61】A diagnosis of DM involves correlating clinical presentation with biochemical markers, muscle biopsy and electromyography (EMG). The Bohan-Peter classification of polymyositis and DM is useful in clarifying this. As per this classification, the case presented here would be a ‘definite’ DM given the patients cutaneous changes, symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, raised skeletal muscle enzymes and characteristic biopsy. An EMG was not performed as its result would not alter diagnosis nor management plan.\n\n【62】The first reported case of DM as a paraneoplastic phenomen was recognised by Stertz, who reported inflammatory myopathy in a patient with gastric adenocarcinoma. 5 Paraneoplastic DM is now better recognised, although evidence to quantify just how many DM cases are associated with malignancy is variable; anything between 6% and 60%. 6\n\n【63】There is strong evidence, however, that paraneoplastic DM as a complication of cervical SCC is rare. A literature search for such cases yielded just four reports, outlined in table 3 . Hence, the importance of highlighting the case discussed her include: first, the rarity of paraneoplastic DM in cervical SCC, but also a diagnosis of cancer preceding the development of DM.\n\n【64】View this table:\n\n【65】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【66】Table 3\n\n【67】Literature review summary; reported cases of dermatomyositis associated with cervical cancer\n\n【68】A study of 65 patients with paraneoplastic DM in China, 2020, found only 32% of cancers were diagnosed before the occurrence of DM: 14% were within the most recent 1 year, 17% were within 3 years and 23% within 5 years. 6 Another study, published 2001, found only 83 of 198 cases were diagnosed with cancer prior to their diagnosis of DM. 2 This is supported by literature included in table 3 , where no patients were aware they had an active cancer when presenting with proximal muscle weakness and cutaneous changes.\n\n【69】Multiple studies highlight the challenge in identifying adult patients with DM at high risk for cancer and how best to investigate such correlation. 7 8 In March 2022, the British Society for Rheumatology produced a useful guideline highlighting that evidence pertaining to effective cancer screening all idiopathic inflammatory myopathies is limited, but suggests CT scanning of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis for at-risk patients is of utility. 9 It defines at-risk patients as those who are; men, older age, of rapid disease onset, experience dysphagia, display cutaneous necrosis or are resistant to immunosuppressive therapy. It also highlights patients with positive anti-transcriptional intermediary factor-1-γ (anti-TIF1-γ) and/or anti-nuclear matrix protein 2 (anti-NXP2) autoantibodies at-risk.\n\n【70】Autoantigen TIF1-γ participates in several biological processes involved in transcriptional regulation, cellular proliferation and apoptosis and in cancer, can act either as a tumour suppressor or promoter, depending on the cellular context and cancer stage. 8 10 A study by De Vooght et al outlines the hypothesis that mutations or loss-of-heterozygosity in TIF1-γ alleles in malignant tissue drive DM by expression of tumour-specific neo-antigens stimulating autoantibody production to antigens in muscle and skin, hence anti-TIF1-γ autoantibodies should be recognised as a sign of potential underlying tumour autoantigen process. 8\n\n【71】This is supported by Best et al , whose systematic review and meta-analysis of all relevant published studies confirmed presence of anti-TIF1-γ in adult patients with DM had a 9.37 fold higher risk of cancer than those without. 7\n\n【72】In the case discussed here, anti-TIF1-γ antibody presence was not tested given the already known cervical SCC and little diagnostic benefit, however, anti-NXP2 antibodies were tested and found to be positive.\n\n【73】The highest prevalence of anti-NXP2 positive patients with DM with a malignancy reported in a cohort to date is 50%, however, this study conducted in 2012 involved just eight patients. 11 Further studies do not draw adequate statistical significance to infer malignancy is more likely in anti-NXP2 positive DM. 12 Nevertheless, there is still relevance in this test, given the evidence that anti-NXP2 presence is associated with clinical characteristics that reflect more severe muscle disease activity. Two studies, one in America 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u> and another in China 通用删除7(英):<u>(2021)</u>, both conclude adult patients with DM with anti-NXP2 antibodies were more prone to dysphagia, have significantly more severe muscle weakness or higher levels of muscle injury markers and were less likely to present with interstitial lung disease than those without anti-NXP2 antibodies. 12 Interestingly, the case discussed here concurs with these findings.\n\n【74】Fortunately, patients with cervical SCC associated DM do appear to experience improvement—if not resolution—of their symptoms, as outlined in this case and those in table 3 . The length of time for resolution of muscle weakness varies, possibly in relation to patient age or other factors not compared here, but consistently coincides with treatment of the underlying malignancy. There are multiple discrepancies between the rheumatological treatments administered in the four cases in table 3 and this case, which does not suggest there is no role for these medications but highlights the importance of providing oncological treatments in paraneoplastic DM associated with cervical SCC.\n\n【75】The possibility of drug-related DM in patients with a malignancy is important to consider prior to completing this discussion. There are a number of drugs well-recognised in inducing inflammatory myopathies, HMG CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase) inhibitors, for example, however, those with an underlying malignancy that go on to develop drug-related DM have most commonly been receiving hydroxyurea for chronic myelogenous leukaemia. 13 14 This may change with increased use of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies for malignancies; a review in 2020 highlighted seven published cases of immunotherapy-induced DM, more have been published since. 15 16 Clinicians should be aware of the potential of this immunotherapy-related adverse reaction as early recognition and treatment may prevent progression of symptoms, decline of functional status and quality of life.\n\n【76】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【77】Having always enjoyed good health and an active life, I was surprised to find that I was beginning to feel tired during the day and that my shoulders kept aching.\n\n【78】Two months later, it came as a shock that I had cancer of the cervix. I was referred to hospital where a treatment plan was formulated. In the intervening weeks, before radiotherapy could be started I found that I couldn’t raise my arms above my head and could barely lift my legs. I was subsequently admitted as an inpatient and underwent many tests by a team of specialists. During those 8 weeks I felt that I was receiving the best of attention and care.\n\n【79】On returning home, I have gradually regained my strength, weight and independence. A recent sensation of numbness in my left foot and lower leg is being monitored.\n\n【80】### Learning points\n\n【81】   Paraneoplastic dermatomyositis (DM) associated with cervical squamous cell carcinoma is rare but should be considered in patients who display proximal muscle weakness and cutaneous lesions.\n\n【82】   DM often precedes a cancer diagnosis; the British Society of Rheumatology provides useful guidance on screening for underlying malignancy.\n\n【83】   Ultimately, treating the underlying malignancy is imperative for improvement and resolution of paraneoplastic DM. Additional glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulins can also be considered.\n\n【84】   Involving multidisciplinary professionals, including but not limited to; physiotherapists, occupational therapists and dieticians will ensure patients have the best prospect of improving quickly and return to activities of daily living as prior to their DM diagnosis.\n\n【85】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【86】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【87】Not applicable.\n\n【88】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【89】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I, and all contributors to this case report, are most grateful to the patient whose case this report describes.

He was advised some topical medications from a local hospital. Family members also tried to remove the stingers with a piece of cloth. Without any remission, he sought a second opinion at our institute. Examination revealed best-corrected visual acuity of 20/30 and intraocular pressure (IOP) of 14 mm Hg in the RE. Slit-lamp evaluation revealed mild circumcorneal congestion, focal corneal oedema with overlying minimal punctate epithelial keratopathy, three intracorneal stingers, mutton-fat keratic precipitates and 3+ cells in the anterior chamber (AC) . Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) further confirmed the exact location of stingers . The RE posterior segment and left eye examination were unremarkable. The patient was started on topical prednisolone acetate 1%, moxifloxacin 0.5%, carboxymethyl cellulose 0.5% and homatropine 2%. A diagnosis of multiple retained corneal bee stingers with secondary intraocular inflammation was made and the need for the removal of stingers was explained. Under topical proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%, a clear corneal incision was made at 10’o clock with a 15-degree knife . With the help of a 23-gauge end-grasping forceps, two stingers were grasped from the endothelial side and removed carefully after injecting a viscoelastic agent in the AC. The remaining intrastromal stinger was removed with a 31-gauge needle from the epithelial side . Four weeks postoperatively, visual acuity in the RE improved to 20/20 (partial) with normal IOP, and resolution of corneal oedema and AC inflammation were noted. Corneal endothelial cell density was within the normal range postoperatively.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】(A) Anterior segment imaging with slit-illumination showing two overlapping corneal stingers (yellow arrow) and a separate stinger (white arrow).

(B) Magnified view of one stinger removed using a 31-gauge needle (white arrow).\n\n【13】Ocular bee sting injury can present as penetrating, immunologic, or toxic reaction, or any combination of these. Injury can present in the form of insult to the cornea, conjunctiva, AC, lens, vitreous cavity, extraocular muscles or even the optic nerve. 1 The reaction to a bee sting can be due to the stinger or venom within it. The active components of the venom include apamin, mast cell degranulating peptide, phospholipase-A2 related peptide and melittin. 2 Melittin and apamin can cause endothelial damage, cataract and zonular dehiscence. Phospholipase-A can degenerate the chromatophores of the iris epithelium manifesting as heterochromia. 1 Secondary bacterial infection is another complication of a bee sting. 3 Possibly our patient had a toxic reaction and/or superadded immunological reaction leading to secondary uveitis. There is partial disagreement regarding the management of retained stingers. 4 5 While some clinicians preferred early surgical removal of stingers, 4 others suggested observation as stingers often become inert once the venom is exhausted. 5 We removed the intracorneal stingers due to persistent symptoms and AC inflammation despite using topical medications. AS-OCT helped us to precisely locate the stingers and decide the approach of removal. The combination of a bidirectional approach from the epithelial and endothelial side, and the use of simple yet appropriate instruments minimised the risk of collateral tissue damage and consequent corneal scarring in the visual axis. Meticulous history, appropriate imaging and a targeted surgical approach with minimal manipulation are keys to management in such patients.\n\n【14】### Learning points\n\n【15】   Retained corneal bee stingers can cause persistent intraocular inflammation.\n\n【16】   Anterior segment optical coherence tomography may help in precisely locating the stingers and deciding the approach to removal.\n\n【17】   Targeted surgical approach through epithelial and/or endothelial side may minimise corneal scarring.\n\n【18】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【19】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【20】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

So, the final diagnosis of nasal localised amyloidosis was achieved. Due to cardiovascular disease and absence of symptoms, it was decided to keep the patient under clinical surveillance.

It is usually systemic, but it can be localised to a specific organ or tissue in 10%–20% of the cases. 1 Localised amyloidosis most commonly occurs at head and neck and it primarily affects larynx and oropharynx. The involvement of nasal cavities is exceedingly rare, with less than 40 cases described in literature to date. 2 The pathophysiology of localised amyloidosis is poorly understood, but it has been proposed that light chains are locally produced and deposited by plasma cells. Imaging findings usually consist in well-defined homogeneous soft tissue mass, although it has been rarely reported to appear as heterogeneous and calcified masses, such as the present case. Bony erosion is only reported at advanced stages. 3 Unlike the systemic form, localised amyloidosis generally has good prognosis, rarely progressing to systemic involvement. Evidence regarding localised amyloidosis management is sparse, but it usually involves surgical excision, radiotherapy or clinical surveillance. 4\n\n【19】### Learning points\n\n【20】   Localised amyloidosis may resemble malignancy in the sinonasal tract.\n\n【21】   Exclusion of systemic disease through a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory in isolated sinonasal amyloidosis.\n\n【22】   Overall prognosis of localised sinonasal amyloidosis is good.\n\n【23】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【24】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【25】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

A triad of age of the child, ACT (its form and duration), and the stage of development govern the severity of developmental dental abnormalities. Since, it is known that ACT targets the cells in an active state of the cell cycle, the regions of the jaw and tooth development get adversely affected.\n\n【5】This is a case of a 16-year-old boy who reported to the outpatient department of division of paediatric dentistry with a report of the discoloured teeth. Medical history revealed that the patient has been treated at the cancer hospital in All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, and is currently under the follow-up without any recurrence. Medical history revealed the child had a malignant round cell thalamic tumour diagnosed at the age of 5 years. When the treating oncologist was consulted, it was revealed that the child had received chemotherapy that was initiated at the age of 5 years and persisted till 7 years of age. Therapy includes a combination of anticancer drugs under Vincristine, Actinomycin-D, Cyclophosphamide (VAC)/Ifosfamide, Etoposide (IE) protocol (named after drugs used) in six cycles, repeated every 6 weeks and spread over a span of 48 weeks. Doses were given according to the body surface area of the patient with a cumulative dose of vincristine (18 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), doxorubicin(375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), actinomycin-D(5 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), cyclophosphamide (10 800 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), ifosfamide (72 000 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and etoposide(4000 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ). The child also received radiation therapy commencing at the age of 5 years with a total dose of 55.9 Gy, comprising of whole brain radiation and spinal radiation in 35 fractions followed by boost radiation to the primary tumour (thalamic region) in 20 fractions.\n\n【6】There was no abnormality evident on extraoral examination. Intraoral examination revealed that the child had permanent dentition with generalised stain deposits with multiple teeth and a grade 1 mobility with mandibular incisors. Oral hygiene was fair with generalised mild gingival inflammation. Pit and fissure caries was present with left maxillary and mandibular permanent first molars. Orthopantomogram revealed arrested root development with multiple teeth . The effects were most pronounced in mandibular incisors, which had minimal root area to support the overlying crown. The mandibular premolar and canine showed arrested root development with short V-shaped roots, whereas the mandibular first molars showed premature apical root closure.\n\n【7】<img/>\n\n【8】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【10】Orthopantomogram showing arrested root growth in multiple teeth. The effects range from premature apical closure in mandibular first molars to almost complete root agenesis with mandibular incisors.\n\n【11】There is strong evidence that supports the association between childhood cancer-related chemoirradiation and developmental dental abnormalities. 1 2 Radiation to the teeth buds at their early stage of development has been associated with dental abnormalities, such as tooth agenesis, root shortening, early apical closure, coronal hypocalcification and microdontia. 3 4 Children who received local radiation are at increased risk of developmental dental abnormalities later in life. 5–7 It has been also observed that the children who had received more than 24 Gy of cranial radiation at age less than 5 years are more prone to the dental defects. 8 Development of tooth starts at 4 months of intrauterine life and continues till 14 years of age. The primary tooth germs in the postnatal period, are mostly at the stage of crown calcification and initiation of root formation. The development of the first permanent tooth germ starts at the time of birth that comprises of various stages, initiation, proliferation, histodifferentiation, morphodifferentiation and apposition, marked by the increased cellular activity of cell lines. 9 Periodic examinations post radiation therapy is essential to provide comprehensive oral healthcare. Dental treatment may require a multidisciplinary approach, involving a variety of dental specialists to address the treatment needs of each individual. There is no evidence regarding the benefits of fluoride in prevention of tooth-related abnormalities, although, caries preventive effect is still crucial considering higher tendency of dental caries in hypoplastic teeth. Dental implants remain the mainstay in the management of cases with tooth agenesis.\n\n【12】The survivors may also experience salivary gland dysfunction/hypofunction or xerostomia along with the abnormalities of tooth development. 10 This can lead to oral discomfort, difficulty in speech, dysphagia and viscous saliva. The xerostomia further can lead to tooth demineralisation, dental caries and periodontal disease. 11 These consequences can be managed by patient education, prevention, symptomatic therapy and use of systemic and topical salivary stimulants. Radiation therapy directed at/near the mouth can affect the process of enamel and dentin formation. It has been found that the teeth, which are located even along the edges of a radiation beam exposure, can receive up to the 45% of the administered dose of radiation. 8 In the present case, the tooth abnormality has been observed in the mandibular dentition and the effects were more pronounced in the incisor region, indicating the consequences of directed radiation rather than a chemotherapeutic drug. Radiation when directed at distant areas of the body has found to have minimal effect on dental development. The same is evident in the present case, with unaffected maxillary dentition and lesser affected mandibular posterior teeth in spite of severe root stunting in mandibular incisor region. Whole brain radiation therapy along with boost and spinal irradiation could have been the reason for the affected tooth development present in the midline. Considering the finding that maxillary teeth were relatively unaffected, the likely cause of stunted root development in the mandibular incisor could be their proximity to spinal irradiation. The ameloblasts are very sensitive cells and a dose as low as 10 Gy can lead to their permanent damage. 12 The goal of any radiation therapy is to kill the tumour cells with minimal damage to the adjacent normal tissues. However, the cells/tissue, which are along the line of radiation beam or near the implanted radioisotope, experience adverse reaction and these effects may be noted bilaterally even if the tumour is unilateral. 13\n\n【13】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【14】We visited the dental outpatient department for the routine dental examination of our child. However, the doctors there told us that the anticancer therapy has significantly affected the growth of teeth. These effects are irreversible and our child needs to be careful to avoid trauma or biting hard with these teeth as there is a little root to support.\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】   Young age of the patient, site of radiation beam, and dose received during the cancer-related radiation therapy are the principal determinants of severity of oral consequences.\n\n【17】   An emphasis should also be given to the structures via which the radiation is passing, particularly in children, as it can lead to adverse effects on developing structures localised in that area.\n\n【18】   The use of site-specific irradiation should be encouraged to reduce its effect over the healthy tissues. The mandibular and maxillary regions should be considered as organs at risk when radiotherapy is delivered to a child to minimise their irradiation.\n\n【19】   An appropriate protocol for the regular visits to the dentist should be promoted to reduce the effect of developmental dental anomalies on day-to-day functional activity and patients should be counselled to maintain oral health, thereby improving their oral health-related quality of life.\n\n【20】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【21】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【22】Parents/Guardian consent obtained.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Mr Ashish Jena for his technical support in this publication.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Two days later, he was readmitted with an inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction and an acute ischaemic stroke in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Given the patient’s haemodynamic stability and high likelihood of an embolic aetiology to the clinical condition, it was decided not to perform coronary angiography and stroke treatment was prioritised instead.\n\n【7】After endovascular thrombectomy, contrast-enhanced CT was performed revealing a mass (18×10×25 mm) in the ascending aortic lumen, without evidence of aortic dissection, aneurysm or tortuosity of the aorta . An infarction of the right kidney was also reported. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed the presence of a pedunculated highly mobile echogenic mass attached to the anterior region of the aortic root, near the right coronary ostium, measuring >15 mm, suggestive of a thrombus. A 12 mm mobile echogenic mass in the anterior region of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) was also identified, suggestive of a thrombus ( online supplemental videos 1 and 2 ). Other findings included left ventricular inferior wall hypokinesia with normal left ventricular function, akinesia of the free wall and diaphragmatic wall of the right ventricle with severe right ventricular dysfunction and small patent foramen ovale with minimal shunt.\n\n【8】### Supplementary video\n\n【9】\\[bcr-2023-255997supp001.avi\\]\n\n【10】### Supplementary video\n\n【11】\\[bcr-2023-255997supp002.avi\\]\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【15】Contrast-enhanced CT scan in coronal view showing a thrombus in the ascending aortic lumen (yellow arrow) and kidney infarction (red arrow).\n\n【16】He was admitted to the intensive care unit where he developed cardiogenic shock with multiorgan dysfunction. Given the high risk of cardiac surgery, a multidisciplinary decision was taken to start anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin after repeating the head CT to exclude haemorrhagic complications.

The patient was deemed unsuitable for ventricular support due to his advanced myocardial infarction and significant neurological deficits.\n\n【17】Thrombus formation in LVOT and in a non-aneurysmal ascending aorta is extremely rare due to the high blood flow environment. 1–3 It has potentially life-threatening complications arising from coronary, cerebral and systemic embolisation.

Esiendrath first described the anomaly in 1925 and less than 50 cases are reported in literature worldwide. 1 In this anomaly the major calyces and pelvis lie outside the kidney and it is often associated with other renal anomalies like hydronephrosis due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), dysplasia and ectopic kidney. 2\n\n【5】Herein, we present a case of ERC in a 10-year-old boy presenting with pain and a lump in the left flank. Ultrasound showed a hydronephrotic left kidney, size 11.3 × 5.1 cm with thinned out cortex and dilated pelvis likely due to UPJO. Right kidney was normal. The renal dynamic scan confirmed severe hydronephrosis and poor function (9%) in the left kidney. Open left pyeloplasty was planned for the patient. Consent for left nephrouretrectomy was also taken in view of poor function. No other imaging was performed.\n\n【6】An anterior flank extraperitoneal approach was used to access the left kidney. Intraoperatively, the ballooned kidney was decompressed and 150 mL of urine was drained. Abnormal intraoperative findings in form of multiple tubular structures (1–3 cm in length) arising from the kidney and then draining into a dilated sac with non-identification of the ureter during initial dissection pointed towards a developmental anomaly of the pelvicalyceal system.\n\n【7】On initial examination, it seemed like a variant of renal duplication anomaly. On further dissection, four major calyces were clearly identified which emerged from the kidney draining into the dilated pelvis and the ureter was attached to the lowermost part of renal pelvis and narrowing at UPJ was present.\n\n【8】In view of poor renal function (9%), papery thin parenchyma and complex anatomy, left nephrouretrectomy was performed . The histopathological finding showed a markedly dilated pelvicalyceal system with thickened ureter and focal hydropic changes in the kidney . In the case with the poor function (<10%) but a good robust parenchyma and comparable renal size, we would have done pyeloplasty.\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【12】Nephrouretrectomy specimen of left kidney showing papery thin parenchyma and four major calyces draining into the dilated pelvis, the extrarenal calyces (ERC).\n\n【13】<img/>\n\n【14】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【16】(A) Microscopic sections(10×) from kidney showing hydropic changes and (B) section from ureter showing thickened muscular wall.\n\n【17】The disparity in the rate of growth that is, rapid branching of ureteric bud into calyces before it coalesces with the metanephric blastema or the delayed differentiation of the metanephric tissue has been postulated as the cause for the origin of ERC anomaly. 3 The child is in our follow-up for 13 months and has been symptom free.\n\n【18】In such cases, if there is preoperative suspicion of ERC, an intravenous pyelography or an MR urogram can definitely prove helpful to delineate the complex anatomy and functional status of the renal moiety beforehand.\n\n【19】### Learning points\n\n【20】   Multiple tubular calyces which lay outside the kidney should alert the surgeon towards the possibility of extrarenal calyces (ERC).\n\n【21】   ERC anatomy can be confused with renal duplication anomalies.\n\n【22】   ERC may be associated with ureteropelvic junction obstruction type of hydronephrosis.\n\n【23】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【24】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【25】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors sincerely thank Dr P.

The patient had undergone extraction of a right second premolar and the dentist was suspecting root fracture. CBCT of right maxilla was done to aid in retrieving the location of root tip. Image acquisition was done using Planmeca ProMax 3Ds machine (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) with standard operating specifications. Planmeca Romexis software V.3.01 R was used for viewing and analysing the images. CBCT slices were analysed in axial, coronal and sagittal sections. Sagittal section showed extraction socket in tooth 15 region. Sagittal section showed a well-defined radiopacity within the right maxillary sinus with perforation of floor of right maxillary sinus . Axial section confirmed presence of root fragment within the antrum suggestive of root fragment, measuring about 4.22 mm . Mucosal thickening was evident in the right maxillary sinus suggestive of sinusitis . Radiographically, a diagnosis of oroantral communication (OAC) was given. The patient was referred for surgical evaluation for treating OAC and Otolaryngologists for further evaluation of sinus pathology. OAC is an unpleasant complicated situation encountered by dental practitioners where an abnormal communication develops between oral cavity and the maxillary sinus. 1 It is always better to diagnose OAC as early as possible and should be closed within 24 hours to prevent any sinus infection and inappropriate healing of the socket. 2 A limitation of two-dimensional imaging; however, is the superimposition of anatomical structures. 3 However, CBCT overcomes this limitation and can be used to identify OAC and also to determine the status of the soft tissue in the maxillary sinus and to identify sinus pathology, which proved to be of high diagnostic value in the reported case.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Sagittal section shows perforation of the floor of the maxillary sinus.\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【12】Axial section shows evidence of root fragment and its measurement.\n\n【13】### Learning points\n\n【14】   The most common cause for oroantral communication (OAC) is the extraction of maxillary posterior teeth.

Since these symptoms were not severe, she was not admitted to a hospital for care. She has a history of well-controlled hypertension and bronchial asthma. MRI revealed a subacute right cerebral infarction with multiple severe stenosis of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) , even though they were intact when the MRI was performed, which is, by chance, due to the detailed examination for the numbness of the extremities and dizziness 3 years before . Simultaneously, prolonged erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) elevation (131 mm/hour) also coexisted. Serum myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were both negative and no other vascular complication as well as malignant tumour or signs of infectious diseases was shown by whole body contrast enhanced CT, however, the biopsy of the superficial temporal artery revealed inflammatory cell infiltration into the tunica media and thickening of the tunica intima , which were consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA). According to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of GCA, 1 the diagnosis of GCA and intracranial GCA (IC-GCA) was made and the patient was administered 25 mg per day of oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) in addition to antiplatelet therapy.

IC-GCA is difficult to diagnose when the patient initially presents with a stroke, 3 however, it is reported to be associate with significant mortality and more prevalent than currently recognised. 4 In this case, of course traditional stroke such as atherothrombotic infarction could not be ruled out, however, we concluded that it was more reasonable to explain newly developed bilateral multiple stenosis of MCA if the GCA was involved. Here, we report the unique MRI finding of bilateral MCA stenosis and emphasise the risk of potential underlying GCA among stroke patients, especially when the condition is accompanied by unexplained inflammation or headache.\n\n【18】### Learning points\n\n【19】   Intracranial giant cell arteritis (GCA) is difficult to diagnose when the patient initially presents with a stroke.\n\n【20】   Underlying GCA should be considered among stroke patients, especially when the condition is accompanied by unexplained inflammation or headache.\n\n【21】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【22】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【23】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Sometimes the sources of heavy metal exposure are unanticipated. We report a case of acute lead poisoning presenting with adverse haematological manifestations following ingestion of ayurvedic medicine.\n\n【5】A 30-year-old wrestler presented with complaints of pain in the epigastrium, episodic vomiting, constipation and easy fatigability following consumption of unsupervised ayurvedic medicines  for a duration of one month. On clinical examination the patient had pallor with mild hepatomegaly. He did not have features of lead encephalopathy, neuropsychiatric/cognitive effects, peripheral neuropathy or lead nephropathy. His evaluation revealed microcytic hypochromic anaemia (haemoglobin 96 g/L, total leukocyte count 6.92×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and platelets 214×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), with reticulocyte count of 0.06% and no evidence of basophilic stippling or haemolysis on peripheral blood smear. Bone marrow  showed cellular marrow with increased iron stores (Perls’ stain: grade 4), with no ring sideroblasts  and dyspoietic megakaryocytes . Radiological evaluation revealed mild hepatomegaly. Due to history of prolonged ayurvedic medicine usage, he was subjected to heavy metal screening, which revealed elevated blood lead level (BLL 83.6 µg/dL), with normal blood/urine levels of arsenic, mercury, cadmium and chromium. Skeletal survey did not reveal dense metaphyseal lines. He was managed with intravenous calcium disodium EDTA at 1 g/m <sup>2 </sup> for 5 days, to which he responded with a reduction in BLL and clinical improvement.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【9】All the ayurvedic medications the patient was consuming to aid in bodybuilding.\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【13】(A) Bone marrow aspirate with erythroid and myeloid precursors (May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain, 400×).

(D) Bone marrow biopsy with dyspoietic hypolobated megakaryocytes (H&E stain, 400×).\n\n【14】In the index case, due to short exposure to ayurvedic medication, the patient lacked the classic features of basophilic stippling and ring sideroblasts, which are often the earliest manifestations of lead poisoning. 1 The onset of symptoms is relatively fast for subacute lead poisoning but probably commensurate with the degree of lead ingested. Ideally, estimating the lead level in ayurvedic medications would have implicated a cause-effect relation; however, this could not be done due to lack of mass spectrometry. Chelation therapy quenches lead from different body sites and expels it through urine, as seen in our patient. Therapy should be initiated when BLL is >80 µg/dL in asymptomatic and >50 µg/dL in symptomatic adults.\n\n【15】Although over 95% of lead exposures are occupational, ayurvedic medicines are recognised as a source of lead poisoning and are responsible for 2% of non-occupational exposures. 2 Ayurvedic medicines incorporate heavy metals (eg, mercury, lead and zinc) as ashes (‘bhasmas’), a practice known as ‘Rasa Shastra’, and these are claimed to be safe and therapeutic if properly prepared and administered. 3 A comprehensive analysis of 193 ayurvedic preparations revealed heavy metals in around 20%, with lead and mercury 100–10 000 times greater than acceptable levels. 4 Lead intoxication associated with ayurvedic medicines is increasingly reported due to lack of government regulations on the efficacy and safety and ready off-the-shelf availability as herbal remedies in food stores or through the internet. 5\n\n【16】The patient in this case has taken unsupervised ayurvedic medicines for bodybuilding, leading to lead poisoning. This case illustrates the impact of ayurvedic medicines, supplements and other non-prescription medicines on patients’ health.\n\n【17】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【18】I was unaware of the adverse effects of these medicines. In an enthusiasm to prepare well for the upcoming sports events and do better, I resorted to these drugs. I should have taken the consult of an expert in Ayurvedic medicines before using it. In the long run, my enthusiasm cost me heavily as I missed the opportunity to participate in the sports event.\n\n【19】### Learning points\n\n【20】   Unprescribed consumption of ayurvedic medicines can lead to severe adverse effects.\n\n【21】   Individuals on ayurvedic medications who present to the hospital with atypical symptoms should be evaluated for heavy metal overdose.\n\n【22】   Self-medication based on internet advice to help in bodybuilding, as in our case, can cause severe organ toxicity.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Kundan, Dr SK Singh, Dr Revanth, Dr Tathagata Chatterjee and Dr PK Sharma for support in managing this patient.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The patient reported a history of lipomatosis and was currently scheduled to undergo treatment for the same. A cone beam CT (CBCT) image, with a 5×5 field of view of right permanent first molar to the right permanent lateral incisor, was advised for the evaluation of the edentulous site for placement of an implant. On radiographic examination, a tree-like course of the maxillary artery over the anterior wall of the maxilla, with its branches into the anterior and middle superior alveolar vessels, was noted on the volume rendering technique (VRT) image  and the reconstructed panoramic image . The maxillary sinus showed isodensity similar to soft tissue on the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus and the lower one-third of the maxillary sinus, which could be suggestive of sinusitis.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】A 3D volume rendered image of the right maxilla with the imprint of the course of the artery on it.\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【12】Panoramic reconstruction also showing the course of the vasculature in the right maxilla.\n\n【13】This finding was found to be unique in the same way that the neurovascular bundles may be noted in the intraoral periapical radiograph as radiolucent lines which traverse the course of the floor of the sinus. 1 However, in this particular case, the presence of such a finding in the VRT image was due to the presence of isodensity along the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus as well as the thin cortical plate of the anterior maxillary sinus, which highlighted the course of the maxillary artery and the vessels branching from it. Píšová et al in their literature review spoke about the effects of the endocranial vasculature on the inner surface of the cranial vault. The most common grooves found are those of the course of the middle meningeal artery. These courses are usually caused by the endocranial pressure, the meningeal layers and bony extensions which may be present. These vascular imprints have been found to be useful in the anthropological field and forensic medicine in identifying the life history of the individual. 2 Similar to this case, there have been no previous reports of such findings other than a study conducted by Kasahara et al in 2016, where they had compared the course of the neurovascular channels of the superior alveolar nerve and vessels using micro-CT in dry cadaver skulls with CBCT as well as histological analysis. 3 Studies like Gomes et al in 2020 who studied the effect of normotension and hypertension in adults using CBCT in the maxillary canine suggested that patients with hypertension had a larger pulp chamber which could be suggestive due to the high flow rate of the blood; however, until now no report of such an impression has been mentioned in the literature. 4 Such features are important during procedures which involve the maxillary sinus, like the sinus lift procedure in case of implant placement.\n\n【14】### Learning points\n\n【15】   The course of the neurovascular channels can be clearly demarcated on this particular cone beam CT (CBCT) volume.\n\n【16】   Visualisation of such changes should not perturb the clinician, as on first glance it appears as trauma.\n\n【17】   This particular CBCT is highlighted as there is a clear course of the maxillary artery seen on the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus in the volume rendered image.\n\n【18】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【19】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【20】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

It revealed a moderate-sized, complex-appearing global pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade as evidenced by right ventricular and right atrial collapse, a dilated inferior vena cava with reduced inspiratory collapse and borderline significant inspiratory reduction of diastolic mitral inflow velocity. A pericardiocentesis was performed and 300 mL of a milky fluid was aspirated .\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【9】Collection bag of pericardial fluid aspirate.\n\n【10】The main differentials of a milky pericardial aspirate are a purulent effusion, chylopericardium and cholesterol pericarditis, which are all rare disorders. 1 Purulent pericarditis is a serious complication of bacterial pericarditis and is characterised by gross pus in the pericardium or microscopically purulent effusion. 2 It is caused by bacterial invasion of the pericardium or by haematogenous spread . 2 This condition is associated with a high mortality rate as it simultaneously threatens septicaemia and tamponade. 1 Chylopericardium is a pericardial effusion composed of chyle and is associated with damage to the thoracic duct. It is diagnosed on pericardial fluid analysis with a triglyceride level greater than 500 mg/dL and a cholesterol/triglyceride ratio less than one. 3 Cholesterol pericarditis is seen in the setting of chronic pericardial effusions, secondary to tuberculosis or rheumatoid pericarditis. It has an elevated cholesterol and total lipid levels like a chylopericardium but contains cholesterol crystals and differs in appearance. The fluid may vary in colour from being cloudy to amber and classically has a glittering ‘gold paint’ appearance. 1 In this patient’s case, the recent oesophageal surgery raises another possibility of a communication between the oesophagus and the pericardial space with possible enteral feeds accumulating in the pericardium.\n\n【11】The key to diagnosis is an analysis of the fluid, with particular focus on the triglyceride level and white cell count . In this setting, a CT scan to assess for the presence of an oesophago-pericardial fistula is required. On analysis of the pericardial fluid, the triglyceride level was 9 mg/dL, the cholesterol/triglyceride ratio was 2.8 and the polymorphs >50 000×106/L. The fluid analysis was not consistent with enteral feed fluids. The pericardial fluid culture grew a streptococcus anginosus species and a purulent pericardium was diagnosed. A subsequent CT scan showed that there was evidence of mediastinitis and possible oesophageal perforation with a posterior mediastinal collection.\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【15】Diagnostic algorithm following pericardiocentesis of milky fluid.

The patient had work-up at the outside hospital that showed elevated liver enzymes. A right upper quadrant ultrasound was done; however, they were not able to locate her gallbladder. The patient was subsequently transferred to hospital. At presentation to our hospital she was complaining of severe 10/10 right upper quadrant pain. Her vital signs were stable, and an abdominal exam revealed significant right upper quadrant tenderness. The patient had repeat basic labs performed that showed elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). The patient subsequently had a CT abdomen and pelvis that showed findings consistent with heterotaxy syndrome with polysplenia . There were multiple small splenules in the right upper quadrant with an infarct in one of them that was likely the cause of the severe right upper quadrant pain . Some other findings evident in our patient were a midline liver, presence of the stomach in the right upper quadrant. The intestines were malrotated with the caecum in the midline and terminal ileum in the right lower quadrant. The inferior vena cava was interrupted with azygos continuation. She had further work-up but no cause for the splenic infarct was found. She was managed conservatively. Her elevated liver function tests (LFTs) were found to be chronic and attributed to fatty liver disease.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】CT of the abdomen and pelvis was consistent with heterotaxy syndrome with polysplenia.

It is a broad term with many different variants. Our patient had visceral heterotaxy which can be classified into heterotaxy with asplenia or polysplenia, as was in our case. Polysplenia syndrome usually involves the presence of multiple small splenules without a parent spleen. Other associations include midline liver, intestinal malrotation, bilateral hyparterial bronchi, bilobed lungs, bilateral left atria, and azygos or hemiazygos continuation of the inferior vena cava. Polysplenia syndrome typically does not involve congenital cyanotic heart defects and thus patients with this syndrome have better outcomes. Asplenia syndrome is characterised by the absence of a spleen. It also involves a midline liver and intestinal malrotation but in contrast to the polysplenia syndrome these patients typically have bilateral right atria, trilobed lungs and eparterial bronchi. Asplenia syndrome typically involves severe cyanotic congenital heart defects. 1\n\n【14】The exact incidence of this syndrome and its variants is not known due to underdiagnosis. Patients are either diagnosed at birth especially if they have a variant with congenital heart defects, or later in life incidentally after they undergo imaging for different reasons. The underlying pathophysiology involves genetic mutations that have been identified in as many as 60 different genes. 1\n\n【15】Due to the wide heterogeneity in underlying organ dysfunction, the treatment varies according to the organs involved. Patients with cardiac involvement usually require surgery early in childhood. Patients with heterotaxy involving the abdominal viscera may also develop complications after birth like bowel obstruction. However, they are more likely to be asymptomatic and be diagnosed later in life. 1\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】   Heterotaxy syndrome is a condition in which the different organs in the thoracoabdominal cavity may be abnormal or malpositioned.\n\n【18】   It can be classified based on malpositioning of abdominal or thoracic viscera. In the first case, it is divided into heterotaxy with polysplenia or asplenia. In the second case, it is divided into isomerism of the right atrial appendages or isomerism of the left atrial appendages.\n\n【19】   In case of heterotaxy with polysplenia, there may be multiple small splenules and any pathology can have a very atypical presentation.\n\n【20】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【21】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【22】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

No organisms were noted on smear in the corneal scrape samples. There was no symptomatic improvement with topical antibacterial treatment (0.5% moxifloxacin eye drops 2 hourly) alone. Later, Demodex mites were isolated from eyelashes and on combined topical antibacterials for left eye and demodicosis management for both eyes, both the corneal infiltrates and blepharitis resolved .\n\n【17】Case 5: A woman in her 50s presented with complaints of ocular irritation for 1 week.

Though not prevalent in any of our cases, ocular demodicosis is a known risk factor for chalazion in all ages. 3 A simple microscopic examination of eyelash samples can help us diagnose and thereafter provide specific treatment. Tea tree oil (TTO-terpinen-4-ol)— with concentrations ranging from 5% twice a day to 50% weekly—is highly effective in its treatment followed by medications like metronidazole, ivermectin and permethrin. 4 TTO application should be supplemented with warm saline compression and lid scrubs. 5 Our cases presented after other therapeutic modalities were tried elsewhere, and we could achieve rapid resolution of the condition once the diagnosis was established.\n\n【23】### Learning points\n\n【24】   Demodex can present as blepharokeratoconjunctivitis with a spectrum of findings and can be easily missed which leads to several recurrences. It is thus important to suspect, diagnose and subsequently direct the treatment towards the eradication of the mites.\n\n【25】   Eyelashes with cylindrical dandruff are pathognomonic for ocular Demodex infestation and tea tree oil application is effective for management of this condition.\n\n【26】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【27】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【28】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

In fact, this case was complicated by bleeding. However, recently a large retrospective study showed that anticoagulation significantly improves the rate of portal vein thrombosis resolution, and significantly reduces the rate of chronic symptomatic portal hypertension without the increasing risk of major bleeding, among patients with pylephlebitis. 5\n\n【14】A wedge-shaped enhancement effect of the portal vein occlusion area may be observed in the early arterial phase on CT. 6 It is speculated that the effect is due to a compensatory increase in hepatic arterial blood flow caused by portal vein occlusion. 6 If there is the effect of the liver in a patient with cholangitis, we should suspect a thrombus in the portal vein on the side that is being contrasted. A high level of suspicion is required and abdominal contrast CT can make an early diagnosis.\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】   The proportion of pylephlebitis caused by cholangitis has increased.\n\n【17】   In pylephlebitis, a wedge-shaped enhancement effect of the portal vein occlusion area may be observed in the early arterial phase on CT.\n\n【18】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【19】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【20】Obtained.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Kenji Shimura, Susumu Maruta, and Sayaka Kainuma, Department of Gastroenterology, and Keiichi Furukawa, Kanta Kurasawa, and Tokio Hoshika, Department of Infectious Disease, Asahi General Hospital for the patient management.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

In the context of the spleen, these lesions mean that the patient has no history of malignancy and no symptoms, such as fever, weight loss and upper abdominal discomfort. Unexpected splenic lesions are frequently identified on CT in daily clinical practice. Although most lesions are benign, clinicians should be alert to warning findings as follows: the presence of solid, contrast-enhancing components and ill-defined lesion borders. 1 These findings suggest the possibility of potentially more relevant diseases, such as malignancy, abscess and sarcoidosis. Alternatively, splenic incidentaloma detected on chest X-ray is rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of incidentally identified splenic masses on plain chest radiography.\n\n【14】Splenic epidermoid cysts are uncommon congenital benign lesions. They are a form of non-parasitic primary cysts. They are composed of cystic lesions lined by keratinising and nonkeratinising epithelia, which may be squamous or cuboidal. Symptoms of epidermoid splenic cysts are usually nonspecific. The most common symptoms are a left upper abdominal mass, followed by left upper abdominal pain. 2 Complications from epidermoid splenic cysts, such as bleeding, infection and rupture, are rare. On imaging examinations, epidermoid of the spleen has a solitary, well-defined cystic lesion, occasionally with plaque-like wall calcification. Surgical therapy is often recommended for symptomatic patients and for cysts larger than 5 cm. The goal of the surgical treatment is to avoid complications and prevent recurrence. 3\n\n【15】Routine chest radiography obtained on admission has been a common practice in many hospitals. In addition to that, especially in Japan, routine chest X-rays are often performed before admission to nursing homes mainly to rule out tuberculosis (since Japan is still a tuberculosis middle-burden country). 4 Clinicians should pay attention to the potential existence of abnormal findings outside the lung fields when reading routine plain chest radiographic images.\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】   Incidentaloma on plain chest radiography is a rare clinical presentation of splenic masses.\n\n【18】   Splenic epidermoid cysts are uncommon congenital benign lesions and rarely lead to complications, including bleeding, infection and rupture.\n\n【19】   Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of abnormal findings in areas other than the lung fields when reading routine plain chest radiographic images.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

DM1 can be broadly classified into at least four subtypes based on the patient’s clinical presentation: congenital, childhood-onset, adult-onset and late-onset. 1 Adult-onset DM1 is the most prevalent, characterised by distal muscle weakness, whereas childhood-onset DM1 is frequently overlooked in affected children or adolescents due to the unnoticeable muscular problems. 2 As muscle involvement may be initially minimal, children often present with difficulty in learning and socialisation at school. 3 4 Patients with childhood-onset DM1 develop muscular symptoms at an older age.\n\n【5】Myotonia is defined as delayed muscle relaxation after voluntary contraction, including eye closure, grip or muscle percussion. The presence of grip myotonia, which indicates DM1, notably narrows the differential diagnosis to only a few diseases, such as myotonia congenita, DM or other rare channelopathies. 5 Here, we present a case of childhood-onset DM1 with a typical clinical course, including the presence of myotonia, which improved with rehabilitation.\n\n【6】A 15-year-old girl presented to our hospital with difficulty in opening her hands after grasping; this was considered abnormal in school medical check-up result. A detailed study of the patient’s history revealed that she had been diagnosed with intellectual disability when in elementary school and that she had been aware of the difficulty in opening her hands since junior high school. Physical examination showed grip myotonia ( video 1 ), whereas laboratory findings revealed an elevated creatine phosphokinase level of 513 U/L (non-disease associated range, 24–195 U/L). Electromyography demonstrated myotonic discharges and short-duration low-amplitude motor unit potentials. Based on the typical clinical course described above, DM1 was suspected.\n\n【7】Video 1\n\n【8】Although DM1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, the family history may be unclear. 1 The diagnosis of DM1 is confirmed by molecular genetic testing of DM protein kinase ( DMPK ). 1 In the present case, although her family history was unclear, the patient was diagnosed with DM1 based on the confirmed presence of expanded CTG repeat sequences (600, non-disease associated range <35) (Southern blot hybridisation of restriction digested genomic blood DNA).\n\n【9】Although there is currently no established therapy for DM1, symptomatic therapy and monitoring of expected complications can improve the quality of life. According to the recent guideline, children with DM1 should frequently be evaluated for physical, occupational and speech rehabilitation needs. 6 Although mexiletine is a therapy option for myotonia, it is commonly mild to moderate in patients with DM1 and rarely requires treatment. 1 6 In the present case, we did not use any drugs, including mexiletine. Two years of physical and occupational rehabilitation improved the function of her hands (eg, the patient was able to button more easily than before), and physical examination revealed some improvement in grip myotonia ( video 2 ). Regular follow-up showed no signs of critical complications (eg, cardiac arrhythmia, cataract and diabetes mellitus).\n\n【10】Video 2\n\n【11】In conclusion, clinicians should be aware that childhood-onset DM1 has long been neglected and DM1 is possible in the differential diagnosis of childhood learning difficulty and muscular symptoms. Rehabilitation may improve the function of hands.\n\n【12】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【13】I have suffered a lot in the past, but I felt so relieved to know that it was all because of my illness. Thanks to the rehabilitation, I am now able to perform various activities of daily living.\n\n【14】### Learning points\n\n【15】   Grip myotonia is a key diagnostic sign for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).\n\n【16】   Childhood-onset DM1 is often missed due to the absence of muscle problems. Patients usually present with low intelligence and other psychosocial problems.\n\n【17】   Although no disease-modifying therapy currently exists, rehabilitation can improve the muscle function and quality of life.\n\n【18】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【19】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【20】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Here, we discuss a case in which macular neovascularisation (MNV) resulted in metamorphopsia and decreased visual acuity in a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta exhibiting a novel COL1A1 gene mutation (p.Tyr165\\). The patient was a woman in her 30s who reported experiencing distorted vision and diminished visual acuity in her right eye for 1 month as well as a history of hearing loss. Rapid improvements in exudative changes and suppression of relapse were achieved after only two intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. Furthermore, since MNV occurred slightly inferior to the fovea centralis, improvements in visual acuity were better than previously reported. As fragility of Bruch’s membrane represents the basis of onset, recurrence and relapse are likely in patients exhibiting MNV, highlighting the need for regular follow-up.\n\n【2】   Retina\n   Orthopaedics\n   Macula\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

The 2019 edition of the Nosology & Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders classifies osteogenesis imperfecta into type 1 (non-deformation with persistently blue sclerae), type 2 (perinatal lethal form), type 3 (progressively deforming type), type 4 (moderate form), 1 type 5—which is accompanied by interosseous calcification/hyperplastic callus—and other types. Type 1 is the most common type of osteogenesis imperfecta among adults.\n\n【10】In more than 90% of cases, osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by genetic mutations ( COL1A1, COL1A2 ) affecting type I collagen, which is a major component of connective tissue, especially in the bones and ligaments. Clinically, patients with osteogenesis imperfecta exhibit susceptibility to fracture, growth disorders, hearing loss, hyperextension of the joints and skin and valvular disease. In 1965, Manschot demonstrated that osteogenesis imperfecta is associated with thinning of the cornea and sclera as well as blue scleral findings. 2 In 2014, Wallace et al 3 reported an association between osteogenesis imperfecta and open-angle glaucoma. Other typical ocular findings are myopia and keratoconus. However, only three case reports have described macular neovascularisation (MNV) occurring in the context of osteogenesis imperfecta. 4–6\n\n【11】In this report, we discuss a case in which MNV resulted in metamorphopsia and decreased visual acuity in a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta, exhibiting a novel COL1A1 gene mutation (p.Tyr165\\).\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A woman in her 30s who reported experiencing metamorphopsia and diminished visual acuity in her right eye for 1 month was referred to Oita University Hospital for detailed examination. Although she had four fractures during her childhood, she had no history of systemic illness. She also disclosed that her otolaryngologist had diagnosed hearing loss, the cause of which remained unknown. Blue sclerae were also observed in two of the patient’s children (both male). The elder son, who was 9 years old, had several histories of fractures and was short in stature. The younger son, who was 7 years old, had a history of fractures in early childhood.\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】Decimal visual acuity was 0.4×−3.5D in her right eye and 1.2×−3.5D in her left eye. Ocular pressure was 14 mmHg in her right eye and 15 mmHg in her left eye. Axial length was 23.97 mm in her right eye and 23.96 mm in her left eye. Both eyes exhibited blue sclerae . Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) indicated that corneal thickness was 421 µm in the right eye and 427 µm in the left eye. There were no noteworthy findings in the optic media, and her left fundus was normal. However, her right fundus exhibited a greyish-white exudative lesion with haemorrhage, extending into the parafovea and serous retinal detachment (size: 2 papillae) . Fundus autofluorescence images showed a faint hypofluorescence consistent with the range of serous retinal detachment and a hypofluorescence in the area of the subretinal haemorrhage . A highly reflexive exudative neovascular complex above the retinal pigment epithelium was also observed on OCT images . There was no local thickening of the choroid or compression of the choriocapillaris, and the thickness of the choroid was almost normal. OCT angiography B-scan clearly demonstrated a blood flow signal consistent with the exudative lesion in the parafovea . Reconstructed composite images showed clear subretinal vascular networks . Based on the above, the patient was diagnosed with type 2 MNV.\n\n【16】<img/>\n\n【17】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【19】Photograph of the anterior segment of the eye at the first visit (blue sclerae).

(C) The composite image of OCTA shows the clear subretinal vascular networks (yellow arrow).\n\n【28】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【29】Osteogenesis imperfecta was suspected based on the presence of blue sclerae, the patient’s history of hearing loss/fracture and the results of a bone mineral density test. Relative to the Young Adult Mean, bone mineral densities for the right femur, left femur and lumbar spine were 62%, 60% and 72%, respectively, which were lower than the standard value of 80% or more. Genetic analysis via next-generation sequencing revealed a novel variant of a nonsense mutation in COL1A1 (heterozygous, c.495T>A, p.Tyr165\\). Furthermore, the relevant spot was confirmed by Sanger method . Based on the above results, a definitive diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta was made.\n\n【30】<img/>\n\n【31】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4</u>\n\n【33】We performed Sanger sequencing of the coding exon of the COL1A1 gene using following primers: 5′-TGATCTGGACCTCCCAAGC-3′(sense) and 5′-CACATCACACCAGGAAGTGC-3′(antisense). COL1A1 mutation (heterozygous, c.495T>A, p.Tyr165\\) was confirmed (red arrow).\n\n【34】Treatment\n---------\n\n【35】After ruling out pregnancy, an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab was administered on the day of the visit.\n\n【36】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【37】One month after the initial diagnosis, serous retinal detachment had disappeared, and corrected visual acuity had improved to 0.7 in the right eye. Two months later, corrected visual acuity in the right eye had improved to 1.2. OCT and OCT angiography revealed a marked reduction in the neovascularisation signal when compared with that observed before treatment . However, 1 month later, mild serous retinal detachment was observed again, although corrected visual acuity in her right eye remained unchanged at 1.2. A second injection of ranibizumab into the vitreous body promptly attenuated the exudative changes. After 25 months, she has had no relapse of the lesion, and corrected visual acuity in the right eye remains unchanged at 1.2.\n\n【38】<img/>\n\n【39】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【40】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5</u>\n\n【41】Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and angiography (OCTA) images obtained 2 months after treatment.

(B) OCTA B-scan clearly demonstrated a blood flow signal consistent with MNV reduction. (C) The composite image of OCTA shows that MNV had diminished dramatically (yellow arrow).\n\n【42】Discussion\n----------\n\n【43】The present report is the first to discuss a case of MNV associated with osteogenesis imperfecta in Japan. Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta exhibit blue sclerae due to scleral thinning and transparency of the choroid, resulting from collagen abnormalities. This sign can also be observed in patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. In general, in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, abnormalities in type I collagen reduce ocular rigidity, resulting in axial elongation of the globe and myopia associated with the development of posterior staphyloma.\n\n【44】Bruch’s membrane is composed of five layers. From the retinal side, these layers are the basement membrane of retinal pigment epithelial cells, the inner collagen layer, the elastic plate, the outer collagen layer and the basement membrane of choroidal capillaries. Since the inner and outer collagen layers contain type I collagen, COL1A1 mutation may explain weakening of Bruch’s membrane in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. In all previous reports of MNV associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, the presence of lacquer cracks was confirmed. 4–6 Rishi et al reported that a 12-year-old girl developed a lacquer crack after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, speculating that the temporary increase in intraocular pressure after intravitreal injection or contraction of the retinal pigment epithelium associated with the retraction of MNV caused the Bruch’s membrane to rupture. Bellanca et al 5 reported lacquer cracks in a 28-year-old man with osteogenesis imperfecta who did not use antivascular endothelial growth factor drugs. Despite treatment for MNV, the patient developed lacquer cracks, which may have been due to decreased tension and ankylosis of the eyeball resulting from eyeball elongation.\n\n【45】In the present case, no clear lacquer cracks were observed either before or after treatment. Although refractive errors can develop over a long period of time, the error observed in our patient was smaller than that indicated in previous reports, and no conspicuous extension of the ocular axis was observed. In addition, we speculate that the nonsense mutation (p.Tyr165\\) in COL1A1 detected in our patient was not a dominant-negative mutation but instead represented a null allele due to nonsense codon-mediated mRNA degradation, resulting in haploinsufficiency. Therefore, although susceptibility to fracture and mild hearing loss were observed in the present case, systemic symptoms remained mild and did not interfere with daily life. We believe that lacquer cracks did not occur given that the patient exhibited only mild weakening of Bruch’s membrane.\n\n【46】Some reports have described genetic mutations affecting other types of collagen, which have also been associated with fragility of Bruch’s membrane. Corominas et al 7 reported an association between exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and COL8A1 gene mutation. According to their report, hyperpigmentation of the macula occurred in patients with early AMD exhibiting the COL8A1 mutation, who exhibited a greater degree of myopia than those without the mutation. Previous mouse studies have suggested that structural changes in Bruch’s membrane associated with the COL8A1 mutation lead to the onset of AMD. Thus, abnormalities in collagen fibres may lead to fragility of Bruch’s membrane, thereby resulting in structural changes and contributing to MNV. Indeed, we speculate that such weakening occurred in our patient due to changes in type I collagen in both the inner and outer layers, resulting from COL1A1 mutation.\n\n【47】Fortunately, in the present case, rapid improvement of the exudative changes and suppression of relapse were achieved with only two intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. Furthermore, since MNV was located slightly inferior to the fovea centralis, improvements in visual acuity were better than those reported for previous cases. 4–6 Since fragility of Bruch’s membrane represents the basis of onset, recurrence and relapse are likely in patients exhibited MNV, highlighting the need for regular follow-up.\n\n【48】In conclusion, we discussed a case of MNV associated with osteogenesis imperfecta due to a nonsense mutation in COL1A1 (p.Tyr165 \\). We believe that thinning of the cornea and sclera decreased the rigidity in the globe, and weakening of Bruch’s membrane due to abnormalities in type I collagen contributed to the onset of MNV in our patient.\n\n【49】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【50】(The author translated the patient’s perspective into English.)\n\n【51】From an early age, I felt that my eyes were of a different colour from the people around me. I did not really care because I thought this was because the pigment of my body was lighter than the others.\n\n【52】Since I was in elementary school, I had repeated fractures and my wrists and fingers remained bent. My vision gradually became myopic. I had never been told that these are symptoms of this disease (osteogenesis imperfecta).\n\n【53】This time, my field of vision suddenly became unclear, landscapes were distorted, and my vision became blurry; it became difficult for me to see. I even hit the wall several times. I went to an ophthalmologist because I was afraid that I would lose my eyesight.\n\n【54】For the first time, I learnt the blue colour of the white of my eye (conjunctiva), the repeated fractures I experienced and macular neovascularisation in my eyes were symptoms of osteogenesis imperfecta.\n\n【55】The two injections I received into my eyes were very scary. Thanks to that I am getting better and living the same life as before. However, I am worried that it may recur every time I come to the hospital for a regular check-up.\n\n【56】I was worried that my two sons had inherited it, so my sons also underwent genetic testing. Turns out that both of them had inherited the disease; this shook me more than when I discovered that I had the disease.\n\n【57】I really did not want them to inherit it. It took me some time to make up my mind that I had to deal with this illness along with my two children.\n\n【58】Since both my children have low bone density, they experience several fractures and sprains. Hence, I have spoken with the school teachers and have told them that my children need to avoid strenuous exercises and that they should not bump into other people. I think my children will be more anxious because they are planning to receive intravenous drip treatment, but I would like to face this illness and live.\n\n【59】### Learning points\n\n【60】   Osteogenesis imperfecta was suspected based on the presence of blue sclerae, the patient’s history of hearing loss, fracture and the results of a bone mineral density test.\n\n【61】   Rapid improvement of the exudative changes and suppression of relapse were achieved with only two intravitreal injections of ranibizumab.\n\n【62】   Thinning of the cornea and sclera decreased the rigidity in the globe, and weakening of Bruch’s membrane due to abnormalities in type I collagen may have contributed to the onset of macular neovascularisation in our patient.\n\n【63】   Since fragility of the Bruch’s membrane represents the basis of onset, recurrence and relapse are likely in patients exhibited macular neovascularisation, highlighting the need for regular follow-up.\n\n【64】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【65】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【66】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Editage  for English language editing.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

She had developed a biphasic wheeze by 6 weeks of age and was given multiple diagnoses by different clinicians, including new-born wheeze and chest infection. There was no familial history of atopy or asthma. It was not until her second attendance at the emergency department that a thorough examination was conducted by a paediatrician who associated the haemangioma on her upper back with her respiratory symptoms.\n\n【22】Infantile haemangiomas (IHs) are one of the most common benign vascular tumours of infancy affecting up to 10% of children. 1 They usually develop in the head and neck region as cutaneous haemangiomas but can manifest as a paediatric upper airway infantile haemangioma (UAIH), typically in the subglottic region. 2 Our case is particularly noteworthy as the cutaneous involvement was found on the patient’s upper back. IH occurring outside of the face is rare (<19%) in the context of UAIH, and the back specifically is yet more uncommon. 3 For example, only one case in a 15-patient series by Marianowski et al was found to involve the patient’s back 4 and similarly 2 patients in the 38-patient series by Uthurriagua et al . 3\n\n【23】Due to the rarity of the UAIH, it has been difficult to draw conclusions between cutaneous haemangiomas and synchronous lesions in the upper airway. However, when there is an association between cutaneous haemangioma and UAIH, the suspicion is almost always raised with cutaneous lesions in the classical ‘beard’ distribution or with PHACES syndrome. The most high-risk skin patterns for UAIH are large segmental mandibular IH, as well as segmental IH of the lower lip and neck. 3 This case is a clear demonstration that UAIH can occur alongside non-segmental cutaneous involvement in an atypical distribution, in this case, the patient’s upper back.\n\n【24】Despite the rarity of the disease, it is important for clinicians to recognise the association between cutaneous haemangiomas and UAIH as untreated mortality rates approach 50%. 2 There are multiple treatment options for IH; propranolol (beta blocker) is now widely accepted as first-line treatment with research supporting its overall efficacy and safety. 5\n\n【25】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【26】We noticed our daughter developed a slight wheeze, at first we thought she had just caught a common cold; however, it turns out this was the first symptom of our daughter’s condition. Over the course of the 2 weeks leading up to our daughter’s diagnosis the wheeze gradually got worse and began to sound like a honking noise. Our daughter’s behaviour also changed drastically during that 2 week period, she went from being a content happy baby to screaming most of the day unless she was asleep. She was visibly working hard to breathe and became increasingly lethargic as a result. 5 days prior to her admission into PICU she also halved her daily milk intake, she went from taking 6 oz bottles to only taking 1 oz at a time. During this period, our daughter’s visible haemangioma on her back also grew significantly as I began to notice I could now feel it through her clothes as it became increasingly raised. As a mother I knew something wasn’t right and thankfully I persisted with seeking medical help until our daughter was finally diagnosed a full 2 weeks after her wheeze first appeared. We are so grateful that our daughter is recovering so well.\n\n【27】### Learning points\n\n【28】   While clinicians must be able to recognise the high-risk ‘beard’ distribution of cutaneous haemangioma with upper airway infantile haemangioma (UAIH), our case demonstrates this can occur when the cutaneous distribution is not classical.\n\n【29】   The presence of stridor and/or respiratory distress in infants with any form of cutaneous haemangioma should prompt clinicians to consider UAIH.\n\n【30】   In these cases, swift referral to an otolaryngologist and initiation of propranolol under close observation is crucial and can be life-saving.\n\n【31】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【32】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【33】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Here, we present a case of haemangioblastoma occurring in the tongue, which is the first reported case in terms of the pathogenic site. The tumour was morphologically indistinguishable from central nervous system haemangioblastoma, that is, neoplastic stromal cells with cytoplasmic vacuolisation and abundant small vessels. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the tumour cells were positive for S100, NSE, CD56, Syn, EMA, vimentin and α-inhibin, while negative for CK, SMA, factor Ⅷ, D2-40 and GFAP. Immunostainings for CD34 and CD31 outlined the rich and delicate vascular channels. Ki-67 expression was presented in approximately 3% of tumour cells. Primary haemangioblastoma has not been previously described at this site, and this case emphasises the need to consider haemangioblastoma in the differential diagnoses of neoplasms occurring in the tongue.\n\n【2】   Pathology\n   Oral and maxillofacial surgery\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Histologically, it is characterised by numerous small vessels and neoplastic stromal cells. The tumour can occur in any nervous system site, predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS), but rarely in the peripheral nervous system and extremely rare in extraneural sites. 1 Although exceedingly rare, solid haemangioblastomas arising outside the CNS have been reported and increasingly recognised, involving peripheral nerves, 2–4 retroperitoneum, 5–7 skin, 4 soft tissues such as popliteal fossa 8 9 and bone, 10 11 and visceral organs including kidney, 12–14 liver, 15 16 lung, 15 17 stomach, 18 pancreas, 19 adrenals 20 and bladder. 19 However, no cases have been reported on the site of the tongue to date. We now present a case of primary extraneural haemangioblastoma occurring in the tongue base with immunohistochemical and pathological characterisation and analysis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A Chinese man in his early 40s presented with symptoms of snoring and hoarseness for over 1 year and aggravated over the previous week. His physician found a faint red mass in the patient’s tongue base with an uneven surface in the process of routine physical examination. The tumour has no tenderness and adhesion, and the mobility is acceptable. Other general and elemental physical examinations were negative. He was born and lived in Guangdong, China. He had no relevant family history or personal medical history. Subsequently, the indirect laryngoscopy showed a mass in the left tongue base measuring approximately 1.5×1.0 cm.\n\n【12】Then, contrast-enhanced CT and MRI scans of the oropharynx and mandible showed an uneven oval mass measuring nearly 4.6×3.9 cm with a relatively clear boundary, being located in the body and left root of the tongue. CT and MRI enhancement scans also demonstrated an inhomogeneous contrast enhancement in the mass . The chest CT and ECG had no additional abnormal findings.\n\n【13】<img/>\n\n【14】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【16】CT: The lesion on the left side of the tongue (red arrow) demonstrates slightly low density on non-contrast CT scan (A) and significantly enhanced on arterial phase CT scan (B), which measures about 46×39 mm.\n\n【17】The tumour was subsequently conducted with a radical resection. The whole mass was completely sampled and routinely fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin after surgery. The tissues were embedded in paraffin. A series of 4 μm thick sections were cut from each paraffin-embedded block and stained with H&E. Three professional pathologists evaluated the slides and gave their final diagnosis.\n\n【18】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【19】### Pathological manifestations\n\n【20】The excised tissue specimen measured 5.5×4×3 cm in size with an uneven surface and locally presented nodular appearance.

Numerous thin-walled vessels that had variable sizes were prominent and stromal cells intervened in the rich capillary network . The stromal cells were oval to polygonal with various degrees of pleomorphism. The cytoplasm of these cells was eosinophilic to clear and many contained lipid vacuoles, which were the most characteristic and distinguishing morphological features of the tumour and could be seen in most regions . The nuclei of these stromal cells varied in size, with mild to moderate atypical and hyperchromatic features . Nucleolus could be found but mitotic figures were scarce .

Immunostainings for CD34 and CD31 outlined the rich and delicate vascular channels, but stromal cells showed no expression due to the lack of endothelial cell markers and endothelium-associated adhesion molecules.

Ki-67 expression was approximately 3% of tumours (G×100). CD34 staining outlined the capillary network of the tumour vasculature (H×100).\n\n【40】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【41】Histologically, haemangioblastoma consists of vast capillary blood vessels, so it is prone to be confused with vasculogenic diseases frequently, such as haemangioma, haemangioendothelioma and haemangiosarcoma. However, three main characteristics could facilitate the diagnosis: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> lacking stromal cells, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> clear or microvacuolated cytoplasm and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> related immunohistochemistry markers.\n\n【42】In addition, the most distinguishing morphological feature of haemangioblastoma is plenty of lipid-containing vacuoles, appearing in the typical clear-cell morphology, which resembles metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC). Actually, patients with VHL-associated haemangioblastoma are prone to consolidate RCC, adding to the complexity of this differential diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry is useful for distinguishing haemangioblastoma from RCC. PAX2(+) or PAX8(+) combined with α-inhibin (−) enhances the diagnosis of metastatic ccRCC while the opposite profile supports the diagnosis of haemangioblastoma. 21 Furthermore, ccRCC that presents tongue metastasis is fairly rare and the follow-up of this patient has no evidence or signs of lesions in any other sites.\n\n【43】Treatment\n---------\n\n【44】First, the initial biopsy was conducted and was suggestively diagnosed with granulation tissue-type capillary haemangioma based on the histological morphology. One week later, a radical resection of the mass in the left tongue base and mouth floor was successfully completed. The tumour was highly vascularised and demarcated from the surrounding tissues with focal slight adhesion. After surgery, the patient had an uneventful recovery under general postoperative treatment for approximately 22 days.\n\n【45】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【46】There was less facial swelling and drainage, no abnormal speech function, no abnormal mouth opening and closing function, and no abnormal neck movement after the operation. During regular follow-ups at months 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36, no evidence of recurrence or other abnormalities was observed.\n\n【47】Discussion\n----------\n\n【48】Haemangioblastoma is a benign slow-growing neoplasm that occurs both in inherited forms associated with VHL disease and more often as sporadic lesions. VHL disease is an inherited condition caused by genetic mutations of the VHL tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 3, being transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode. 21 Patients with VHL are at increased risk of developing ccRCC, capillary haemangioblastoma of the CNS and retina, phaeochromocytoma, neuroendocrine and pancreatic tumours. 22–24 Although haemangioblastomas have a characteristic association with VHL disease, a larger number of these tumours occur sporadically, typically in the cerebellum. 22 Extraneural haemangioblastomas are exceptional and usually occur in patients with VHL disease. Simultaneously, as a solitary sporadic lesion, it is increasingly recognised in extraneural sites, for instance, kidney, liver, lung, skin, adrenals, bladder, pancreas, soft tissues, stomach, bone and other locations. Nevertheless, the location in the tongue has never been reported in English literature, thus adding a new pathogenic site in that extraneural haemangioblastoma may occur.\n\n【49】Epidemiologically, haemangioblastomas mainly occur in adults, with 1:1 male to female ratio and could be reported for all ages and have even been presented as congenital solid tumour lesions. 25 Moreover, the average patient age of VHL-associated haemangioblastoma as recorded is nearly 20 years younger than that of sporadic tumour. 1\n\n【50】Histologically, haemangioblastoma comprises abundant capillary blood vessels and stromal cells with cytoplasmic vacuolisation. As mentioned above, atypical stromal cells constitute the neoplastic cell type in haemangioblastoma and they are surrounded by numerous non-neoplastic cells, including endothelial cells, lymphocytes and pericytes. However, the exact origin of stromal cells remains uncertain and controversial. Various cell lineages have been proposed, such as glial cells, 26 endothelial cells, 27 arachnoid cells, 28 embryonic choroid plexus cells 29 and fibro histiocytic cells. 30 Ponnaluri et al have illustrated that the tumourlet-like stromal cells have both the proangiogenic and stem cell markers, which occur in optic nerve haemangioblastomas and retinal haemangioblastomas. The finding above highly suggested that haemangioblastomas may derive from stem cells or embryonic development. 31 Additionally, other recent studies have demonstrated the hypothesis that the morphology of the tumour is the result of reactive angiogenesis with paracrine signalling pathway caused by deficient VHL tumour suppressor protein HIF1A-expressing stromal cells. 32 However, these theories are better presented only in VHL-associated haemangioblastoma other than sporadic lesions in extraneural locations. Therefore, further research should be done to explore the histogenetic principles and origin of the tumour mass.\n\n【51】As for the prognosis of this tumour, Cheng et al revealed that only 4 out of 23 (17.4%) patients with CNS haemangioblastoma presented local recurrence during the follow-up. 33 Recurrence of extraneural sporadic haemangioblastomas has never been reported after a thorough search. Patients with solitary sporadic tumours have a better outcome than those in the setting of VHL disease because the latter condition is prone to merge multiple lesions. 34 In our case, the patient is alive and in a healthy condition 3 years later without any haematological and image findings of recurrence or metastasis after the therapeutic strategy of the total tumour resection. And further regular follow-ups would be conducted to detect the local and distant recurrence, even if the biological behaviour is benign and the tumour mass is resected.\n\n【52】### Learning points\n\n【53】   Extraneural sporadic haemangioblastoma may occur in the tongue, which is a completely new pathogenic site proposed up to now.\n\n【54】   Morphological manifestation and immunohistochemical analysis are pivotal in the differential diagnosis of haemangioblastoma with other vasculogenic diseases.\n\n【55】   Haemangioblastoma without atypia histological features suggests a good prognosis.\n\n【56】   Patients with solitary sporadic tumours have a better outcome than those in the setting of von Hippel-Lindau disease because the latter condition is prone to merge multiple lesions.\n\n【57】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【58】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【59】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Real-time intraoperative guidance such as neuromonitoring can substantially improve the safety and efficacy of spinal surgery. 1\n\n【5】A 32-year-old man, case of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), Nurick’s grade 3 with focal ossified posterior longitudinal ligament at C6, American Society of Anaesthesiologist grade 1, was posted for single-level corpectomy. The patient has a heart rate (HR) of 60/min and blood pressure of 110/80 mm Hg on the right arm. The surgery went on smoothly, but postsurgery, we noted that he had increased tonicity in his bilateral lower limb and had bradycardia. An urgent CT scan showed a loose piece of bone impinging the cord . However, any signs of lateralisation were absent. The next day, an emergent re-exploration was done, and the anaesthesia workstation monitor showed a pulse rate of range 46–48/min . The piece was challenging to localise intraoperatively. However, the corpectomy window was enlarged, and a suspected bony part adhered to the duramater was removed. As we started the closure with lots of anxiety and fingers crossed, we noted a change in the HR that increased to 90/min, as shown in the monitor . This was the subtle indicator of a successful surgery, and our anaesthesia monitor guided us akin to intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM). A repeat postoperative CT confirmed the excision of the bony piece , and the patient had a dramatic improvement in his tone the following day.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【9】(A) CT scan showing the bone piece impinging the spinal cord .

(B) CT scan after removing a bone piece.\n\n【14】The goal of any spinal surgery is preventing further neurological deterioration, although achieving some functional recovery. 2 3 IONM is integral in predicting intraoperative cervical cord function changes in CSM. 4 Severe compression of the descending motor tracts can be picked up as abnormalities of the intraoperative motor evoked potentials (MEPs) by IONM. 3 But today’s IONM has multiple neuromonitoring modalities that include somatosensory evoked potentials, MEPs, spontaneous electromyography and triggered electromyography. A careful interpretation of these combined modalities can maximise the sensitivity and specificity in detecting impending neural injury. 5 In developing countries, the universal availability of the IONM is a significant limitation, especially in the emergency theatre. 6–8 But, the anaesthesia monitoring is routine in all cases. A visible documented change can be satisfying to the whole surgical team when there are no other ways to confirm intraoperatively. We had not kept an image of the preoperative anaesthesia monitor findings during the revision surgery, but we retrieved the old readings once we observed an improvement. The purpose of the article is to highlight this critical finding wherein our ‘regular’ anaesthesia monitor saved our day.\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】   Intraoperative neuromonitoring is valuable in operating complex spine surgery.\n\n【17】   The role in cervical myelopathy may be beneficial, but it is not widely available in all set-ups.\n\n【18】   A regular anaesthesia monitor can provide subtle hints for the successful completion of decompression.\n\n【19】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【20】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【21】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

During her admission on the neonatal unit, she presented on day 68 with a swelling of the right cheek . At the time, she was establishing feeds with expressed breast milk, through a combination of nasogastric tube and exclusive bottle feeds. There was a background of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, requiring nasal cannula oxygen. The swelling extended from the tragus of the right ear to mid-cheek and the inferior angle of the mandible. The area was slightly erythematous, warm, indurated and tender. There was no involvement of adjacent lymph nodes or the external auditory canal, which showed a normal tympanic membrane appearance and no discharge. Examination of the oral cavity revealed a yellow purulent discharge at the opening of the right Stensen’s duct, when the parotid gland was massaged. A clinical diagnosis of acute suppurative parotitis was made. This was confirmed on ultrasound scan imaging of the parotid glands, which showed hypoechoic areas with heterogeneous echotexture and increased vascularity, indicating an acute inflammation .\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】The infant with swelling on the right side of the face.\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【12】Ultrasound scan image of parotid glands.\n\n【13】The infant received 10 days of intravenous flucloxacillin, gentamicin and metronidazole, along with analgesia in the first 2 days. This combination of antimicrobial therapy provides cover for potential staphylococcal species, Gram-negative organisms and anaerobic organisms. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common organisms implicated in late-onset neonatal sepsis and parotitis. There was no history of mastitis in the mother. The dosage regime administered was as per neonatal formulary, in accordance with the corrected age of the infant. The maxillofacial team advised conservative treatment as no abscess was noted on imaging. The infant’s C reactive protein peaked at 108 mg/L. There was no rise in serum amylase level. Blood culture showed no growth. The purulent discharge from Stensen’s duct showed a heavy growth of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus , Enterococcus spp and viridans-type streptococci. There was clinical and biochemical resolution by 5 days. A repeat ultrasound scan undertaken 5 days after completing antibiotics revealed sequelae of previous parotitis. She was discharged home from the neonatal unit at 3 months of age.\n\n【14】Isolated suppurative sialadenitis in neonates is a rare entity. The parotid glands are more commonly affected due to the serous nature of their secretions. In contrast, the secretions of the submandibular and sublingual glands are more mucoid and bacteriostatic in nature. 1 Prematurity is a recognised risk factor for this condition, in view of the potential for dehydration, malnutrition, immunosuppression and tube feeds predisposing to salivary stasis. There is a higher incidence in male infants. 2–4 Some case reports describe healthy term infants also being affected. Infection is usually unilateral and thought to be retrograde through the salivary ducts following ascending infection from the oral cavity, although haematogenous seeding following bacteraemia has also been described. 1 3 Diagnosis is mainly clinical, supplemented by inflammatory markers. Extrusion of pus from Stensen’s duct is pathognomonic of suppurative parotitis. 1 Fever and raised serum amylase levels are uncommon findings in this age group. 1 3 A number of microorganisms have been implicated, the most common being S. aureus . Imaging is important for confirming the diagnosis, directing management, and excluding complications or other structural issues. Prognosis is generally good and prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotic cover prevents abscess formation. 4 Recurrence rates are low and possible complications include osteomyelitis, salivary fistula, facial palsy, extension to the external auditory canal, mediastinitis and subsequent respiratory distress. 1 4\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】   Infants presenting with a facial swelling should have a thorough examination, including that of the oral cavity, draining lymph nodes and the ears. There should be a high index of suspicion for sialadenitis, as fever may be absent and inflammatory markers may be non-specific.\n\n【17】   Consider ultrasound imaging to help confirm diagnosis and exclude any abscess formation, but there should not be any delay in commencing intravenous antibiotics when clinical suspicion is high.\n\n【18】   Prognosis is usually good and recurrence rates are very low. Prompt management involving antimicrobial therapy (including cover for anaerobic organisms) is the mainstay of treatment.\n\n【19】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【20】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【21】Parental/guardian consent obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

There is also evidence of non-opacification of the inferior sagittal sinus and anterior portion of the superior sagittal sinus (white arrow). DVA, deep venous anomaly; DSA, digital subtraction angiography.\n\n【14】Ethanol/setrol sclerotherapy and/or surgery are the usual treatment options for these malformations. However, in our case, the vascular channels along the forehead and supraorbital region were the sole drainage pathway for the anterior cranial fossa structures, hence they were not embolised and the patient was kept on conservative management.\n\n【15】CVMS is a complex craniofacial vascular malformation in which the patient presents with a myriad of venous vascular malformations, which may affect bone, the dura, soft tissues and neural structures including the ocular globe and brain. 1 CVMS can present with a constellation of imaging findings including metameric distribution of slow-flow vascular malformations along craniofacial planes, DVA, cavernomas, dural sinus aberrations and cavernous haemangiomas. 2\n\n【16】The abnormality is thought to be caused by somatic mutations occurring prior to the migration of neural crest cells, which can lead to various venous abnormalities along the facial, osseous and cerebral planes which follow a segmental or ‘metameric’ distribution. 3\n\n【17】CVMS is classified into three groups: medial prosencephalic (olfactory) which involve the forehead, nose, corpus callosum, hypothalamus and hypophysis (CVMS 1); lateral prosencephalic (optic) which involve the temporo-parietal-occipital lobes, retina, optic nerve, eye, thalamus, maxilla and cheek (CVMS 2) and rhombencephalic/mesencephalon (otic) which affect the cerebellum, brainstem, lower face, mandible, petrous bone, and maxilla (CVMS 3). 4\n\n【18】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【19】I was suffering from a swelling in the forehead since childhood. The persistent swelling led to loss of self-esteem and lack of confidence. My family consulted many doctors in the last 15-20 years, but we failed to arrive at any conclusive diagnosis. This led to a lot of apprehension as to whether this condition was life threatening or only a cosmetic problem. I started to feel depressed which affected my academic, social, personal and professional life. Doctors here conducted a few tests and enlightened me about my condition. They explained and reassured me that this is not a life hindering situation and that I should not let this affect my dayto-day activities. It feels much better to finally know what the diagnosis is and it gives me closure about the nature of my condition.\n\n【20】### Learning points\n\n【21】   Cerebrofacial venous metameric syndrome is a clinicoradiological diagnosis.\n\n【22】   Anatomical delineation of the venous drainage pathway is important in deciding treatment approach, that is, conservative versus endovascular/surgical intervention for these patients.\n\n【23】   If the normal drainage pathway of brain parenchyma is absent, then endovascular/surgical closure of the abnormal venous channels can lead to venous hypertension and intracranial venous bleeds. Therefore, conservative management and regular follow-up is recommended in these cases.\n\n【24】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【25】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【26】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The department of intervention radiology at Medanta has been extremely supportive in coordinating the scans for this patient.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

He fell forward after hitting a pothole while riding his bike. He initially presented with pain exacerbated by range of motion of the right shoulder that improved with rest. His symptoms were unchanged with deep breaths, and he denied any current shortness of breath, abdominal pain or neurological symptoms. His vital signs were significant for tachycardia to 108 beats per minute, but he was oxygenating at 98% on room air with a normal blood pressure and respiratory rate. His physical examination was significant for a deformity with tenderness to palpation over the right clavicle. He had normal neck range of motion without tenderness to palpation of the cervical spine. His right upper extremity was neurovascularly intact including over the distribution of the axillary nerve. He had decreased range of motion of the right shoulder in all directions. The patient underwent plain radiography series of the clavicle, shown in figure 1 .

Because midshaft clavicle fractures are common, associated medial and lateral portions of a segmental clavicle fractures may be missed. 1 5 With a clinical concern but unclear plain radiography findings, CT scan of the clavicle may be ordered to further evaluate for subtle fractures or for surgical planning. 5\n\n【15】<img/>\n\n【16】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3</u>\n\n【18】Anatomical diagram of the shoulder with associated neurovascular structures. Segmental clavicle fractures can occur as a result of a direct trauma  such as colliding with a pole or assault with an object. Another possible mechanism is the result of a fall to the ground on an adducted shoulder (typical mechanism for midshaft clavicle fractures). It is speculated that a combination of direct force on the point of shoulder girdle (green arrow) and an indirect force from behind the shoulder causing anterior movement of the lateral shoulder (blue arrow) may also cause segmental clavicle fractures.\n\n【19】The teaching point in this case is that while the midshaft fracture garners attention, it is the lateral third fracture which is most concerning. While midshaft fractures historically have often been treated conservatively, the literature increasingly indicates that lateral clavicle fractures may benefit from surgical stabilisation. 1 3 5 7 8 10 11\n\n【20】When serving as a provider in a trauma centre, urgent care clinic or emergency room, injuries of this nature do require careful evaluation of the lungs, chest and spine.

Careful neurological, vascular and cardiopulmonary evaluation are essential.\n\n【21】### Learning points\n\n【22】   Although, sport-related clavicle fractures are common, segmental fractures are rare.\n\n【23】   Segmental clavicle fractures should alert the clinician to other possible mechanisms of injury than a simple fall.\n\n【24】   Associated injuries to the shoulders, ribs, chest wall, lungs, pericardium and spinal column should be considered.\n\n【25】   Due to the unstable nature of segmental clavicle fractures, referral to orthopaedic surgery for surgical fixation is typically recommended.\n\n【26】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【27】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【28】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The rash started 5 days after he self-administered a dose of insulin glargine that was 3 months beyond the expiration date. The rash started as pruriginous hives in the chest and spread to the extremities and head as a maculopapular rash with flaking. He denied any previous history of skin disease or malignancy. The patient’s home medications included apixaban, insulin glargine, chlorthalidone, ergocalciferol, fenofibrate, levothyroxine and valsartan. He had no allergies to medications, and he denied smoking, drinking alcohol or the use of recreational drugs.\n\n【5】On arrival to the emergency room, his vital signs were as follows: temperature 37°C, heart rate 108 beats per minute, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute and blood pressure 135/68 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were normal. Skin examination revealed diffuse scaly desquamating pink plaques covering the whole body and head including scalp but sparing the face . Left-sided supraclavicular and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy were palpable. There was no nail pitting, hair loss, joint pain or swelling. Oral mucosa was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations were significant for a glucose of 383 mg/dL, C reactive protein of 2.5 mg/dL and white cell count 177××10 <sup>9 </sup> /L with 1.6% eosinophils. Antinuclear antibody showed a fine granular and speckled pattern with a titter of 1:160. HIV, syphilis serology, and Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 and HTLV-2 were negative. CT scan with intravenous contrast of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no evidence of malignancy but mildly prominent bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, presumed to be reactive. Multiple skin biopsies revealed superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, dilated and tortuous capillaries in multiple dermal papillae, psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, thin suprapapillary plates and broad mounds of parakeratosis . Immunohistochemistry showed lymphocytes to be predominantly CD3 positive T cells with CD4>CD8, retention of CD7, and CD20 showed a normal distribution of B cells, consistent with psoriasis. No evidence of cutaneous lymphoma was identified.

One week after discharge, the patient was readmitted for intravenous antibiotic treatment of otitis externa. At that time, he did not manifest a new or worsening rash. A perusal review of the literature did not show an association between EP and any of the patient’s home medications. The Naranjo probability scale was used to evaluate the adverse drug reaction. In our patient, the score was at least 7 or higher because some of the evaluations were not able to be performed. Our patient had self-administered a single dose of expired insulin glargine, and we did not repeat the administration, use a placebo, or detect the concentration in blood because he was already on insulin in the hospital. Therefore, we further postulated that expired insulin glargine was responsible for the induction of EP.\n\n【19】EP is rare and severe, only accounting for 1%–2.24% of psoriatic patients. 1 The common presentation is typically erythema, oedema, pruritus, ill-defined psoriatic plaques, scaling, hair loss, and rarely exudative lesions and palmoplantar or diffuse desquamation. 1 There have been several potential causes of EP. These range from environmental due to trauma, sunburn, alcoholism or infection; chemical reactions from CT contrast, topical tar; and systemic illness with HIV, leukaemia, lymphoma and gout. Medications such as lithium, bupropion, antimalarials, infliximab; discontinuing steroids, methotrexate and efalizumab have been associated with EP. 1 There is no previous description of EP associated with expired insulin glargine administration. The use of systemic glucocorticoids for EP is discouraged due to their ability to trigger severe psoriasis flares; however, this did not occur in our patient. Our patient was successfully treated with topical steroids and cyclosporine.\n\n【20】The exact pathogenesis of EP is not well understood. The disease is associated with predominantly T helper (Th) 2 expression from studies demonstrating increased levels of IgE in patients with EP. There is a switch from Th1 to Th2 dominant. 2 Type 1 IgE mediated has been the most reported type of hypersensitivity reaction to insulin but type 3 and type 4 can also occur. The presentation for insulin hypersensitivity typically ranges from a local erythema and swelling at the injection site to generalised reactions like urticaria and angioedema which does not match this patient’s presenting symptoms. 3 We believe this is the first report documenting a relationship between expired insulin and EP. The patient was advised about the correct use of medications before he was discharged.\n\n【21】### Learning points\n\n【22】   Erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) should be suspected in a patient with a generalised cutaneous finding of erythema, oedema and pruritus after administration of expired insulin.\n\n【23】   EP treatment with topical triamcinolone acetonide and oral cyclosporine is considered a better treatment option in diabetics to prevent further hyperglycaemia produced by systemic steroids.\n\n【24】   Patient education regarding complications of insulin use should be addressed at all appointments.\n\n【25】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【26】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【27】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Microscopically it mimics some malignant vascular tumours and it is necessary to differentiate it from other malignant vascular lesions. We report a case of SCH in anterior mandibular region of a young male in his 20s. Although it is a benign lesion, the reported case displayed extensive areas of muscle infiltration and necrosis.

Now, according to the classification International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies 通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u>, it has been included under the category of benign vascular tumours. 3\n\n【8】SCH can occur either sporadically or in association with syndromic disorders (10% of cases) such as Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber, Maffucci, epithelioid haemangioendothelioma, early onset varicose veins, lymphoedema and superficial cutaneous lymphatic malformations. 1 4 It mainly affects the distal extremities, but may occur at other sites such as the chest wall, genital area, head and neck region. It has been rarely reported in oral cavity. Microscopically, it is characterised by presence of cavernous vascular channels and spindle cell proliferation. 4\n\n【9】Here, we describe a case of SCH in mandibular anterior region of a young male. To the best of our knowledge, this is the eleventh case of SCH reported in the oral cavity.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A male in his 20s reported to our clinic with a primary symptom of swelling in the chin region noticed over 2 years. On intraoral examination, firm, well-defined, compressible, irreducible, non-fluctuant, painless and non-pulsatile swelling of size 3×3 cm was palpated in mandibular labial vestibule.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】On radiographic examination, MR angiography revealed lobulated hyperintense lesion showing postcontrast enhancement in the subcutaneous plane of the submental region in midline. Lesion was extending to the right side with multiple tortuous vascular channels, suggestive of a vascular malformation. MRI (T2-weighted sequences) revealed mildly hyperintense lesion, which led to scalloping and thinning of outer cortex of mandible. The appearance was suggestive of a soft tissue tumour, possibly of vascular origin . Ultrasonography showed well-defined echogenic lesion measuring approximately 3.6×1.9 cm nestled in the subcutaneous plane of the right side of chin. It displayed a bunch of vessels with predominantly low resistance arterial flow evident on doppler imaging . Based on clinical and radiological information, a series of differential diagnosis were considered including haemangioma/vascular tumour, peripheral giant cell lesion, pyogenic granuloma, peripheral ossifying fibroma and other mesenchymal tumours such as neurofibroma and schwannoma.\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【17】(A) MRI face-axial T2-weighted image shows a lobulated lesion in the subcutaneous plane of the chin, slightly to the right of the midline. Lesion is of intermediate signal intensity with few internal flow voids (arrow). The posterior margin is not well defined and is causing scalloping and mild thinning of the cortex of the underlying bone (open arrow). (B) Postcontrast T1-weighted image shows the moderate postcontrast enhancement (arrow). (C) Sagittal ultrasonography image reveals a heterogenous, solid lesion in the subcutaneous plane. The mass is predominantly echogenic with linear anechoic areas (arrow) which show colour flow on Doppler evaluation. (D) Power Doppler evaluation shows the markedly increased vascularity (arrow) within the lesion.\n\n【18】The macroscopic examination of the excised lesion showed dark brown tissue and was firm in consistency . On light microscopy study, the lesional tissue was composed of variably sized blood vessels, budding capillaries and highly cellular areas. The tumour cells were seen infiltrating the muscle and adipose tissue. Cellular areas consisted of spindle shaped tumour cells with vesicular to hyperchromatic nuclei and a few regions showed epithelioid tumour cells with enlarged vesicular nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. The multiple, thin walled blood filled spaces lined by endothelial cells were seen, engorged with red blood cells and eosinophilic material. Stroma showed mild chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate interspersed with areas of necrosis and haemorrhage. Tumour cells were immunopositive for CD31 and CD34 . Based on the radiological and histopathological features, the final diagnosis of spindle cell haemangioma was tendered.\n\n【19】<img/>\n\n【20】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【22】Gross specimen.

(D) Cellular areas were consisting of spindle shaped tumour cells and variably sized blood vessels. (E and F) Tumour cells were immunopositive for CD34 and CD31, respectively.\n\n【27】Treatment\n---------\n\n【28】After the discussion with multidisciplinary team and considering the high vascularity of the lesion and young age, the lesion was removed surgically followed by electrocauterisation to avoid inadvertent bleeding under general anaesthesia. The overlying mucosa was excised. The borders of the lesion were demarcated in a meticulous manner by dissecting around the lesion followed by its complete removal. As the posterior margin was not easily discernible, the periosteum attached to the lesion was removed in this region.\n\n【29】Since the recurrence rate of head and neck SCH is low as compared with cutaneous SCH, 5 6 surgical excision was performed, which is considered as the standard treatment. Follow-up at 8 months revealed no recurrence of the lesion.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】Oral pathologists may be unfamiliar with the histopathological features of SCH in view of the rarity of its occurrence in the oral cavity. SCH is a slow growing tumour; presenting as dermal or subcutaneous nodules and mainly affects the distal extremities. Superficial lesions appear bluish while the deeper lesions appear skin coloured due to the difference in the thickness of skin cover over the lesion. SCH mostly occur in middle-aged patients but may appear at any age 1 4 7 ( table 1 )\n\n【32】View this table:\n\n【33】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【34】Table 1\n\n【35】Review of literature showing spindle cell haemangioma of oral cavity since 1995–2021\n\n【36】Clinically, it presents as solitary or multiple subcutaneous nodules, so it could be considered in the differential diagnosis of benign soft tissue tumours. Published literature suggests that majority of cases occur in adult population. The mean age of occurrence is in the fourth decade with two cases reported from a younger population. 5 8 Male to female ratio was 1.2:1. The maximum reported size of the lesion was 3 cm and the longest duration of lesion existence prior to its diagnosis was reported as 5 years. 6 Approximately 10% of cases were associated with some inherited syndromes. Cai et al reported a case of SCH of lower lip in a 34 years female associated with Maffucci syndrome. 9\n\n【37】Microscopically, it presents as well-circumscribed mass surrounded by fibrous connective tissue showing a range of cellularity, imparting it a lobular architecture. 10 Variably sized blood vessels along with solid cellular areas are recognised as characteristic features. Solid cellular areas consist of spindle shaped cells with plump vesicular to hyperchromatic nuclei with some regions also showing epithelioid shaped endothelial cells. Vascular cavernous spaces are lined by endothelial cells and also contain erythrocytes. 1 11 Similar features were found in our case. Additionally, there was evidence of muscle and adipose tissue infiltration with a few areas of necrosis and the lesion lacked a definite capsule. However, prominent cytological atypia and mitotic figures were absent. It is necessary to differentiate SCH from other vascular tumours such as Kaposi sarcoma and angiosarcoma because the latter are malignant lesions. 7 In SCH, the presence of phleboliths in cavernous vessels and plump endothelial cells can differentiate it histologically from Kaposi’s sarcoma. Slit-spaces can be seen in Kaposi’s sarcoma, but it is not a prominent feature of SCH. Ancillary methods like immunohistochemistry are very useful to differentiate SCH from Kaposi’s sarcoma. Human herpesvirus 8 positivity is found in Kaposi’s sarcoma but is absent in SCH. Histologically, a lack of infiltrative growth pattern, significant nuclear atypia, high mitotic rate and atypical mitotic figures differentiate SCH from angiosarcoma. 12 On immunohistochemical analysis, CD31 and CD34 markers are helpful to deduce the origin of tumour cells in SCH. Along with these, IHC positivity for factor VIII and SMA is also present in SCH and can help in its diagnosis. 4 7 13\n\n【38】Clinical and radiological characterisation of vascular anomalies of the head and neck is necessary for guiding the appropriate treatment. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for the management of head and neck vascular anomalies. Spectral and colour Doppler ultrasonography and dynamic time resolved MR angiography are helpful to differentiate high and low flow vascular anomalies. Embolisation and sclerotherapy are the primary treatment options for these vascular lesions. 14 Nair et al described a simplified algorithm for effective management of vascular lesions requiring surgery. 15\n\n【39】SCH is a rare benign vascular tumour of oral cavity and histologically it mimics some malignant vascular tumours. Therefore, it is essential to recognise this entity to avoid misdiagnosis and to differentiate it from other malignant vascular lesions.\n\n【40】### Learning points\n\n【41】   Spindle cell haemangioma (SCH) is a rare slow growing benign vascular tumour.\n\n【42】   Present report is the eleventh case of SCH reported in oral cavity.\n\n【43】   Histopathologically, it mimics some malignant vascular tumours, which need to be carefully excluded to avoid misdiagnosis.\n\n【44】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【45】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【46】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Physical examination revealed numerous thick hyperkeratotic plaques measuring 10–20 mm located on the forearms and shins with firmly adherent scales over fingers and toes bilaterally with pinpoint capillary bleeding indicative of positive Auspitz sign, in addition to perioral scaly erythematous rash . Her skin lesions initially started 9 months prior to her current presentation. She was treated with triamcinolone 0.1% cream two times per day, which was changed to clobetasol ointment 0.05% two times per day with no significant response. Her altered mental status was attributed to an acute exacerbation of COPD. She was started on intravenous methylprednisolone three times a day as part of the management of COPD exacerbation and hydrocortisone 1% ointment two times per day for dermatitis with no significant improvement of her skin lesions. Histopathological examination of her skin biopsies demonstrated an irregularly acanthotic epidermis with slight spongiosis, psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, hyperkeratosis and confluent parakeratosis with neutrophilic collections . A preliminary diagnosis of rupioid psoriasis versus acrokeratosis paraneoplastica was made. There was a concern for a potential underlying internal malignancy given the classification of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica a paraneoplastic dermatosis. She had a family history of type 2 diabetes, breast and colon cancer, asthma, COPD and coronary arterial disease. Therefore, CT of the chest and abdomen and esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed with negative findings for any underlying neoplasia. A final diagnosis of rupioid psoriasis was made and due to the lack of response to topical and systemic steroids, she was started on 0.1% tacrolimus cream applied to bilateral upper and lower extremities two times per day with significant improvement of her skin lesions within 2 days.

Eventually, in the advanced stages, psoriasiform plaques can extend centripetally affecting both extremities and the trunk. 6 Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica is usually associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the aerodigestive tracts, especially in the initial stages when a tumour is not apparent. Histopathology findings can be non-specific including hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, spongiosis and perivascular infiltration as in our case.

Early detection of thyroid storm is the key to decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. We present a rare case of thyroid storm induced by combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab in a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because of prominent hyperthyroidism with gastrointestinal symptoms and signs of heart failure, the patient was diagnosed with thyroid storm 3 weeks after initiating this combination immunotherapy. The patient had no history of thyroid disease but was positive for antithyroid antibodies. This case report suggests that thyroid function and symptoms of suspected thyroid storm should be evaluated routinely within 3 weeks from the initiation of therapy when combination therapy is administered in patients with NSCLC positive for antithyroid antibodies.\n\n【2】   Endocrine system\n   Thyroid disease\n   Lung cancer (oncology)\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

The ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody acting against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte 4 (CTLA-4), and nivolumab is a human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody. Combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab has demonstrated consistent efficacy in patients with advanced NSCLC. However, the incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including endocrine disorders such as pituitary and thyroid dysfunctions, has been an important issue with ICI treatment. The nivolumab and ipilimumab have notably similar irAE incidence rates. An increase in irAE incidence rate is observed when these drugs are administered in combination. According to a systematic review, the incidence rate of hyperthyroidism was observed to be 8% (34/407) in patients with advanced solid tumours. 1 According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V.5.0, the severity of thyroid dysfunction is low, 2 and there has been only one reported case of thyroid storm in a patient with advanced melanoma induced by combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab. 3\n\n【10】A previous study suggested that the risk of thyroid dysfunction induced by anti-PD-1 therapy can be increased in patients positive for antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) and/or antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) before treatment. 4\n\n【11】We have reported a rare case of thyroid storm in a patient with advanced NSCLC receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】The patient was a woman in her 70s with advanced NSCLC. The chief complaints were dyspnoea on exertion and left-sided chest pain. Chest CT revealed a mass lesion in the left upper lung, and a bronchoscopy was performed. Based on the results of positron emission tomography-CT and contrast-enhanced MRI of the head, the patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, cT4N3M0, stage IIIC; genetic testing revealed no driver gene mutations, and the programmed death ligand-1 expression rate (22c3) was less than 1%. The patient’s Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) was 1. She was admitted to our hospital and combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab was initiated. Although the patient was positive for TgAb before chemotherapy, all other thyroid function test results were normal. She was asymptomatic and had never been diagnosed with thyroid goitre. After initial treatment, nausea (grade 1) and sinus tachycardia (grade 1) were observed on days 5 and 10, respectively. The treatment course was otherwise uneventful, and the second course of nivolumab was administered on day 21 after the initiation of treatment. The patient’s general condition was stable, and she was discharged 24 days after treatment initiation. However, on the day after discharge, she was rushed to the emergency room because of dyspnoea, nausea and cold sweats. The patient was tachycardic at 131 beats per minute and agitated, with symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Her blood pressure was 103/74 mm Hg, and her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15. Most notably, no thyromegaly, exophthalmos,or thyroid tenderness were appreciable on physical examination. The Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS) score was 50. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for thyroid storm management after endocrinology and cardiology consultation.\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】The initial complete blood count was normal, but the C reactive protein level was slightly high. Blood cultures were found to be negative after 48 hours. An echocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, and the N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide levels were also high. The patient’s thyroid function test results on the day of presentation were as follows: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 0.01 μIU/mL; free thyroxine (FT4), 7.2 ng/dL; and free triiodothyronine (FT3), 16.0 pg/mL ( table 1 ).\n\n【16】View this table:\n\n【17】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【18】Table 1\n\n【19】Summary of laboratory test results taken before chemotherapy and on admission\n\n【20】Her thyroid function test results prior to initial combination treatment were as follows: TSH, 1.51 μIU/mL; FT4, 1.3 ng/dL; and FT3, 3.3 pg/mL. However, her thyroid peroxidase immunoglobulin levels were normal, and TgAbs were positive at 106 IU/mL ( table 1 ). Chest radiography revealed a new left pleural effusion.\n\n【21】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【22】The patient exhibited several signs and symptoms of thyroid storm based on the BWPS diagnostic criteria for thyroid storm, including agitation, nausea with vomiting, tachycardia, fever and history of nivolumab and ipilimumab treatment. Differential diagnoses included medication-induced thyroid storm, Graves’ disease, thyroiditis, thyroid adenoma, toxic multinodular goitre and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. We considered Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s disease to be less likely based on the negative results for thyrotropin receptor autoantibodies and TPOAb. The chest CT scan showed neither adenoma nor goitre before chemotherapy. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis was an immune-mediated thyroid storm. The clinical course of the thyroid function tests before and after the initially combined immunotherapy supported this diagnosis .\n\n【23】<img/>\n\n【24】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【25】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【26】Changes in thyroid function tests over the course of treatment. Day 25 represents the day from initiation of chemotherapy. FT4, free thyroxine; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone.\n\n【27】Treatment\n---------\n\n【28】The patient was admitted to the ICU for a thyroid storm and was initiated on propranolol (20 mg per day) and landiolol (750 mg per day) to achieve appropriate control of her heart rate. Hydrocortisone (100 mg every 8 hour) and potassium iodide (200 mg per day) were also administered. Antithyroid drugs were not administered because anti-TSH receptor antibodies were negative and the cause of the thyroid storm was considered to be drug-induced destructive thyroiditis. 5 On day 2, she was febrile up to 40°C and exhibited signs of heart failure, therefore, she was initiated on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. On day 3, her general condition worsened, resulting in a further decline in cardiac function and circulatory failure despite treatment; therefore, norepinephrine therapy was started, and respiratory management was switched to invasive positive pressure ventilation. As acute renal failure was also observed, continuous haemodiafiltration was initiated to prevent her clinical condition from worsening. As a result of continued intensive management, thyroid function gradually recovered, and cardiac function improved accordingly. As her respiratory condition stabilised, she was extubated 9 days after intubation. The patient’s thyroid function improved over time and remained within the normal range; thus, thyroid medication was not administered.\n\n【29】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【30】After discharge from the ICU, rehabilitation was initiated to improve activities of daily living. However, her ECOG PS only improved by 3, and chemotherapy for NSCLC was terminated. She was discharged on day 40 after admission, and palliative care was continued at home.\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】This case report is an example of a nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy-induced immune-mediated thyroid storm, which occurred within 3 weeks of treatment initiation. The clinical diagnosis of thyroid storm was confirmed by the BWPS system. This scale system assigns points in seven domains among five categories of thermoregulatory dysfunction, central nervous system effects, gastrointestinal-hepatic dysfunction, cardiovascular dysfunction and precipitant history. Scores were added, and scores of 45 or greater were considered highly suggestive of a thyroid storm. 6 Our patient’s score was 50 on presentation.\n\n【33】A notable point, in this case, was that the patient was positive for antithyroid antibodies. The incidence of thyroid dysfunction in patients positive for thyroid antibodies is high. Okada et al reported that the incidence of thyroid dysfunction, including destructive thyroiditis and hypothyroidism, was higher in the thyroid autoantibody-positive group than in the autoantibody-negative group. It was also reported that the presence of TgAb or TPOAb or both at baseline was a general risk factor for immunotherapy-induced thyroid dysfunction. 4\n\n【34】On searching several databases, we found only one case report in which ipilimumab and nivolumab combination induced thyroid storm in a patient receiving immunotherapy for advanced melanoma. In that case, the patient was negative for antithyroid antibodies but developed a thyroid storm 21 days after initiation of the combination therapy.\n\n【35】The combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies has been reported to increase the incidence of thyroid dysfunction and shorten the time for the onset of thyroid dysfunction. Iyer et al reported that the median time to thyrotoxicosis after treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab combination was 2 weeks, whereas that with nivolumab monotherapy was 6 weeks. 7\n\n【36】To summarise, we have reported a rare case of nivolumab and ipilimumab combination-induced thyroid storm. When combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy is administered in patients who are positive for antithyroid antibodies, it is desirable to perform thyroid function tests every 2 weeks, if possible. It may also be beneficial to monitor the thyroid function every 3 weeks after anti-PD-1 antibody administration because of the risk of development of thyroid-related adverse events in the early phase.\n\n【37】### Learning points\n\n【38】   Combined nivolumab and ipilimumab immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an effective treatment, but it should be recognised that severe immune-related adverse events, such as thyroid storm, may be present.\n\n【39】   In patients with positive antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) or antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) or both, consultation with an endocrinologist is recommended before initiating nivolumab plus ipilimumab, even if there is no history of thyroid disease.\n\n【40】   In patients with NSCLC positive for TgAbs or TPOAbs or both, treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy, thyroid function and symptoms of suspected thyroid storm should be monitored every 2 or 3 weeks.\n\n【41】   When nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy is administered, confirmation of thyroid function before the second course of nivolumab treatment is recommended.\n\n【42】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【43】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【44】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

This case report demonstrates the importance of ruling out this condition before subjecting patients with invasive procedures that might bring more harm than benefit for the patient.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A man in his 20s with underlying chemorefractory primary T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was admitted to the ward for disease progression. He had a fall 2 days earlier and had a body weakness and lethargy. After a few days in the ward and initiation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, he developed sudden acute chest pain, which was compressing in nature, which does not relieve on rest. On examination, he was alert but distressed. His blood pressure was 92/55 mm Hg, with a pulse rate of 96 per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.\n\n【14】He was diagnosed with primary T-cell lymphoma 2 years ago after having generalised neck and groin swelling accompanied with constitutional symptoms. Lymph node biopsy was done confirming the disease. His disease was chemorefractory after failed second line of chemotherapy, hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin) and ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) regimen. The latest PET-CT (positron emission tomography and computed tomography) scan 3 months earlier showed disease progression. He had no history of bronchial asthma, no known drug and food allergies, and no signs and symptoms of parasitic infection.\n\n【15】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【16】ECG on episode of chest pain showed diffused ST depression over inferolateral leads with dynamic changes, as compared with baseline ECG which was normal . High sensitivity cardiac troponin-I was elevated, 2718 pg/mL. His full blood count showed normocytic normochromic anaemia with haemoglobin of 71 g/L, platelet count of 14×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and markedly elevated absolute eosinophil count of 51.9×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (normal range 0.02–0.5×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) which was 73% of the leucocyte count. His baseline eosinophil count before he was diagnosed with lymphoma was 0.8×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. COVID PCR was negative.

Antithrombotic therapy was not started in view of the severe thrombocytopenia. He was transfused with one unit of packed red cells and multiple units of apheresis platelets. After formal consultation with cardiology was done, echocardiography was ordered and showed diffused thrombus deposition over the endocardium with preserved left ejection fraction of 65% with no regional wall motion abnormality. There was also moderate pericardial effusion present . The patient was treated as eosinophilic myocarditis based on suggestive features from echocardiography, supported by the very high absolute eosinophil count. The patient was further planned for cardiac MRI. However, he developed claustrophobia as he was put on the gantry during CMR (cardiac magnetic resonance), thus the procedure was abandoned. Plan for endomyocardial biopsy was put on hold due to severe thrombocytopenia.\n\n【29】<img/>\n\n【30】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3</u>\n\n【32】Transthoracic echocardiography showing diffused superficial layer of thrombus deposition over the endocardium, papillary muscle atrophy and moderate pericardial effusion: (A) apical four chamber, (B) apical two chamber, (C) apical three chamber, (D) parasternal short axis at the level of mitral valve, (E) parasternal short axis at the level of papillary muscles and (F) parasternal short axis at the level of apex.\n\n【33】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【34】Unfortunately, the patient’s condition deteriorated as severe hospital-acquired pneumonia set in. As he was already in a chemorefractory disease, the decision was made with the family for only conservative therapy and to optimise palliative care. He ultimately succumbed after 3 weeks in the ward, and the family refused for postmortem.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】EM (eosinophilic myocarditis) is a rare infiltrative disease of the myocardium, which has a potential catastrophic outcome for the affected patient. The association of eosinophilia and myocardial damage has been established in numerous studies, and many aetiologies have been identified such as hypereosinophilic syndrome, parasitic infection and bronchial asthma. 1\n\n【37】The clinical presentation of EM varies from being asymptomatic to acute fulminant heart failure. Naturally, it has three stages, necrotic, thrombotic and fibrotic stages depending on the current pathophysiological process. As our patient has preserved ejection fraction, and echocardiography showed diffused superficial layer of thrombus, he was probably at the thrombotic stages.\n\n【38】In our patient’s case, the most likely cause for the severe hypereosinophilia was the progression of the T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Various cytokines and growth factors are secreted by malignant lymphoma cells which stimulate the bone marrow to induce granulocyte precursors towards differentiation into eosinophils. 2 As the patient has no history of bronchial asthma or parasitic infection, other causes for the hyperosinophilia were unlikely.\n\n【39】We described a case of EM mimicking acute coronary syndrome, as the patient had classical compressive chest pain accompanied with widespread ECG changes and elevated troponin levels. As the patient was young, and echocardiography showed no regional wall motion abnormality even at a tachycardic state, possibility of ischemia was unlikely. Thambidorai et al and Galiuto et al described in their case reports of EM mimicking myocardial infarction after excluding coronary angiography. The diagnosis was made on suspicion of EM due to elevated absolute eosinophil count, and after EMB (endomyocardial biopsy) was done. 3 4 The true cause of the chest pain in this case was most likely due to myopericarditis, as evident by the elevated troponin levels and presence of pericardial effusion.\n\n【40】Although, we were unable to perform CMR and EMB for this patient due to unavoidable consequences, the diagnosis of EM was very likely in this patient, as echocardiography shows pathognomonic changes of diffused thrombus deposition with pericardial effusion supported by the very high eosinophil count. 5 Baseline echocardiography which was done a few months earlier was normal , followed by a full body F-18 FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose-18) PET-CT scan 2 weeks earlier which showed normal myocardium uptake and absent pericardial effusion .\n\n【41】<img/>\n\n【42】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【43】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4</u>\n\n【44】Baseline transthoracic echocardiography showing normal endocardial borders.

In Japan, the number of super-old patients—age >90 years—with hip fractures has increased drastically over time. Available strategies for anaesthetic management for hip fracture surgery include general anaesthesia, neuraxial anaesthesia and peripheral nerve block. However, general and neuraxial anaesthesia are often avoided for various reasons, particularly in elderly patients. In recent years, peripheral nerve block has proven effective in various surgical procedures. Additionally, dexmedetomidine exhibits neuroprotective effects and has been used safely in super-old patients.

NA includes spinal anaesthesia (SA) and epidural anaesthesia. GA and NA are often avoided in the elderly population for various reasons. Herein, we report successful anaesthetic management using femoral nerve block (FNB) and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block (LFCNB) under dexmedetomidine (DEX) sedation for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a femoral neck fracture in a 97-year-old patient. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s family for the publication of this report.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 97-year-old woman (body mass index (BMI), 14.8 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ; weight, 31.6 kg (measured later); height, 146 cm) visited a local hospital with the chief complaint of right hip pain with an unknown history of present illness. After detailed physical and radiographic examinations, she was diagnosed with Garden type Ⅱ of an intracapsular fracture of the right femoral neck . She was referred to our hospital for further surgical treatment. She had a history of severe mitral regurgitation, mild dementia and chronic constipation. Her current pharmacotherapy includes three constipation medications and verapamil. Unfortunately, further internal medicine information was unavailable. ECG, performed at our emergency department, showed sinus rhythm.\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【15】Initial plain radiograph of fracture; Garden type Ⅱ of intracapsular fracture of the right femoral neck.\n\n【16】The orthopaedic surgeons decided on a less invasive ORIF using cannulated cancellous screws (CCS) because of the minimal displacement of the fracture and advanced age of the patient.\n\n【17】We selected FNB and LFCNB under DEX sedation as the anaesthesia method because the planned ORIF required only a small incision. Additionally, to prevent intraoperative or postoperative complications, including hypotension, postoperative delirium (PD) and respiratory failure, and due to suspicion of fused vertebrae for vertebral fracture, GA and NA were avoided.\n\n【18】During the operation, the patient’s blood pressure was monitored non-invasively, along with electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and continual skin temperature monitoring. To assess respiratory depression associated with sedation, nasal capnography—handmade with a suction catheter—was used to monitor end-tidal carbon dioxide and respiratory rate. Sedation level was assessed using the Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale. Her weight, which was not known, was estimated to be 40 kg based on her small frame, and we administered anaesthesia accordingly.\n\n【19】First, we performed a continuous infusion of DEX intravenously, at a high rate of 80 µg/h for 5 min, for sedation and administered 50 µg fentanyl to induce analgesia simultaneously. Thereafter, the DEX dosage was decreased to 28 µg/h at a lower rate. Because SpO <sub>2 </sub> was decreased to 90% for sedation, we initiated oxygen administration via a face mask at 3 L/min; however, the sedation level was maintained at 3. PNB was performed using a linear ultrasound probe (HFL50, SonoSite, Bothell, Washington, USA) and a 5-cm, 22-gauge needle (Stimuplex Ultra.360, B-Braun, Tochigi, Japan). The femoral nerve was located using a peripheral nerve stimulator plus an ultrasonic echo device. A 16-mL dose of ropivacaine (0.375%) was injected around the femoral nerve, and LFCNB was achieved with a 4-mL dose of ropivacaine (0.375%). After including adequate local anaesthesia, surgery was initiated. At the beginning of the surgery, the surgeons infiltrated 10 mL of 0.5% xylocaine with epinephrine into the skin incision for haemostasis. The patient showed signs of distress during the insertion of CCS into the femoral head , following which an additional 50 µg fentanyl was administered. For postoperative analgesia, we administered 600 mg acetaminophen at the end of the surgery. The duration of the surgery was 9 min and that of anaesthesia was 42 min. No vasopressor was required as our patient’s intraoperative haemodynamic state remained stable . No manual ventilatory assistance was required either because our patient’s sedation level was 3–4 at mild-to-moderate levels, and her respiratory condition remained stable during surgery.\n\n【20】<img/>\n\n【21】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【23】Plain radiograph after surgery showing internal fixation with three cannulated cancellous screws.\n\n【24】<img/>\n\n【25】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【26】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3</u>\n\n【27】Perioperative time course.

The next day, rehabilitation was initiated and training for standing was possible. Eventually, she was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital on postoperative day 15.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】Hip fracture incidence rates increase exponentially with age. In Japan, from 2009 to 2014, this trend was prominently seen in the 90–94 year age group in women and the 85–89 year age group in men. 3 Therefore, hip fractures in super-old patients are expected to increase in the future. However, whether anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in the elderly is best performed under GA or RA, including PNB or NA, remains debatable. The case of a 72-year-old patient who underwent ORIF with PNB has been reported 4 ; however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report of anaesthetic management in a 97-year-old patient. In this case, PNB under DEX sedation for ORIF was selected in a super-old patient.\n\n【32】The first reason to avoid GA and NA is hypotension. Intraoperative hypotension occurs commonly during hip fracture surgery, especially in elderly patients with a higher number of comorbidities. 5 Internationally, the 30-day mortality rate after hip fracture surgery is 6%–8%; intraoperative hypotension is associated with increased 30-day mortality. 1 Although GA or SA is usually selected for hip fracture ORIF, the incidence of intraoperative absolute hypotension (lowest systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) is high in both GA and SA (49.2% and 28.2%, respectively). 5 In recent years, PNB has proven to be effective in various orthopaedic procedures. Intraoperative blood pressure is higher during PNB than that during GA 6 or SA, 7 8 and PNB provides a more stable haemodynamic state. Owing to a history of severe mitral regurgitation and the potential for hypovolaemia, our patient’s intraoperative haemodynamics were closely monitored. In fact, we believe that the patient’s haemodynamics remained stable during the surgery because we selected PNB for anaesthetic management.\n\n【33】Additionally, intraoperative hypotension is associated with PD. 9 PD occurs in 12%–51% of elderly patients following orthopaedic surgical treatment. 10 PD is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, such as high mortality rates, extended hospitalisation or further cognitive decline. 9 10 Risk factors for PD include those that are patient-related and those that are adjusted in-hospital; thus, they are potentially prevented. 9 Examples of the former include advanced age, low BMI, preoperative cognitive decline, polypharmacy (over three medications) and a high American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score. In contrast, the risk factors for the latter include intraoperative blood pressure (mean arterial pressure) control, blood transfusion and postoperative pain management. Our patient had a BMI of 14.8 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> and an ASA score of 3. In short, avoiding intraoperative hypotension was important to ensure a good prognosis because our patient had an advanced age, low BMI, preoperative cognitive decline, polypharmacy and a high ASA score. Fortunately, our patient was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital without any problems.\n\n【34】We avoided GA and NA for several other reasons. We aimed to prevent the risk of postoperative respiratory failure, which occurs more significantly in the setting of GA. 11 As the patient was 97 years old, poor outcomes were likely in case of respiratory failure after surgery. Moreover, as compared with SA, patients who underwent hip fracture surgery with GA have a higher risk of 30-day complications, such as the need for blood transfusion and risk of deep vein thrombosis. 12 In contrast, we also wanted to avoid NA as it can be difficult to achieve because of the bent or fused spine of an elderly patient. Postoperatively, our patient was found to have a history of compression fracture of the third lumbar vertebra. Furthermore, as our patient had a history of mild dementia and experienced severe pain on movement, we judged that it would have been difficult for her to maintain the lateral position during NA. Lastly, had our elderly patient been on antithrombotic drugs for any indication, NA may also have been contraindicated. 13\n\n【35】Intraoperative sedation is an important component of RA techniques and surgical procedures. We selected DEX as a supplement of the PNB and surgery because DEX is a selective α2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a large number of advantages, including fast-onset sedation with minimal respiratory depression, mild analgesic properties and the ability to improve postoperative recognition. 14 In our patient, we assessed the level of sedation using the OAA/S score, a subjective assessment carried out intermittently depending on the patient’s response to either verbal or physical stimuli. 15 We believe that the combination of fentanyl bolus was a contributing factor for the decrease in oxygen saturation after the initiation of DEX. Since then, the patient had mild-to-moderate sedation levels and did not require manual ventilatory assistance. Despite the combination of PNB and a continuous infusion of DEX, the patient showed signs of distress while inserting CCS into the femoral head. This could be because the short time between the PNB and the initiation of surgery may have resulted in inadequate analgesia to the femoral head. However, PNB is considered to have been effective, as the patient did not require any analgesics for at least 12 hours after surgery. Moreover, DEX exhibits neuroprotective effects and decreases the incidence of PD, 16 leading to shorter hospital stays. 17 18 Furthermore, in elderly patients, intraoperative DEX use can remarkably improve the first night sleep quality after surgery, resulting in PD prevention. 19 DEX has been used safely not only in our patient but also in another super-old patient. 20 Briefly, DEX can be a useful anaesthetic adjuvant for a wide range of clinical applications due to its safety and effectiveness.\n\n【36】In summary, we achieved successful anaesthetic management with PNB and DEX in a 97-year-old patient for femoral neck fracture fixation. Because the incidence of hip fractures is expected to increase in the future, we believe that PNB is an effective method to anaesthetise super-old patients instead of GA or NA. Additionally, DEX has many advantages, including good sedation, analgesia and neuroprotective effects with minimal respiratory depression.

Blood cultures were positive for Fusobacterium necrophorum and a right lingual vein thrombosis was detected at a late stage when the patient developed a septic shock. Initial antimicrobial therapy with metronidazole and ceftriaxone was modified to meropenem due to progressive worsening. The patient underwent laparoscopy and neurosurgical drainage of a cerebral abscess. She spent many days in the intensive care unit and recovered fully after 6 weeks on meropenem therapy. Although considered rare, the incidence of Lemierre syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, is increasing. The clinician should promptly recognise and treat it while being aware of its potential atypical presentations.\n\n【2】   Ear, nose and throat/otolaryngology\n   Infectious diseases\n   Intensive care\n   Surgery\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

There is no standard of care as evidence is based on case series.\n\n【10】We report here the case of complex and severe Lemierre syndrome, complicated by multiple abscesses at various extrapulmonary locations that required a multidisciplinary approach combining surgery, intensive care, internal medicine and infectious disease specialists.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A previously healthy woman in her late twenties first consulted an emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, sore throat, cough with bloody sputum, odynophagia and vomiting. She appeared well and the physical examination only showed bilateral cervical adenopathy and exudative tonsils. Rapid antigenic detection test for group A Streptococci and reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. She was discharged home with symptomatic treatment for suspected viral pharyngitis.\n\n【13】Two days later, she consulted another emergency department because of persistent fever and new-onset epigastric pain despite improving sore throat. She denied past or current drug use.\n\n【14】On examination, she appeared very unwell, blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate was 110/min and body temperature was 35.8°C. Oropharyngeal examination showed a small right submandibular adenopathy, an erythematous throat and bilateral tonsillitis. Epigastric tenderness, hepatomegaly and right hypochondrium pain were present. A right gluteal pain was elicited on palpation without cutaneous lesion or palpable collection.\n\n【15】The patient was transferred to our tertiary referral hospital and admitted for further management of suspected abdominal sepsis (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment \\[SOFA\\] score=7 points). 7\n\n【16】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【17】Laboratory results on admission and on day 2 are shown in table 1 . Initial workup ruled out viral hepatitis, syphilis and HIV infections. Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serologies confirmed past infections. Nucleic acid amplification tests for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (urine and vaginal swab) and for Leptospira spp (blood) were negative.\n\n【18】View this table:\n\n【19】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【20】Table 1\n\n【21】Patient’s blood results on admission and on day 2\n\n【22】On admission, a contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed several pulmonary nodular lesions compatible with septic emboli—the largest one in the right upper lobe—hepatosplenomegaly, periportal oedema and free abdominal fluid with a 3 cm collection in the rectouterine pouch . A neck CT performed on the same day was negative for internal jugular thrombosis and evidenced only mild swelling of the left tonsil.\n\n【23】<img/>\n\n【24】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【25】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【26】Chest CT scan showing pulmonary nodules, one of which in the right lung is excavated (yellow arrow), consistent with septic pulmonary emboli.\n\n【27】<img/>\n\n【28】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【29】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【30】Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan showing a pelvic abscess (yellow arrow).\n\n【31】Gynaecological examination and endovaginal ultrasound were normal. Because the sepsis was suspected to be of abdominal origin, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed on day 2. It showed fibrinous adhesions in the hepatic area (perihepatitis) as well as purulent peritonitis in the rectouterine pouch. Both 16S rRNA performed on abdominal fluid and fibrinous adhesions were negative. Blood cultures resulted positive for F. necrophorum in 29 hours.\n\n【32】Postoperatively, the patient developed acute delirium and acute pulmonary oedema, attributed to aggressive fluid resuscitation and sepsis-associated capillary leak syndrome. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen and vasopressor support. A repeated total-body contrast-enhanced CT scan on day 3 showed a right lingual vein thrombosis  and a right precentral cortical brain lesion . On day 6, due to persistent fever and abdominal pain, a contrast-enhanced abdominal-CT was repeated. It showed a large right intramuscular gluteal abscess (40×80×15 mm) without evidence of connections with the collection previously described in the rectouterine pouch . Growing pulmonary lesions were also noted at this time. The gluteal abscess was surgically drained. Broad range 16S rRNA PCR performed on drainage material returned positive for F. necrophorum . Brain MRI showed a right frontal abscess of 9×11 mm . Brain MRI was repeated 8 days later because of new-onset left central facial palsy with dysarthria and showed an increase in the size brain abscess (16×18 mm). The patient underwent craniotomy and 16S rRNA confirmed F. necrophorum infection.\n\n【33】<img/>\n\n【34】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【35】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3</u>\n\n【36】Contrast-enhanced neck CT scan (A) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (B) showing a right lingual vein thrombosis (yellow arrow).

Ventricular function and morphology as well as valvular apparatus were normal. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) was documented and confirmed by a bubble study.\n\n【46】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【47】Lemierre syndrome was considered in the differential diagnosis because of the history of sore throat, clinical signs of pharyngotonsillitis and the presence of a possible septic embolisation in the lungs. Abdominal symptoms have been commonly reported in patients with typical Lemierre syndrome initiated by a pharyngeal infection. 2 5 However, primary infection sites can be found in the liver and be associated with portal vein thrombosis (pylephlebitis), 8–10 or in gynaecological organs such as the vagina, cervix and uterus (with or without intrauterine device) and be associated with pelvic veins thrombosis. 11–16 Although not specific, thrombocytopaenia, as observed in the present case, is a common feature of Lemierre syndrome. 2 5 There was no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n【48】The presence of a perihepatitis with periportal oedema and a 3 cm collection in the rectouterine pouch initially raised the suspicion of a pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) complicated by Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS), an inflammation of the liver capsule associated with chronic PID. 17 18 FHCS starts by ascending infection from the cervix or the vagina to the endometrium. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for FHCS diagnosis.\n\n【49】An infectious endocarditis was also initially considered. Endocarditis caused by F. necrophorum is exceptional with only 10 cases reported in the literature since 1980. 19\n\n【50】Treatment\n---------\n\n【51】According to our institutional guidelines and because of the suspicion of abdominal sepsis, empiric antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam was promptly initiated on admission. As the laparoscopy suggested PID, the treatment was then modified to ceftriaxone, metronidazole and doxycycline. After identification of F. necrophorum in the blood cultures and exclusion of C. trachomatis , doxycycline was stopped. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole were continued based on susceptibility test ( F. necrophorum isolate was sensitive to penicillins, carbapenems, clindamycin, moxifloxacin and metronidazole).\n\n【52】The pelvic and gluteal abscesses were surgically drained. Regarding the right frontal brain abscess, conservative management was initially attempted. However, due to the progression of the abscess and the onset of neurological symptoms (left facial palsy and dysarthria) on effective antibiotic therapy, a craniotomy was performed, and ceftriaxone and metronidazole were replaced by meropenem. Only a partial drainage of the abscess was possible because of the critical localisation near the motor cortex.\n\n【53】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【54】The patient was discharged home after 26 days. Meropenem was administered for 6 weeks after the neurosurgical intervention without any complications.\n\n【55】A thorax and abdominal contrast-enhanced CT 1 week after initiation of meropenem showed a regression of the pulmonary lesions and complete regression of the gluteal abscess.\n\n【56】Neurological recovery was excellent after speech therapy. Cerebral MRI showed a complete regression of the abscess 1 month after surgery. At 6-month follow-up (4 months after cessation of antibiotic therapy), the patient was doing well and had no complaints. At that time, brain MRI showed complete healing of the cerebral abscess.\n\n【57】Discussion\n----------\n\n【58】Local infections with anaerobic organisms leading to thrombophlebitis with distant embolisation were first described by Lemierre. 20 F. necrophorum is the most common aetiological agent of Lemierre syndrome, but other organisms from the oral flora can be found, such as Streptococci and less frequently Staphylococcus aureus . 1 3 F. necrophorum is classified into two subspecies: subsp. necrophorum , involved in most veterinary infections, and subsp. funduliforme , responsible for most human cases. In vitro studies show that F. necrophorum subsp. funduliforme is able to evade complement attack by binding factor H, and to activate the contact system, suggesting a potential role of these mechanisms in the virulence of the pathogen. 21 22 However, the exact mechanisms used by F. necrophorum subsp. funduliforme to escape human host defence and cause severe invasive infections remain largely unexplored. Septic clots are usually observed within 1–3 weeks after primary infection. 5 23 24\n\n【59】The overall annual incidence of Lemierre syndrome, defined as a documented F. necrophorum infection with primary foci in the head and neck, and dissemination to a nearby region (eg, mastoiditis) and/or distal regions (eg, pulmonary septic emboli), has been reported to be 3.6 per million persons per year in the Danish general population and 14.4 cases per million in people aged 15–24 years old. 6 The reasons for the characteristic age distribution, with a predilection for young individuals, remain unclear but might be due to its possible association with EBV-related infectious mononucleosis, which presumably facilitates the entry of Fusobacterium inside the connective tissue. 25 Recent epidemiological data suggest an increased incidence of invasive Fusobacterium spp infections from 2010 to 2017. 5 This trend might be explained by several factors: a decrease in antibiotic prescriptions for upper airway tract infections, more sensitive laboratory techniques for pathogen detection and decreased rates of tonsillectomy. 26 27\n\n【60】Septic thrombosis is traditionally described as occurring in the internal jugular vein. In our patient, we identified a thrombosis of the right lingual vein at a relatively late stage, after 72 hours of hospitalisation. We hypothesised that a jugular thrombosis might have occurred earlier and could have already embolised at the time the patient underwent radiologic exploration. Indeed, it has been suggested that the finding of a jugular vein thrombosis at the time of clinical presentation may not be a sensitive diagnostic criterion for Lemierre syndrome. 28 The lung is the most common site of embolisation, accounting for up to 85% of the cases. 29 Our patient presented other uncommon embolisation sites. Muscle abscesses have been reported in rare cases, resulting generally from contiguous thrombophlebitis and associated with fasciitis or arthritis. 30 31 The central nervous system is usually not affected because of downstream venous embolisation of the septic emboli in the pulmonary circulation. Only 3%–5% of patients had brain abscesses in a review of 251 infections caused by Fusobacterium spp (but not necessarily with Lemierre syndrome). 1 Mechanisms causing epidural or brain abscesses in Lemierre syndrome include retrograde intracranial extension of the septic thrombosis from the internal jugular vein or contiguous dissemination from an otogenic source of infection. 2 29 In the present case, we postulated that the presence of a PFO contributed to an arterial haematogenous diffusion of F. necrophorum and extensive systemic embolisation, a mechanism proposed to explain septic emboli in the arterial circulation in Lemierre syndrome. 32 To the best of our knowledge, only two cases of Lemierre syndrome with brain abscess and echocardiographic evidence of right-to-left shunt through a PFO have been reported in the literature to date. 33 34 Some cases of ischaemic strokes due to arterio-arterial septic embolism from the internal carotid artery (in contiguity with the internal jugular vein) have been described. 32 35 In the present case, there was no evidence of ischaemic stroke or cervical arterial defects.\n\n【61】Recent studies show that F. necrophorum isolates are generally susceptible to penicillin with a resistance rate between 0.7% and 2% and no resistance to clindamycin or metronidazole have been identified. 5 24 Our patient demonstrated progression of cerebral abscess despite effective therapy with high doses of metronidazole. The increase in size on cerebral MRI was explained probably by the need of surgical drainage in order to control the infection rather than the development of antibiotic resistance as the negative culture on the abscess may suggest. However, the therapy was changed to meropenem with a favourable outcome after neurosurgical drainage.\n\n【62】The benefit of anticoagulation in Lemierre syndrome is debated in the absence of interventional studies. A post hoc analysis in a population-based observational study in Sweden found no clear indication of a benefit, nor major risks in patients with anticoagulation therapy. 36 In case series, 20%–50% of the patients with Lemierre syndrome received anticoagulant therapy. 4 37 In our case, we did not pursue anticoagulation therapy because of the cerebral abscess. There were no adverse thrombotic events during the follow-up.\n\n【63】### Learning points\n\n【64】   Lemierre syndrome is a re-emerging life-threatening condition requiring early recognition. Clinical presentation can include disseminated extrapulmonary septic emboli in the presence of a patent foramen ovale.\n\n【65】   Empiric antibiotic therapy covering Fusobacterium spp and oral Streptococci (such as ceftriaxone and metronidazole) should be initiated promptly, without waiting for the identification of a thrombosis as traditionally portrayed.\n\n【66】   A multidisciplinary approach, including the early involvement of critical care and surgery specialists, is crucial for optimal management.\n\n【67】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【68】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【69】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We are very thankful to Dr Livia Whiting who was involved in the case management and reviewed the draft, to Dr Fabio Zanchi who reviewed and commented on the radiological images, and to Dr Elizabeth C.

The pain was originally intermittent and sharp in nature but progressed to a constant severe neuropathic pain despite appropriate analgesia. In addition, her right leg became similarly affected approximately 3 weeks prior to admission. She described numbness of her lower extremities and saddle area. She also had symptoms of urinary retention with occasionally urinary incontinence. Medical history revealed approximately 2 years previously that the patient was diagnosed with a left lung cancer (T3N2M0), histology consistent with a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Treatment involved left pneumonectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n【5】On the basis of the clinical features of cauda equina syndrome non-contrast MRI of spine was performed, the results of which were largely unremarkable . Her analgesic regime was modified under the supervision of the pain management team with initial good response. Subsequently, she developed blurred vision and confusion. CT scan of the head was insignificant and funduscopy did not show any evidence of papilloedema. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed high protein and lactate with low glucose. CSF cytology revealed large atypical cells and immunohistochemistry was suggestive of adenocarcinoma cells. Brain MRI with contrast was reported as consistent with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) . No post contrast spinal MRI was undertaken as a diagnosis of LC was not initially considered. She later developed swallowing difficulties and hearing loss.

Patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension are at increased risk of coagulopathy and major abdominal bleeding. 3\n\n【5】We report a patient with liver cirrhosis (Child Pugh score B; 9 points) in his 40s who was stabbed with a knife causing a penetrating liver lesion in liver segment 2 and major bleeding. The patient was haemodynamically unstable, and damage control laparotomy was performed at the local hospital: the liver was packed with gauze packs  and the patient received 10 red blood cell transfusions, 14 fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and three thrombocyte transfusions, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to our level 1 trauma centre. Due to persistent bleeding, a new laparotomy was performed 2 hours after the initial surgery. During the relaparotomy, a severe perforating stab was identified in liver segment 2, and a TachoSil tissue sealant patch was applied, and the venous liver bleeding was stopped. Pringle’s manoeuvre was not necessary. The patient suffered though from diffuse bleeding from multiple surfaces, including bleeding from major abdominal venous collaterals in skin, subcutis and fascia. The patient was acidotic, hypothermic and had severe coagulopathy, and was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) following ‘damage control’ principles. NOAK-TEG was measured to 144, so another three FFP and two thrombocytes were given and low TEG-MA (47.9) and TEG FF-MA (11.6) was corrected with 4 g of fibrinogen. In the ICU, the patient was rewarmed, and the metabolic acidosis was corrected, but the patient continued to be haemodynamically unstable and continued to bleed. Ten hours after the second surgery, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was inserted , and immediately afterwards a relaparotomy was performed in which the bleeding was stopped. Vital signs, bloodparameters, arterial blood gases, drain production and transfusion requirements all improved. In the ICU, the patient developed multiorgan failure, and severe hepatic failure and died 4 days after TIPS insertion and 5 days after the trauma. During the admission, blood investigations showed bilirubin of 39 increasing to 219, albumin of 24 increasing to 34 and an INR of 1.2 increasing to 3.4.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【9】(A) Trauma CT of the liver after initial emergency surgery and abdominal packing and (B) reconstructed scan from trauma CT of upper liver, portal vein and collaterals before TIPS.

This is the first case to report TIPS as a tool to stop acute severe traumatic abdominal bleeding in a patient with liver cirrhosis combined with hypothermia, acidosis and severe coagulopathy. TIPS probably has no effect on traumatic arterial or venous bleeding. In our patient, the liver bleeding was stopped by application of a tissue sealant patch, but the major subsequent problem appeared to be diffuse abdominal bleeding and abdominal venous collateral bleeding. TIPS reduced portal pressure in our patient from 28 to 14 mm Hg and based on vital signs, blood parameters, drain production and transfusion requirements was effective to stop the diffuse intra-abdominal and collateral bleeding. Timing of TIPS placement is of utmost importance. Early TIPS placement in highly selected patients may abort the bleeding, reduce the risk for multiorgan failure and death. The decision for TIPS can be made in the operating theatre when the bleeding cannot be controlled. TIPS can be an effective tool in patients with portal hypertension and severe traumatic abdominal bleeding. Post-TIPS hepatic failure is a well-known complication which occurs in 20% of all patients. Trauma patients who are treated with TIPS are at increased risk for hepatic failure, hence we strongly advocate for reversal of TIPS as soon as the bleeding has stopped and the patient is stable. Closure of the TIPS shortly after TIPS placement could have been considered in the present case.\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】   Patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension are at increased risk of coagulopathy and major abdominal bleeding.\n\n【17】   In our case, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) reduced portal pressure in our patient from 28 to 14 mm Hg and was effective to stop the diffuse abdominal and abdominal venous collateral bleeding.\n\n【18】   TIPS can be an effective tool in patients with portal hypertension and severe traumatic abdominal bleeding, though we strongly advocate for reversal of TIPS as soon as the bleeding has stopped and the patient is stable to reduce the risk for post-TIPS hepatic failure.\n\n【19】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【20】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【21】Consent obtained from next of kin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Diabetes distress, a psychological barrier to diabetes self-management, has become increasingly recognised in the literature, but effective and feasible ways of addressing it in routine primary care settings are not known. We present the case of a middle-aged non-Hispanic white American woman with poorly controlled diabetes (haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): 13.9%) and elevated diabetes distress (baseline Diabetes Distress Scale Score: 2.53) who participated in a health coaching intervention. After the 5-month programme, which included eight 45 minute long sessions with a trained health coach, the patient achieved and sustained a 0.8-point reduction in diabetes distress, an improvement in insulin adherence and a 3.6-point reduction in HbA1c. This case demonstrates a novel approach to managing diabetes distress that entails providing patients a safe, nonjudgemental space to express their feelings and explore challenges with diabetes self-management.\n\n【2】   diabetes\n   general practice / family medicine\n\n【3】http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-241759\n\n【4】Statistics from Altmetric.com\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】   diabetes\n   general practice / family medicine\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】Diabetes distress is a form of psychological distress specific to individuals living with diabetes, encompassing the burden, fears and challenges of dealing with the disease and its complications. 1 It is important to address diabetes distress because it is associated with poor self-management behaviours and poor diabetes control. 2–4 The 17-item Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS), one of the common scales for measuring diabetes distress, assesses four domains of diabetes distress, namely emotional burden, regimen distress, interpersonal distress and physician-related distress. 5 These four subscales have been used in previous studies and are considered reliable and valid. 2 6 Evidence suggests that diabetes distress is meaningfully associated with diabetes self-management and diabetes control when an individual’s DDS score is greater than or equal to 2.0. 3 A mean item score in the range 2.0–2.9 is considered to indicate a moderate level of distress, while a score of 3.0 or above indicates a high level of distress. 3 Diabetes distress and its four subdomains, as captured in the DDS, each has a score range of 1–6.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】### Clinical presentation\n\n【10】The patient was a non-Hispanic white American woman in her late 50s whose highest level of education was less than high school and whose annual household income was less than 50 thousand dollars. She had multiple chronic conditions including obesity, controlled hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) of 13.9%). She has been living with type 2 diabetes since 2005. The patient had a total DDS score of 2.53 at baseline, indicating a moderate level of diabetes distress. The breakdown of the score into subdomains of the DDS showed that regimen distress (score of 4) and emotional burden (score of 3.2) were the primary forms of diabetes distress experienced by the patient.\n\n【11】The clinic enrolled the patient in an intervention that sought to alleviate diabetes distress through health coaching. The patient’s diabetes distress in the context of poorly controlled diabetes indicated the need for the intervention. We present the highlights of a novel approach that uses health coaching techniques to help patients with diabetes distress manage the emotional toll of diabetes and improve their diabetes control.\n\n【12】### Treatment\n\n【13】The participant received eight coaching sessions delivered via telephone over a 5-month period: two times per month for the first three months and then monthly for the last two months. Each session lasted for approximately 45 minutes. The health coach was a registered dietitian with additional certifications as a Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist and Certified Health and Wellness Coach. Notwithstanding her knowledge as a dietitian, the intervention focused on using her professional coaching skills. The coach was external to the patient’s routine primary care team and was contracted by the primary care practice to provide the service.\n\n【14】Prior to the first session, the coach spoke with the patient to explain what coaching was and to come to a consensus regarding how they would proceed. Then they set up a coaching schedule for the eight sessions. Highlights of the patient’s coaching journey are summarised in the remaining paragraphs in this section. At the first coaching session, the coach and the patient reviewed the patient’s concerns and challenges with diabetes care, identified the patient’s strengths (eg, what has worked for her in the past with regards to diabetes self-management) and created a health vision statement and associated goals. The patient’s baseline DDS report provided information on the specific types of distress the patient was feeling the most, that is, regimen distress and emotional burden ( table 1 ) and the specific things about living with diabetes that were upsetting the patient as informed by the DDS questions with the highest scores ( table 1 ). Notably, the patient indicated that she was often failing with her diabetes routine, particularly, she was not taking insulin as prescribed, she lacked motivation to keep up with the demands of diabetes self-management, and she had resigned to fate with a conviction that she would inevitably end up with serious long-term complications of diabetes no matter what she did. These findings informed the development of the coaching priorities.\n\n【15】View this table:\n\n【16】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【17】Table 1\n\n【18】Patient’s diabetes distress scores at baseline and 2 months post-intervention\n\n【19】It was remarkable to note that the patient reported that although she was adherent with her oral medications for diabetes and other comorbidities, she had stopped taking insulin for about four years. Initially, she could not properly articulate why she was not taking insulin prior to coaching. She started with saying she hated needles and insulin. With the guidance of the coach, she was able to identify the root cause of her nonadherence as a severe fear of hypoglycaemia as she was not eating regularly. Up to this point, she had not discussed her fears with the doctor. Thus, she identified insulin self-management as an important short-term coaching target and her immediate action plan was to schedule an appointment with her doctor to discuss the insulin situation. Other short-term plans were to reduce her meal portion sizes and to increase her physical activity levels. Her 3-month goal was to achieve a target HbA1c value of 9%, a meaningful reduction from her baseline value of 13.9%. She set an initial vision to attain a healthier state in life in which she would feel ‘strong, wonderful, peaceful and calm.’ At the end of the session, the patient expressed that she felt heard, more confident, and empowered to take on her challenges.\n\n【20】At subsequent coaching sessions, the patient’s progress on her goals was reviewed, with a focus on specific issues that she was dealing with or wanted to talk about at any given time. By the second coaching session, the patient had scheduled the doctor’s appointment as decided from the first session; the appointment was to occur on the day after the second coaching session. Building on the first session, the patient and coach worked on her fears and inertia for insulin, breaking it down to specific actionable items, then they discussed her feeling of control and level of confidence and made a list of issues that the patient will discuss further with the doctor. The patient’s strengths and past successes were also explored, allowing her to derive confidence from those experiences. At the end of the second session, the patient stated that she felt much more confident about taking insulin and felt prepared to talk with the doctor the following day, armed with the list of discussion topics for the visit.\n\n【21】At the doctor’s visit that occurred after the second coaching session, the patient discussed her challenges with insulin as articulated. This triggered a prolonged visit during which the doctor spent more than 30 minutes educating her on proper self-monitoring of blood glucose and the symptoms of hypoglycaemia, to ameliorate her fears of hypoglycaemic coma. She was also educated on the need for better control of her blood glucose and the importance of regular administration of insulin.\n\n【22】At the third coaching session, her vision and 3-month goal remained the same. Her short-term plans following the doctor’s visit were to take her insulin as prescribed (for which she ranked both the importance and her confidence level as 9 out of 10, respectively), consume each of her five favourite vegetables at least once per day, avoid drinking sodas and read information concerning carbohydrate counting. She stated that she found it beneficial discussing her eating habits. The patient noted that her pillbox was critical in helping her remember to take her medications. Hence, she made a plan to put the insulin pen together with her pillbox, so that she can remember the injection when she takes her pills.\n\n【23】At the fourth session, she reported excitedly that she had been taking insulin consistently without missing a dose. She also reported moving around more and doing more house chores. She stated ‘I can do it (house chores), insulin gave me strength to do it. It is bringing my sugar down to where I want.’ She also reported cutting the quantity of frequently taken carbohydrates by half and increasing vegetable intake. She stated that having a food plan ‘helped a whole lot’. She expressed more clarity on her newfound motivation for working to get her diabetes under control. She revised her vision statement to read ‘I am saving my life! I do not want to die. I do want to live to at least 90. This is my way of trying to save my life so that I can be that old’. She retained this new vision for the rest of the intervention period. Her goal to bring down her HbA1c to 9% in the short-term remained the same, and she hoped to achieve this goal by her next doctor’s visit. Her short-term plans were to replace her missing glucometer, continue taking insulin as prescribed, maintain the halving of carbohydrate portion sizes and double vegetable intake at supper. At the end of the session, she stated ‘I have come a long way from our first conversation. I have learnt a lot from our session’.\n\n【24】At the fifth session, she was still taking insulin consistently. The approach of keeping her insulin pen along with the pillbox had worked well. She had an HbA1c test between coaching sessions 4 and 5 that showed a value of 10.8%, down from the 13.9% recorded at the beginning of the intervention. This was not yet at her goal of 9% but was trending in the right direction. Further conversations were had on her dietary management goals and plans, and she decided to include a plan to purchase a blender for juicing vegetables in her updated short-term plans.\n\n【25】The sixth coaching session was eventful. The patient was crying on the phone and described her mood as ‘feeling angry, bad and let down’. The patient stated that she was frustrated and disappointed at the outcome of a continuing care visit with her doctor the previous day. During this visit, the doctor changed her insulin dosing from a single dose of long-acting insulin at bedtime to four times daily, with the addition of a dose of rapid-acting insulin before each meal. She did not feel that this change was necessary considering that her HbA1c had dropped from 13.9% a few months earlier to 10.8% in the most recent test. She felt unheard and described the prescription as unfair. This frustration reflected in an updated DDS assessment after the visit, in which her score for the scale item ‘Feeling that my doctor doesn't take my concerns seriously enough’ went up two points. The patient was worried about the new prescription because she stated that following a similar regimen in the past ‘took away so much joy from her life’. Despite the progress she had made in the past few months, she said that she felt like ‘quitting everything’. The coach listened mindfully and expressed empathy, acknowledgement and validation, gave the patient room to vent and helped her overcome the negative feelings. On review of goals and plans, the patient noted that she had purchased a blender for juicing as per her plan in session 5 but was yet to replace her glucometer. She rated both her confidence level and importance of taking the long-acting insulin at night as a 10 out of 10. However, she ranked her confidence level at 5 for taking rapid-acting insulin at meal times. At the end of the session, the patient expressed gratitude for the support.\n\n【26】By the seventh coaching session, the patient had ordered a replacement glucometer. She was still taking the once-daily long-acting insulin as prescribed, but she often forgets the rapid-acting insulin during mealtimes and only takes it a few days in a week.\n\n【27】At the eighth and final coaching session, the patient noted that she had improved her rapid-acting insulin adherence to daily but often only once per day as compared with the recommended three, that is, one-third of the time. The session ended with her reaffirming commitment to achieving her vision statement. In the end, she expressed gratitude for the coaching experience, stating ‘I learnt a lot… getting there, though slowly. At least better than what it used to be; from not taking insulin at all to taking two shots per day’.\n\n【28】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【29】### Timeline\n\n【30】The timeline for the patient’s journey through the intervention described in this case report is summarised in figure 1 . The patient was enrolled in the intervention on 16 July 2018, completed coaching on 1 December 2018 and had a postintervention follow-up visit and assessment on 13 February 2019. Some of the key events during the process (as outlined above) are summarised in figure 1 .\n\n【31】<img/>\n\n【32】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【33】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【34】Timeline. DDS, Diabetes Distress Scale; HbA1c, haemoglobinA1c.\n\n【35】### Changes in diabetes distress\n\n【36】The primary goal of the intervention was to reduce diabetes distress through health coaching. At the time of enrollment, the patient had a moderate level of overall diabetes distress (DDS score of 2.53) that was driven by high levels of regimen distress (4.0) and emotional burden (3.2). These distress levels were observed to be slightly elevated at a follow-up assessment at the initiation of coaching (DDS score of 2.94, Regimen Distress of 4.4, Emotional Burden of 4.2). By the mid-point of the intervention, the patient’s distress levels had come down significantly (DDS score of 1.76, Regimen Distress of 1.8, Emotional Burden of 1.4). The reduced distress levels were sustained at a postintervention assessment administered 2 months after completing the intervention (DDS score of 1.71, Regimen Distress of 2.6, Emotional Burden of 1.8). Figure 2 shows the trajectories of the patient’s distress levels from enrollment to the postintervention assessment. Scores that are 2.0 and above are considered significant levels of distress. 3\n\n【37】<img/>\n\n【38】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【39】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【40】Patient’s DDS trajectories during and after coaching. The scores for physician-related distress and interpersonal distress were identical at each time point, which is why the interpersonal distress line is not visible. DDS, Diabetes Distress Scale; HbA1c, haemoglobin A1c.\n\n【41】At baseline, the patient assigned the highest possible score (ie, 6 ‘a very serious problem’) to three DDS items ( table 1 ). These items were ‘feeling that I am often failing with my diabetes routine’, ‘not feeling motivated to keep up my diabetes self-management’ and ‘feeling that I will end up with serious long-term complications, no matter what I do’. At the postintervention assessment, she rated these items 4 (‘somewhat serious problem’), 3 (a moderate problem’), 1 (not a problem), respectively. These findings are not surprising considering that improving motivation and self-efficacy is at the heart of coaching. It is likely that the improvement in her adherence with insulin regimen due to the coaching intervention was a driving factor in reducing the ranking on the first item (‘feeling that I am often failing with my diabetes routine’). At the baseline, the patient had practically resigned to fate and accepted that ending up with serious long-term complications was inevitable. This feeling of hopelessness disappeared after receiving coaching and she no longer felt that she would inevitably develop serious long-term complications. This is in line with her newly developed health vision to live to at least the age of 90. Her feeling of lack of motivation to keep up with diabetes self-management also improved from ‘a very serious problem’ to ‘a moderate problem’.\n\n【42】### Changes in glycaemic control\n\n【43】As reflected in figure 3 , the patient’s glycaemic control improved during the intervention. Starting off with a very high HbA1c level (13.9%), her 3-month coaching goal was to get to an HbA1c level of 9%. She came close to achieving this goal, with an HbA1c level of 9.2% recorded during the fourth month of intervention. At the final assessment, two months after the intervention, her HbA1c increased to 10.3% but was still a 26% relative reduction compared with the baseline value.\n\n【44】<img/>\n\n【45】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【46】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3</u>\n\n【47】Patient’s glycated HbA1c values at baseline, during and after coaching. HbA1c, haemoglobin A1c\n\n【48】### Changes in self-management behaviours\n\n【49】The most remarkable change in the patient’s self-management behaviour during the coaching intervention was the change in her insulin adherence. She went from receiving and ignoring insulin prescriptions over a 4-year period to consistently taking long-acting insulin daily and taking at least one-third of her rapid-acting insulin dose daily. At goal reviews during her coaching sessions, she also reported improving her dietary behaviours, particularly, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption and halving carbohydrate intake, and increasing her physical activity levels, particularly, doing more house chores.\n\n【50】Global health problem list\n--------------------------\n\n【51】   Diabetes distress, an indicator of poor emotional well-being, is a common and important barrier to self-management and control of diabetes.\n\n【52】   Patients do not often feel capable of fully expressing their needs and concerns with their doctor. In the case of this patient, she was unable to discuss her anxieties regarding insulin and hypoglycaemia, resulting in poor adherence to insulin for several years.\n\n【53】   Health coaching is well suited to addressing the underlying contributors and consequences of diabetes distress and improving patients’ motivation and self-efficacy for diabetes self-management.\n\n【54】Global health problem analysis\n------------------------------\n\n【55】Diabetes distress, an indicator of poor emotional well-being, is a common and important barrier to self-managing and controlling diabetes. Diabetes distress has a strong inverse association with positive diabetes self-management behaviours. 6–10 Reductions in diabetes distress are associated with clinically significant reductions in HbA1c, 11 12 and changes in glycaemic control and diabetes distress correspond with each other over time. 7–9 Thus, controlling diabetes distress should be a routine component of comprehensive diabetes care. 13\n\n【56】Often, patients do not feel capable of fully expressing their needs and concerns with their doctor. This results in poor adherence with treatment regimen and the attendant negative consequences, especially for ongoing chronic care management. In the case of this patient, she was unable to discuss her anxieties about insulin, resulting in poor adherence for about 4 years. It has been proposed that one of the ways that chronic care coaches add value to patient care is by bridging gaps between clinicians and their patients, 14 and there is evidence that health coaching strengthens patients’ relationship with and trust in their providers. 15 This was certainly the case with this patient. Following interaction with the coach, the patient felt empowered to discuss her insulin concerns with the doctor. Opening up to the provider on her insulin fears provided the opportunity for her to receive education and reassurance that she can safely administer insulin at home without getting into hypoglycaemic coma.\n\n【57】Health coaching is well suited to addressing the underlying contributors and consequences of diabetes distress. Health coaching seeks to enlighten the recipient and facilitate health behaviour change in order to achieve health or wellness goals. Several behavioural change theories underlie health coaching, including the social cognitive theory and the transtheoretical model. 16 In the context of this study, the authors’ conceptualisation of health coaching aligns with the articulation in two previous reviews, 17 18 as reflected in the following definition:\n\n【58】> A patient-centered approach wherein patients at least partially determine their goals, use self-discovery or active learning processes together with content education to work toward their goals, and self-monitor behaviors to increase accountability, all within the context of an interpersonal relationship with a coach. The coach is a healthcare professional trained in behavior change theory, motivational strategies, and communication techniques, which are used to assist patients to develop intrinsic motivation and obtain skills to create sustainable change for improved health and well-being. 18\n\n【59】Interventions for alleviating diabetes distress need to help patients express their feelings about diabetes and improve their self-efficacy in meeting their diabetes care needs. 19 By establishing trust and rapport, building a growth-promoting relationship and helping clients deal with negative emotions, health coaching can help patients express their feelings. 20 Furthermore, coaching can help patients improve motivation and self-efficacy for diabetes self-management through the use of appreciative inquiry and motivational interviewing. 20 These coaching techniques formed the basis for the intervention. There is growing evidence behind the various coaching techniques, particularly motivational interviewing 21–24 —a collaborative and goal-oriented style of communication that helps strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal, in a nonjudgemental and empathetic atmosphere. 25\n\n【60】### Learning points\n\n【61】   The Diabetes Distress Scale helps identify patients facing emotional barriers to diabetes self-management and it can be easily administered in primary care settings.\n\n【62】   Patients dealing with diabetes distress need to be supported to express their feelings about diabetes and improve self-efficacy in meeting their diabetes care needs.\n\n【63】   Health coaching provides patients with a safe nonjudgemental space to express their feelings, explore and address the underlying contributors and consequences of diabetes distress and improve their motivation and self-efficacy for diabetes self-management.\n\n【64】   Health coaches can help bridge gaps between clinicians and patients, helping avert poor adherence to treatment because of such gaps.\n\n【65】   Health coaches working remotely can be successfully integrated into primary care workflow.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

One of the most common mechanisms for gastric pneumatosis is gastric ischaemia, also a rare entity. Although patients with gastric ischaemia may require surgical intervention, they can often be treated with conservative measures such as a proton pump inhibitor, broad-spectrum antibiotics, nasogastric tube decompression, fluid resuscitation and total parenteral nutrition.

In one recent review, there was 111 publications over the last 25 years, mostly single case reports. 1 Some of the most common mechanisms for gastric pneumatosis include gastric ischaemia or infarction, bacterial infection and gastric mucosal disruption facilitating air penetration, such as in forceful vomiting or gastric outlet obstruction. 1 2\n\n【10】Due to the rich collateral blood supply to the stomach, gastric ischaemia itself is a rare entity. Aetiologies of gastric ischaemia can be divided into systemic hypoperfusion, such as in shock, or local causes of hypoperfusion, such as in gastric volvulus, coeliac axis occlusion or in superior mesenteric artery syndrome. 1\n\n【11】The treatment of gastric pneumatosis is often conservative; however, surgery may be required depending on the aetiology. 1 In one recent study, patients with elevated serum lactic acid, elevated serum creatinine, or concomitant small bowel or colonic pneumatosis were found to have higher mortalities. It has been suggested that more aggressive treatment may be warranted in these patients. 3\n\n【12】We report a rare case of gastric ischaemia and pneumatosis following therapeutic left gastric artery gelfoam and coil embolisation that was treated with conservative measures.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A man in his 70s with a medical history significant for recurrent upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding secondary to a gastric dieulafoy lesion, erosive gastritis, coronary artery disease with a drug-eluting stent (on aspirin 81 mg daily), chronic kidney disease stage III, hypertension and non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes presented with a 1-week history of worsening fatigue and shortness of breath.\n\n【15】The patient was recently hospitalised three times in the past few months for severe symptomatic acute blood loss anaemia secondary to a bleeding gastric dieulafoy lesion. This was treated on the first admission with argon plasma coagulation and clipping and the third admission with epinephrine and clipping. No intervention was necessary during the second admission.\n\n【16】On presentation, he was found to have a haemoglobin of 57 g/L and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). He began having multiple episodes of melena associated with a brief hypotensive episode and was subsequently transfused three additional units of pRBCs. He underwent oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) revealing active bleeding of the gastric dieulafoy lesion that was treated with Injection Gold Probe.\n\n【17】Next day, the patient had a drop in his haemoglobin, which required transfusion of an additional unit of pRBC. This drop in haemoglobin was attributed to continued bleeding of his dieulafoy lesion. Since endoscopic therapeutic approaches had failed three times and the recurrent bleeding was significant enough to warrant multiple hospitalisations the decision was made to consult interventional radiology (IR) for embolisation. The patient underwent gelfoam and coil embolisation of the left gastric artery with successful haemostasis.\n\n【18】He had no further drops in haemoglobin or evidence of melena or haematochezia after the embolisation. Over the next 72 hours after the procedure, he developed persistent diffuse abdominal pain and vomiting. He then became septic with fever of 38.9°C, tachycardia to 120 s and leucocytosis with white cell count of 20.8 10ˆ9/L.\n\n【19】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【20】A CT abdomen pelvis with intravenous contrast showed pneumatosis and mural thickening along the wall of the lesser curvature of the stomach . An OGD showed diffuse ischaemic changes, characterised by discolouration and deep ulceration in the proximal stomach involving the anterior and posterior wall extending down to the lesser curvature of the stomach . Acute care surgery was consulted and recommended conservative management with strict bowel rest, serial abdominal exams and trending of serum lactic acid.\n\n【21】<img/>\n\n【22】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【24】OGD showing discolouration and deep ulceration in the proximal stomach involving the anterior and posterior wall extending down to the lesser curvature of the stomach.

Blood cultures were drawn which did not yield growth of any organisms. An OGD was performed 2 days after diagnosis of pneumatosis to assess extent of ischaemia and found diffuse ischaemic changes characterised by discolouration and deep ulceration of the proximal stomach involving the anterior and posterior wall with extension to lesser curvature of stomach. Nasogastric (NG) was placed to suction to alleviate the large volume of gastric secretions (1–2 L per day). He was treated with high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy with intravenous pantoprazole 40 mg three times a day. He was unable to tolerate postpyloric feeding via NJ tube due to abdominal pain and was initiated on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). A repeat CT abdomen done 5 days after initial diagnosis showed improvement in gastric pneumatosis. He completed a 10-day course of intravenous antibiotics. He was on TPN for a total of 21 and then transitioned to enteral tube feeds that were well tolerated. He was able to slowly restart eating by mouth and tolerated advancements of diet from clear liquid to solids. Enteral tube feeds were stopped day before discharge.\n\n【31】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【32】The patient was hospitalised for a total of 33 days. On discharge, he was tolerating a low fat and low fibre diet. A repeat CT abdomen pelvis non-contrast prior to discharge showed persistent and similar appearing gastric pneumatosis. The patient was seen in the GI clinic 1.5 months after discharge and was noted to be feeling well overall with occasional bloating during meals. He continues to follow up with his primary care physician and gastroenterologist over a year after discharge.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】Gastric pneumatosis has a variety of causes, including gastric ischaemia and infarction. Gastric ischaemia is a rare condition on its own, that may be under-reported, under-recognised and underappreciated. 2\n\n【35】The aetiologies of gastric ischaemia are many and there are numerous risk factors that have been identified. One retrospective study separated aetiologies into local vascular (n=8; 47%), mechanical obstruction (n=5; 29%) and systemic hypoperfusion from shock (n=4; 24%). Local vascular causes include coeliac artery ostial stenosis, postsurgical complications, portal vein thrombosis and hepatic artery embolisation. Causes of mechanical obstruction include paraoesophageal hernias and gastric outlet obstruction. 4 Other rarer causes of gastric ischaemia that have been reported in case reports include disseminated intravascular coagulation, 5 severe mesenteric ischaemia, 6 antiphospholipid syndrome complicated by adrenal insufficiency due to bilateral adrenal gland infarction, 7 complication of endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer 8 and following intra-arterial infusion of vasopressin into the left gastric artery. 9\n\n【36】Known risk factors for gastric ischaemia include advanced age, smoking, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, hypertension and portal hypertension. 10 Ageing and diabetes decrease gastric motility and delay gastric emptying which leads to gastric distention which then results in increased intragastric pressure. 11 This mechanism has been shown to decrease gastric blood flow in animal models. 12 Smoking increases acid and pepsin secretion and levels of oxygen-free radicals as well as decreasing prostaglandin synthesis, gastric blood flow and mucus secretion. 13 Portal hypertension decreases gastric blood flow due to vascular congestion. 10 Our patient had multiple risk factors for the development of gastric ischaemia after left gastric artery embolisation, including advanced age, atherosclerosis, diabetes and hypertension.\n\n【37】The most common presenting symptoms of gastric ischaemia are abdominal pain, GI bleeding and acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy. CT imaging may show evidence of gastric pneumatosis or portal vein air. 4 Diagnostic endoscopy is recommended for suspected gastric ischaemia because it can confirm the diagnosis, estimate severity of the ischaemia and rule out other pathologies. 2 The most common endoscopic findings are mucosal congestion and haemorrhagic (purplish hue) mucosa with or without ulceration, usually on the greater curvature of the body. 2\n\n【38】Management options for gastric ischaemia are divided into surgical and conservative. Conservative approaches involve gastric acid suppression with PPIs, broad-spectrum antibiotics, NG tube decompression, fluid resuscitation and TPN. 4 Broad-spectrum antibiotic use is selective with some authors using antibiotics if there is presence of gastric pneumatosis on imaging. 2 Intervention can be surgical via gastric resection or with IR. For example, in the latter case, if the aetiology is hepatic artery ostial stenosis then a stent can be placed with IR. 4 Surgical intervention is recommended for gastric perforation and gangrenous or necrotising gastritis that has not responded to conservative management as well as all cases of ischaemia secondary to gastric volvulus. 2 In one study, the median duration of hospitalisation was 15 days and the mortality was 24% within 6 months of diagnosis. 4\n\n【39】Gastric ischaemia following embolisation is rare due to rich collateral supply to the stomach. If ischaemia does occur, it tends to occur after what is called ‘blind embolisation’, which involves the occlusion of several main gastric pedicles such as left gastric and right gastroepiploic arteries. 14 Even in these procedures’ ischaemia tends to be temporary. Widespread necrosis and subsequent gastric pneumatosis from left gastric artery embolisation is rare and limited to case reports. One case reported transient and focal gastric infarction in a patient without underlying risk factors. 15 Another case reported full thickness necrosis of the gastric wall on postmortem examination, however, being the patient had died the ischaemia could have been due in large part to systemic hypotension rather than left gastric artery embolisation. 16\n\n【40】### Learning points\n\n【41】   Gastric ischaemia after embolisation of left gastric artery is rare due to rich collateral vascular supply.\n\n【42】   Endoscopy is required to confirm diagnosis, determine severity and rule out other pathologies.\n\n【43】   Conservative therapeutic approach involves gastric acid suppression via high-dose proton pump inhibitor, broad-spectrum antibiotics, nasogastric tube for decompression, fluid resuscitation and total parenteral nutrition.\n\n【44】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【45】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【46】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

It is the most common prion disease and accounts for approximately 90% of all prion disease cases. 1 It mostly presents with rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia and myoclonus. The clinical course differs according to subtype of CJD, that is, sporadic, iatrogenic, familial and variant. 2 3 The sporadic form of CJD (sCJD) is the most common form of CJD and in most cases patients die within months. 4 Currently, routine diagnostic investigations include brain MRI, electroencephalography (EEG) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses. 5 6 Typical brain MRI findings for sCJD are high signal in specific regions: putamen or caudate, or high signal in at least two cortical regions (temporal, parietal, occipital). Characteristic EEG findings for sCJD are periodic biphasic and triphasic sharp wave complexes. In CSF analyses, typical abnormalities include positive 14-3-3 protein, high total tau protein (t-tau), high ratio between phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and t-tau, high S100 protein and high neuron-specific enolase (NSE). The real-time quaking-induced conversion test in CSF is a relatively new diagnostic test which is highly sensitive and specific for sCJD. 7 Yet, postmortem brain autopsy remains the standard for definite confirmation of CJD. Postmortem brain autopsy can provide further classification of the molecular subtype of sCJD. 8 9 sCJD can have an asymptomatic incubation period lasting for decades, 3 but little is known about this long disease-free period before symptom onset.\n\n【10】Here, we describe a participant from the population-based Rotterdam Study who developed sCJD. The study has a longitudinal design including multiple visits at the research centre with extensive investigations, which provides us a unique opportunity to detail the preclinical phase of sCJD. In this article, we describe the clinical history of this patient, retrieved from both the Rotterdam Study and the National Prion Disease Registry.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】Our case was a 76-year-old woman with a medical history of hyperthyroidism, varices, recurrent urinary tract infections, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, cholecystectomy and uterus extirpation. She was married and had worked as nurse. With regard to the patient’s participation in the population-based follow-up study, the Rotterdam Study, our case entered this study in 1991, and participated up to the fifth examination in November 2010.\n\n【13】From May 2010, she started to develop symptoms of forgetfulness, dizziness, steerlessness in the right leg, and a heavy feeling in the head and eyes. Over a period of a few months, there was fast progression and she had difficulties with her balance and walked unstable. She also had an increased fall tendency. Besides, she had a feeling of pressure in the left ear, visual problems and sometimes diplopia. The patient was seen by an ophthalmologist and an otorhinolaryngologist, both specialists found no abnormalities. Regarding the typical symptoms for sCJD, over a period of months, she had progressive cognitive decline, cerebellar signs, pyramidal signs and extrapyramidal signs. The patient was registered at the Dutch National Prion Disease Registry in March 2011, where according to protocol an in-depth study was conducted on the medical history. There was no iatrogenic history explaining the CJD. During the extensive interview of the family, no evidence for a positive family history emerged.\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】### Research visit examinations\n\n【16】During the fourth examination of Rotterdam Study in May 2004, at age 70 years, cognitive tests were performed and showed no abnormalities, with scores for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 30 out of 30 and good scores for the other cognitive tests, as described in table 1 . Furthermore, routine locomotor symptom screening showed no abnormalities. During the fifth examination round in November 2010, at age 77 years, the participant reported that she suffered from cognitive complaints and cognitive testing showed abnormalities. The MMSE score was 22 out of 30 and compared with the previous examinations she had lower scores on the Word fluency task, Purdue Pegboard Test, words learning test and Stroop test. Detailed information on the results of the cognitive tests is described in table 1 . Based on the presence of subjective cognitive complaints, the presence of objective cognitive impairment, and the absence of dementia, she was classified in the Rotterdam Study as having mild cognitive impairment. 10 During locomotor symptom screening we found no dysarthria, no tremor, no abnormalities during finger tapping, normotonic arms and legs, and no dysmetria. At the standing and gait examinations, she was able to stand stable on two legs, but not in tandem position. She was able to walk independently, though with a slight unstable gait pattern. A non-contrast brain MRI was performed (in November 2010) as part of the research protocol and was compared with the brain MRI from other Rotterdam Study participants aged 70–96 years (median age of 77 years). This revealed that she had a smaller volume of the right and left hippocampus, right thalamus, left amygdala and brainstem. She had a larger volume of CSF, right and left nucleus accumbens, and right putamen than expected for her age. There were no changes on the brain MRI at the basal ganglia, as verified a posteriori by the CJD expert centre at the University of Edinburgh.\n\n【17】View this table:\n\n【18】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【19】Table 1\n\n【20】Results of the cognitive tests before and at diagnosis of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease case\n\n【21】### Clinical investigations\n\n【22】Brain MRI which was performed in October 2010—around 4 weeks before the brain MRI in the Rotterdam Study research centre—showed intracerebral multiple white matter hyperintensities, which were confluent periventricular. These white matter hyperintensities were most likely of vascular origin. Also, slightly wider peripheral and central CSF spaces were seen on brain MRI. The MRI did not show high signal in putamen or caudate. MRI images are shown in figure 1 . Furthermore, an EEG, which was performed in March 2011, showed sufficient fast activity and showed occipital rhythm and diffuse rhythm. Diffuse slow activity was frequently seen as well. The EEG did not show sharp wave complexes. Analysis of the CSF, performed in March 2011, showed a weakly positive 14-3-3 protein, elevated t-tau (4800 ng/L, normal <350), with normal p-tau (72 ng/L, normal <85), elevated S100 protein (8.2 µg/L, normal <3.9) and elevated NSE (20.8 µg/L, normal <17.5). The MMSE score at that time was still 25 out of 30. The patient was heterozygous for codon 129 from the prion protein gene (PRNP; genotype MV) and for the apolipoprotein E gene (genotype epsilon 2/epsilon 3).\n\n【23】<img/>\n\n【24】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【25】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【26】Axial brain MRI images showing multiple white matter hyperintensities; left: fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain MRI sequence; right: diffusion-weighted imaging brain MRI sequence.\n\n【27】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【28】Several differential diagnoses were considered and evaluated. Table 2 gives an overview of the differential diagnoses and on how they were ruled out. Based on the diagnostic criteria for sCJD, 11 the patient was diagnosed with probable sCJD. The criteria which were met were the presence of progressive cognitive impairment, visual problems, cerebellar problems, pyramidal signs and extrapyramidal signs and positive 14-3-3 protein in CSF.\n\n【29】View this table:\n\n【30】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【31】Table 2\n\n【32】Overview of the differential diagnoses and performed investigations to rule them out\n\n【33】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【34】Our case was diagnosed as a probable sCJD case at the age of 77 years. The patient died in June 2011, 3 months after the diagnosis sCJD was clinically suspected. Postmortem brain autopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Pathological investigation showed widespread spongiosis and gliosis. Prion protein immunohistochemistry showed synaptic staining, mainly in the deeper layers with most spongiosis, plaque-like deposits and compact deposits. In the cerebellar cortex spongiosis and frequent periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive plaques (kuru-type plaques) and deposits were seen, as shown in figure 2 . The cerebellar grey matter also showed some PAS-positive plaques. Other parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, basal nuclei, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and brain stem, showed spongiosis and some PAS-positivity. PRNP gene analysis revealed no mutations. Based on the pathological alterations, the final histopathological diagnosis was sCJD type MV2K. 8 9 12\n\n【35】<img/>\n\n【36】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【38】Microscopic pathology demonstrating kuru-type plaques in the cerebellum.\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】sCJD is the most common form of CJD. 4 We report the first case diagnosed with sCJD who was enrolled in a population-based cohort study and was classified as having mild cognitive impairment during the diagnostic workup for sCJD.\n\n【41】sCJD is a fatal neurological disease with a large variety in symptom onset and progression. Rapid progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia is often the first clinical manifestation of sCJD. We describe the first case diagnosed with sCJD in the population-based Rotterdam Study and for whom prospective epidemiological data is available. During the patient’s last visit at our research centre, she had subjective cognitive complaints and, based on cognitive examinations, she also had objective cognitive impairment. Therefore, she was classified within the study as having mild cognitive impairment. At the same time, the patient was suffering from several other neurological symptoms and was referred to the neurology clinic for diagnostic workup. Given that sCJD is a progressive disease in which symptoms are known to progress rapidly, the cognitive decline observed during her final visit to our research centre was not unexpected. However, since she did not yet fulfil the criteria for dementia, she was classified as having mild cognitive impairment. This was beyond our expectations, as the visit at our research centre was during the early clinical stage of sCJD, that is, 4 months before diagnosis of sCJD. This shows that the symptom onset of cognitive impairment in our sCJD case was subtle. 13 Moreover, the MMSE score a few months before death showed subtle cognitive impairment. The recognition of sCJD is often a diagnostic challenge.\n\n【42】sCJD cases with the molecular subtype MV2K have a long clinical course and usually present with early-onset ataxia. This was seen in our case as well, as dominant symptoms were the difficulties with balance and unstable walking. Further, in cases with this molecular subtype, sharp wave complexes on EEG are infrequently seen, as was the case in our patient. It is of interest that the patient had a late symptom onset. The age of onset of the cognitive problems in our case was 76 years, which is higher than the mean age of onset for sCJD. 9 14 The mean age of onset in the Netherlands is 66 years. 15 In sCJD cases with the molecular subtype MV2K, the median age of onset is known to be 65 years (range 36–83 years). 9 16 Our case can be considered as a relatively late-onset case of sCJD. A possible explanation for the late onset of mild cognitive impairment symptoms is that our case was high-functioning before symptom onset, which could have provided cognitive protection.\n\n【43】In conclusion, we describe the first case diagnosed with sCJD who during diagnostic workup for sCJD was classified as having mild cognitive impairment in a population-based cohort study.\n\n【44】### Learning points\n\n【45】   The sporadic form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is the most common prion disease, which is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease caused by accumulation of abnormally folded prion protein.\n\n【46】   As the symptom onset of sCJD can be subtle, the diagnosis of sCJD can be a diagnostic challenge, especially in the early clinical stage of the disease.\n\n【47】   In sCJD cases with the molecular subtype MV2K, the median age of onset is 65 years with a large range of age of onset.

The infantile-onset form is rapidly fatal if left untreated and presents with respiratory symptoms, a typical encounter during infancy. We discuss two infants presenting with respiratory symptoms since early infancy and found to have cardiomegaly, hypotonia, elevated muscle enzymes, leading to the diagnosis of Pompe disease with genetic confirmation. However, both infants expired before the enzyme replacement therapy due to complications of irreversible muscle damage despite supportive medical care. Presentation with respiratory symptoms common during childhood, absence of alarming symptoms such as hypoglycaemia, ketoacidosis or encephalopathy, and relative rarity of Pompe disease can contribute to lapses in the early diagnosis as observed in the index patients. Thus, these cases emphasise the importance of vigilant assessment of common paediatric presentations, which may be presenting symptoms of underlying sinister pathologies.\n\n【2】   congenital disorders\n   pathology\n   genetic screening / counselling\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

The overall incidence has been estimated at around 1 in 40 000; however, it is much higher in Taiwan and Missouri, perhaps due to founder effects. 1–6 The clinical picture of PD has a broad spectrum of phenotypes from infantile-onset PD (IoPD) to the late-onset adult form. IoPD, the most severe form in the spectrum, is characterised by cardiomegaly, hypotonia, respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties, all of which can be attributed to the underlying lysosomal glycogen accumulation causing lysosomal functional deficit leading to irreversible cellular damage. Despite its relative rarity, the presentation of IoPD can mimic common ailments such as respiratory infection or present with relatively nonspecific symptoms such as poor feeding, posing a diagnostic dilemma and subsequent delay in the early diagnosis.\n\n【10】Untreated IoPD is well known to be rapidly fatal, with death due to cardiorespiratory failure within the first year of life. 4 7 Therefore, prompt diagnosis and initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) are critical to reducing subsequent disability. Although the fatal outcome may not be prevented, the best possible clinical outcomes are attained by commencing ERT before significant muscle damage. 8 9 Therefore, it is imperative to have a high index of suspicion and rule out rare pathologies in common clinical presentations, as observed in these two infants presenting with respiratory symptoms since their early infancy.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】The first patient (infant A) was a 4-month-old female infant brought to medical attention with faltering growth and persistent cough since early infancy. The acute presentation was due to the worsening respiratory distress and apathy for 3 days without fever. She had a persistent nonproductive cough since the late neonatal period, which was not further investigated for it was attributed to episodes of uncomplicated respiratory infections. During the physical examination, she was not febrile, pale, or icteric, nor did she have any dysmorphic features. However, her mouth was visibly open at rest, possibly due to mild macroglossia. She was tachypneic (respiratory rate: 60/min, the normal range for 3–6 months: 30–55) and had subcostal and intercostal recessions with nasal flaring. Her heart rate was 136 bpm (the normal range for 3–6 months: 120–160) with an oxygen saturation >92% on nasal prong oxygen. There was a soft systolic murmur with reduced breath sounds on the left lower zone of the lungs on auscultation. Her abdomen was not tender, but she had mild hepatomegaly and reduced muscle tone in all four limbs. Her birth history was uncomplicated, for she was born at term by an elective caesarean section (indication: breech presentation) with a good Apgar score, average body weight (−1 SD), and length (+2 SD) at birth. There were no perinatal complications. However, her weight and length were observed to fall away from the mean, with both dropping to −2 SD of the respective growth charts by the age of 4 months. Her development assessment revealed difficulty in meeting gross motor milestones as she could not hold her head up while prone at the age of 4 months. Though she was a product of a second-degree consanguineous marriage , a detailed inquiry into the family history of inherited or metabolic disorders did not reveal any affected relatives, and her elder sibling was apparently healthy.\n\n【13】<img/>\n\n【14】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【16】Genogram of infant A, demonstrating second-degree consanguinity (illustration by UDS).\n\n【17】The second patient (infant B) was a 7-month-old male infant brought to medical attention with a history of recurrent respiratory infections since early infancy and gross-motor delay. The infant initially presented with difficulty in breathing and poor feeding as early as 17-days-old, however, he was not further investigated as he recovered with supportive care. At the age of 1 month, he was referred to a cardiologist due to a systolic murmur and found to have mild biventricular hypertrophy (BVH), which was attributed to maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at the time. However, the significant worsening of BVH during subsequent reviews led to a family screening but did not identify any cardiac abnormalities among immediate family members. His prenatal history revealed that his mother had GDM with reasonable glycaemic control on oral hypoglycaemics. He was born at term by an emergency caesarean section (indication: lack of progression of labour) with a good Apgar score, average body weight (+1 SD), and length (+2 SD) at birth. During the first 4 months, he required three hospital admissions due to episodes of breathing difficulty, all of which settled with supportive medical care and/or antibiotic therapy. Subsequently, at the age of 5 months, he was found to have moderate hepatomegaly; thus, directing the investigations towards inborn errors of metabolism leading to storage disorders. When he again presented at the age of 7 months, his growth had defaulted with weight and length at −1 SD of the respective growth charts. On physical examination, he had mild coarse facial features, and there were extra-axial Mongolian blue spots on his left forearm and both ankles. He was tachypneic (>40/min, the normal range for 6–9 months: 25–40), and his heart rate was >100 bpm (the normal range for 6–9 months: 100–150) on nasal prong oxygen. He had non-tender hepatomegaly of 4 cm and reduced muscle tone and power (grade 3/5–4/5; complete movement of limb against gravity but no resistance) in all four limbs. His developmental assessment revealed gross motor delay with head control and sitting achieved 1 month later than usual. He had a healthy sibling, and his family history did not reveal any consanguinity or familial disorders.\n\n【18】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【19】The basic investigations of both infants were revealed to be within normal limits except for the elevated muscle enzymes. The metabolic screening, including plasma ammonia, lactate, arterial blood gas analysis, and urine ketones, failed to reveal any significant abnormality in both infants. However, at their acute presentations with respiratory distress, both infants demonstrated type II respiratory failure (infant A: respiratory acidosis with hypoxaemia, infant B: mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with hypoxaemia), indicating failure of the respiratory mechanism.

As specialist confirmatory tests were not available in Sri Lanka, GAA level assessment was done at the Center of Medical Genetics at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, India, and the genetic studies were done at Archimed Life Science, Austria (for infant A) and Supratech Micropath Laboratory and Research Institute, India (for infant B) using leukocytes of dried blood spots (DBS). Both infants had significantly low total and lysosomal GAA levels, confirming the diagnosis of PD ( table 2 ). Given the clear-cut results, further confirmation by urinary glucose tetra-saccharide (UGlc4) analysis was unnecessary. 10 The molecular genetic studies based on next-generation sequencing revealed their genotypes as compound heterozygous variants of GAA , leading to a severe form of classic IoPD ( table 3 ).\n\n【38】View this table:\n\n【39】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【40】Table 2\n\n【41】Acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase (GAA) activity in leukocytes of the dried blood spots\n\n【42】View this table:\n\n【43】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【44】Table 3\n\n【45】Summary of GAA variant analysis\n\n【46】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【47】Based on the clinical presentation of index patients, the diagnostic workup considered two broad clinical entities: myopathy (due to presence of hypotonia and type II respiratory failure) and organomegaly (due to presence of cardiomegaly and hepatomegaly). For myopathy, glycogenoses (PD, Cori disease), fatty acid oxidation defects (FAOD), carnitine defects, and mitochondrial/oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defects were considered, whereas lysosomal storage disorders such as PD, mucopolysaccharidoses, and Niemann-Pick disease were considered for organomegaly. Each of the above differentials was tentatively excluded based on their key biochemical features. For example, Cori disease (glycogen storage disease, GSD-III) was excluded due to the absence of ketotic-hypoglycaemia, although the history and examination findings with increased markers of muscle damage were compatible. Similarly, OXPHOS defects were less likely due to the absence of prominent lactic acidosis despite the presence of clinical features. FAOD and carnitine disorders were also considered less likely due to the absence of hypoglycaemia but could not be confidently excluded without urine organic acid analysis and plasma carnitine profiling. Although the clinical presentation and cardiomegaly with pericardial effusion were compatible with infective myocarditis in infant A, the absence of fever and normal inflammatory markers made it less likely. Tables 4 and 5 summarise the essential clinical and biochemical findings of diseases with similar presentation to IoPD. Recently, a new search tool was launched by the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism to simplify the differential diagnosis in inborn errors of metabolism. This Inborn Errors of Metabolism Knowledgebase (IEMbase) is designed to match combinations of clinical symptoms and biochemical markers to produce a prioritised differential diagnosis with access to further information on disorders, which is freely available at IEMbase version 2.0.0. 11\n\n【48】View this table:\n\n【49】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【50】Table 4\n\n【51】Comparison of clinical findings of diseases with similar presentation to IoPD\n\n【52】View this table:\n\n【53】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【54】Table 5\n\n【55】Key biochemical findings of pathologies with similar clinical presentations to IoPD\n\n【56】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【57】Irreversible muscle damage had taken place in both infants by the time of confirming the diagnosis of IoPD with enzyme assays at 5 months in infant A and 8 months in infant B, by which time ERT was likely to be less effective. 9 Supportive medical care, including supplemental oxygen with positive airway pressure ventilation, clearing respiratory tract secretions, treating pulmonary infections, gavage feeding for adequate caloric intake, and fluid status management, were provided for both infants. However, both infants died due to cardiorespiratory failure before specific treatment could be started, as ERT was not available in Sri Lanka. Genetic screening of the siblings of index patients for the carrier state did not reveal any pathogenic GAA variants. The parents were given genetic counselling, and they were educated about the 25% possibility of conceiving another child with PD and the 50% possibility of the child being a carrier. Although prenatal diagnosis based on chorionic villus sampling could be undertaken in future pregnancies, it is not freely available in Sri Lanka and was not an affordable option for the families of index patients. Therefore, they were strongly advised to present for genetic testing in the newborn within the first 2 weeks, as a prompt diagnosis before irreversible muscle damage can significantly improve the clinical outcome of an affected infant, though the complete cure is not possible.\n\n【58】Discussion\n----------\n\n【59】Glycogen is the principal storage form of carbohydrate in humans, found mainly in the liver and skeletal muscles. It is a large homopolymer of D-glucose linked by 1,4 glycosidic bonds, with 1,6 branch points at every 4–10 residues. The sequential action of cytoplasmic enzymes on the hepatic glycogen releases glucose into the circulation during fasting, whereas in the muscles, the same process would supply glucose for muscle contraction. Inherited deficiencies of enzymes involved in the glycogenolysis can lead to excessive glycogen accumulation, associated with episodic hypoglycaemia, muscle dysfunction or both. 12 Figure 5 summarises disorders of glycogen degradation alongside the respective enzyme defects. GAA, deficient in PD, releases glucose from glycogen by hydrolysing the 1,4-glycosidic bonds and, to a lesser extent, 1,6 bond. However, this is not to supply glucose but to degrade glycogen taken up by the lysosomes from the cytosol, presumably following the autophagy of damaged structural elements or organelles. Thus, deficiency of GAA causes glycogen accumulation, but not hypoglycaemia and the metabolic sequelae. Therefore, the lack of warning metabolic signs in PD may significantly contribute to the delay in diagnosis as observed in the index patients.\n\n【60】<img/>\n\n【61】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【62】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5</u>\n\n【63】Glycogenolysis pathway with the respective disorders of enzyme deficiency (illustration by UDS). GSD, glycogen storage disease.\n\n【64】Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles containing acid hydrolases, playing a central role in the catabolism of macromolecules such as glycogen, glycosaminoglycans, sphingolipids and proteins. Thus, functional deficits of these hydrolases lead to the accumulation of undigested substrates, a common hallmark of lysosomal storage disorders. The absence of GAA in PD leads to lysosomal accumulation of its substrate, glycogen, causing swelling and rupture of lysosomes with lysosomal dysfunction and subsequent cellular injury, leading to multiorgan involvement. 13 14 Figure 6 illustrates the pathogenesis of PD at the cellular level. As the autophagy-lysosomal pathway plays a crucial role in the degradation of macromolecules, recycling the worn-out organelles, removing toxic substances and cellular adaptation to various stresses, dysfunctional autophagy leads to a cascade of events far beyond the progressive glycogen accumulation. 15 The organ systems involved include; heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), skeletal muscle (hypotonia, reduced muscle power, motor delay, macroglossia and type II respiratory failure), smooth muscle (feeding difficulties), liver (hepatomegaly and hepatocellular damage), and central nervous system (physiological fatigue). 13 16 These symptoms classically manifest during infancy, presenting as IoPD, the most severe form in the PD spectrum. Generally, the disease severity is inversely correlated to the residual GAA activity, with the median age of clinical onset being 1.6 months for IoPD. 4 Muscles being the most prominently involved organ leading to hypotonia and weakness, PD is also classified as a metabolic myopathy. 17 Due to the general hypotonia and respiratory muscle weakness, infants with PD are more prone to pulmonary infections, a prominent clinical presentation observed in index patients.\n\n【65】<img/>\n\n【66】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【67】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6</u>\n\n【68】Pathogenesis of Pompe disease due to lysosomal glycogen accumulation (illustration by UDS). GAA, acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase.\n\n【69】The first description of a PD patient by PJ Pompe in 1932 states that it is a rapidly progressive disease with cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, hypotonia and death due to cardiorespiratory failure within the first year of life, which describes the classical presentation of IoPD. 14 17 However, due to the nonspecific nature of the clinical symptoms that do not directly point towards PD unless considered together, the index of suspicion of PD during initial presentations could be low, especially in geographical areas with a lower incidence of PD. Cardiomegaly being the first alarming sign observed in both infants, it posed a significant diagnostic challenge due to heterogeneous aetiologies associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, including; inborn errors of metabolism, malformation syndromes, neuromuscular disorders, and non-genetic conditions such as maternal GDM accounting for <10% of cases each, while sarcomeric-protein disease accounts for a majority (50%). 18 Due to the rarity of PD and a variety of disorders with a similar presentation, the initial diagnostic workup may overlook PD, as observed in the index patients. This may lead to a symptomatic-management approach during initial presentations, which is detrimental in PD as irreversible muscle damage occurs with time. In fact, the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of infant B was initially attributed to the maternal GDM and expectantly managed until it was observed to increase significantly during serial echocardiography.\n\n【70】Due to the progressive nature of the disease, IoPD patients die within the first year of life without ERT. 4 ERT with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) is the only treatment shown to increase the survival rate of patients, with cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) positive patients demonstrating a better immune tolerance. 19 CRIM status, determined based on the presence or absence of endogenous GAA, is a critical determinant of the successful response to ERT. The capacity to produce even a small amount of endogenous GAA (termed CRIM-positive) induces tolerance to the exogenous rhGAA protein in the patient, thus reducing the likelihood of an immunological reaction against GAA administered as ERT. Conversely, patients who do not produce any endogenous GAA (CRIM-negative) demonstrate poor immunological tolerance to the exogenous rhGAA due to antibody production against the protein, eventually reducing the efficacy of ERT. 8 20 Since the presence of at least one CRIM-positive variant results in CRIM-positivity, both index patients can be labelled as CRIM-positive, indicating that they were possible candidates for ERT.\n\n【71】Early initiation of treatment significantly improves the quality of life as the best motor outcome is achieved by introducing ERT before irreversible muscle damage caused by the buildup of lysosomal glycogen. 8 21 22 Thus, this necessitates early identification of the disease for the best possible clinical outcome of the patient. Initial steps in the diagnostic algorithm for IoPD include clinical vigilance in the early identification of probable PD by adding all the pieces in the puzzle together, including cardiac, respiratory, neuromuscular symptoms and investigation finding of elevated markers of muscle damage, especially CK, a sensitive though nonspecific indicator for PD. 17 The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring GAA activity, which is <1% of normal subjects in IoPD. The genetic analysis is complementary to the diagnosis and particularly useful for identifying the carriers during the family screening. The index patients were found to have compound heterozygous variants leading to IoPD, and the missense variant, c.1560C>A observed in infant B, has only been reported once in the literature as a novel mutation identified in late-onset PD. 23 This finding may add information to the current knowledge base on genotype–phenotype correlation.\n\n【72】The most effective way for early detection of PD would be to assess GAA level in DBS incorporated in the newborn screening, introduced in Taiwan and some states in the USA with a higher incidence of PD. However, this is a controversial area, with disadvantages such as the high cost of treatment and dilemma of whether and when to treat individuals with mild variants of uncertain pathogenicity. 24 To date, Sri Lankan newborn screening programme only tests for congenital hypothyroidism universally, while glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is tested on-demand, and inclusion of PD in Sri Lankan newborn screening is controversial for the same reasons discussed above by van El et al . 24 In a large-scale pilot study on newborn screening for PD in Taiwan, Chien et al diagnosed IoPD in four newborns before the age of 1 month, compared with 3–6 months taken for the diagnosis in the control group. 25 At the time of diagnosis, none of the babies had any clinical symptoms but were found to have increased CK levels (mean=687 U/L) and vacuoles in the muscle biopsy, despite having normal muscle strength. 25 This finding highlights the possibility of using CK as a cost-effective surrogate marker for muscle damage in PD, especially in resource-poor settings. Thus, CK could be used for early selective screening of infants presenting with persistent respiratory symptoms and hypotonia for PD, which may provide a solution to the delayed diagnosis.\n\n【73】PD being a multisystem metabolic disorder, its clinical management requires a multidisciplinary team including a cardiologist, respiratory physician, neurologist, intensivist, metabolic specialist, physiotherapist, occupational and speech therapists, dietician, genetic and psychological counsellors led by an experienced paediatrician. 17 The care should be tailored according to the stage and extent of the disease, with the mainstay of treatment being ERT, which was approved by the FDA in 2006 and includes biweekly administration of rhGAA. However, as rhGAA does not cross the blood–brain barrier, ERT cannot alleviate any neuropathology, thus warranting new treatment approaches capable of simultaneously treating muscular and neuropathology, such as gene therapy, which is still in the experimental state. 26 ERT can significantly improve the overall quality of patients’ and indirectly their family members’ lives, as evident by the conclusion of Chien et al in their study on the long-term prognosis of IoPD treated with rhGAA, which showed that patients achieved near-normal development with residual myopathy. 21 However, the high cost of ERT can be prohibitive to an ordinary family, especially in a developing country, and its feasibility would depend on the proactive involvement of the government. Considering the progressive and lethal nature of IoPD, a significant responsibility falls on the clinical team in providing holistic care for the patient and the family, which essentially includes palliative care as IoPD patients can only coexist with treatment that prolongs life. 27 Furthermore, to empower the family in making suitable medical decisions, the genetic counselling of the family should focus on improving their genetic health literacy, understanding of the future risk and available therapy. 28\n\n【74】Presentation with respiratory symptoms common during infancy, absence of alarming symptoms such as hypoglycaemia, ketoacidosis or encephalopathy, and relative rarity of PD can contribute to lapses in the early diagnosis of IoPD as observed in the index patients. Thus, these cases emphasise the importance of vigilant assessment of common paediatric presentations, which may be masking serious underlying pathologies.\n\n【75】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【76】Given below is the English translation of the narrations in Sinhala by the parents of infant B.\n\n【77】‘We understand that this is a genetic disease, so there is no complete cure for it. But it was heart-wrenching to see our beloved child suffer. We wonder if this disease was diagnosed earlier, before it became worse, would he have had less pain and suffering. We understand that there is a chance of our next child also being affected by this disease. Although a complete cure is not possible, it is a relief to know that a treatment is available to reduce the disability. We have only one child and wish to have a few more children. Therefore, we shall bring our next baby during the first week itself for the genetic testing.’\n\n【78】### Learning points\n\n【79】   Common paediatric presentations should undergo vigilant assessment not to miss any underlying pathologies, especially when recurrent.\n\n【80】   Delayed diagnosis is a major determinant of the overall outcome in infantile-onset Pompe disease.\n\n【81】   Creatine kinase can be used as a cost-effective screening tool for Pompe disease in infants presenting with persistent respiratory symptoms associated with hypotonia.\n\n【82】   Pompe disease should be primarily considered in infants presenting with respiratory symptoms, hypotonia, cardiomyopathy and elevated creatine kinase in the absence of hypoglycaemia.\n\n【83】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【84】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【85】Consent obtained from next of kin.\n\n【86】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【87】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We sincerely thank Professor Priya Kishnani of Duke University School of Medicine—USA, Professor Rasika Perera and Dr. Indika Neluwa-Liyanage of University of Sri Jayewardenepura—Sri Lanka, for their expertise and critical review of the manuscript, and Dr. Ravinder Makkar of Sanofi Genzyme—India, for facilitating the genetic studies.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

He denied any fever or chills, nausea or vomiting. Physical examination revealed right-sided costovertebral angle tenderness with an ill-defined mass. His laboratory workup showed leucocytosis with a white cell count (WBC) of 18.6×10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL with 85% neutrophils and baseline creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL. Urine analysis was cloudy with elevated WBC, red blood cells, positive nitrite and leucocyte esterase. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast demonstrated a markedly enlarged right kidney with ‘bear paw sign’, multiple, low-density areas suggestive of necrosis or abscess corresponding with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) . He was started on a piperacillin/tazobactam combination as empirical therapy for UTI. Urine culture grew 100 000 CFU/mL pansensitive Pseudomonas . He was discharged on an oral antibiotic regimen of levofloxacin for 6 weeks and scheduled for a follow-up on an outpatient basis. On his follow-up after completion of antibiotic therapy, he reported total resolution of his symptoms, and an elective right nephrectomy was planned after counselling. XGP is a rare severe chronic inflammatory disease of the renal parenchyma, which is characterised by the destruction of the renal parenchyma and granulomatous inflammation, with lipid-laden foamy macrophages as well as inflammatory infiltration and extensive renal fibrosis. 1 Although the aetiology of XGP remains unclear, it is commonly associated with recurrent UTIs and obstructive nephropathy. Other proposed aetiologies include altered immune response, congenital urinary anomalies, lipid metabolism abnormalities, malnutrition and lymphatic blockage. 2 XGP might occur in all age groups, but predominantly affects adults. XGP often occurs unilaterally, and bilateral cases are extremely rare, mostly diffuse and occupationally focal. 1 Typical clinical manifestations of XGP are fever of unknown origin, abdomen/flank pain, weight loss, anaemia or palpable renal mass. 1 Commonly isolated pathogenic bacteria are Escherichia coli , Klebsiella and Proteus . Differential diagnosis of XGP includes a large variety of conditions such as Wilms tumour, renal cell carcinoma, renal abscess, infected renal cystic disease and tuberculosis; therefore, CT scan is essential for diagnosis and preoperative evaluation, but a tissue biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis, especially in suspected cases. 3 XGP can be classified based on CT features to either diffuse or focal. In diffuse XGP, typical CT findings include renal parenchymal destruction, which is replaced by multiple, rounded, low-density areas with enhancing rings arranged in a hydronephrotic pattern and hypoenhanced renal parenchyma, described as ‘bear paw sign’. While in focal XGP, CT frequently shows a well-defined hypoattenuated localised intrarenal lesion. Depending on the extent of inflammation, XGP can be classified into three stages: nephric XGP (stage I: confined localised disease to the renal parenchyma), perinephric XGP (stage II: the inflammation extends to the perirenal fat) and perinephric XGP (stage III: the lesion extending into perinephric spaces). 4 5 The standard management is antibiotic therapy and total nephrectomy, but focal XGP can be treated with antibiotics or nephron-sparing surgery. 1 3\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Coronal plane of CT of the abdomen and pelvis showing ‘bear paw sign’: multiple, low-density areas suggestive of necrosis or abscess suggestive of stage II xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【12】Axial plane of CT of the abdomen and pelvis suggestive of stage II xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.\n\n【13】### Learning points\n\n【14】   Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a rare chronic granulomatous inflammation of the renal parenchyma due to recurrent urinary tract infections or obstructive uropathy.

Physical examination revealed normal contour of the cranium and a normal hairline. The face exhibited a long and narrow profile, but individual features were unremarkable in size, shape or position. Neurological examination was notable for central hypotonia and developmental delay. MRI demonstrated a T2-hyperintense, T1-isointense cortical lesion along the left inferior mesial temporal lobe consisting of cystic and solid components, without reduced diffusivity, and multiple solid enhancing nodules on postgadolinium sequences . The neuroradiographic differential diagnosis included ganglioglioma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, with lesser consideration for pilocytic astrocytoma. A stereotactic biopsy of the lesion was performed, and neuropathological evaluation revealed biphasic neoplastic architecture comprising regions of densely compact eosinophilia and other, more microcystic, areas . Piloid cells and a fibrillar background with focal Rosenthal fibres were visible within the compact eosinophilic areas. Large dysmorphic ganglion cells with vesicular chromatin were interspersed throughout the tumour, in addition to intermixed lymphocytic infiltrates. No significant mitotic activity, necrosis or microvascular proliferation were observed. Immunostaining revealed a mixed population of neoplastic cells, with some neoplastic cells and the fibrillar background immunopositive for glial fibrillar acidic protein and other neoplastic cells immunopositive for synaptophysin and NeuN . Sparse (2%) Ki-67 immunopositivity and numerous leucocytes positive for leucocyte common antigen were detected; BRAF p.V600E was not observed (not shown). Microarray analysis and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumour tissue detected no clinically significant abnormalities. However, NGS revealed six variants of uncertain significance in PBRM1 (c.3505C>G), FAT1 (c.4434C>G), TRRAP (c.3636G>C), TSC1 (c.3008C>T), DDIT3 (c.466C>T) and SOX9 (c.769C>T). The functional pathogenic likelihood of each variant, according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, 1 was predicted using the InterVar tool based on human reference genome hg38. 2 3 The mutations in PBRM1, FAT1, TSC1 and DDIT3 were classified as ‘pathogenic’, while those in TRRAP and SOX9 were predicted to be ‘benign’. Overall, the neuropathological findings were considered most consistent with a diagnosis of ganglioglioma (WHO Grade 1), a rare central nervous system (CNS) tumour. 4 The patient remains stable under neuroimaging observation more than 2 years postdiagnosis and seizure-free on antiseizure therapy.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Neuroimaging features of a ganglioglioma in a child with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome.

Although gangliogliomas preponderantly exhibit BRAF mutations, particularly p.V600E, 20–24 that activate MAP kinase pathways, 21 25 these were not observed in our patient’s ganglioglioma, which presented a novel mutation profile. Gangliogliomas are proposed to arise from dysplastic clonal precursors, 26 27 and thyroid hormone preeminently influences neural stem cells and progenitors. 28–30 However, whether AHDS pathophysiology influenced emergence of the ganglioglioma in this patient or it arose stochastically is indeterminate and may be worthy of future investigation.\n\n【14】### Learning points\n\n【15】   Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a multisystemic developmental disorder characterised by a heterogeneous clinical presentation that can include craniofacial deformity, severe intellectual disability and neurological abnormalities.\n\n【16】   AHDS results from loss-of-function mutations of SLC16A2 , an X-linked gene that encodes a transporter to deliver thyroid hormone to the brain during development.\n\n【17】   We present the first case of a ganglioglioma with novel molecular features in a patient with AHDS that may be worthy of future investigation.\n\n【18】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【19】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【20】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The cap and the safety tab of the applicator were removed and loaded with the implant. Applicator was injected in vitreous cavity 3.5 mm from the limbus in the inferonasal quadrant at an angle of 45° with respect to the scleral surface. The actuator button was pressed and an audible click was heard. During the withdrawal of the applicator, it was realised that the implant was partly inside the scleral tunnel and partly in the subconjunctival space (broken into three pieces). A limited conjunctival peritomy was done to remove the implant segments from the subconjunctival space . Part of the implant stuck within the scleral tunnel was held with fine-toothed forceps and gently removed . The entry site and vitreous were inspected for any other implant residues, but none were found. Since we had completely removed all the broken pieces of the implant, a new applicator was used to deliver another dexamethasone implant at a different site. On a follow-up of 6 months, no adverse effect was noted and the intraocular pressure was within the normal limit at every visit.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】(A) External photograph of the left eye (taken intraoperatively) showing retained pieces of Ozurdex implant (blue arrow) in the subconjunctival space after localised conjunctival peritomy.

Fenolland et al reported a case of inadvertent delivery of the Ozurdex implant into subconjunctival space, which was left as such. 1 They decided not to remove the broken implants. We chose to explore as we were not sure of the location of the implant and felt that the intrascleral fragments might not elicit a desired therapeutic response. Accidental intralenticular injection of implant has been reported previously by Chhabra et al requiring cataract surgery after 3 months. 2 In another study, the dexamethasone implant was stuck intrasclerally which was mechanically pushed into the vitreous cavity. 3 In our patient, we did not push the intrascleral fragment because of the fear of crushing it within the scleral tunnel. The safety profile of intravitreal dexamethasone has been reported to be reasonably good, so we decided to inject one more dexamethasone implant in the same sitting and the lack of adverse effects on follow-up further justifies our management approach. 4 The patient responded well to the new implant, with a reduction in macular thickness and improvement in best-corrected visual acuity to 20/30 at 6 weeks postinjection. The present case acknowledges a rare possibility of Ozurdex implant being delivered at an unexpected location, the probable reasons and steps to avoid it. Finally, the authors suggest their technique to tackle it, in case such an event happens.\n\n【13】### Patients’s perspective\n\n【14】I am thankful to the treating physician for explaining the potential complications of a dexamethasone implant. I was relieved when they explained to me that they had removed the broken implant pieces and injected another implant safely. My eye was red for around 1 week postoperatively, which gradually recovered. My vision is gradually recovering, and I am aware of future complications of this implant but currently not facing any trouble.\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】We suggest the following measures to avoid the Ozurdex implant being delivered at an unexpected site:\n\n【17】   Smaller intrascleral tunnel and visualisation of the tip of the applicator in the vitreous cavity before delivering the implant.\n\n【18】   Ensure that the actuator button is completely pressed and is locked flush with the applicator before withdrawal.\n\n【19】   Hear the audible click clearly after pressing the actuator button, wait a while and visualise the implant going into the vitreous if feasible (might not be possible always depending on the direction of the injector/applicator).\n\n【20】   Document and inform the manufacturer for quality control and random check whether the implant gets delivered completely after pressing the applicator key.\n\n【21】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【22】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【23】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies are strongly associated with NLE. Anti-La/SSB and anti-U <sub>1 </sub> \\-RNP antibodies are less frequent. Cutaneous and cardiac manifestations are prominent of NLE. Nearly half of the cases show either cutaneous or cardiac features, and 10% show both. Skin lesions may be congenital or develop within 12–16 weeks postpartum. Commonly, the lesions are characterised by erythematous scaly papules or plaques with annular or polycyclic configuration principally affecting the face and scalp, followed by the trunk and extremities. Characteristic periorbital involvement is described as ‘raccoon eyes’ sign. These lesions usually resolve within a year. Uncommonly, vitiligo-like, morpheaform, erythema multiforme-like, atrophic-telangiectatic, purpuric and discoid-atrophic lesions are seen. Acral papular and bullous lesions have also been described. Cardiac involvement usually develops in the second trimester and is characterised by irreversible complete heart block necessitating pacemaker in almost all the cases. A transient thrombocytopenia occurs in 20% of the cases accounting for the purpuric lesions. 1–4 Here, we report a case of NLE with various types of skin lesions in a newborn of an asymptomatic mother who was incidentally found to have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n【5】A full-term male neonate was brought with lesions on the face and trunk since birth. On examination, multiple erythematous papules with annular, arcuate and polycyclic margins were seen on the abdomen . Also noted on the abdomen was a smooth atrophic hypopigmented plaque with polycyclic erythematous margin, central telangiectasia and areas of brown pigmentation reminiscent of morphoea . Bilateral periorbital erythematous-hypopigmented patches were seen  and the back revealed multiple hyperpigmented atrophic plaques . Rest of the cutaneous and systemic examination was normal. Dermoscopy of the morphea-like lesion showed white globules and structureless areas, telangiectatic vessels, follicular plugging and brown pigmented lines and structureless areas , supporting the diagnosis. 5 Examination of the mother revealed asymptomatic erosions on the hard palate without any other cutaneous or systemic abnormalities. Diagnostic workup of the baby revealed anaemia (8.7 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (92 000 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> ) and normal cardiologic evaluation.

Further workup led to the diagnosis of NLE in the baby and incidental detection of SLE in the mother. Hence, NLE should be considered for congenital atrophic or morphea-like lesions with or without the classical lesions in babies of mothers with or without overt manifestations of collagen vascular diseases.\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】   Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) occurs due to transplacental transfer of autoantibodies in newborns of the mothers with clinical or subclinical collagen vascular diseases.\n\n【17】   Typical cutaneous lesions of NLE are erythematous scaly annular or polycyclic lesions predominantly involving the photoexposed areas. Rare manifestations include vitiligo-like, morpheaform, erythema multiforme-like, atrophic-telangiectatic, purpuric and discoid-atrophic lesions.\n\n【18】   Knowledge of the typical and atypical cutaneous lesions of NLE presenting at birth or developing in the early postnatal life is important for considering NLE among the differential diagnoses and to carry out further diagnostic workup in the baby and mother to establish the diagnosis of NLE and to detect any subclinical collagen vascular disease, respectively.\n\n【19】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【20】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【21】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The post-reduction radiographs revealed the left patellar restored to normal position . The patient accepted a knee brace for temporary fixation and was recommended further surgical intervention. 2 However, the patient decided not to take the surgery and then was asked for a regular follow-up.

His gait was previously normal. He had no symptoms or signs of stroke. He had a 6-year history of impaired verbal fluency and mild executive dysfunctions, consistent with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). On examination, his gait was ataxic, and he had a positive Romberg test (Panel 1 — video 1 ). Power was grossly intact in his lower limbs. He demonstrated mild loss of proprioception of his left big toe. An MRI  a year earlier demonstrated normal hippocampal volume and white matter chronic small vessel ischaemic disease. A cerebral single-photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) was performed and demonstrated widespread CSVD. Compared with the SPECT from 14 months prior , there were new perfusion defects in the left parietal periventricular white matter, the right thalamus and the right anterior temporal cortex as well as more evident perfusion defects in the frontal lobes . Vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency and tabes dorsalis causing Romberg sign were unlikely because B <sub>12 </sub> level and syphilis screen were normal, respectively. As there were no abnormalities to cerebellum perfusion and previous MRI demonstrated no structural cerebellar abnormality, cerebellar cause was also unlikely. Given the absence of bradykinesia, rigidity or tremor, this presentation was inconsistent with Parkinson’s disease. In consideration of this all, a diagnosis of CSVD progression causing the gait disorder and falls was therefore made. CSVD is the most common chronic and progressive vascular disease which affects capillaries, arterioles and small veins supplying the brain’s white matter and deep structures. 1 This condition, if widespread and extensive, can cause gait disturbance 2 3 and uncommonly, a positive Romberg sign.

Diagnosing an obturator hernia clinically is a challenging one and nearly impossible.

Here, we report an unusual presentation of an obturator hernia in a 70-year-old woman who presented to emergency room with acute abdomen and uncomplicated reducible inguinal hernia. Radiological imaging showed obstructed inguinal hernia while on diagnostic laparoscopy, a strangulated and perforated obturator hernia of Richter’s type was seen in addition to an uncomplicated inguinal hernia. Obturator hernia, although very rare, is associated with high morbidity and mortality as it is often underdiagnosed as in our case.

The obturator hernia is most often the Richter's type, which can be a diagnostic challenge as focal strangulation of the bowel can progress to gangrene with or without overt signs of intestinal obstruction. 4 Richter’s hernia is a type of abdominal hernia in which only part of the circumference of the bowel is entrapped and strangulated in the hernial orifice. The segment of the engaged bowel is nearly always the lower portion of the ileum. 5\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 70-year-old woman was brought to the emergency room with uncomplicated reducible swelling in the right inguinal region for the past 3 years with sudden onset of pain over the swelling for 3 days. Pain was severe, gripping in character and constant which was relieved partly on flexion of the thigh. No history of any medical illness nor any previous surgeries. On physical examination, the patient was moderately nourished and built. Her heart rate was 102 beats/min and blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg. Abdomen was soft, not distended with diffuse tenderness present over lower abdominal quadrants with no guarding or rigidity. On local examination, a swelling of size 4×3 cm was seen in the right inguinal region which was reducible with expansile impulse on coughing.\n\n【12】INVESTIGATIONS\n--------------\n\n【13】Ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed a possible right inguinal/femoral hernia with features of obstruction, and advised CT correlation. CT scan of the abdomen was done subsequently which showed a 3×3 cm defect in the right inguinal region with herniating bowel loops and overcrowding of ileal loops over the defect with free fluid noted around the ileal loops suggestive of obstructed inguinal hernia as seen in figure 1 .\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【17】CT image depicting groin defect with overcrowding of bowel loops.\n\n【18】Treatment\n---------\n\n【19】On a diagnosis of obstructed inguinal hernia, patient was posted for diagnostic laparoscopy and proceeded. After insufflation and creating pneumoperitoneum figure 2 , overcrowding of small bowel loops was seen in right inguinal region and pelvis with localised bilious collection of 50 mL in favour of early perforative peritonitis. On releasing the adhesions and bowel loops, a 3×3 cm defect was noted in the right inguinal region with viable bowel loops. On further release, 1.5×1.0 cm defect was noted in the obturator canal with perforation of entrapped bowel loop of Richter’s type seen. Laparotomy was done and a 1 cm perforation in terminal ileum with unhealthy edges was noted 20 cm from ileocaecal junction as seen in figure 3 . Thorough lavage was given. Perforation site resection and anastomoses were done in two layers. Anatomical repair of both the defects was done.

Orals were started on postoperative day 4 after good bowel sounds, escalated to soft solids and discharged on postoperative day 7. The patient was periodically followed up for a period of 1 year who remained asymptomatic.\n\n【34】Discussion\n----------\n\n【35】Obturator hernia is the protrusion of abdominal viscera through obturator canal in which the obturator nerve and vessels pass. This hernia is about six to nine times more common in women than men due to their broader triangular pelvis and greater transverse diameter. It affects women of around 70–90 years of age, the reason being attributed to atrophy of the preperitoneal fat around the obturator vessels in the canal thereby predisposing hernia formation and hence the name ‘little old woman’s hernia’. 3 The major risk factors for obturator hernia are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic constipation and ascites. Diagnosing an obturator hernia at the earliest is very difficult as it usually presents with non-specific signs and symptoms. Although it is a rare abdominal hernia, the mortality rate is as high as 70%. Major clinical symptoms are due to intestinal obstruction like abdominal pain, distension, nausea, vomiting and constipation. They may also have recurrent attacks of intestinal obstruction in the past with or without a palpable mass in the groin. 6\n\n【36】Emergency CT scanning could lead to rapid diagnosis and early surgical intervention and thus optimising the outcome. The use of CT scan in detecting obturator hernia was first reported by Meziane et al in 1983. 7 The common CT scan finding is herniated loop of distal small bowel extending through the obturator foramen between the pectineus and obturator externus muscles. In incarcerated hernia, CT scan shows associated bowel loop dilatation in the abdomen. Since the use of CT scan, preoperative diagnosis rate was improved from 43% to 90% in some reports. 8 However, it is not always possible to diagnose all obturator hernias using CT of the abdomen as seen in our case. Diagnostic laparoscopy serves as a tool in diagnosing and treating occult, suspected and missed obturator hernias on imaging. In our institution, we routinely practice and advocate laparoscopic method for uncomplicated groin hernias including suspected obturator hernias without bowel complications due to advantages like diagnostic accuracy of occult hernias, lesser postoperative pain and other complications. But in this case scenario, due to perforated ileum with peritonitis on laparoscopy and the need for resection and anastomosis, we converted to open surgical approach. Open approach with lower midline is considered the most preferred by many authors as it gives good exposure to the obturator ring and also aids in performing bowel resections when required. 9 In view of peritonitis in this case, mesh (non-absorbable or absorbable) was not employed for further reinforcement as non-absorbable meshes have higher chances of mesh rejection and absorbable meshes can get dissolved in the presence of bacterial infection.\n\n【37】### Learning points\n\n【38】   Obturator hernia, although very rare, is associated with high morbidity and mortality.\n\n【39】   It is often underdiagnosed as in our case; the preoperative finding of hernia was because of the inguinal hernia with no bowel obstruction and it was an obturator hernia which did not show up clinically was strangulated with a perforated bowel of Richter’s type within it. The same could have been easily missed if an inguinal approach had been followed. Laparoscopy bailed us out from missing out a perforation from an occult obturator hernia.\n\n【40】   Laparoscopy should be considered as a tool of choice in cases of an occult obturator hernia and unclear hernias arising from the myopectineal orifice of Fruchaud.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The latter was considered a treatment endpoint and her therapy was discontinued. Review of the patient at week 9 showed further reduction in swelling  and dermoscopy showed complete disappearance of yellow-orange and white areas .

It includes two conditions—Merkelsson-Rosenthal syndrome (chronic lip or facial swelling, facial palsy and fissured tongue) and granulomatous cheilitis of Miescher (swelling confined to the lips). The latter affects young adults involving one or both the lips. Various treatment modalities include systemic or intralesional steroids, clofazimine, minocycline, metronidazole, dapsone, thalidomide and surgery in recalcitrant cases or cases with severe deformation. 1\n\n【15】Dermoscopy of various granulomatous diseases is characterised by a common feature of diffuse or localised yellow-orange areas (corresponding to the diffuse or focal granulomatous infiltration, respectively), commonly with telangiectatic vessels. 2 Similar features were observed in our case, which, in conjunction with the clinical features, prompted a diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis that was confirmed histologically. Disappearance of the yellow-orange areas is a dermoscopic indicator of disease resolution and/or a good treatment response, which was observed on serial dermoscopic follow-up in our case. 3 At week 6, although swelling was still evident clinically, dermoscopy showed complete disappearance of the yellow-orange background which prompted the treatment end point. Follow-up at week 9 showed further reduction in swelling and normal lip architecture on dermoscopy despite treatment cessation at the previous visit (week 6).\n\n【16】This report illustrates that dermoscopy not only assists in the diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis and assessing treatment response, it also appears to indicate the treatment end point earlier than that by clinical assessment alone.\n\n【17】### Learning points\n\n【18】   Granulomatous cheilitis is characterised by a chronic granulomatous inflammatory swelling of lips.\n\n【19】   Yellow-orange areas are the essential dermoscopic features in granulomatous disorders and their disappearance indicates a good treatment response.\n\n【20】   Dermoscopy not only asserts the clinical diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis, but it also helps in assessing treatment response.

The symptomatology of post-COVID-19 syndrome bears significant resemblance to several other postinfectious syndromes such as those that follow Lyme disease, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Zika infection, as well as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), fibromyalgia and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). 7–19 Currently, not much is known about the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 syndrome, but previous data from other related syndromes suggest immune dysregulation as a central cause that can lead to alteration in brain activity as measured on functional imaging. 20–22 To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive case report of detailed findings including abnormal PET brain imaging in the evaluation of a patient with post-COVID-19 syndrome at this time point.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A middle-aged woman with a medical history significant only for hypothyroidism presented to a tertiary medical centre for evaluation of a 9-month history of persistent headache, dyspnoea on exertion, chest pressure, tachycardia, anosmia, parosmia, myalgia, vertigo and fatigue that started after an occupational infection with COVID-19. Shortly following her exposure to COVID-19, which occurred during an occupational exposure in December 2020, she had initial symptoms of fever, dyspnoea, cough, anosmia, fatigue and dysgeusia, as well as rhinorrhoea and left eye pain similar to sinusitis. She was not admitted at this time but was prescribed a 3-week course of dexamethasone. Since that time, her anosmia had continued with the addition of parosmias of burning or foul odour. She continued to experience significant fatigue that ultimately decreased her exercise tolerance and was accompanied by brain fog, chest pressure, dyspnoea on exertion and tachycardia with minimal activity. She noted a decline in cognitive function including short-term memory deficits and an inability to multitask. In January 2021, she awoke with severe dizziness characterised by debilitating vibration sensations and imbalance. She thereafter developed both persistent vestibular dysfunction as well as a persistent headache, which was focused behind her left eye and her left parietal area accompanied by photophobia and phonophobia. She also developed significant pain issues including myalgias in her lower extremities, neck, back and anterior chest wall along with paresthesias in her face, especially on her left side. Additional symptoms through her course included but were not limited to diffuse skin changes, lower extremity oedema, emotional lability/irritability, partial focal seizures, insomnia, palpitations, tinnitus, speech difficulties and salivary gland pain with eating.\n\n【10】Vital signs were normal with a blood pressure of 112/75, oxygen saturation of 98% and pulse of 65, and physical examination was non-contributory except for multiple tender points in the abdomen, anterior chest wall, shoulders and neck.\n\n【11】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【12】Her initial evaluation prior to being seen by our team included laboratory workup that included an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) to 121 mm/hour, positive D-dimer of 1.41 ng/mL (upper limit of normal 0.50) and neutrophilic predominance of 86% on complete blood count (CBC) differential. A brain MRI demonstrated non-specific white matter changes and minimal olfactory enhancement in January 2021, and a fluoroscopic guided lumbar puncture in March 2021 that was negative for infectious causes of her headaches. Two identical gamma restriction bands were observed in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indicative of systemic rather than intracerebral synthesis of gammaglobulins. Videonystagmography testing was abnormal as evidenced by left unilateral weakness and biphasic nystagmus. She additionally had an echocardiogram in July 2021, which was technically limited but reported mild-to-moderate aortic insufficiency and mild aortic sclerosis. A 7-day cardiac monitor performed at the time was negative for worrisome arrhythmias.\n\n【13】Echocardiogram repeated at our institution demonstrated ejection fraction of 71% and normal valves with normal ventricular function with no wall motion abnormality. MRI of the brain repeated 8 months later redemonstrated non-enhancing T2 signal changes in the white matter of the anterior left frontal lobe especially along the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle but otherwise unremarkable . PET CT of the brain using通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> fluorodeoxyglucose for metabolic evaluation revealed non-specific scattered areas of low-level hypometabolism at bilateral frontal, left precuneus, occipital and parietal regions . Quantitative axonal sweat reflexes were normal, heart rate was augmented by 12 on tilt-table testing without significant decrease in blood pressure, and heart rate responses to deep breathing were reduced on autonomic reflex screening.\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【17】Mild olfactory enhancement noted on initial MRI, resolved on follow-up.\n\n【18】<img/>\n\n【19】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【21】Non-enhancing T2 signal white matter changes at the anterior left frontal lobe especially along frontal horn lateral ventricle, as well as a non-specific tiny focus of superior left frontal lobe, unchanged between MRIs.\n\n【22】<img/>\n\n【23】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3</u>\n\n【25】Prominent perivascular spaces in the right greater than left basal ganglia were visualised on MRI.\n\n【26】<img/>\n\n【27】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【28】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4</u>\n\n【29】Global view of PET scan results performed at 9-month mark.

Inflammatory markers were no longer elevated given an ESR of 2 mm/hour and a CRP of <3.0 mg/L. D-dimer was also within normal limits. Endocrine testing including dehydroepiandrosterone, free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels were all normal, though thyroid-stimulating hormone was low at 0.03 mIU/L (lower limit of normal 0.3 mIU/L). Thyroperoxidase antibody was negative at 1.2 IU/mL. An extended autoimmune workup with ANA, CCP, double-stranded DNA, SSA, SSB, Smith, RNP, Scl 70, Jo 1 and rheumatoid factor was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis was negative. Cytokine panel testing showed normal levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Interleukin(IL)-6, interferon beta, IL-10, IL-1 beta, interferon gamma, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), IL-2 receptor alpha soluble, interferon alpha and IL-18 with an elevated level of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 at 228 pg/mL (upper limit of normal 198 pg/mL).\n\n【35】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【36】This patient had a constellation of symptoms that most closely resemble post-COVID-19 syndrome, with features similar to that seen in both ME/CFS and fibromyalgia. It was important to evaluate for potential alternative diagnoses including autoimmune diseases, endocrine disorders and other inflammatory disorders. She had an extensive largely negative workup that is consistent with that expected of the post-COVID-19 syndrome. Importantly, she did show a few markers that could potentially be helpful in the diagnosis of post-COVID-19 syndrome including an elevated MCP-1, blunted vagal response and hypometabolism on brain PET scan.\n\n【37】Discussion\n----------\n\n【38】PASC is remarkably heterogeneous in its presentation and may be better phenotyped by grouping patients by symptom clusters in order to better target treatment by applying lessons learnt from treating similar medical conditions. A subset of patients with PASC will present with a syndromic constellation of symptoms similar to that seen in other post viral illnesses, ME/CFS, fibromyalgia and POTS. 1–5 7 These patients are referred to by several terms including ‘long-haulers’ and ‘long COVID-19’ but are perhaps more appropriately described as having post-COVID-19 syndrome. Diagnosis of the post-COVID-19 syndrome is often frustrating for both patients and medical providers as while diagnostic criteria have been proposed, they have not been widely implemented. 23 Furthermore, these criteria are clinical, and there is no accepted diagnostic testing modality for post-COVID-19 syndrome at this time.\n\n【39】Here we present the case of a middle-aged woman with an occupationally acquired COVID-19 exposure that led to persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis of post-COVID-19 syndrome at 9 months. Salient features of this case include the presence of multiple phenotypes of post-COVID-19 syndrome including fatigue-predominant as well as myalgia-predominant features. We also demonstrate the myriad of symptoms that can be associated with persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms including but not limited to headache, dyspnoea on exertion, tachycardia, myalgia, anosmia/parosmia, vertigo, cognitive dysfunction, emotional lability and fatigue. At this time, existing data suggest that patients with persistent symptomatology, including those with fibromyalgia, ME/CFS and POTS, have a dysregulated immune response that may be responsible for the characteristic syndromic presentations. It is highly likely that this pathophysiology also occurs in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome; indeed, preliminary data from our first 108 patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome does demonstrate an increased incidence of elevation of IL-6. 24 More recently, data have emerged demonstrating decreases in CD8+ T cells in patients with PASC compared with healthy controls and patients who had COVID-19 but did not develop PASC. 25 26 Patients with PASC have also demonstrated a significant decrease in T regulatory cells and elevation in the CD14+, CD16+ and CCR5+ monocyte subsets. 26 Chemokine analysis in patients with PASC was also abnormal with significant elevations in CCL5/RANTES, IL-2, IL-4, CCL3, IL-6, IL-10, interferon gamma and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and significantly lower levels of GM-CSF and CCL4 when compared with healthy controls. 26 In light of these findings, the elevated MCP-1 observed in our patient may represent one feature of the immune dysregulation seen in PASC.\n\n【40】Studies have demonstrated hypometabolic changes on PET scan as well as altered brain recruitment in response to standard stimuli on functional imaging. 20–22 Similarly, patients in the early stages of post-COVID-19 syndrome (3–4 weeks after infection) have been demonstrated to have hypometabolic brain PET scans. 27–29 Review of our patient’s PET scan demonstrates similarities to those presented by Guedj et al 27 but also shows sparing of the gyrus rectus. The significance of this imaging finding will be better demonstrated with larger study cohorts and may indicate a feature of the beginnings of recovery. Demonstrating that these changes are present at 9 months after infection supports the persistence of symptoms and implies that hypometabolic changes on brain PET scan may be a marker of continued post-COVID-19 syndrome and may be useful as a biomarker going forward.\n\n【41】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【42】Backstory: before testing positive for COVID-19 in December 2020, I was a fully employed, healthy woman. I have always been exemplary in my diet, supplement, and exercise regimens – and often got razzed about it! My husband and I live on a farm in a rural area. We have horses and love to trail ride. We have ATVs and a lovely in-ground pool. We also have cattle and goats, and have been active with our family in 4-H. We have always had a garden and beautiful flower beds. I was heavily involved in the loving maintenance required to sustain all of these things—I absolutely love country life.\n\n【43】While at my job, I had several occupational exposures to COVID-19 without a fit-tested N95 mask for PPE.\n\n【44】Within 36 hoursof exposure, I developed a fever of 102 and felt miserable. I tested positive the next morning for COVID-19. My symptoms included lots of upper respiratory drainage with sneezing, headaches, cough, fever, body aches, diarrhea, SOB with exertion, heart palpitations, and extreme fatigue. The Occupational Medicine NP prescribed a Z-Pak and dexamethasone three week taper dose. I expected two weeks off and full recovery, as I have always been very healthy - why wouldn’t I snap back? However, I have been unable to work since.\n\n【45】My initial COVID-19 infection was resolving, but I was still extremely fatigued. Exactly two weeks after testing positive for COVID-19, I began to have strange new symptoms—without any similar history prior to COVID-19. I was dizzy, my head had vibration-like pressure, brain fog, tinnitus, sore joints and muscles, GI upset—I was still so exhausted. I was prescribed Bactrim by my Occupational Medicine NP, guessing it was an inner ear infection—two additional weeks expected for recovery.\n\n【46】I then elected to see my trusted ENT as these new symptoms persisted. Testing was done, I was diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus affecting my vestibular system, tinnitus, and mild-to-moderate unilateral hearing loss. I was given vestibular exercises to do at home, was told 8–12 weeks to recovery if I pushed through the exercises and desensitized my vestibular system. I was given vertigo restrictions by ENT—no driving, swimming, or operating heavy equipment. The vertigo restrictions are still in place nine months later.\n\n【47】Then, days later, came a migraine-like headache behind my left eye and across my left temple and scalp. That evening, I experienced an episode while in bed which started with a feeling of euphoria, followed by twitching in the left arm which migrated to the left side of my face with facial spasms around my left eye and down to my cheek, with residual numbness into the left arm and face which lasted for hours. My left temple has remained so tender that I am unable to sleep on my left side.\n\n【48】The migraine continued, then worsened behind my left eye and left temple, causing me to visit the ER to rule out stroke in January 2021. CT was negative; however, MRI showed some irregularities. Depression set in with a feeling of impending doom, especially at night. Very emotional. Migraines have persisted since January.\n\n【49】Foggy thinking worsened with short-term memory problems, inability to multitask, confusion, difficulty verbalizing appropriately—which led to irritability, more anxiety and depression. My personality is ‘flat’, nothing like my former self. I am still plagued by all of these symptoms.\n\n【50】Neurologist consulted: vertigo, anxiety, hemifacial spasms, and migraine following COVID-19 were diagnosed. Rest and vestibular physical therapy ordered—six months postinfection, full recovery anticipated. Psychologist recommended for anxiety and depression. Weekly psychotherapy by phone starting in early April—very stabilizing but exhausting.\n\n【51】In March, rash broke out on the forehead, cheeks, and nose with sun exposure, again no history of skin problems. Dermatologist seen; told COVID-19 causes rashes, given topical rosacea medication—no results. Rash extended into scalp with hair loss. Topical steroid prescribed, relieved scalp symptoms. Heavy sunscreen and hat required while outside, rash still present.\n\n【52】ENT ordered VNG vestibular testing for my continuing in balance symptoms. Concerning nystagmus found along with other problems. Testing was so tiring and sensitizing, five days complete rest were required afterwards. My brain felt like I had a TBI. ENT corresponded with PCP with grave concerns when testing results were received showing ‘central’ damage.\n\n【53】Heat and cold intolerance developed; heat caused dizziness and profuse sweating, cold causing Raynaud’s in fingers and livedo reticularis on extremities and abdomen.\n\n【54】Neuropathy developed, first in my toes, then fingers—like a bee sting, lasting several minutes to a few hours, onset in the evening. Left facial and scalp numbness has also persisted.\n\n【55】Physical therapist evaluation spawned new recommendation to Neurologist for vision OT and speech therapy. My symptoms were worsening: balance, vision, and speech were all involved. PT worked on inner ear crystals using the canalith repositioning procedure for weeks, imbalance unimproved.\n\n【56】Severe insomnia—everything hurt. Melatonin started by Neurologist recommendation. Complete exhaustion.\n\n【57】Neurologist reassessment with new orders for lumbar puncture and blood testing for multiple disorders, including MS, results largely negative. Orders to continue PT, added vision OT and speech therapy. Trazodone started for insomnia. With worsening symptoms at next neurologist appointment, amitriptyline was started briefly with intolerable side effects, and trazodone was resumed.\n\n【58】Eyes checked by three specialists due to persistent pain behind left eye, difficulty focusing, photophobia, shapes appearing in my visual field. All three specialists concluded there was nothing wrong with my eyes—‘it’s not your eyes causing the problem…’\n\n【59】Weekly PT, plus new vision OT and ST were started. This routine kept me completely exhausted—like I was on a roller coaster. I slept for days after each therapy session, then repeat.\n\n【60】During a PT evaluation of my nystagmus utilizing a head roll maneuver, I had another ‘episode’ which started with a feeling of euphoria/fear, bursting into tears uncontrollably, and my left leg and arm had twitching that ‘marched’ up into my face, around my left eye, down into my cheek, then around the left side of my mouth. This episode was stronger and made me realize that the ‘episodes’ I was experiencing were actually Focal Aware Seizures.\n\n【61】Every body system was negatively affected by June. Then I developed weight gain with generalized edema, and 2+ pitting edema in my left ankle and foot, chest discomfort, frequent heart palpitations, bradycardia, and greater SOB with exertion. My PCP ran testing for ‘everything \\[she\\] could think of’. TSH low normal, thyroid medication dose was increased. A proBNP was elevated to 253 - Entresto started for what appeared to be mild heart failure. Echo showed mild-to-moderate aortic insufficiency. Heart monitor showed bradycardia to 37bpm to tachycardia in the 130s with arrhythmias at rest. PCP discussed my worsening symptoms and my husband asked if she would refer me to a tertiary care center so we could get some answers—she agreed and contacted the referral center immediately. Neurologist consulted and agreed with PCP, stating this center would be their next recommendation.\n\n【62】My husband and I had been raised to believe this particular referral center is the place to go when you really need medical help. We were completely exhausted, confused, and angry after evaluations and testing by a myriad of local doctors, specialists, and therapists—all with largely negative testing results and similar or conflicting phrases. ‘COVID-19 is new, there aren’t any scientific studies yet’ and ‘these symptoms may be COVID-19 related, we just don’t know about COVID-19’. Or, the ‘you should be recovered after \\\\\\ weeks/months’ teamed with ‘you need to completely rest’, or ‘you need to desensitize your vestibular system and stay active to get better’.\n\n【63】I was over six months post COVID-19 infection walking with a Rollater and still unable to drive a car. I had intolerable, worsening symptoms and no answers—my husband and I were both physically and emotionally drained. When the referral center called me, wanting to schedule an appointment - I literally cried! It was three months wait to be seen at their Post COVID-19 Clinic, but they gave me that the hope I desperately needed. All of my local doctors and therapists were eager to get their answers too!\n\n【64】We drove over 600 miles to the Post COVID-19 Clinic. It was definitely worth the drive. The facility was huge and intimidating at first, but everyone we spoke to was extremely helpful and courteous.\n\n【65】I cannot say enough good about my Post COVID-19 physician and his delivery of knowledge on Post COVID-19 Syndrome. For the first time, I was speaking with a doctor who understood what I had been going through and had answers! He thoroughly listened, answered questions and explained what he believed was causing my symptoms and the tests he was ordering to confirm. He and his staff were also very responsive, accommodating our need to see other specialists and having testing completed within as few days as possible. After my testing results were completed, he took the time to thoroughly explain what was found and my final diagnosis, answering all of our questions and laying out the Post COVID-19 Clinic plan of care for patients with Post COVID-19 Syndrome. For the first time since my symptoms began, I had hope!\n\n【66】As with my post COVID-19 physician, the three other specialists I saw, the nurses, and the technicians were all very professional and took time to do their job well and unhurried with excellent communication. Each employee seemed genuinely happy and engaged in their duties, all of which helped me to better tolerate a multitude of tests and appointments.\n\n【67】The patient education delivery was unique, given via Zoom meeting from home. Their Post COVID-19 Syndrome educational Zoom meetings were well-presented, engaging, and enlightening. For the first time, I fully understand why I feel like I do. More importantly, I now have guidance on how I can relieve symptoms by rethinking and differently managing my personal health practices. I will also be given a health coach for six sessions over the next six months to help me institute my new Post COVID-19 Syndrome plan of care.\n\n【68】I cannot discuss what COVID-19 has done to me without mentioning what it has done to my husband. He has been there every step of the way and it has wreaked havoc on his mental and physical health. Without his dedicated support, I am unable to function independently. I cannot imagine being less fortunate and not having a support system with Post COVID-19 Syndrome.\n\n【69】### Learning points\n\n【70】   The post-COVID-19 syndrome is common, occurring in approximately 10%–30% of patients who have recovered from acute COVID-19 infection.\n\n【71】   Patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome often have a constellation of symptoms that are life limiting but have a generally negative workup.\n\n【72】   Diagnosis of post-COVID-19 syndrome requires a high index of clinical suspicion.\n\n【73】   There are no definitive diagnostic tests for post-COVID-19 syndrome; however, we present the hypometabolic PET scan of the brain, elevated MCP-1 and blunted vagal response as potential supporting tests for the diagnosis of this prevalent condition.\n\n【74】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【75】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【76】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

MRI demonstrated a non-specific T2-hyperintense lesion involving the left putamen, globus palidus, thalamus, and internal, external and extreme capsules without reduced diffusivity on apparent diffusion coefficient sequences and without evidence of contrast enhancement . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the lesion revealed elevated choline-to-creatine ratios without evidence of a lactate peak  that could be consistent but non-diagnostic of neoplasm. MRI of the spine was normal (not shown). The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin at the outside hospital for presumptive diagnosis of a demyelinating disorder based on neuroimaging features. Inflammatory markers and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infectious/inflammatory studies were normal, and the patient was subsequently discharged.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Neuroimaging features of unusual paediatric-type diffuse low-grade glioma.

Serum and CSF germ cell markers were performed to assess for an unusual germ cell tumour that were negative along with negative CSF cytology. Due to lack of radiographic improvement, the patient underwent a robotic-guided biopsy following obtaining informed consent, which demonstrated primarily white matter with marked oedema, within which was a paucicellular proliferation of infiltrating glial cells with mild nuclear pleomorphism and a myxoid background, specifically without vascular proliferation and necrosis . Immunohistochemistry was positive for GFAP, synaptophysin (in enlarged axons and scattered neuron) and CD68 (in few scattered cells), and showed elevated Ki-67 (5% positivity) and negative for H3K27M consistent with a histological diagnosis of paediatric-type diffuse low-grade glioma. Next-generation sequencing and microarray testing of the tumour were normal as was a germline cancer gene panel. Methylation analysis clustered with low confidence (0.266) with the MYB subgroup and was non-diagnostic. Based on the negative genetic testing and non-diagnostic methylation analysis, the tumour was best classified as a paediatric diffuse type of low-grade glioma not elsewhere classified. 1\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【13】Histological features of unusual paediatric-type diffuse low-grade glioma.

We present a case of vaping-related pneumothorax and make recommendations for structured reporting of this emerging cause for pneumothorax. A normal-weight 34-year-old male presented to our emergency department with dyspnoea and back pain increasing over 24 hours. Chest X-ray showed a large right-sided pneumothorax. Three years ago, he had quit smoking cigarettes and switched to vaping. CT scan revealed bullae, and the patient received apical lung resection. Histology revealed mild alveolitis. Vaping is an emerging cause of lung injury. This report demonstrates a potential association between vaping and pneumothorax. However, structured reporting and future research are needed to establish a definitive (or causal) relationship between vaping and pneumothorax.\n\n【2】   pneumomediastinum\n   pneumothorax\n   drug misuse (including addiction)\n   tobacco-related disease\n   cardiothoracic surgery\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Increased marketing of these devices has been paralleled by reports of e-cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI), 1 life-threatening bronchiolitis (similar to bronchiolitis obliterans or ‘popcorn lung’), 2 persistent severe fixed airway obstruction 3 and asthma. 4 The first regular publication of a case of a vaping-related primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) was published online in September 2019 from Harvard Medical School. 5 A case of vaping-related secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) that was experienced shortly after treatment for vaping-induced pneumonitis was reported in November 2019 from Corpus Christi Medical Center in Texas, USA. 6 Before and after these two publications, several conference abstracts of cases of vaping-related pneumothorax have been published.\n\n【10】PSP is a well-known disorder in young otherwise healthy adults that is associated with numerous risk factors. These risk factors include being underweight, lean habitus, scuba diving, high altitude, flying, smoking and, more specifically, smoking cannabis.\n\n【11】Risk factors like being underweight or atmospheric pressure changes generally are accepted as contributing to or causing pneumothorax. However, it is still a matter of debate whether other factors such as smoking cannabis predispose individuals to or otherwise contribute to PSP. One reason for this continuing debate is missing information from case reports and case series. 7 8\n\n【12】As this report is now the seventh regular publication about pneumothorax in association with vaping, it is worthwhile considering the information that should be included for such cases and for reviews.\n\n【13】In this study, we used the CARE checklist to report a case of a patient presenting with a pneumothorax associated with vaping without the patient ever consuming cannabis. As we expect further cases to be reported for pneumothorax in relation to vaping, we report our case together with recommendations for standardised reporting of this relationship. In the absence of standardised reporting, drawing a causal link between vaping and PSP will be difficult if not impossible. 9 10\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】In October 2019, a 34-four-year-old white male presented to his general practitioner with a 1-day history of back pain, shortness of breath, tightness in his chest, burning pain in his right chest, retrosternal pain and feeling dizzy. Symptoms started after minor exertion during the afternoon on the day before presentation.\n\n【16】### Medical history\n\n【17】No specific health problems occurred during adolescence. His previous medical history was otherwise unremarkable apart from a few rib fractures on his right side sustained through a cycling accident 3 years ago. There was no family history of lung disease. As a trained nurse, the patient worked in outpatient palliative care and devoted his free time to strength training and competitive sports. Due to his occupation, he had regular health checks, all negative for infectious diseases. He had no recent sports trauma to his chest. Despite being an active and internationally successful athlete, he smoked 20 cigarettes per day from the age of 21 years to the age of 31 years. Three years ago, he quit smoking by switching to vaping nicotine. He never smoked or vaped cannabis. He reported a pattern of regular deep and slow inhalation with the vaping device throughout the day similar to smoking a pack of cigarettes.\n\n【18】### Clinical findings\n\n【19】On physical examination, we saw an athletic male with normal body mass index (BMI 23.6, 184 cm body height and 80 kg body weight). There were no signs of chronic lung disease such as finger clubbing, chronic cough, wheezing or sputum production. Neurology examination was unremarkable. During the patient’s initial visit to his general practitioner, vitals included a heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 143/91 mm Hg, peripheral oxygen saturation without air supply of 98% and a respiratory frequency of 15 per minute. His ECG demonstrated signs suggestive of myocarditis. The patient arrived at our emergency department 2 hours later with normal peripheral oxygen saturation of 98%, but increasing tachypnoea with 24 breaths per minute. His heart rate and blood pressure remained normal, and there was no enlarged jugular vein pulse or cyanosis. Respiratory frequency returned to normal rates with 3 L of nasal air flow supply. ECG demonstrated again changes in V3–V5 suggestive of myocarditis . His skin was dry and warm on palpation with a temperature of 36.8°C, and his tongue was of healthy appearance. His heart sounds were regular on auscultation and breathing sounds were absent on the right side of his chest. Percussion revealed tympanitic chest sounds on the right. The patient complained of acute pain in his chest.\n\n【20】<img/>\n\n【21】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【23】ECG on admission demonstrating ST-elevation in V3–V5 (40 Hz, 50 mm/s, 10 mm/mV).\n\n【24】### Diagnostic assessment and therapeutic intervention\n\n【25】His chest X-ray demonstrated a large (according to Collins formula 11 ) right-sided pneumothorax  and a small right-sided pleural effusion. Immediate insertion of a right-sided chest tube led to pain relief and normalisation of the ECG.\n\n【26】<img/>\n\n【27】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【28】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【29】Posteroanterior chest X-ray in inspiration on presentation, demonstrating a large right-sided pneumothorax.\n\n【30】Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were discussed with the patient, and a decision was made for a CT thorax scan. The CT scan demonstrated a bilateral inflated lung, the inserted chest tube on the right side, apical bleps of approximately 0.5–1.0 cm in diameter and a small stripe of remaining apical pneumothorax. Blood tests did not reveal any inflammation or other abnormal findings. After successful removal of the chest tube, the patient was discharged and returned for follow-up examination 1 week later in our outpatient department. During the visit, the patient stated his desire to proceed with bullae resection. Being active in martial arts and internationally successful, he feared of another episode of a pneumothorax leading to a further delay in his training.\n\n【31】The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) resection of the apical bullae and partial apical pleurectomy. Intraoperatively, the apical bullae and a minor clear fluid collection could be demonstrated with no other visible lung pathology. The resection specimen revealed the site of ruptured bullae. The patient made an uneventful recovery. Perioperatively, the patient received routine tyloxapol inhalations four times daily. Standard analgesia contained oral metamizole, ibuprofen and oxycodone/naloxone.\n\n【32】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【33】After uneventful recovery and chest tube removal, the patient was discharged and re-evaluated 10 days later in the outpatient clinic. The patient reported normal breathing and no need for analgesia. He returned to work 4 weeks after discharge from our care and gradually resumed sports activities 6 weeks after surgery. The patient did not stop using his vaping device during treatment and continued use at follow-up. We invited the patient to review his histology slides under a twin microscope and counselled him regarding chronic health effects of smoking and vaping. He was asked to self-assess his vaping habits with the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI, German version). While he reported being a frequent vaper, his SRHI score (0.83) suggested only a modest level of habitual use.\n\n【34】### Histology\n\n【35】The histology of this resection specimen revealed a subpleural bulla with typical histopathology of a pneumothorax with bulla rupture and small resorbed micro-bleeding. The surrounding lung tissue was characterised by a loss of lung parenchyma and by destruction of alveoli so that there was permanent dilation of airspaces. Large dilated airspaces—bulging from beneath the pleura—were clearly visible. There was also residual lung tissue with mild macrophagocytic alveolitis and signs of mild, chronic, fibrosing inflammation. Hyperdistention of alveolar ducts associated with rupture of alveolar septa was also seen. The specimen did not reveal lipid-laden macrophages.\n\n【36】### Vaping device used\n\n【37】The basic anatomy of vaping devices can be found in vaping-related internet content. 12 Our patient used an atomiser-type Vapefly Brunhilde MTL RTA 8 mL (MTL—mouth to lung, RTA—rebuildable tank atomiser). The coil used was a Geek Vape Stainless Steel 316 L , 15 wraps with 1.08 Ω, used with 20 W. Wicking for the coil was Wic ‘N’ Vape Cotton Bacon Prime . The Mod (battery carrier) was a VooPoo Drag 2 Box Mod . The vaping device was used with the following e-liquid: Dampfplanet Liquidbase VG50/PG50 (VG—vegetable glycerin, PG—propylene glycol) with Dampfplanet nicotine shot 20 mg/mL without flavour. The e-liquid was mixed with nicotine to achieve a concentration of 6 mg/mL. The patient stated that he uses his vaping device on a daily basis and consumes approximately 16 mL of e-liquid per day.\n\n【38】### Analysis of previous case reports and recommendations for reporting\n\n【39】We analysed six previously published case reports and case series 5 6 13–16 and several conference abstracts 17–25 of pneumothorax in association with vaping. We only analysed reports in English. Information on patient demographics, medical conditions, presenting symptoms, diagnostic findings and outcomes was examined. Results are reported in table 1 . Given the relative paucity of data on the relationship between vaping and pneumothorax, we used a tabular evaluation of existing case reports and conference papers. This method has been previously used by DeVito et al . 26 In their review, the authors aimed to elucidate the impact of nicotine exposure from vaping devices on addiction and psychiatric symptoms and produced a qualitative table to depict standardised information. Here, we present a similar qualitative table that provides standardised information relevant to the aims of the current case report.\n\n【40】View this table:\n\n【41】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【42】Table 1\n\n【43】EVALI-associated pneumothorax in relation to demography, complications and treatment\n\n【44】Discussion\n----------\n\n【45】We presented a case of a young, healthy athlete who reported daily nicotine vaping and experienced an episode of spontaneous pneumothorax. This pneumothorax likely was a secondary spontaneous pneumothorax based on the presence of emphysematous bullae observed via his CT scan and histology slides. By analysing previous pneumothorax cases with vaping-related lung injury, we found two distinct types of pneumothorax presentation. Sixty per cent of reports analysed through table 1 demonstrated pneumothorax together with the truly horrifying changes of the lung parenchyma on CT scans that marked the EVALI outbreak in the USA with ground glass opacities (GGO), ‘crazy paving patterns’, absurdly large bullae in young people, bronchiectasis and volume loss (ie, the GGO group). 27 In contrast, our patient was an athlete presenting with pneumothorax secondary to emphysema due to smoking and vaping nicotine without major structural changes of the lung parenchyma. The last seven cases in table 1 share similar clinical presentation and outcome including our case (ie, the non-GGO group). Chest X-rays and CT thorax scans of these patients did not show any major parenchymal changes together with a pneumothorax. There was no statistically significant age difference between the GGO and the non-GGO groups (27.1 vs 21.4 years, p=0.16). BMI, nutritional status or body habitus of the patients rarely were reported, so we could not examine differences based on these factors. All patients in the non-GGO group were male, their previous medical history was unremarkable and they had no current infection or infectious diseases. Interestingly, although information on vaping duration was not included in seven cases reports, the numbers extracted give the impression that the duration of vaping in the GGO group was rather short compared with the more uncomplicated pneumothorax in the non-GGO group (10.8 vs 21.8 months, p=0.31). The relatively short vaping duration observed in the GGO group is consistent with the presentation of EVALI cases observed during the 2019 outbreak in the USA.\n\n【46】Despite pneumothorax being a major complication of vaping and despite a strong association between smoking cannabis and pneumothorax as well as between vaping and use of cannabis in vaping products, information on cannabis use and toxicology proof was not available for all cases reviewed. In addition, information used to classify pneumothorax (PSP or SSP) like the presence of coughing or thoracic strain was not provided in several reports. Therefore, we reclassified the pneumothoraces into PSP and SSP according to an accepted definition and according to the information given in the reports. 28 Only two of the pneumothoraces in the non-GGO group might be regarded as vaping-related primary spontaneous pneumothoraces. Interestingly, none of the patients in the non-GGO group developed bilateral pneumothorax, whereas 5 of 11 patients in the GGO group developed bilateral pneumothorax. In 7 of 11 cases in the GGO group, pneumothorax developed with a latency of 4–18 days after presentation. Furthermore, 4 of 11 patients in the GGO-pneumothorax group needed ECMO support. None of the patients similar to our patient (non-GGO group) developed respiratory failure. In both groups, recurrent pneumothoraces and bronchial fistula occurred. Interestingly, Gonsalves and colleagues reported recurrent pneumothorax after PSP in three out of three EVALI cases. 29 Here, we found recurrent pneumothorax after PSP and after SSP in both the GGO and non-GGO groups. In five of the cases reviewed in table 1 , no information on pneumothorax management could be retrieved.\n\n【47】Table 2 is a checklist-type table that we created based on previous reviews of EVALI cases and our own experience that may be used to encourage standardised reporting of vaping-related pneumothorax. 29–33\n\n【48】View this table:\n\n【49】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【50】Table 2\n\n【51】Checklist for reporting of vaping-related pneumothorax\n\n【52】Our patient also presented with rather rare ECG changes suggestive of myocarditis. There are few reports of such ECG changes with a right-sided pneumothorax. 34 ECG changes resolved quickly after chest tube insertion on the day of admission. Management with VATS resection of the right lung apex was successful, and the patient restarted training in martial arts 6 weeks after the operation. Histology of the lung specimen revealed typical pathology of nicotine smoking-related pneumothorax. No specific investigations are known for pathology specimens from vaping-associated pneumothorax.\n\n【53】The patient demonstrated in-depth knowledge of his vaping device and reported that it helped him to quit smoking 3 years ago. Prior to switching to vaping, the patient smoked approximately 20 cigarettes per day for a period of 10 years despite being a successful athlete. The patient reported his athletic ability increased after switching to vaping. The patient was well aware that, in the long term, there might be significant changes to his fitness due to structural changes in his lungs and vessels. The patient clearly understood that vaping nicotine might help quit smoking nicotine but might not lead to a decreased spectrum of related illnesses.\n\n【54】As was the case with smoking, it likely will be decades after the introduction of e-cigarettes until the full picture regarding associations between vaping and diseases emerges. The current report is only the seventh case report to highlight vaping-related pneumothorax. However, pneumothorax in young adults has been strongly associated with cigarette smoking and cannabis use; case–control studies have established both as significant risk factors for pneumothorax. 35 Yet, evidence of a causal relationship is lacking. Moreover, whole case series of vaping-related lung injury have been published without any patient experiencing a pneumothorax. 32 36 Compared with this report, Jonas et al identified 8 patients with pneumothorax among 216 published cases with vaping-associated lung injury. 31 In 2019, research has, for the first time, tried to identify cannabinoids in lung tissue of young adults with pneumothorax. 7 While this is an important step in understanding the relationship between cannabis use and pneumothorax, evidence of cannabinoids in lung tissue does not provide proof of a pathology mechanism. Similarly, it might be difficult to establish a causal relationship between vaping and pneumothorax. However, if such a relationship exists, we expect to see a rise in cases of pneumothorax that accompanies the increased popularity of vaping. Building on the evidence of a cannabis–pneumothorax association, we provided recommendations through table 2 about reporting vaping-associated pneumothorax. As no systematic pathology examination of lung tissue from patients with vaping-associated pneumothorax exists today, there should be an international agreement on what to look for in such specimens.\n\n【55】The mechanism of developing a pneumothorax with vaping is likely to be complex. A factor that has long been suspected of contributing to pneumothorax is inhalation technique. Of note, inhalation technique is one of the main differences between smoking tobacco cigarettes, smoking cannabis and vaping. The importance of researching variation in inhalation technique is underscored by the results of a study on ‘dripping and e-cigarettes’ from Yale University School of Medicine. 37 Dr Krishnan-Sarin and colleagues describe that, among 1080 (main sample n=7045) students from eight Connecticut high schools, 282 students (mean age, 16.4 years) used dripping. Dripping is a technique where e-liquids are vaporised directly via application to the atomiser coil to produce a stronger flavour, thicker cloud of vapour and a ‘stronger throat hit’. Dripping can lead to inhalation of higher temperature vapour and exposure to non-nicotinic toxic byproducts such as volatile aldehydes (formaldehyde) in toxic concentrations. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to ask patients about inhalation technique to understand the development of vaping-associated pneumothorax.\n\n【56】A major criticism in reporting of cannabis-related and smoking-related pneumothorax has been the absence of standardised information about smoking habits in case reports and cohort studies. 31 32 38 39 Recognising similar problems in addiction research, the European Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) recommended the use of standard questionnaires in 2002. 40 The EMCDDA questionnaire has been used in a large Danish cohort study to establish cannabis as a risk factor for PSP, 35 but the EMCDDA questionnaire has not yet been updated to include assessments of e-cigarette use. Until psychometrically sound measures of e-cigarette use are included in large, standardised surveys like the EMCDDA, it is critical to source reliable and valid measures of e-cigarette use and related behaviours elsewhere. In this study, we used the SRHI, a recently validated measure of habitual e-cigarette use. 41 To increase the scientific rigour and interpretability of findings related to e-cigarette use, the use of validated measures like the SRHI is strongly recommended.\n\n【57】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【58】People are likely to think about lifestyle factors contributing to a dramatic episode of illness and hospitalisation while recovering. After reading a lot and asking myself questions, it is still difficult for me to decide whether there is an association between my vaping and experiencing an episode of recurrent pneumothorax. If there is, how are we going to find out the most important contributing factors? There are a wide variety of flavours, mixing ratios of VG and PG and nicotine concentrations in the e-liquid. Moreover, there are different metals used for the coils, energy settings and inhalation techniques. These multiple factors might render it impossible to estimate any correlation between vaping and pneumothorax. Generally, I am very grateful for having my vaping devices as it helped me quit smoking. Currently in my opinion, smoking is still much more harmful than vaping. Taking my occupation as a palliative care nurse into account, this episode with a pneumothorax sharpened my existing views of risks of daily life. One should live the life he wants to live and should enjoy what he wants to enjoy. To know about risks is absolutely worthwhile for making informed decisions, but quality of life is very individual and important too.\n\n【59】### Learning points\n\n【60】   Vaping nicotine may cause pneumothorax.\n\n【61】   For patients with pneumothorax and a background of vaping, ask about inhalation technique and e-liquids used.\n\n【62】   Ask for vaping habits using, for example, the Self-Habit Reporting Index.\n\n【63】   Counsel for vaping-related health effects.\n\n【64】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【65】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【66】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The most common age range at presentation is 3 months to 36 months. 2 If intussusception develops in a patient outside this age range, a pathological lesion should be sought as the lead point. In our patient, PCI developing in the caecum acted as the lead point, telescoping the caecum into the transverse colon. Although most PCI cases can be managed conservatively, complications, including intussusception, are sometimes known to occur. 3\n\n【20】In the present case, abdominal radiography played a major role in diagnosing intussusception because the intramural air in the large intestine hampered ultrasonographic evaluation. On abdominal radiograph, delineation of the tip of the intussusceptum outlined by the intestinal air within the intussuscipiens is called the meniscus sign, which is known to be highly specific to ileocecal intussusception. 4 Although the air within the transverse colon was not seen on abdominal radiograph in our patient, intramural air in the inverted caecum outlined the crescent-shaped contour of the intussusceptum, leading to the suspicion of intussusception. In patients with PCI, a crescent-like distribution of cysts on an abdominal radiograph may serve as an important clue to detecting this complication.\n\n【21】### Learning points\n\n【22】   Intussusception is a rare complication of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis.\n\n【23】   Since ultrasonographic evaluation could be hampered by intramural air, an abdominal radiography may serve as an important clue to detecting intussusception in patients with pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis.\n\n【24】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【25】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【26】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

She had developed a flare of lupus nephritis months prior to presentation and received prednisone 20 mg/day. She had no history of injection drug use. She had a history of atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria of 2.8 g/day on admission. Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies were present according to the serum analysis. This finding was compatible with secondary APS. Brain MRI revealed an acute right cerebellar infarction . No stenosis or occlusion was found in the intracranial arteries.

After 2 weeks, heparin was switched to warfarin. Prednisone was increased to 50 mg/day and mycophenolate mofetil was added to treat lupus nephritis as proteinuria greater than 2 g/day persisted.

Ablation was done ultrasound guided, confirming the absence of thrombus on completion of the procedure. On the day of presentation, she had a follow-up visit to obtain duplex ultrasound of her right lower extremity (RLE) as part of the postprocedural protocol, which revealed a non-compressible femoral vein, indicating deep venous thrombosis (DVT). While the ultrasound technician was performing a thorough ultrasound compression test on the proximal femoral vein, common femoral vein and superficial femoral vein, the technician noticed a dislodge of the DVT from the femoral vein, followed by recovery of compressibility of all venous systems . The patient was referred to the emergency department for further evaluation. On arrival, patient was asymptomatic, vital signs were unremarkable and physical examination was unrevealing except for varicose veins and a taped postprocedural site seen on the RLE . CT of the chest with contrast revealed a thrombus involving the right middle lobe pulmonary artery . Transthoracic echocardiogram did not reveal any right ventricular strain. However, brain natriuretic peptide was elevated to 640 pg/mL and high-sensitivity troponin I was mildly elevated to 21 ng/L, indicating submassive PE. Patient was compliant with medication and denied previous history of thrombosis nor family history of hypercoagulation. Initial hypercoagulation work-up was also unrevealing. She was treated with heparin inpatient and was transitioned to apixaban on discharge.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Recovery of ultrasound compressibility seen after dislodge of the thrombus in the proximal femoral vein (A).

In general, age is one of the highest independent risk factors for DVT. 2 In this case, it is likely that age played a large role, along with potential venous static pathology in this specific population undergoing EVRFA, inflammatory process as a nature of the procedure and immobility that comes with age and postprocedural discomfort of the leg. In addition, this case was highly alarming in developing a large proximal DVT only 1 day after the procedure, which is very early in the postprocedural course, while follow-up duplex ultrasound was commonly performed after 1 week in previous studies. 1 It is important to recognise the under-reported complication of PE/DVT in elderly patients undergoing EVRFA, as mortality is high for elderly patients with PE. 3 When clinicians encounter geriatric patients with varicose veins, EVRFA should be carefully discussed after individualised risk evaluation for PE/DVT.\n\n【14】### Learning points\n\n【15】   A rare case of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was reported in an elderly patient who underwent endovenous radiofrequency ablation (EVRFA) of the right great saphenous vein characterised by a rapid onset.\n\n【16】   When clinicians encounter geriatric patients with varicose veins, EVRFA should be carefully discussed in consideration of individualised risk evaluation for PE/DVT.\n\n【17】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【18】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【19】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Purpureal rashes are essentially patches of petechiae. They are commonly described and seen together though petechiae are caused by intradermal capillary bleeding while purpuric lesions result from bleeding within the skin or coalescence of smaller petechiae. A spectrum of pathologies can lead to the appearance of these rashes. 1 Traditionally purpureal and petechial rashes are due to underlying thrombocytopaenic clotting disorders for instance autoimmune conditions, anticoagulant medications or due to non-thrombocytopaenic factors such as cutaneous blood vessel damage following strenuous exercise, muscular activity such as in marathon runners or after long walks. 2 3 The former conditions require effective clinical management while resting, reassurance is all that is required for activity-induced purpureal and petechial rashes. A high index of suspicion, awareness, focused history, clinical examination and complementary investigations can assist in differentiating between the two scenarios.\n\n【5】Here we present a man in his 60s who developed spontaneous onset exercise-induced petechiae (EIP) of his forearm following railing-assisted squat exercise at a gymnasium.\n\n【6】A man in his sixth decade developed diffuse erythematous, petechial rashes predominantly over the volar aspect of both forearms , and to a lesser extent on the thighs on three successive occasions, after recently starting railing-assisted squats at his gymnasium . He took a 40 mg angiotensin II receptor blocker tablet for hypertension and a lipid-lowering medication once daily.\n\n【7】<img/>\n\n【8】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【10】(A,B) Exercise-induced petechiae with diffuse erythematous, petechial, non-blanching rash present predominantly located on the volar aspect of the left forearm (A) and right forearm (B) after squatting exercise at the gymnasium.\n\n【11】<img/>\n\n【12】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【14】Clinical photograph showing railing-assisted squat manoeuvre being undertaken at a gymnasium by a man in his 60s. Note the position of both upper limbs.\n\n【15】For the first time these appeared after 150 squats and subsequently after 200 and 250 squats. The petechial rashes (1–3 mm) were itchy and of non-blanching nature. Apart from local discomfort, these did not result in any restriction of joint movements and the rashes disappeared spontaneously after an hour, without any residual effect.\n\n【16】Precautionary laboratory investigations for bleeding and clotting disorders (platelet count, bleeding and clotting time, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin clotting time), and the capillary fragility test were normal.\n\n【17】The patient was managed with reassurance and suggested activity modification to prevent a further such episode in the future.\n\n【18】This is the first reported case of EIP on the forearms, after gym exercise. Such lesions have been described before as ‘purpura’ and ‘vasculitis’, which is a misnomer for our case, as the skin lesions were smaller. 2 3 Palpability (ie, the lesion is raised) is an important diagnostic clue for inflammatory conditions such as vasculitis, hence the term ‘palpable purpura’ is used to describe vasculitis. EIP is reported to occur on the lower legs after intense muscular activity, especially in hot weather. It is thought to develop due to venous stasis that is induced by the acute failure of the muscle pump and thermoregulation decompensation, after prolonged and unusual exercise. 1 These lesions are known to relapse after precipitating exercises. It can also probably represent the fragility of cutaneous blood vessels. EIP is a self-limiting condition which can improve with modification of the exercise regime and does not require any specific management. However, awareness of this entity is crucial to avoid unnecessary anxiety, investigations and treatment.\n\n【19】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【20】‘When I noticed the rash suddenly develop following my gym visit, I was worried. I initially thought it to be due to allergies or due to some insect bite. When it reappeared 2nd and 3rd time after the same exercise, I consulted my doctor. He listened to my story, organised some basic blood tests and suggested modifying how I do my exercises’. This reassured me and has not reoccurred again.\n\n【21】### Learning points\n\n【22】   Purpureal and petechial rashes can appear due to a variety of acute, chronic medical or benign conditions.\n\n【23】   A focused history, clinical examination, awareness of aetiological causes and prompt recognition of the underlying condition are necessary to either investigate or provide reassurance to the patient.\n\n【24】   Exercise-induced purpura or petechiae is a self-limiting condition managed with observation and activity modification.\n\n【25】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【26】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【27】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

We describe the case of a young man in his 40s who was referred to our clinic for management of a large orbital mass probably arising out of the ocular surface covering the whole globe . The fungating mass measured 5×5 cm, multilobular with overlying necrotic areas and haemorrhagic points. Reviewing his medical records, it was evident that 3 years ago, he underwent an enucleation procedure, which had to be halted due to intraoperative heart block. His condition at the time was critical, necessitating intensive care and significant resuscitation efforts. Due to the complexity of his case and the challenges associated with administering general anaesthesia, orbital exenteration was deemed unfeasible. Instead, an incision biopsy was performed to confirm the histopathology as invasive SCC . Subsequently, he was referred to a radiation oncologist to initiate definitive radiation therapy. The patient underwent conformal beam radiotherapy, specifically external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), targeting the left orbit. The treatment involved the use of 6 mV photon beams, with a total dose of 30 Gy administered over a span of 2 weeks, consisting of 10 fractions . EBRT was divided into 3 Gy/fraction as phase 1 and boost dose of 10 Gy in five fractions. The patient responded well to radiotherapy with adequate reduction in tumour mass, globe salvage as well as vision salvage . During the course of radiotherapy, the patient developed few side effects in the skin and conjunctiva (grade 1 reaction); however, there were no episodes of bleeding from the tumour mass. There were no clinical manifestations of tumour lysis syndrome. 1 Currently, the patient’s left eye has a visual acuity of 20/200 and is accompanied by an immature cataract for which surgery has been scheduled. The patient has been consistently attending follow-up appointments and there has been no recurrence of the condition for the past year.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】(A) Clinical photo showing right-sided fungating mass (size 5×5 cm) over ocular surface consisting of multiple lobules, overlying necrotic areas and haemorrhagic points with indistinguishable ocular features.

The clinical presentation and neurophysiological tests were consistent with motor neuron disease. She was referred to the regional ventilation unit for respiratory muscle function testing.

Three years later, she presented with an unplanned pregnancy and expressed the wish to continue the pregnancy to term. She was monitored throughout pregnancy with interval respiratory muscle testing and was reviewed in the high-risk pregnancy anaesthetic clinic. She was also closely monitored by the obstetrics and gynaecology team. A multidisciplinary team meeting between all stakeholders agreed on caesarean section delivery at 34 weeks.

A large population-based study in the UK reported an incidence rate of 0.6 (CI 0.2, 1.3) in this age group. 1 There are only a few case reports of pregnancies in people living with MND (the majority of these cases were MND presenting for the first time during pregnancy). To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a successful pregnancy managed without any complication in a patient living with MND. We highlight the challenges faced throughout the pregnancy and how these were addressed using a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach. This case report demonstrates the possibility of successful pregnancy in people living with MND and illustrates an approach which may help fellow clinicians support patients in their decision making. Finally, the case also illustrates other important complications of MND and interventions to manage them and that treatment is not always futile. Life events, therefore, need not to be denied to neuromuscular patients.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】### Initial presentation and investigations\n\n【12】A fitness instructor woman in her 20s presented to the ventilation team with a weak cough and difficulty to expectorate thick and sticky phlegm. She was diagnosed with MND 3 months earlier following a review by the neurology team with left arm weakness, gradual left leg weakness and disarticulate speech. She also complained of food ‘going down the wrong way’ and choking spells when drinking liquids. This was followed by gradual exertional dyspnoea, cramps in hands, legs and feet as well as fasciculations. Her medical history was unremarkable and she was not on regular medications. There was no family history of MND.\n\n【13】Examination revealed 1 beat of clonus at both ankles, up-going plantar responses and symmetrical ankle jerks. Neurophysiological studies showed normal nerve conduction studies but widespread evidence of chronic neurogenic changes on needle electromyography. There was active denervation both distally and proximally in her left upper limb and distally in both lower limbs . Her baseline investigations included normal CT of head, chest, abdomen and pelvis as well MRI of head and whole spine. She was commenced on riluzole with regular monitoring of biochemistry including liver function tests.\n\n【14】View this table:\n\n【15】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【16】Table 1\n\n【17】Neurophysiological studies\n\n【18】She was reviewed by the speech and language therapist (SALT) in regards to her swallow and was advised to add thickener to her fluids.\n\n【19】### Sleep and ventilation team review\n\n【20】She was referred to the regional sleep and ventilation unit to assess her respiratory muscle function and to exclude sleep disordered breathing. She was managing to sleep well at night and felt refreshed in the mornings. She denied having any morning headaches and was able to lie flat without difficulty. Her investigations (as highlighted in her respiratory muscle testing in tables 2 and 3 ) revealed restrictive spirometry, borderline sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) and cough peak flow with normal capillary blood gases. In this initial assessment, she was provided with information regarding the long-term feeding plan, including percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion. She was referred for initiation of cough assist and an overnight pulse oximetry was arranged; this was found to be normal with no evidence of nocturnal desaturations.\n\n【21】View this table:\n\n【22】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【23】Table 2\n\n【24】Serial pulmonary function tests before and during pregnancy\n\n【25】View this table:\n\n【26】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【27】Table 3\n\n【28】Serial pulmonary function tests after pregnancy\n\n【29】She remained under regular review by the neurology, respiratory and SALT teams for worsening mobility, bulbar function and swallowing. She did not have sleep-related symptoms, although there has been gradual decline in her respiratory muscle testing. She mobilised short distances. She was admitted electively for PEG insertion 1 year following her diagnosis. This was complicated by post procedure pancreatic inflammation, treated by the surgical team with diagnostic laparoscopy, exploratory laparotomy and irrigation of peritoneal cavity. She recovered well from this episode and remained stable for the following 18 months.\n\n【30】Treatment\n---------\n\n【31】### Pregnancy and MDT approach to management\n\n【32】Three years following her diagnosis of MND (May 2018), she confirmed a positive pregnancy test to the sleep and ventilation team. This was not a planned pregnancy; however, she wished to continue the pregnancy to term and optimise the chances of a successful outcome. She denied any symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing, was finding her sleep refreshing with no waking headache or any daytime somnolence. Respiratory muscle testing at this stage showed worsening restrictive defect in her spirometry with static SNIP and stable blood gases (investigation 2). Scarcity of evidence in the literature in regards to the safety of pregnancy in MND made it difficult to predict the course of the pregnancy. Nonetheless, the challenges ahead were extensively discussed during consultations and a personalised plan was drawn, including MDT approach to her further management ( table 4 ). She was monitored closely with a monthly follow-up and regular respiratory muscle testing.\n\n【33】View this table:\n\n【34】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【35】Table 4\n\n【36】Multidisciplinary team approach\n\n【37】There was an appreciable decline in her motor function (especially upper limbs) and was using a wheelchair on regular basis. Her respiratory function, however, improved during pregnancy and remained stable throughout the pregnancy. Following parturition, both her spirometry and SNIP declined again to a new baseline. She was reviewed in the high-risk antenatal anaesthetic clinic given her known progressive MND, risk of diaphragmatic splinting and respiratory compromise with the advancing pregnancy.\n\n【38】Perioperative care plan was then planned following an MDT meeting between the obstetric, anaesthetic and the respiratory consultants. Her detailed plan included:\n\n【39】   An elective caesarean section at 34 weeks: on balance, it was felt to be the safest time for both mother and baby and carried less risk of decompensation and need for invasive ventilation.\n\n【40】   Discussion with the intensive care unit and plan for invasive ventilation in the event of respiratory compromise.\n\n【41】   Management in the maternal high dependency unit (maternal HDU) in the first 24 hours post delivery, with support from ventilation nurse specialists, in case of non-invasive ventilation requirement post partum.\n\n【42】   Patient and partner were given a guided tour of the maternity unit to inform their expectation and to reduce anxiety.\n\n【43】At this stage, she was rarely mobilising except for limited occasions with support from her partner. She was able to transfer from bed to chair unaided.\n\n【44】### Parturition and postpartum care\n\n【45】She was admitted in October 2018 for an elective caesarean section (C-section) at 34 weeks and 4 days gestation. An arterial line was inserted for blood gases monitoring and a spinal anaesthetic was used, achieving a block to T4. Although non-invasive ventilation was on standby, she did not require any assistance with ventilation and was stable from respiratory point of view throughout the procedure. Initially, her head was elevated to a 15-degree angle, raising to 30 degrees soon after C-section to ensure the local anaesthetic did not distribute caudally. Phenylephrine infusion was used throughout the delivery to prevent hypotension. The C-section was completed without complication. Following delivery she was monitored in the recovery unit and later transferred to the maternity HDU as planned. A healthy baby boy, weighing 2.76 kg was delivered and assessed by the paediatric team; his APGAR score (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration) was 9 at 1 min and 10 at 5 min. No abnormality was detected during examination. The baby was admitted to the transitional care unit for nasogastric feeding and remained stable throughout.\n\n【46】Her stay in maternity HDU was uneventful, and she was stepped down to the ward the following day. She received regular chest physiotherapy given her relatively weak cough. She struggled with mucus clearance 48 hours post partum; this was managed with regular chest physiotherapy, mucolytics (carbocisteine) and saline nebulisers. She did not tolerate a trial of manual insufflation exsufflation and her chest stabilised the following day. She was deemed medically optimised for discharge 5 days post partum but remained in hospital for further 2 days until baby was weaned from nasogastric feeding.\n\n【47】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【48】At the time of writing of this article, mother and baby (2 years and 8 months) remain well. The baby is meeting all his developmental milestones. The patient is under regular review for her MND by the various MDTs and has interval respiratory muscle function tests. She remains stable from respiratory point of view and is not on a ventilator (NIV). She enjoys regular family trips and leads as active a lifestyle as possible with support from her very supportive partner.\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】Pregnancy in women with MND is rare and presents a theoretical risk to both the mother and child. Previous reports have described women developing signs of the disease during pregnancy or early post partum. Our case is unique in that we describe a female patient with known MND conceiving and delivering a healthy baby 3 years after her diagnosis. Challenges for clinicians arose due to limited data in the literature regarding the effects of MND on the pregnancy, parturition and the newborn in addition to the effects of pregnancy on the course of disease. We are aware of only one previous case report of a planned pregnancy in known amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 2 A case of a young woman with sporadic ALS who gave birth twice during the course of her disease. The first pregnancy occurred 1 month after diagnosis (conceived before diagnosis was made). This resulted in an uncomplicated delivery. Second pregnancy occurred 2 years after diagnosis, when she was confined to bed due to the severity of her MND. This pregnancy was complicated by progression of dysphagia and cachexia and at 21-week gestation; PEG tube was performed. Emergency C-section was needed at 34-week gestation. The baby girl suffered from intrapartal asphyxia; APGAR score was 7 and increased to 8 after 5 min. She required admission to neonatal ward for oxygen therapy. Two months after delivery, mother was tracheostomised and put on long-term invasive mechanical ventilation. She died 11 months after the second childbirth due to severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage. This case represents very rapid progression of symptoms during and after pregnancy, and the postpartum period was complicated for both mother and child. In contrast, our case’s symptoms stabilised during the gravid period; the parturition was relatively uneventful, and the postpartum period was without any complications for both mother and child.\n\n【51】Our case demonstrated appreciable improvement in the spirometry and SNIP values during pregnancy. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) continued to show sustained improvement until parturition. Following childbirth, the FEV <sub>1 </sub> , FVC and SNIP declined to a new baseline which was sustained for few months post partum. Chemical/hormonal changes and the mechanical effects of the progressive uterine distension lead to changes in respiratory physiology during pregnancy. 3 Progesterone gradually increases during pregnancy from 25 ng/mL at 6 weeks gestation to a peak of 150 ng/mL at 37 weeks, and it is known to increase the sensitivity of the respiratory centre to carbon dioxide. Similarly, the oestrogen level increases during pregnancy and is responsible for higher number of progesterone receptors within the hypothalamus and medulla. 3 The progressive uterine distension leads to elevation of the diaphragm which can affect lung volume and chest wall/thoracic configuration. 4 In most cases, the FVC, FEV <sub>1 </sub> and peak expiratory flow remain unchanged or modestly increase during pregnancy. This could explain the respiratory function test observed in our case.\n\n【52】These cases should remind clinicians looking after younger patients with MND of the importance of early family planning discussion. The patients should be informed of the limited evidence on pregnancy influencing disease progression. In the early stages of MND, there is no evidence in the limited literature of adverse events to mother and baby; however, in the latter stages when respiratory and dietary issues become evident, outcomes to both mother and baby can be catastrophic.\n\n【53】The most important aspect of care for a woman with respiratory muscle weakness secondary to neurological disorder is to carry out an early risk stratification and then to clearly discuss the risks and benefits of each treatment. This will allow the clinician to decide on appropriate and timely investigations (such as respiratory muscle function tests and blood gases) and liaise closely with other colleagues involved in patient’s care. Any investigation and/or treatment needs to be individualised and tailored to the needs of the patient depending on the type of neurological condition and the degree of severity. As our case illustrates, it is also important to optimise the patient’s nutritional demands, general physical health and to coordinate care between all the MDT caring for the patient. Regular monitoring throughout pregnancy, the timing of elective admission for C-section and carefully agreed postpartum care played a significant role in the success of pregnancy and stable postpartum period in our case.\n\n【54】### Learning points\n\n【55】   Respiratory muscle assessment for people living with motor neuron disease (MND) and the importance of regular monitoring during pregnancy.\n\n【56】   A multidisciplinary team of physicians and healthcare professionals is essential in positive outcomes for mother and baby in MND pregnancies.\n\n【57】   MND does not have harmful consequences on fetal development, but respiratory function of the mother should be carefully monitored.\n\n【58】   In younger patients with new diagnosis of MND, family planning should be discussed early.\n\n【59】   Careful planning of interventions increases the chances of successful outcome.\n\n【60】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【61】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【62】Consent obtained from next of kin.\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I would like to acknowledge all the healthcare professionals who played a vital role in this successful pregnancy, namely: 1.

MP-TLT, micropulse transscleral laser therapy.\n\n【10】A patient in his early 70s presented with primary angle closure glaucoma to our glaucoma clinic with IOP of 26 mm Hg on four antiglaucoma medications in his right eye with vertical cup disc ratio of 0.9. The patient had a previous failed trabeculectomy and undergone cataract surgery 6 months back. It was decided to perform MP- TLT to lower the IOP as the patient was not willing to undergo another invasive surgery.\n\n【11】We obtained written informed consent for MP-TLT and its related complications before surgery. After topical anaesthesia with 0.5% proparacaine, with the laser settings of, power 2500 mW, total duration 80 s, treat mode ON, we performed MP-TLT in an appropriate technique instruction according to the device company with the speed of 20 s per hemisphere per pass (surgical video 1 ).\n\n【12】Video 1 Conjunctival laceration with conjunctival epithelial burn during MP TLT with newer generation new MP3 fiber optic probe.\n\n【13】While performing MP- TLT, after placing 0.5% carboxy methylcellulose gel as coupling agent over cornea and conjunctiva, a conjunctival laceration was noted on the first pass with conjunctival epithelial burn in the inferior 180° area and the conjunctiva was found to be sucked inside the probe as a novel finding  (surgical video 1 ). The laser therapy was aborted after first pass and the patient prescribed antibiotic–steroid combination eye drops, with lubricants and cycloplegic.\n\n【14】The IOP of the patient was 20 mm Hg on first operative day and 28 mm of Hg after 2 months in post operative period. The patient was counselled and planned for glaucoma drainage device surgery.\n\n【15】The risk of conjunctival epithelial burn is higher in eyes with increased pigmentation and which are on long-term antiglaucoma medications. This report of conjunctival epithelial burn with MP-TLT indicates that more additional studies are required to modify the MP-TLT technique in eyes which are on long-term antiglaucoma medications. Such a complication can led to scarring of the conjunctiva and adversely impact outcome of future filtering surgery. To prevent such a complication, each quadrant should be treated separately and the tip of the probe irrigated after each pass.\n\n【16】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【17】I am very thankful to my doctor, the way how he managed the complication and for controlling my glaucoma progression and giving me best surgical option as well.\n\n【18】### Learning points\n\n【19】   Micropulse transscleral laser therapy is a non-invasive laser treatment modality in refractive glaucoma eyes.\n\n【20】   Complications like anterior chamber reaction, conjunctival haemorrhage are common but conjunctival laceration and burn are rarely noted.\n\n【21】   This case report highlights a novel complication like moving of conjunctival epithelial burn tissue into the probe.\n\n【22】   This can lead to scarring of the conjunctiva and adversely impact outcomes of future glaucoma surgery.\n\n【23】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【24】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【25】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Two weeks later, she developed progressive gait imbalance, diplopia and headache without antecedent constitutional or infectious symptoms. Her medical history was significant for hypertension and breast cancer in remission.\n\n【5】On presentation, the patient was hypertensive, with blood pressure fluctuations between 133/61 mm Hg and 191/79 mm Hg over the 2 days after admission, perhaps reflecting a degree of autonomic dysfunction. The initial examination demonstrated partial global ophthalmoparesis, bilateral ptosis, slowed saccades in restricted range, minimally responsive pupils with a degree of light near dissociation ( video 1 ), bilateral limb ataxia with preserved reflexes, and preserved sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, proprioception and temperature in all four limbs. Lumbar puncture showed 0 nucleated cells, glucose of 87 mg/dL and protein of 29 mg/dL. Bacterial and fungal cultures were negative. MRI of the brain with and without contrast showed no abnormalities. Nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography showed acute left facial neuropathy, reduced fibular and tibial motor amplitudes, and a mildly prolonged ulnar F wave relative to the F estimate, but no additional abnormalities and no electrophysiological evidence of a neuromuscular junction disorder ( table 1 ). A 5-day course of intravenous Ig 0.4 g/kg resulted in symptom improvement. Serum GQ1b IgG antibodies titres were elevated at 1:12 800 (normal <1:100), supporting the diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS). As for other serum labs, the patient had unremarkable comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count with differential, sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, rapid plasma reagin, aquaporin-4-IgG, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody and myasthenia gravis panel.\n\n【6】View this table:\n\n【7】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【8】Table 1\n\n【9】Nerve conduction study and electromyography\n\n【10】Video 1 Neuro-ophthalmological examination in a patient with Miller Fisher syndrome before and after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin\n\n【11】At the 2-month follow-up visit, the patient had further improvement in symptoms ( video 1 ). She continued to have mild ophthalmoplegia and mild ataxia but was able to ambulate independently and complete her activities of daily living.\n\n【12】MFS is a subtype of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a group of immune-mediated acute neuropathies. It is rare, with an incidence of approximately 1 per 1 million. MFS can present after infections or following vaccinations. 1 Postvaccination MFS incidence is unclear in the literature due to its uncommon occurrence. Postvaccination GBS has been reported more frequently, especially in association with the influenza vaccine. The risk of developing GBS is low following vaccination, increasing by one case for every million cases. 2 The prognosis of MFS is generally good, with most patients showing significant improvement or resolution of their symptoms by 6 months. 3 There is some evidence that intravenous Ig therapy may reduce the time to symptom recovery, but plasmapheresis does not appear to affect it. Neither intravenous Ig or plasmapheresis had been shown to affect patient outcomes compared with no immunotherapy. 4 In patients who developed MFS after COVID-19 vaccines, there is currently no long-term data. In the previously reported cases, patients significantly improved 4–6 weeks after immunotherapy. 5\n\n【13】The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine contains a nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and was designed to elicit B-cell and T-cell responses against the spike protein. 6 MFS had been reported in patients after COVID-19 infection and following the first and second doses of the Pfizer vaccine. 7–10 There also had been multiple cases of GBS reported in patients after receiving COVID-19 vaccination. 11–13 A causal link cannot be established with the very low number of cases compared with the number of vaccines administered, but the timing is supportive. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a published report of MFS or GBS after the Pfizer vaccine booster.\n\n【14】The classic triad of MFS is ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia 14 ; however, many patients present with incomplete forms. Berlit and Rakicky reported that global ophthalmoplegia was present in 48.9% of patients, and areflexia in 81.6%. 15 Odaka et al reported hyporeflexia or areflexia in 53% of MFS patients. 16 The reason for the variability in symptom presentation between individuals is unclear, but it may be secondary to the variation in GQ1b expression sites in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In our case, the patient had ophthalmoplegia and bilateral ataxia with preserved reflexes. There has been much debate regarding whether ataxia in MFS is central or peripheral, or both. 17 In addition to the heavy expression of GQ1b in the ocular motor nerves, GQ1b has also been found in the cerebellum, muscle spindles and large-diameter dorsal root ganglion neurons. 18–20 Berlit and Rakicky reported that in MFS patients that presented with ataxia, 90.1% presented with cerebellar ataxia and only 0.9% presented with sensory ataxia. 15 In MFS patients with evidence of sensory neuropathy on NCS, the sensory NCS can often be incongruent with the level of ataxia and areflexia/hyporeflexia found. Motor and sensory NCS can oftentimes be normal in symptomatic MFS patients and are not reliable for diagnosis or exclusion. 6–9 21\n\n【15】In conclusion, we describe a case of MFS after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine booster. In patients with symptoms involving ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and/or areflexia after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, MFS should be included in the differential diagnosis. GQ1b antibodies can help confirm diagnosis, and immunotherapy may reduce time to symptom recovery and should be considered. MFS is very rare and should not dissuade people from receiving the vaccine, especially given its favourable risk–benefit ratio.\n\n【16】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【17】This is a timeline of events that led to my Miller Fisher diagnosis.\n\n【18】1.  Received Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines:\n\n【19】    1.  First dose (date hidden)\n\n【20】    2.  Second dose (date hidden)\n\n【21】2.  Booster (date hidden) (3 weeks after the booster vaccine) I noticed my pupils were dilated and walking was difficult and getting worse each day.\n\n【22】   I decided to go to the local hospital emergency room, and I was admitted into the hospital that day.\n\n【23】   The hospital ran a series of tests on me to determine the cause of my condition. Meanwhile they were in contact with (hospital name hidden) because they were baffled by my symptoms. Unable to determine what was causing my symptoms, I was transferred to the (hospital name hidden).\n\n【24】   The physicians there determined that I had Miller Fisher. The next day I began 5 days of intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG).\n\n【25】   As of today, (date hidden), my eyes aren’t normal, but they are better. My legs are weaker than before but seem to be getting stronger.\n\n【26】   In closing I would like to thank (hospital name hidden) and their staff for their care. The commercial for (hospital name hidden) that says if (quote hidden), really fits me. (Name hidden) is the ultimate consummate physician. He is caring and so professional. What is really amazing to me is that he really listened to what I had to say. This seems to be a lost art today with some of our doctors. I am (age hidden) and have been seeing doctors and having surgery since I was (age hidden) and he really stands out among them!\n\n【27】### Learning points\n\n【28】   Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a rare event following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.\n\n【29】   While ataxia, ophthalmoplegia and areflexia constitute the cardinal features of MFS, partial presentations are common.\n\n【30】   SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated MFS appears to have a favourable prognosis and may be responsive to immunotherapy.\n\n【31】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【32】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【33】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

With increased use of methadone, there has been increasing reporting of less commonly reported side effects (ie, hypoglycaemia). Here, we describe a woman in her 70s with history of opioid use disorder on methadone, stage 4 chronic kidney disease and prior hypoglycaemic episodes who initially presented with perforated gastric ulcer requiring surgical repair. Her perioperative course was complicated by profound hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. Given concern for methadone-induced hypoglycaemia, methadone was discontinued with monitoring of subsequent blood glucose, insulin, C peptide, proinsulin, β-hydroxybutyrate and blood methadone levels. As the serum methadone levels decreased, insulin levels substantially decreased in parallel. After 21 days off methadone, dextrose infusion was discontinued with restoration of euglycaemia. In a patient with hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and methadone use, it is important to consider discontinuing methadone and re-evaluate fasting glucose levels prior to an extensive and invasive insulinoma workup.\n\n【2】   Endocrine system\n   Psychiatry (drugs and medicines)\n   Drugs: endocrine system\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Methadone is a μ-opioid receptor agonist that acts centrally and peripherally. It also modulates nociceptive input through its effect on serotonin, norepinephrine and N \\-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. 3 4 Possible aetiologies of hypoglycaemia may include promotion of pancreatic insulin release, 5–8 suppression of counter-regulatory mechanisms such as glucagon, epinephrine and sympathoadrenal responses to hypoglycaemia 9 10 as well as impairment of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. 11 12\n\n【11】In mouse models, methadone significantly lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner at doses greater than 10 mg/kg. 13 Clinical observations of methadone-induced hypoglycaemia have been documented in retrospective studies and case reports 12 14–23 and occurred in situations of overdose when methadone doses were escalated. 19 20 24 A retrospective study of the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System from 2004 to 2012 showed significantly increased odds of hypoglycaemia in tramadol and methadone compared with the use of other opioids, such as codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, hydromorphone, morphine and fentanyl. 12 25\n\n【12】The objective of our study is to report a case of recurrent hypoglycaemia associated with endogenous hyperinsulinaemia in the setting of high dose methadone, which, to our knowledge, is the first report of its kind. This case uniquely demonstrates normalisation of blood glucose levels through repeated supervised fasts after methadone was held, a finding not reported in current literature.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A woman in her 70s was admitted following acute onset of abdominal pain from perforated gastric ulcer. The perioperative period was notable for profound hypoglycaemia. She has a history significant for opioid use disorder and had been prescribed methadone for over three decades, incidentally found hepatitis C infection with spontaneous clearance without cirrhosis, class 2 obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 38 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , hypertension and stable stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) of unclear aetiology. She reported episodes of confusion, non-sensical speech, blurry vision and diaphoresis that occurred when skipping a meal. Those symptoms did not occur when she ate three meals per day with a snack at bedtime. She had two prior evaluations for hypoglycaemia 4 and 2 years before her current admission at outside hospitals.\n\n【15】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【16】Four years prior to her current admission, she presented with transient right arm weakness with a point-of-care (POC) glucose of 20 mg/dL. She had resolution of her symptoms with intravenous dextrose. A CT scan of the head without contrast did not show acute changes. With a serum glucose of 3.2 mmol/L (58 mg/dL), an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> and a serum creatinine of 229.9 µmol/L (2.6 mg/dL, similar to her baseline value), she had an insulin level of 18.5 µU/mL and a C peptide of 1.89 ng/mL. The patient’s glucose level rose by less than 1.4 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) following intravenous glucagon administration. Her home medications were methadone 115 mg daily and amlodipine 5 mg daily. She denied alcohol intake or illicit drug use.\n\n【17】Sulfonylurea ingestion was ruled out with a negative hypoglycemic agent screen and insulin autoimmune syndrome was ruled out with a negative insulin autoantibody test. Non-invasive imaging techniques for insulinoma localisation, including CT and MRI studies of the abdomen with contrast, were contraindicated due to renal impairment. Endoscopic ultrasonography did not detect any pancreatic lesions. Based on these results, it was suspected that hypoglycaemia was multifactorial from methadone-induced hyperinsulinaemia and impaired clearance of methadone metabolites and gluconeogenesis from kidney dysfunction. Methadone was tapered down from 115 to 15 mg daily, which led to the resolution of hypoglycaemia.\n\n【18】Two years prior to her current admission, the patient was admitted to an outside hospital with confusion, blurry vision and diaphoresis. She had profound hypoglycaemia with a plasma glucose level of 1.8 mmol/L (33 mg/dL). She demonstrated pathological endogenous hyperinsulinaemia with an insulin level of 46.5 µU/mL and C peptide of 34.3 ng/mL. Her random cortisol level at 12:50 pm was 0.8 µmol/L (27 µg/dL), excluding adrenal insufficiency. During this admission her serum creatinine was 194.5 µmol/L (2.2 mg/dL) with an eGFR of 22 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> when the insulinoma workup was initially sent. At that time, she was prescribed methadone 105 mg daily. The patient was started on prednisone 20 mg two times per day and methadone was tapered to 40 mg daily on discharge. By the end of her hospital stay, her glucose levels stably ranged from 4.4 mmol/L (80 mg/dL) to 7.7 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). She was advised to taper methadone and prednisone, and transition to buprenorphine/naloxone. The patient had received outpatient care outside our institution prior to her current admission; however, records were not accessible through our electronic medical record. Although the medical history provided by the patient was limited, she reports not completing evaluation besides the inpatient evaluations from prior to her current admission. She continued to have repeated episodes of confusion, non-sensical speech, blurry vision and diaphoresis that occurred when skipping a meal that she self-managed with frequent snacking while on methadone.\n\n【19】She presented with a perforated gastric ulcer which led to emergent surgery where she underwent a graham patch repair during her current admission. Her preoperative period was notable for symptomatic hypoglycaemia, with a nadir serum glucose level of 1.94 mmol/L (35 mg/dL). At this time, she was prescribed methadone 60 mg daily. Her weight on admission was 115 kg. Table 1 shows the patient’s admission laboratory data.\n\n【20】View this table:\n\n【21】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【22】Table 1\n\n【23】Laboratory values on admission of case study patient\n\n【24】The results of her complete blood count, CMP, cortisol (0.61 µmol/L or 22.2 µg/dL at 7:30 am), thyroid stimulating hormone (1.21 μIU/mL) and liver function tests were within normal limits. Her eGFR was 20–22 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> at baseline, with a serum creatinine of 203.4 µmol/L (2.3 mg/dL). Serum and urine toxicology screening tests were negative except for methadone. Despite recovering after surgery and maintaining her caloric intake, the patient continued to be hypoglycaemic (blood glucose as low as 1.2 mmol/L or 36 mg/dL) 2 weeks later. At that time, she was switched to buprenorphine/naloxone.\n\n【25】Table 2 and figure 1 summarise the laboratory results during repeated supervised fasts for evaluation of hypoglycaemia in addition to diagnostic criteria for different causes of hypoglycaemia. Figure 2 illustrates the length of time the patient took to reach hypoglycaemia and corresponding serum methadone levels. Three days after methadone discontinuation, she was maintained on a solution of 50% dextrose in water infused at a rate of 25 mL/hour in addition to meals to maintain a target glucose level of 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL). The first monitored fast was conducted and found that after an hour after stopping the dextrose solution, her plasma glucose dropped to 2.9 mmol/L (52 mg/dL) with associated confusion and drowsiness. Additional labs drawn at the same time showed an insulin level of 7.4 µU/mL, C peptide of 1.05 ng/mL, proinsulin of 8.9 pmol/L and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) of 0.03 mmol/L. Serum methadone level was 610 ng/mL (therapeutic range 100–400 ng/mL). A serum creatinine was 247.6 µmol/L (2.8 mg/dL) and her eGFR was 19 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . Serial serum methadone levels were obtained to evaluate the association between methadone levels and severity and aetiology of hypoglycaemia.\n\n【26】View this table:\n\n【27】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【28】Table 2\n\n【29】Laboratory findings and clinical parameters from reported hypoglycaemia evaluations and in the case study patient\n\n【30】<img/>\n\n【31】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【33】Glucose and methadone levels during three monitored fasts.

Illustrated by Aanika Balaji.\n\n【38】Five days after methadone discontinuation, the patient was maintained on a solution of 50% dextrose in water infused at a rate of 10 mL/hour to maintain glucose above 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL). Seven hours after discontinuing the dextrose solution and her diet, her serum glucose dropped to 1.2 mmol/L (36 mg/dL), with an insulin level of 7.7 μU/mL, C peptide of 0.94 ng/mL, proinsulin of 7.9 pmol/L and BHB of 0.03 mmol/L. At this time, the patient’s serum methadone level was 410 ng/mL. Her serum creatinine was 229.9 µmol/L (2.6 mg/dL) with an associated eGFR of 21 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . The results of all three supervised fasts are shown in figures 1 and 2 .\n\n【39】Fourteen days after methadone discontinuation, the patient’s maintenance fluid was decreased to 20% dextrose in water infused at a rate of 30 mL/hour. Fourteen hours after stopping this solution and beginning the fast, her serum glucose dropped to 2.7 mmol/L (49 mg/dL), with an associated insulin level of 4.4 μU/mL, C peptide of 0.58 ng/mL, proinsulin of 4.7 pmol/L and BHB of 0.15 mmol/L. Her serum creatinine level was 247.6 µmol/L (2.8 mg/dL) and eGFR was 20 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . Serum methadone level was 99 ng/mL.\n\n【40】She underwent endoscopic ultrasonography which did not detect distinct pancreatic lesions. A selective arterial calcium-stimulation test was attempted as an additional test for tumour localisation. Insulin levels did not rise by twofold within 90 and 120 s of calcium stimulation in the distal splenic artery and proper hepatic artery, which would localise to the body and tail of pancreas; of note, however, most samples drawn were haemolysed and were unable to be used to detect insulin levels.\n\n【41】Twenty-one days after methadone discontinuation, the dextrose infusion was stopped without recurrence of hypoglycaemia. Serum methadone level was undetectable then. She was made NPO the following day for 24 hours and POC glucose checks showed stable readings ranging between 4.6 mmol/L (82 mg/dL) and 5.2 mmol/L (93 mg/dL). The patient was medically stable and was ultimately discharged. Her methadone prescription was changed to buprenorphine/naloxone.\n\n【42】Outcome and Follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【43】The patient responded well to buprenorphine/naloxone without any side effects. About 6 months following her admission and the initiation of buprenorphine/naloxone, she reported that she no longer had abnormally low POC glucose levels or confusion when skipping a meal. Furthermore, her fasting POC glucose levels were in the 4.4–5.0 mmol/L (80–90 mg/dL) range.\n\n【44】Discussion\n----------\n\n【45】This case demonstrated evidence of endogenous hyperinsulinaemia in a patient who had no localising pancreatic lesions with reversible hypoglycaemia as serum methadone levels tapered off, suggesting methadone-induced hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. Whipple’s triad, a clinical trio of symptoms which suggests the presence of an insulinoma, was established by the presence of neuroglycopenic symptoms when her glucose was less than 3.1 mmol/L (55 mg/dL), with resolution of symptoms after treatment. When the plasma glucose concentrations were 1.8 mmol/L (33 mg/dL), 2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) and 2.9 mmol/L (52 mg/dL), the insulin concentrations were greater than 3.0 μIU/mL and the C peptide concentrations were greater than 0.6 ng/mL, confirming endogenous hyperinsulinaemia. Although the patient has stage 4 CKD with an eGFR of 20–25, significant decreased renal insulin metabolism is not expected in a non-diabetic patient with renal disease until the eGFR level falls to less than 15–20 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . 26 27 Additionally, her serum creatinine levels and calculated eGFR drawn concurrently with insulinoma workups did not vary significantly and were near her baseline creatinine of 229.9 µmol/L (2.6 mg/dL), eGFR of 20–22 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> (range: 194.5–247.6 µmol/L; eGFR 19–21 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ). Therefore, renal insufficiency alone is unlikely to explain this degree of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in this case.\n\n【46】The patient underwent repeat evaluations during multiple admissions, which excluded other causes of hypoglycaemia, including exogenous insulin use, sulfonylurea ingestion and insulin autoimmune syndrome. There were several clinical findings that were not consistent with insulinoma. First, while on methadone, this patient did not respond to intravenous glucagon as plasma glucose concentration did not rise by at least 1.4 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) despite being well nourished (BMI 38 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and having no evidence of hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Second, no discrete lesion was identified on endoscopic ultrasound. Third, during her final supervised fast when the methadone level decreased to 99 ng/mL, her C peptide and proinsulin levels were no longer inappropriately elevated, and glucose levels remained in normal range.\n\n【47】There are two retrospective studies 20 23 and eight case reports of hypoglycaemia in the setting of methadone use. 14–19 21 22 The lowest reported glucose level was 0.6 mmol/L (10 mg/dL), 22 with a median of 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) and range between 0.6 mmol/L (10 mg/dL) and 2.4 mmol/L (44 mg/dL). Hypoglycaemia occurred during fasting states 14–17 and were precipitated by methadone overdose, 14 21 22 dose escalation 17–20 and/or renal failure. 15 17 The hypoglycaemia resolved with dose splitting, 15 dose reduction 17 19 or methadone discontinuation. 14 17 18 21 22 When measured, insulin and C peptide levels were elevated. 14 17\n\n【48】Multiple case reports demonstrate a link between methadone use and hypoglycaemia. These case reports demonstrate hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia occurring in patients aged 11 months to 51 years following ingestion of high doses of methadone. 14 21 22 In the case described by Toce et al , a previously healthy 11-month-old boy who developed respiratory failure and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia after an acute, unintentional methadone exposure. 14 With a blood glucose of 0.9 mmol/L (17 mg/dL) and serum methadone level of 123 ng/mL, insulin level was inappropriately elevated to 14.4 µU/mL and serum BHB was suppressed to 0.22 mmol/L. Similar to our case presentation, testing for sulfonylurea and metabolic causes of hypoglycaemia was negative. An 18-hour fasting challenge was performed and the patient remained euglycaemic on hospital day 14 after methadone had been cleared from the child’s system. We noted a similar phenomenon when our patient had low serum methadone levels, she remained euglycaemic for longer periods of time without the need for dextrose supplementation. Li and colleagues reported the case of a woman in her 50s with opioid use disorder who presented with respiratory failure and refractory hypoglycaemia (2.1–2.6 mmol/L) 4 hours after the ingestion of 1000 mg of methadone. 21 Dextrose was able to be weaned off 54-hours after ingestion. Fung et al presented a similar case of an otherwise healthy woman in her 20s who presented with altered mental status following the ingestion of 800 mg of methadone and was found to have hypoglycaemia with a blood glucose of 0.6 mmol/L (10 mg/dL). 22\n\n【49】Masharani et al outline the case of a woman in her late 30s with obesity, stage 3 CKD (eGFR 30–60) and back pain on methadone 160 mg every 6 hours as needed who presented with Whipple’s triad. 17 She had endogenous hyperinsulinaemia (insulin of 8.5 µU/mL, C peptide of 2.7 ng/mL, proinsulin of 49 pmol/L and BHB of 0.15 mmol/L) with a serum glucose level of 2.4 mmol/L (44 mg/dL). Sulfonylurea screen and insulin autoantibodies were negative. She had a normal cosyntropin stimulation test. Endoscopic ultrasound and 68 gallium-labelled octreotide positron emission tomography/CT were negative. Methadone was tapered off and she was transitioned to buprenorphine with resolution of the hypoglycaemia the following day. Also described is a brief case of a patient on dialysis and 240 mg of methadone daily who developed episodes of symptomatic hypoglycaemia (up to 1.2 mmol/L) that resolved after methadone dose reduction to 100 mg daily.\n\n【50】Maingi et al described a case of a man in his mid 40s with rectosigmoid cancer, renal failure and malabsorption on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) infusion for 18 hours a day. 18 When his fentanyl patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA) for cancer pain was changed to methadone, he developed symptomatic hypoglycaemia that resolved only after methadone infusion was stopped. Gjedsted et al presented a similar case of a female child with acute lymphatic leukaemia and cancer pain. 19 When intravenous fentanyl was changed to intravenous methadone and the dose was escalated from 860 mg/24 hours to 1560 mg/24 hours, blood glucose declined from the range of 5.6–11.1 mmol/L (100–200 mg/dL) to 1.1–1.7 mmol/L (20–30 mg/dL). Reduction of the dose of methadone normalised the blood glucose.\n\n【51】Moryl et al conducted a chart review of 59 patients on methadone for cancer pain and reported 11 patients with a glucose level <3.9 mmol/L (mean level of 3.0 mmol/L, range of 1.3–3.7 mmol/L) precipitated by dose escalation. 20 In a retrospective observational study, Flory and colleagues found a significant increased risk of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with methadone at doses greater than 40 mg/day (p < 0.01). Logistic multivariable regression showed a significant association between methadone and hypoglycaemia with an OR of 2.2 (95% CI (1.6–2.9)) and a dose-response relationship with an OR of 3.1 (95% CI (2.5–3.6)) when doses were greater than 80 mg/day. 23\n\n【52】Our study has a few limitations. First, the generalisability of our study is limited as we are only able to draw conclusions from one case. The sensitivity for detecting insulinomas by endoscopic ultrasound is poor (75–83%) and a lesion may have been missed during this examination. 28 The gold standard diagnostic test for insulinoma localisation, the selective calcium arterial stimulation test (SACST), was inadequate due to haemolysed samples in the proximal splenic artery, gastroduodenal artery and superior mesenteric artery, which would localise to the head, neck and body of the pancreas, respectively. We did not repeat the SACST because the results of the hypoglycaemia evaluation during the third supervised fast were available and no longer consistent with an insulinoma (C peptide was <0.6 ng/mL and proinsulin was <5 pmol/L despite a glucose level of 2.7 mmol/L). The insulin level, although drastically decreased over time, is only mildly above the reference range and we believe this is in part related to the poor kidney clearance. Second, when the serum methadone level was undetectable, the patient underwent a short fast of 24-hour duration, which preserved her blood glucose levels in 4.6–5.2 mmol/L (82–93 mg/dL) range. About two-thirds of patients with insulinoma have hypoglycaemia within the first day of fasting and 85–95% have hypoglycaemia within 48 hours. 29 We did not pursue the standard 72 hours duration of the fast because we had a low clinical suspicion for an insulinoma and the patient was otherwise ready for hospital discharge.\n\n【53】Hypoglycaemia is now listed as one of the potential adverse effects of methadone in the setting of overdose or dose escalation in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 30 Further prospective studies are needed to determine the prevalence of new-onset hypoglycaemia in methadone users in addition to establishing the biochemical cause of hypoglycaemia in diverse patient populations with or without other hypoglycaemic risk factors. We believe providers should consider high doses of methadone as a potential aetiology in a patient with recurrent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and consider tapering off methadone prior to undergoing an extensive and invasive insulinoma workup.\n\n【54】### Learning points\n\n【55】   Excess methadone use may clinically present as an insulinoma; however, the annual incidence of insulinoma is 1–4 in one million, whereas the number of methadone prescriptions yearly is increasing.\n\n【56】   Consider methadone-induced hypoglycaemia in a patient with laboratory evidence of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia with concurrent use of methadone, in addition to other causes of hypoglycaemia (eg, exogenous insulin use, sulfonylurea ingestion and insulin autoimmune syndrome) ruled out.\n\n【57】   The gold standard for diagnosis of insulinoma is a selective calcium arterial stimulation test, which is a time-consuming, invasive and costly study. Therefore, consider discontinuing high dose methadone in patients with hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and re-evaluate fasting glucose levels prior to invasive/extensive workup for insulinoma.\n\n【58】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【59】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【60】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

We studied a spinal GCT case that had expanded to the thoracic spinal canal and mediastinum and was successfully treated by surgical decompression and denosumab. A woman in her 30s presented with weakness in both the lower extremities. MRI revealed a large tumour in the posterior mediastinum expanding from the thoracic vertebrae (T3–6), which compressed the spinal cord. The patient underwent urgent spinal decompression with instrumentation and her tissue was sent for a pathology study. Histologically and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of GCT. Since it was an unresectable tumour, this patient was treated with denosumab. Her neurological problem resolved after 6 months of treatment. After 4 years of follow-up, the patient displayed no further progression and no side effects from long-term denosumab usage.\n\n【2】   Spinal cord\n   Orthopaedic and trauma surgery\n   Surgical oncology\n   Neurosurgery\n   Orthopaedics\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

To reduce the likelihood of unfavourable outcomes, denosumab has been approved to treat patients with unresectable spinal GCT or when resection is likely to result in morbidity. 3 Even surgical resection of spinal GCT combined with denosumab administration does not guarantee excellent clinical outcomes and radiological findings. 4\n\n【12】In general, 120 mg of denosumab injected subcutaneously every 4 weeks with additional loading doses given on day 8 and 15 during the first month of therapy is prescribed for GCT. 5 6 This regimen leads to elimination of tumours and consistent suppression of bone resorption. However, there is no standardised denosumab dosage and treatment duration. Previous reports have suggested ranges varying from 4 months to 55 months. 7 It can be used to supplement surgery either preoperation or postoperation for spinal GCT as the long-term effects of denosumab use in patients with spinal GCT expanding to the mediastinum has not been reported. 8–10\n\n【13】Herein, we report of a rare case of unresectable GCT of the thoracic spine that expanded into the mediastinum and spinal canal, resulting in paraplegia. The patient was treated with surgical decompression without tumour resection and long-term denosumab administration with the final result being full neurologic recovery.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A woman in her 30s presented with atraumatic weakness in both her legs for 1 week and had difficulty urinating for 3 days. This patient was referred to our hospital 6 years ago. The patient provided a 10-year history of spinal surgery with instrumentation after a fall from height caused a vertebral compression fracture without neurological deficit. The patient had no other medical problems and her family history was unremarkable. On examination, she presented an old midline surgical scar and mild tenderness on her back. A neurological examination showed signs of near paraplegia (Frankel grade C) in all lower extremity muscles, positive Babinski sign and ankle/knee hyperreflexia.\n\n【16】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【17】A plain radiographic examination of the thoracic spine showed a large soft tissue mass in the posterior mediastinal region (20.3×18.7 cm) and previous posterior instrumentation from T3–7, which was related to a history of vertebral fracture around 10 years ago . The images also revealed right lateral displacement of the heart, mediastinal structure and trachea due to the pressure effect from the mass. Blood for complete blood count, biochemistry and tumour markers were normal except for hyperkalemia and leukocytosis. An MRI of the thoracic spine showed a large heterogeneous enhancing soft tissue mass at the posterior mediastinal region with bilateral paravertebral extension predominately on the left side with a size of about 18.4×18.0×10.4 cm. This mass protruded from the T4 vertebra, leading to a pressure effect of thecal sac at lower T3 to upper T5 vertebrae and total obliteration of the spinal canal, which is suggestive of myelopathy at the T3–5 vertebral level . This mass also involved the left lateral chest wall with multiple left posterior ribs erosion. The rest of her spine MRI showed no other abnormalities. A CT scan also demonstrated a large extrapulmonary mass with internal calcification at the posterior mediastinum extending to the bilateral paravertebral area . Last, a whole-body bone scan showed no evidence of bony metastasis.\n\n【18】<img/>\n\n【19】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【21】Plain radiography of the thoracic spine showed a large soft tissue mass at posterior mediastinal region.

Due to an incomplete cord compression condition, our surgical plan was urgent decompression via laminectomy. However, we were unable to remove the tumour due to abundant fibrosis from a previous spinal surgery. Therefore, we only carried out partial laminectomy of T3 and T6 with posterior instrumentation T2 to T8 and transpedicular biopsy at T4. A histological examination showed low-grade spindle cells with giant cells, which were unlikely to be malignant. Due to a low tissue sample yield for further investigation, we had to re-do tissue biopsy. Finally, both histological and immunohistochemistry tests ( online supplemental file 1 ) confirmed diagnosis of GCT of the bone with an absence of a mitotic figure . Furthermore, the MIB-1 labelling index (Ki-67) was examined and determined to be in the range of 0.5%–1%.\n\n【32】### Supplemental material\n\n【33】\\[bcr-2022-248837supp001.pdf\\]\n\n【34】<img/>\n\n【35】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【36】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4</u>\n\n【37】Histological examination (H&E, 400x) of (A) first-time tissue biopsy and (B) second-time tissue biopsy.\n\n【38】Treatment\n---------\n\n【39】In general, the standard treatment for GCT of the bone is wide-margin surgical excision. However, after discussions with the cardiothoracic surgeon about mediastinal mass, our group agreed that this is an unresectable GCT. We provided information on available treatment options for unresectable tumours. The patient voluntarily agreed to receive denosumab, and the consent form was obtained. The patient received a subcutaneous injection of denosumab (120 mg) on day 0, 7, 14, 28 and every 4 weeks for 12 months thereafter. This was followed by denosumab administered every 8 weeks for 10 months. After this, the patient received denosumab every 12 weeks for 28 months, and this treatment is still ongoing. The patient is also on an oral daily supplement containing calcium and vitamin D.\n\n【40】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【41】In a 2-month follow-up, the patient showed neurological improvement as she was able to ambulate with a walker. Six months later, the patient was able to walk without gait aid and had full neurological recovery. A CT scan done at the 7-month follow-up did not show any significant reduction in tumour mass. After 4 years of follow-ups, both CT and MRI imaging showed no significant reduction in tumour size in the mediastinum, but there was a slight decrease in primary tumour mass . Currently, the patient has not developed any further neurological problems and displayed no side effects from long-term denosumab usage.\n\n【42】<img/>\n\n【43】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【44】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5</u>\n\n【45】The thoracic spine anteroposterior (AP) view images (A) after a 4 year follow-up showed a large mass in the chest wall without significant reduction in tumour size. However, in MRI of the thoracic spine demonstrated slightly decreased tumour mass in the spinal canal. (B) MRI T2-weighted showed mass without significant reduction in size in the mediastinum. (C) Axial T2-weighted image at T4 also showed a mass with a less occupied spinal canal.\n\n【46】Discussion\n----------\n\n【47】In this case, the patient had a large unresectable spinal GCT expanding into the posterior mediastinum that involved the thoracic spinal canal with cord compression, resulting in paraplegia. The patient was treated with standalone denosumab after spinal decompression with posterior instrumentation and without any attempt of tumour resection. The neurological status gradually improved and fully resolved within 6 months of denosumab administration. The interesting point is that this patient had an adequate clinical response but not radiological outcomes. The improved clinical conditions could be the result of urgent decompression and altered loading of the spinal column following posterior instrumentation. 4 Although, repeated biopsy for evaluating histological response was not performed after denosumab administration. The neurological condition of the patient remained stable without any side effects from denosumab usage over 4 years of follow-up.\n\n【48】GCT of the spine is usually located in the vertebral body from where it continues to extend to other parts of the spine, including the lamina, spinous process, and even the paravertebral area. 9 Patients with spinal GCT usually present back pain at the site of tumour or neurological deficit before definite diagnosis. 11 As in this case, the tumour destroyed all spinal columns of thoracic vertebrae and invaded the vital adjacent structures (not only the spinal cord and nerve roots but also the intramediastinal organs). The surgical removal of the tumour by total en bloc spondylectomy is an effective method against spinal GCT. This method also leads to improvement in neurological function in patients with complete paralysis before surgery. 12 However, not all patients were suitable to undergo an extensive invasive surgical procedure.\n\n【49】This tumour was defined as an unresectable lesion as it was too large to achieve a wide surgical margin in a difficult anatomical location, leading to potentially severe morbidity and mortality after surgical resection. Therefore, systemic treatment is advised to reduce severity of the disease and stop tumour progression. One of the effective systemic treatment options is denosumab. A previous study reported that 96% of patients with unresectable lesions showed no signs of further progression after denosumab was given every 4 weeks with a median follow-up of 13 months. 13\n\n【50】Denosumab is a fully humanised monoclonal antibody for the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, which inhibits osteoclastic activity. 13 For treatment of GCT of the bone, denosumab causes new bone formation and downgrades a high-grade lesion to a lesser grade by increasing the rim of ossified bone on the periphery. 14 15 A formed osseous rim helps decrease the possibility of injury to adjacent neurovascular structures, facilitates ease of surgical resection and prevents tumour contamination. 8 Moreover, there have been reports of successful use of denosumab in recurrent, metastatic and unresectable lesions, especially in spinal GCT. 5 15 To date, there is still no standard optimal dose and duration of denosumab use in treating spinal GCT. Various doses and durations in previous studies are shown in table 1 . The efficacy of long-term treatment and whether GCT remains sensitive with denosumab is still unclear. Interestingly, our case demonstrated disease control after denosumab injection, with a reduced interval from weekly to every 3 months for more than 50 months. However, a previous study reported complications, including osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral fracture, skin rash and hypophosphatemia following long-term denosumab use with a median time of 54 months for unresectable GCT. 16 There were no complications or instances of denosumab toxicity in our patient. This implies that our denosumab regimen is able to control spinal GCT in patients who cannot have the entire tumour removed.\n\n【51】View this table:\n\n【52】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【53】Table 1\n\n【54】Dose and duration of denosumab for treating spinal GCT\n\n【55】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【56】I remember that I felt hopeless when I could not move my legs. After the first operation, I still could not move my leg and was afraid that I would be permanently disabled. Surprisingly, 6 months after the operation, the weakness subsided, and I could walk independently. Currently, I am happy with the results even if I have to come to the hospital for drug injections every 3 months.\n\n【57】### Learning points\n\n【58】   Patients with aggressive spinal giant cell tumours (GCTs) may exhibit neurological deficit or mediastinal mass.\n\n【59】   Neurological deficits resulting from unresectable spinal GCT can be improved with use of our denosumab regimen.\n\n【60】   Long-term denosumab usage ceases GCT progression and seems to be safe.\n\n【61】   A definite conclusion about our denosumab regimen as standard treatment for unresectable spinal GCT cannot be made.\n\n【62】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【63】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【64】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors are sincerely thankful to Dr. Sorranart Muangsomboon, Instructor and Anatomical Pathologist, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, for assistance in histological findings review, and Aditya Rana, from the Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, for assistance in proofreading the English of this report.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Stellate ganglion phototherapy (SGP), a non-invasive procedure for modification of the sympathetic nervous system, is an effective treatment for refractory ventricular tachycardia (RVT). However, there are limited data on the efficacy of SGP for RVT in patients with CS. In our case report, we found that SGP was effective for treating RVT in a patient with CS.\n\n【2】We present the case of a man in his 60s with multiple cardioversions of implantable cardioverter defibrillator for ventricular tachycardia. The patient was administered prednisolone for the management of CS, which subsequently led to an increase in anti-tachycardia pacing for ventricular tachycardias. We introduced SGP to suppress RVT and anti-tachycardia pacing decreased from 371 to 25 events. Thus, SGP could be a feasible option for the management of RVT in patients with CS.\n\n【3】   arrhythmias\n   pacing and electrophysiology\n   anaesthesia\n\n【4】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【5】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

The purpose of this study is to report a case of RVT in a patient with CS who was successfully treated with SGP.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A man in his 60s with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shock for ventricular tachycardia (VT) was admitted to our hospital. One year before admission, the patient developed sick sinus syndrome and VT due to non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Consequently, an ICD was implanted, and he was treated with 100 mg amiodarone (AMD) and 2.5 mg bisoprolol daily. There were no incidences of ICD shocks after ICD implantation, except for a few occasions of anti-tachycardia pacing 通用删除1(英):<u>( online supplemental figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【16】### Supplemental material\n\n【17】\\[bcr-2022-249183supp005.pdf\\]\n\n【18】ECG revealed a heart rate of 60 beats per minute (bpm), the QRS and QT intervals were within normal limits. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed diffuse, severely reduced left ventricular function (ejection fraction, approximately 35%) and the aneurysmal wall in the left inferior ventricle . The laboratory test results were within the normal ranges, including a serum potassium level of 4.7 mmol/L and thyroid function. However, brain natriuretic peptide levels were elevated to 156 pg/mL due to decreased cardiac function.\n\n【19】<img/>\n\n【20】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【22】Echocardiographic findings.

Prednisolone at 30 mg/day was initiated on day 8, as corticosteroid therapy is recommended in cases of CS. 13 However, following corticosteroid therapy, the patient frequently suffered from multiple anti-tachycardia pacing for non-sustained VTs, which caused general malaise. Corticosteroid therapy for CS was considered as a possible trigger for VT and the treatment was discontinued. No other immunosuppressive drugs were initiated out of concern for avoiding drug-induced VT. Although three-dimensional endocardial mapping was performed, the VT circuit was not revealed. Additional epicardial mapping was avoided because the investigators did not have enough experience with epicardial ablation.

SGP, stellate ganglion phototherapy.\n\n【38】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【39】After SGP therapy, incessant VTs were significantly reduced without any further complications, such as Horner’s syndrome and vagal or laryngeal recurrent nerve blockades. Subsequently, the frequency of anti-tachycardia pacing therapy decreased from 371 to 25 times. Consequently, palpitations and general malaise improved. The patient was discharged on day 49 without any symptoms .\n\n【40】Two episodes of anti-tachycardia pacing recurred after the discontinuation of SGP following discharge. Hence, SGP was re-initiated two or three times a week. No further episodes of ICD shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing occurred. Thus, sotalol was discontinued, and amiodarone was reduced to 100 mg/day. Hereafter, the initiation of immunosuppressive drugs is considered for the basic treatment of CS.\n\n【41】Discussion\n----------\n\n【42】This is the first report describing a case of RVT in a patient with CS who was successfully treated with modification of the sympathetic nervous system using SGP.\n\n【43】Corticosteroid therapy and catheter ablation have been reported to have beneficial effects on ventricular arrhythmias in patients with CS, but their limitations have also been discussed. 3 4 The disease process in CS is considered to be a combination of active phase inflammation and chronic phase fibrosis. 4 Triggered activity or abnormal automaticity associated with disease inflammation in the active phase may lead to ventricular arrhythmia. 4 14 Therefore, corticosteroid therapy has been reported to have a beneficial effect on ventricular arrhythmias by suppressing disease inflammation in patients with CS. 3 4 However, corticosteroid was also reported to increase the burden of ventricular arrhythmias, 15–17 and this mechanism is poorly understood. In contrast, during the chronic phase, it is likely that macro re-entry circuits around cardiac scarring cause VT. 5 6 Cardiac scarring has been reported to extend not only to the endocardium, including the left and right ventricles, but also to the epicardium, 1 4 which may be challenging to ablate in ill-equipped facilities.\n\n【44】Ventricular arrhythmogenesis is often associated with the sympathetic nervous system. 7 SGP, a neuromodulation therapy that non-invasively suppresses sympathetic neurological activity, is reported to be effective for RVT. 11 12 The stellate ganglion, which is the therapeutic target of neuromodulation therapies, is located in the intervertebral space between the C7 and T1 vertebral bodies. 18 It is irradiated through the skin surface using a phototherapy treatment device: Super Lizer, (Tokyo Iken Co), which uses linearly polarised near-infrared light with high magnetic permeability. 11 The wavelength band is 600–1600 nm, which allows the non-invasive penetration of light into the tissues to inhibit sympathetic neurological activity without any other nerve blockades. 11 Although SGP has been shown to have an antiarrhythmic effect on RVT in dilated cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cardiomyopathy, 11 12 limited data are available regarding patients with CS.\n\n【45】In the present case of CS, ventricular arrhythmias increased immediately after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy, the standard therapy for CS. Therefore, steroid treatment is potentially a significant cause of ventricular arrhythmias. Catheter ablation of the endocardium did not suppress RVT, which suggests that the critical conduction pathway of VT extended to the epicardial muscle. Due to certain technical difficulties in treatment, additional ablation was not performed. Despite such a challenging case, successful non-invasive treatment of RVT was achieved with bilateral SGP.\n\n【46】In conclusion, we present a case of RVT in a patient with CS who was successfully treated by SGP, which is a non-invasive modification therapy of the sympathetic nervous system. SGP could be a key therapeutic option for the management of RVTs in patients with CS. Nevertheless, further studies are required to clarify these effects.\n\n【47】### Learning points\n\n【48】   Corticosteroids and catheter ablation may not always be sufficiently effective for managing ventricular tachycardia in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis.\n\n【49】   Neuromodulation therapies via the stellate ganglion can be effective for the treatment of refractory ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【50】   Stellate ganglion phototherapy, a non-invasive neuromodulation therapy that suppresses sympathetic neurological activity, could be a key therapeutic option in the management of refractory ventricular tachycardia in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis.\n\n【51】### Supplemental material\n\n【52】\\[bcr-2022-249183supp001.pdf\\]\n\n【53】### Supplemental material\n\n【54】\\[bcr-2022-249183supp002.pdf\\]\n\n【55】### Supplemental material\n\n【56】\\[bcr-2022-249183supp003.pdf\\]\n\n【57】### Supplemental material\n\n【58】\\[bcr-2022-249183supp004.pdf\\]\n\n【59】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【60】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【61】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The patient had difficulty passing urine and felt mass bulging through the vaginal opening for 6 months. She reported three to four episodes of incontinence per day and two to three episodes of enuresis per night with a poor flow for the last 2 months. Clinical examination of the pelvis revealed inferior descent of urinary bladder with hard consistency and posteroinferior descent of the rectum. There was complete prolapse of the uterus and vagina with external os exposed. An unenhanced MRI of the pelvis was advised to look for the pelvic viscera’s status and assess the protruding hard consistency mass.\n\n【5】Unenhanced MRI of the pelvis revealed complete prolapse of the uterus, vagina (procidentia) and rectum below the pubococcygeal line (middle and posterior compartment prolapse) . There was inferior descent of the urinary bladder forming an hourglass appearance with a large well-defined, oval-shaped structure in the prolapsed part of the bladder lumen suggestive of cystocele with a large calculus (anterior compartment prolapse) . The calculus appeared hypointense on all MRI sequences. Cystocele was irreducible due to the presence of the large calculus. The primary goal was to remove obstructive urinary symptoms, considering weak pelvic muscle, significantly large hiatus and large calculus in the bladder lumen. The abdominal approach was selected due to vaginal wall oedema, and correction of rectal prolapse by rectosigmoidectomy, reanastomosis and posterior colporrhaphy was done. Cystolithotomy was performed, calculus was removed and hiatus was repaired using an abdominal approach by the urologist. The bladder wall was significantly inflamed, and the vaginal route was not selected to avoid fistula formation as bladder mucosa was significantly inflamed. Considering the age of the patient, an abdominal supracervical hysterectomy was done. The vaginal wall and pelvic floor muscles were provided mainly by posterior colporrhaphy and sacrocolpopexy using native tissue. For rectal prolapse, posterior colporrhaphy was done after rectosigmoidectomy and reanastomosis. Burch urethropexy and perineoplasty were done to support the pelvis.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【9】(A,B) MRI.

A large calculus (asterisk) is seen in the prolapsed part of the urinary bladder (UB) with inflamed wall. The figure also demonstrates procidentia marked as a black arrow along with peritoneocele (white arrow). There is prolapse of the rectum inferiorly and posteriorly below the pubococcygeal line that suggests posterior compartment prolapse (white star).\n\n【14】A cystocele is a pelvic organ prolapse where the bladder descends inferiorly and posteriorly into the vagina and perineum. Cystocele is quite a common condition accompanied by other pelvic viscera prolapses. 1 2 The incidence of cystocele is around 9 per 100 women-years, and the affected age group is mainly the geriatric group. Muscles and tissue supporting the bladder become weak, allowing it to herniate out of its place. During vaginal childbirth, chronic constipation, violent coughing or heavy lifting can happen.\n\n【15】The occurrence of irreducible cystocele with procidentia caused by the simultaneous event of large urolithiasis is relatively rare. Developing obstructive urinary symptoms and changes (hydroureter and hydronephrosis) in the urinary tract makes this entity urgent for intervention.\n\n【16】The most common presentation in cystocele is increased urination frequency, stress incontinence, frequent urinary tract infection, discomfort and pain in the vagina and tissue protruding in the perineum that may be tender or bleeding. A pelvic examination can assess how far the uterus has slipped into the vagina. The investigation to diagnose cystocele is through cystourethrogram and MRI. Cystourethrogram helps in identifying the configuration of the bladder and any blockages. MRI is more valuable in cystocele to determine the full extent of bladder prolapse and helps in grading. MRI also provides information on other viscera and the status of muscles forming the pelvic floor.\n\n【17】Various surgical approaches have been proposed for procidentia and multiple compartmental prolapses with large bladder calculi. The predictive value of apical prolapse will increase as the cystocele stage increases. In the case of anterior compartment prolapse, proper suspension of the vaginal apex plays an essential role in treatment success. 3 A study of over 2700 women comparing isolated anterior repair versus combined anterior and apical repair found lower rate of 10-year reoperation in the combined anterior and apical repair group (11.6% vs 20.2%). 4\n\n【18】Correction of anatomical defect is the basic principle of surgery for cystocele. Laparotomy, laparoscopic and robotic system approaches can be preferred with vaginal or abdominal routes. The risk of fistula formation is higher if the calculus is removed by the vaginal route during anterior colporrhaphy. However, transvaginal cystolithotomy is the preferred surgery as it is minimally invasive. With the suprapubic cystotomy approach, no risk of fistula formation seems to occur and it cures the patient completely.\n\n【19】Apical prolapse surgeries are classified into two categories: the first one is the obliterative approach, and the second one is the restorative approach.\n\n【20】Abdominal sacrocolpopexy can be performed with various approaches, such as laparotomy, robot assisted-laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy or conventional laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy, and remains the gold standard for patients desiring restorative outcomes.\n\n【21】An obliterative procedure can be done in patients who cannot tolerate extensive surgery due to old age and no longer desire preservation of coital function.\n\n【22】There are three ways in case of prolapsed uterus in patients with apical prolapse. First is the supracervical hysterectomy with sacrocervicocolopopexy, in which the uterus is not preserved. The second option can be sacrohysteropexy. The uterus and vagina are fixed with a mesh to the sacral promontory, preserving the uterus. The third option is sacrocolpopexy, in which closure of the vaginal cuff is done after total hysterectomy. Based on these options, it is difficult to determine whether sacrohysteropexy and total hysterectomy and sacrocolpopexy result in superior outcomes given our current knowledge. 5–8\n\n【23】The supracervical hysterectomy is way better as it reduces the risk of mesh erosion and cautery-induced thermal injury to the vagina. 9 Warner et al 5 observed that the mesh exposure rate was 4.9% in the total hysterectomy group. The supracervical hysterectomy group (p=0.03) showed no mesh exposure.\n\n【24】In 2006, a randomised study was conducted by Paraiso et al 10 for comparing outcomes of three different rectocele repair techniques: posterior colporrhaphy, site-specific repair and site-specific repair augmentation with a porcine small intestinal submucosal graft. After 1 year, subjects who received site-specific repair alone (6 of 27; 22%) or posterior colporrhaphy (4 of 28; 14%) (p=0.02) had better results than those who received graft augmentation as there was a significantly greater anatomical failure rate (12 of 26; 46%).\n\n【25】The abdominal surgical route is preferred for patients with anterior and posterior prolapse and a high risk of recurrence.\n\n【26】This case is an unusual presentation of the large vesical calculus in the prolapsed part of the cystocele, which is further complicated by the neglected middle and posterior compartment, making it necessary because the surgical approach needs to be modified based on complications and age of the patients. 11\n\n【27】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【28】I was in pain for the past few months, and my symptoms have increased in severity, affecting my daily routine activity. I came to the hospital with great hopes. Doctors assured me about my condition and advised me to undergo surgery. After many discussions, I agreed to surgery, and I am happy that doctors had saved my life. Doctors also asked me to come for a general check-up every month.\n\n【29】### Learning points\n\n【30】   Multispecialty approaches are needed in case of multicompartmental prolapse with irreducible cystocele containing calculus due to long-standing situation complicating the anatomy of the pelvis resulting in various urinary complications such as hydronephrosis and cystolithiasis.\n\n【31】   Imaging has to cover the entire urogenital system to diagnose preoperatively. MRI was superior to CT because of its inherent soft tissue resolution and non-invasive nature.\n\n【32】   Urgent surgical correction of the obstructive symptoms is essential. Inclination towards vaginal approach towards cystolithotomy is more in literature than the abdominal route. However, the patient’s age and clinical/local examination findings are essential to decide the surgical approach to avoid postoperative fistula formation and ureteral injuries.\n\n【33】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【34】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【35】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Current treatment strategies are based on agents without tumour cell specificity, such as proteasome inhibitors (eg, bortezomib, carfilzomib), immunomodulatory drugs (eg, thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide) monoclonal antibodies (eg, daratumumab, elotuzumab) and conventional chemotherapy.\n\n【10】Genome sequencing of myeloma cells revealed a wide spectrum of potentially actionable mutations, including BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, FAM46C, DIS3 and others. 2\n\n【11】The mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK pathway is the major signal transduction cascade that regulates cell growth. In myeloma the most frequently observed recurrent mutations involve this pathway. 3 An emerging therapeutic target is the BRAF V600E mutation that leads to constitutional activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling pathway and results in tumour cell growth, differentiation and survival. 4\n\n【12】Oral inhibitors of BRAF-mutant kinase are approved and widely used for the treatment of BRAF-mutant melanoma. 5 In MM, BRAF V600E mutations are detected in 3%–10% of patients, and have been associated with rapidly progressing, relapsed or refractory disease, extramedullary disease and IgA MM, with short PFS and overall survival. 6\n\n【13】The activating BRAF V600E mutation was reported to be of therapeutic relevance in MM: The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib as a single agent was evaluated in a small study of patients with BRAF-mutant MM. Although the overall response rate was 33%, median PFS of 4.3 months was short and suggested early resistance. 7 In experimental tumour models and in patients with malignant melanoma, MEK activation was shown to compensate for pharmacological BRAF inhibition, and combined MEK and BRAF inhibition was highly synergistic and therefore able to delay resistance. 8 Our hypothesis was that MM harbouring an activating mutation of BRAF could be highly vulnerable to dual BRAF and downstream MEK inhibition. Here, we describe successful treatment with a combination of dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib in a patient with refractory BRAF-mutant MM.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A man in his 70s presented with an osteolytic skull lesion, headache, bone pain, and pancytopenia without fever. Biopsy of the skull lesion revealed IgA-kappa MM with an extraordinarily high proliferation index (Ki67=70%). Cytogenetic studies indicated high-risk disease with gain of 1q and IGH-FGFR3 fusion t(4;14); serum free light chain concentrations were kappa 195 mg/L and lambda 8 mg/L, with elevated kappa/lambda ratio (24.4). At diagnosis, serum paraprotein was 13.2 g/L.\n\n【16】Standard systemic therapy with bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) was initiated, along with palliative radiotherapy to the skull (15×2.5 Gy) and to an osteolytic vertebral body (12×3 Gy). After five cycles, the patient met the criteria for very good partial response (VGPR). After two further cycles of treatment, rapid clinical and serological relapse was evident, with regrowth of the skull lesion and increased kappa light chains (936 mg/L). Carfilzomib was initiated as a salvage treatment but was unsuccessful, and kappa light chains rose to 1307 mg/L. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-CT indicated a metabolically active MM with osteolytic bone lesions, extramedullary soft tissue lesions and pleural effusion . Severe fatigue, bone pain requiring opioid analgesics, anaemia and fever were present, with deterioration of performance status to ECOG 3 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status).\n\n【17】<img/>\n\n【18】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【20】PET scan before (A) and after 4 weeks of treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib (B), (A) Initial PET scan, (B) PET scan after 4 weeks.

Evaluation of the primary biopsy specimen, using PCR and sequencing of exon 15, revealed BRAF V600E mutation (c.1799T>A). In the liquid biopsy, we identified dominant newly emerging mutation clusters in RAS genes and altered MAP kinase (MAP2K1) ( table 1 ).

The patient died 11 months after the beginning of treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibition.\n\n【41】Discussion\n----------\n\n【42】Our patient had highly aggressive disease responding poorly to prior standard therapy. Combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib was well tolerated, and led to rapid clinical, radiographic and laboratory response. This observation is consistent with other preliminary reports on dual inhibition of BRAF/MEK in MM. 10 11\n\n【43】Raab et al presented results of 12 patients with BRAFV600 mutant relapsed MM treated with encorafenib (BRAF-inhibitor) and binimetinib (MEK-inhibitor). Overall response was achieved in ten of the twelve patients (83%), six of whom had a VGPR and three had complete remission. No new safety signals could be identified. 12 Interestingly, two patients under dual BRAF/MEK inhibition had new KRAS mutations at time of progression—one with the same KRAS p.G12V mutation we found in our patient.\n\n【44】In another study of 180 paired tissue biopsies of newly diagnosed and relapsed MM Xu et al showed enrichment of RAS and BRAF mutations in relapsed MM compared with newly diagnosed MM. As expected, BRAF mutations were significantly associated with activated downstream signalling while only KRAS and not NRAS mutations were associated with pathway activation. 3 These findings correspond well with our observations.\n\n【45】MM follows multiple evolutionary pathways over a patient’s course of disease. Keats et al used serial genomic analysis of samples collected at different points of progression in 28 patients. They found in a high-risk patient with t(4;14)—similar to our patient—a higher mutation rate than patients without high-risk genetic abnormalities. Different clones appeared to compete with each other depending on the selection pressure caused by therapy. 13\n\n【46】These observations suggest that resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibition can be mediated by selection of genetically distinct resistant clones characterised by activating mutations of RAS genes. A better understanding of resistance mechanisms could lead to the development of new therapies acting on the RAS/RAF pathway (eg, highly selective KRAS or pan-KRAS inhibitors).\n\n【47】Sequencing of BRAF provides a rapid method for detecting BRAF V600E mutations. 14 The presence of this mutation should be considered particularly in patients with limited treatment options such as rapidly progressive disease, IgA MM and extramedullary disease. 15 While the primary biopsy can be re-examined, a new bone marrow/extramedullary biopsy should be preferred at relapse, as mutations are more common in the recurrent setting. A ‘liquid biopsy’ may be an alternative to repeat bone marrow sampling to characterise the mutational landscape that developed during clonal selection in response to the specific treatment.\n\n【48】Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition represents a promising strategy for treating BRAF V600-mutated MM. More information is required regarding the long-term success rate and optimal treatment regimen at relapse.

Neonates who present with this diagnosis generally do not undergo genetic testing. Therefore, the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta(OI) type VIII rests solely on the clinical features. Since it is prevalent, this is a wake-up call for more surveys to be undertaken for the same genetic variant and to identify potential couples who may transmit the gene to their offspring, especially among those who have relatives diagnosed with Osteogenesis Imperfecta.\n\n【11】Type VIII OI is autosomal-recessive, characterised by white sclerae, severe growth deficiency, extreme skeletal under-mineralisation and bulbous metaphysis. 1 Its prevalence is approximately 1 in 10 000–20 000 births. 2\n\n【12】We report a case that required genetic testing for confirmation, the results of which helped greatly in counselling the baby's parents. The case in question required a multidisciplinary approach to management.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】The term neonate was born to non-consanguineous parents. He was the second born- with an 18 month older female sibling. The mother’s pregnancy was uneventful, and she had attended all her antenatal clinic appointments. She was given routine haematinics and folic acid, and the tetanus vaccine as per standard of care. She progressed well, although she noted poor weight gain in the third trimester.\n\n【15】Antenatal ultrasound was not done. The baby was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery and admitted to the neonatal unit with severe respiratory distress and malformed limbs, both upper  and lower . The head circumference was 35 cm at birth. Clinically, the features appeared similar to OI, but a possible metaphysical dysplasia was considered because the sclerae were not blue .\n\n【16】<img/>\n\n【17】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【19】(A) Right upper limb with shortened humerus and curved ulna .

A homozygous, likely pathogenic variant was identified in the P3H1 gene. The result is consistent with the genetic diagnosis of autosomal-recessive OI type VIII. The variant coordinate was NM\\001243246.1: c.1095C>G p with amino acid change: (Tyr365\\), recessive homozygous, nonsense, likely pathogenic (class 2).\n\n【37】Echocardiography revealed a structurally normal heart.\n\n【38】Ultrasound of the abdomen showed normal renal and hepatic morphology.\n\n【39】Serum alkaline phosphatase was 652 mmol/dL (normal level up to 125 mmol/dL).\n\n【40】Lactate dehydrogenase was also raised to 585 mmol/dL.\n\n【41】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【42】The differential diagnosis was metaphysial dysplasia on account of the symmetrical short bones, macrocephaly and absence of blue sclerae.\n\n【43】Treatment\n---------\n\n【44】The baby was treated with appropriate antibiotics for pneumonia and paracetamol for pain. Supportive care was given, including feeding by tube and providing oxygen during the pneumonia episode.\n\n【45】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【46】The baby was discharged after 3 weeks when his condition was stable. He was readmitted at 8 weeks with severe pneumonia. At this time the highest saturations (sPaO2) were in the mid-70s, and he was acidotic with a blood pH of 7.27 and carbon dioxide retention. The baby succumbed to severe pneumonia aged 10 weeks.\n\n【47】The results of genetic analysis were available prior to the baby's death. The mother was counselled, and both parents returned after 6 weeks (the customary period of bereavement) to discuss the test results in more detail.\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】OI, an inherited connective tissue disorder, is recognised by excessive brittleness of the bones. It is the most common genetic disorder of bones with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 10 000–20 000 births. 1 2 It has several classification types, and infants with the worst form of the disease die in the perinatal period.\n\n【50】Type VIII OI, a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterised by white sclerae, severe growth deficiency and bone fragility, was added to the classification in 2007 as a severe and lethal type. 1 Type VIII OI accounts for fewer than 10% of patients with OI. DNA analysis is considered a definitive test for confirming the diagnosis. 3\n\n【51】A similar case of type VIII OI due to a homozygous mutation of c.1914+1G>C (NM\\001243246.1) in P3H1 exhibited retinal detachment, emphasising the need for fundoscopic examination as part of a multidisciplinary approach. 4\n\n【52】The variant P3H1, and variant coordinate 1095C>G p.(Tyr365\\) , create a premature stop codon. 5 6 Pathogenic P3H1 variants are causative for autosomal-recessive OI type VIII. In 2007, Cabral et al described a form of autosomal-recessive OI that they designated OI type VIII, characterised by white sclerae, severe growth deficiency, extreme skeletal under-mineralisation and bulbous metaphysis. 1\n\n【53】However, this variant coordinate is rare, as compared with the c.1080+1G>T described in West Africa and the descendants of West Africans in the USA. 5 In Cabral et al’ s study, the screening of contemporary cohorts in West Africa revealed that nearly 1.5% of West Africans are carriers for this mutation and 0.4% of African Americans of Western African descent are carriers. 7\n\n【54】The carrier rate in our setting is not known and the variant coordinates are different from what was found in our case. As this is a homozygous-recessive variant, there is a need for genetic counselling and further survey of the families. Although the parents in our case were non-consanguineous, the recessive nature of this condition indicates the need for further screening of the families after genetic counselling in the familial context if possible, similar to the scenario in individauls of Karen descent. Due to resource constraints, however, this is not possible. 1 8\n\n【55】Type VIII OI patients present with severe to lethal OI, recessive inheritance, white sclerae, rhizomelia, and poor trabeculation of long bones, with most of the affected individuals dying early from respiratory causes, as in our case. Those who survive into childhood have extremely low bone mineral density, severe growth deficiency and bulbous metaphysis.\n\n【56】A multidisciplinary team approach is essential for management, with the aim of providing the maximum long-term function and autonomy that the disease allows. 3 9 Clinical management encompasses physical rehabilitation and surgical procedures, and management of hearing, dental and pulmonary abnormalities.\n\n【57】Fratzl-Zelman et al studied five individuals with type VIII OI. 9 All the patients had white sclerae, normal dentition, relative macrocephaly, triangular facies, and skeletal findings that included rhizomelia, radiographic “popcorn” calcifications at epiphyses, and extremely low bone density. Bisphosphonate treatment was initiated, but progressive skeletal deterioration with age was observed.\n\n【58】Our case demonstrates the importance of genetic testing, which revealed typical P3HI gene mutations. P3H1 , cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and cyclophilin B (CyPB) assemble into a 1:1:1 complex within the endoplasmic reticulum that post-translationally modifies specific proline residues in unfolded collagen alpha chains. 10 Recessive OI (types VII and VIII) is caused by deficiency of any of the three collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex components, increasing modification of the collagen helix, supporting delayed collagen folding. In type VIII OI there is the absence of alpha1 (I)Pro986 3-hydroxylation and over-mediation of the collagen helical region, supporting delayed folding. 11\n\n【59】A multidisciplinary approach to management was used in our case, which included neonatologists, medical officers, endocrinologists and geneticists. This case demonstrates the challenge in confirming the diagnosis in our setting due to limited resources, and the possibility that most cases of type VIII OI are missed.\n\n【60】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【61】Although my baby died, I am very grateful to the doctors that took care of him. I am glad that it was possible to do a genetic test, despite this being expensive and not available in our country. The test was done for free. The doctors told me that my baby had a rare condition for which there is no cure, and I thank God for the few weeks I spent with my baby before his death.\n\n【62】### Learning points\n\n【63】   Pathogenic P3H1variants are causative for autosomal-recessive OI type VIII.\n\n【64】   Genetic testing is important for the diagnosis of Type VIII OI.\n\n【65】   A multidisciplinary approach in management is important to maximise the long-term survival of the patient.\n\n【66】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【67】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【68】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s)\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank the parents and also the doctors and nurses in the Neonatal Unit and General Pediatrics.

Symptoms had started on postoperative day 2. No signs of wound dehiscence or cutaneous leakage of CSF were found. Lumbar spine CT suggested a CSF leak, and the patient was admitted to a neurosurgery ward, where she remained on bed rest. Lumbar spine MRI on postoperative day 12 revealed two CSF leaks with associated bilateral pseudomeningoceles, and an unforeseen intradural CSF collection extending from the conus medullaris to the L5 vertebral body . The latter caused the anterior displacement of the conus medullaris and compaction of the cauda equina nerve roots, which were displaced anteriorly but also seen residing centrally within the thecal sac, acquiring what has been dubbed the ‘flying bat’ sign for lumbar subdural hygroma. 1\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【13】Postdiscectomy day 12 lumbar spine MRI.

He has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to schizophrenia. He was referred to our hospital due to sudden worsening of subcutaneous emphysema after a contusion on the right side of the chest due to a fall. He initially had stable vital signs with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. However, subcutaneous emphysema, extending from the face to both thighs, was noted.\n\n【6】The chest radiographs and CT scan revealed a fracture of the ninth rib on the right, right-sided pneumothorax, mediastinal emphysema and severe bilateral subcutaneous emphysema.

On day 3, a cuff-leak test was performed. Since there was no leak, methylprednisolone (mPSL) was administered to improve his airway oedema. 4 After completing the administration of mPSL, the patient was extubated with the tube exchanger intact.

This is initially attempted with medical measures; the failure of which requires some form of surgical intervention. Trabeculectomy is the gold standard for glaucoma filtering surgery, in which aqueous humour flows into the subconjunctival space leading to an elevation of the conjunctiva, referred to as a ‘filtering bleb’. The success of trabeculectomy is frequently augmented by the use of mitomycin C (MMC). 3 MMC is an antifibrotic agent. Cotton sponges are soaked in MMC 0.1–0.5 mg/mL and applied between the sclera and conjunctiva for 1–5 min. Subsequently, the sponges are removed and the area of application is washed thoroughly with a balanced salt solution. MMC prevents excessive postoperative scarring and thus reduces the risk of failure of trabeculectomy. However, MMC is associated with bleb thinning in the long term, which increases the risk of bleb leak, hypotony and bleb-related infections. 4 The current literature shows variability in the reported incidence of these complications. Bindlish et al , in their retrospective review of primary trabeculectomy with MMC and laser suture lysis, reported an incidence of bleb leaks of 14.6%, blebitis in 5.7% and endophthalmitis in 0.8% of eyes during 1–3 years of follow-up. 5 A study by DeBry et al estimated the 5-year probability of developing a bleb leak, blebitis and endophthalmitis as 17.9%, 6.3% and 7.5%, respectively. 4 Bleb leak is a major risk factor for bleb-related infections. 6 One study reported that trans-conjunctival oozing and point leaks at least 3 months after trabeculectomy with MMC occurred in 2%. 7 Small leaks can be sealed with soft bandage contact lenses, cyanoacrylate glue or autologous fibrin glue, 8 9 but studies have shown that bleb revision is associated with better outcomes and reduced risk of intraocular infections as compared with those managed more conservatively. 10 Myopia, conjunctivitis, upper respiratory infection, intraoperative use of MMC, antibiotic use in the postoperative period and blepharitis have also been associated with an increased risk of bleb-related infection. 7 11 Surgical bleb revision has a protective effect against bleb-related infection when such risk factors are present. 11 We present a patient with a thin cystic leaky bleb who underwent bleb revision surgery with a successful outcome.\n\n【5】A male patient with primary congenital glaucoma in his early 20s presented with gradual, painless, progressive diminution of vision in the left eye, 13 years after he underwent trabeculectomy with MMC. On clinical examination, visual acuity was 4/60 with an IOP of 4 mm Hg in the left eye. A thin cystic bleb  was observed on slit-lamp examination with positive Seidel’s test  and evidence of hypotonic maculopathy in the fundus. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) demonstrated a multicystic bleb with thin overlying conjunctiva . Considering the risk of infection due to active leak, bleb revision was performed using a ‘bleb-sparing epithelial exchange technique’ ( video 1 ). 12 The IOP was 12 mm Hg at 1 week postoperatively with a diffuse bleb on clinical examination . AS-OCT also showed a diffuse bleb with a thick overlying Tenon and conjunctiva . Visual acuity was improved to 6/18 at 3 months.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【9】(A) Clinical photo showing thin cystic bleb.

Here, we report a man in his 70s with acute onset of dysarthria, dysphagia and hemiplegia showing brainstem and subcortical lesions, which responded to steroid and colchicine therapy. He had a history of uveitis and was homozygous for the human leucocyte antigen-B51 allele, and we clinically diagnosed him with acute neuro-Behçet’s disease. Old-age onset neuro-Behçet’s disease is uncommon, and as far as we know, this is the oldest case of the first attack of neuro-Behçet’s disease.

Here, we describe an elderly case of first-attack neuro-Behçet’s disease who was homozygous for the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 allele and who presented with dysarthria, gait disturbance and a brainstem lesion, and responded to corticosteroid and colchicine therapy.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A man in his 70s was referred to our hospital on suspicion of a brain tumour on MRI. The patient first presented to a local doctor due to a 3-day history of gait disturbance, left hemiparaesthesia, dysarthria and dysphagia. MRI of the brain showed high-intensity lesions in the brainstem and left caudate nucleus. He had a history of uveitis and retinitis pigmentosa in his 30s and was blind. He also had a medical history of hypertension and bronchial asthma and was being treated with esaxerenone (2.5 mg/day), azilsartan (20 mg/day), amlodipine (5 mg/day) and tulobuterol patch (2 mg/day).\n\n【12】On physical examination, he had a mild fever of 37.2°C, without headache or consciousness disturbance. He showed no skin rash on the extremities or body trunk. No vulvar ulcers or stomatitis were noted. The pathergy test was negative. Vulvar ulcers were absent.\n\n【13】On neurological examination, he showed dysarthria and dysphagia. He displayed mild paraesthesia and hypoesthesia on the left half of the body, including the face. The deep tendon reflexes in the extremities showed hyper-reflexia, and his gait was spastic. Areflexia was detected for the plantar reflexes.\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】His history was not remarkable except for the history of uveitis and retinitis pigmentosa. He had not been previously noted to have Behçet’s disease. Also, he had no family history of Behçet’s disease. Blood examination revealed no elevation of white cell count (5.4 x 10 <sup>2 </sup> /µL; normal 3000–8900/µL), liver enzymes, normal kidney function and no increased levels of cancer markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19–9 and soluble interleukin (IL)−2 receptor). Autoimmune antibodies (rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antiaquaporin-4 antibody and antimyelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody) were negative. Antiaquaporin-4 antibody and antimyelin oligodendroglial antibody were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed normal results without elevation of IL-6 (11.0 pg/mL; normal <17 pg/mL); CSF oligoclonal IgG bands and CSF cytopathology were negative. HLA analysis revealed homozygosity for the B51 alleles.\n\n【16】MRI of the brain showed hyperintense lesions in the brainstem and left caudate nucleus. These lesions were hyperintense in diffusion-weighted and apparent diffusion coefficient images. Gadolinium enhancement was absent, and MR spectroscopy showed an elevation of the choline peak and preserved N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) peak, suggesting neuroinflammation .\n\n【17】<img/>\n\n【18】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【20】MRI of the patient’s brain.

(E) The brainstem lesion was negative for gadolinium enhancement (arrowhead). (F) MR spectroscopy showed a choline (Cho) peak and preserved N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) peak.\n\n【21】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【22】Based on the history of uveitis and HLA-B51 homozygous allele, neuro-Behçet’s disease is the most likely diagnosis. According to the diagnostic criteria, the patient did not meet the criteria of the International Study Group Criteria 6 but had a steroid-responsive brainstem lesion that improved on colchicine alone. The patient meets the criteria for probable neuro-Behçet’s disease according to the International consensus recommendation criteria for neuro-Behçet’s disease diagnosis. 2 It is a brainstem lesion in an elderly person and possibly a brain tumour. Other possibilities include demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.\n\n【23】Treatment\n---------\n\n【24】According to the acute onset of a brainstem lesion, MRI findings and HLA-B51 positivity, we started oral corticosteroid and colchicine therapy after intravenous methylprednisolone administration (1000 mg/day for 3 days) on suspicion of neuro-Behçet’s disease.\n\n【25】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【26】After administration, his symptoms gradually ameliorated, and 2 months later, he returned home with minor sequelae of mild left hemiparesis and gait disturbance. At that time, we diagnosed him as neuro-Behçet’s disease. Follow-up MRI showed a reduction of the brain lesions. Therefore, we ceased oral corticosteroid administration for 2 months and continued with colchicine treatment alone, and he has not had a relapse to date .\n\n【27】<img/>\n\n【28】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【29】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【30】Clinical course. After steroid therapy and oral colchicine induction, the patient’s symptoms and MRI of the brain lesions were improved (arrowheads). mPSL, methylprednisolone; PSL, prednisolone.\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】Behçet’s disease was first described by the Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Behçet in 1937. 7 Behçet’s disease is a systemic inflammatory disease with an unknown cause that is common in the Far East, Middle East and Mediterranean regions along the Silk Road, and a genetic predisposition has been shown. 8 Behçet’s disease commonly affects men between the ages of 20 and 40 years, and the clinical features and course of the disease are reportedly closely related to sex and age. 9 Our patient may have had Behçet’s disease in his 30s when he had uveitis but was not diagnosed at the time. Behçet’s disease with an onset over 60 years of age is rare, but there are a few reports of cases with an age of onset over 70 years with ophthalmic and dermatological manifestations. 10 With the recent ageing of the world’s population, the number of elderly patients with Behçet’s disease is likely to increase. In addition, there is reportedly a higher rate of neurological symptoms as the age of onset increases. 3 However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports of new-onset neuro-Behçet’s disease in patients aged over 70 years. Therefore, our case has the oldest onset age of neuro-Behçet’s disease.\n\n【33】Considering the diagnosis of our patient, he presented with a brainstem lesion, which is frequently a diagnostic challenge because there is considerable risk associated with biopsy, and there are many differential diagnoses including primary brain tumour, metastatic cancer, malignant lymphoma, cerebrovascular stroke and autoimmune inflammatory diseases (such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, neuro-Behçet’s disease and neurosarcoidosis). Our case showed poor gadolinium enhancement on MRI, and malignancy was unlikely. On MR spectroscopy, he showed an elevated choline peak and preserved NAA peak, which suggest demyelination or inflammation. Choline in the brain is usually in an insoluble form, so a high choline peak may represent abnormal choline mobility, suggesting inflammation, demyelination and remyelination. 11 In addition, a decrease in NAA reflects axonal injury or loss. Meanwhile, a preserved NAA peak indicates that axonal damage is mild. 11 The location of the brainstem lesion in our case also supports the diagnosis of neuro-Behçet’s disease. 12\n\n【34】Regarding CSF examination, our case showed normal CSF test results. More than 30% of patients with neuro-Behçet’s disease reportedly do not have CSF pleocytosis, 5 so normal CSF findings cannot be used to rule out a diagnosis of neuro-Behçet’s disease. In our case, the fact that the patient was homozygous for the HLA-B51 allele also contributed to the diagnosis. Menthon et al reported that the risk of developing Behçet’s disease is 5.78 times higher in HLA-B51 carriers than in non-carriers. Especially, in a Japanese cohort, the risk ratio was found to be 7.48 times higher in HLA-B51 carriers. 13 Also, previous report showed that in various types, neuro-Beçhet’s disease have the highest rate of HLA-B51 positivity. 14\n\n【35】For the treatment of neuro-Behçet’s disease, steroid therapy is effective in the acute phase, but it may increase the rate of side effects and should be administered for a short period of time. 15 For this reason, colchicine (1.0–2.0 mg/day) administration immediately after the first attack and continued for 5 years is recommended to prevent relapse. 15 In addition, the administration of cyclosporine to suppress ocular Behçet’s disease is known to induce neuro-Behçet’s disease. 16 Therefore, if a patient is taking cyclosporine, it is best to discontinue it. Our patient had a good outcome with the use of steroids and colchicine.\n\n【36】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【37】The patient said, “I was initially pessimistic because I thought my illness was a brain tumour. Now, with steroid treatment and colchicine medication, I came back home and am satisfied with my life.”\n\n【38】### Learning points\n\n【39】   Behçet’s disease over the age of 70s is considered to be rare.\n\n【40】   Treatable brain lesions, including neuro-Behçet’s disease, should be listed in the differential diagnosis of brain lesions of the elderly.\n\n【41】   Clinicians should consider human leucocyte antigen tests for diagnosing neuro-Behçet’s disease even if the patients are over their 70s.\n\n【42】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【43】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【44】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A draft of this manuscript was edited by NAI, Inc.

Bladder cancer is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and it is related to tobacco use. 3 When interviewing a patient with this genital presentation, the urological malignancies, such as bladder or prostate cancer, should be excluded. 4\n\n【5】We report a case of a man in his early 60s who presented to the emergency department with 2 weeks of progressive penoscrotal oedema. He denied genital trauma or prolonged erection. He smoked 20 cigarettes a day.\n\n【6】On physical examination, oedema of the penoscrotal area and cutaneous fibroma were seen. Enlarged bilateral inguinal adenopathies were palpable.\n\n【7】He was investigated with contrast-enhanced thorax, abdomen and pelvis CT scan. The CT scan showed multiple retroperitoneal, axillary, pelvic, inguinal and iliac adenopathies . An infiltrative vesical mass  obstructing the left ureter caused marked dilation and chronic atrophy of the left kidney. Also, a defect of repletion in the left calyceal system suggested ureteral tumour dissemination. An omental cake, which is an extensive peritoneal dissemination with omental metastasis, and hepatic metastasis were described. Although the left kidney was atrophic, his blood analyses showed preserved renal function with creatinine 0.75 mg/dL.\n\n【8】<img/>\n\n【9】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【11】Axial section of contrast-enhanced pelvic CT scan showing an infiltrative vesical mass (arrowhead) and multiple adenopathies (arrow).\n\n【12】Transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT) was debated in a tumour board. The TURBT is not a curable approach in a metastatic or unresectable stage. In order to obtain a pathology sample to confirm the diagnosis, we decided to perform an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of an inguinal adenopathy due to its availability and quick results. The sample was obtained in the pathologist’s office the same day with no admission.\n\n【13】Pathology reported a high-grade urothelial carcinoma. After multidisciplinary discussion, a palliative platinum-based chemotherapy of cisplatin and gemcitabine was started for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. At 6 months, ureteral disease progressed and the patient was accepted at a clinical trial  with erdafitinib for FGFR mutated progression on platinum-based chemotherapy. The lymphadenopathies reduced its size in the 3-month review of the CT scan and the penoscrotal oedema showed partial improvement. The patient is alive after 12 months of follow-up.\n\n【14】Bladder cancer spreads first to perivesical nodes and then to the presacral nodes, followed by the internal iliac, obturator and external iliac nodes. 5 The penis lymphatic drainage drains to superficial and then deep inguinal lymphatic nodes and later to the iliac nodes. 6 So, neoplastic enlargement of the inguinal or iliac lymphatics can cause drainage obstruction that expresses as secondarily painless penoscrotal oedema. The idiopathic penoscrotal oedema can be also caused by an infectious genital disease, injury after trauma, lymphadenectomy, radiation or underlying malignancy. 2 4 7\n\n【15】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【16】Translated to English from native language.\n\n【17】When I visited the emergency room twelve doctors came to see my problem and no one thought it would be this serious. I was suffering from internal pain and swelling of my genitals… I had to wait for a month to get the scan done and meanwhile the disease was spreading. I knew something was going on. The moment the scan was done, I received a call from the hospital and then they told me the diagnosis. It was shocking to hear that I had a spread disease. I was upset that none of the doctors that I visited thought that my inflammation could be something severe. I knew that the treatment was being delayed… Now I am alive and my cancer is regressing but this drug has severe effects on my eyes and nails, I cannot drive anymore. But it works well.\n\n【18】### Learning points\n\n【19】   Penoscrotal oedema can be caused by malignant compression of inguinal nodes.\n\n【20】   Persistent penoscrotal oedema should be studied with imaging techniques.\n\n【21】   Bladder cancer is a very prevalent disease.\n\n【22】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【23】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【24】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

He had no history of trauma or fever. He had no known comorbidities. On examination, he was found to have tenderness over D10–D12 region. Neurological status was found to be normal. HLA-B27 was found to be positive, while rheumatoid factor was negative. Radiographs of the lumbosacral spine showed bilateral sacroiliitis, bamboo spine and syndesmophytes . Dorsal spine radiograph showed irregularities, and erosions of the end plates of D11–D12 vertebral bodies , which was suspected to an Andersson lesion. MRI of the spine showed signal intensity changes involving the D11–D12 intervertebral disc space and vertebral end plates. The lesion has the classical hemispherical shape, was hypointense on T1 weighted images , hyperintense on T2 weighted images  and short tau inversion recovery images . It also showed vertebral end plate erosions and reactive sclerosis  and sacroiliitis . The absence of any surrounding abscess also helps to rule out infective spondylodiscitis. These features confirmed the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis with Andersson lesion of D11–D12. Conservative treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was attempted for 6 weeks; however, the patient had inadequate pain relief. The patient then underwent posterior spinal stabilisation and instrumented fusion of D9–L2 vertebra , supplemented by minimally invasive anterior discectomy, anterolateral interbody fusion of D11–D12 with cage and bone grafting . We chose to stabilise such a long segment in view of involvement of the thoracolumbar transition zone, osteoporosis and the large forces acting as a result of the long lever arm created by fusion of vertebra in ankylosing spondylitis. The patient was followed-up for a period of 2 years and was found to have no progress of symptoms or recurrence of the Andersson lesion .\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】(A) Antero-posterior and (B) lateral radiograph of lumbosacral spine, (C) dorsal spine radiograph showing bilateral decreased SI joint space, and sclerosis around SI joints, suggestive of sacroiliitis .

Macular oedema was noted in the right eye while the left eye was within normal limits. Slit lamp biomicroscopy revealed a probable excavation in the inferotemporal aspect of an otherwise healthy optic nerve . Optic-disc-pit maculopathy (ODM) was suspected. Line-scan optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed subretinal fluid at macula that communicated with the optic nerve head. Schisis of the retinal layers along with an outer lamellar macular hole was also noted confirming the clinical diagnosis .\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】(A) Fundus photo (right eye) demonstrates presence of a single grey round depression at the inferotemporal margin of the optic disc (red circle) suggestive of an optic-disc-pit. A resultant fluid accumulation at the macula and fovea can be noted (blue arrow and star). (B) Line scan optical coherence tomography (OCT) through macula of the right eye demonstrates schisis of the neural retinal layers (yellow arrow) and large schitic cavities centrally (yellow star). There are also signs of an optic-disc-pit (red circle) and an outer macular hole (yellow circle).

(D) Eight-month follow-up OCT (upper panel) shows nearly resolved IRF and SRF, with closure of the outer macular hole as compared with (C). Centrally spared residual ILM flaps can be seen (star). Well-stuffed optic-disc-pit can be noted in the horizontal OCT scan (lower panel) passing through the optic disc (arrow). ILM, internal limiting membrane.\n\n【9】Surgery was planned with the aim of removing traction around the optic-disc-pit and fovea, and to seal the optic-disc-pit. It was performed under the guidance of intraoperative OCT (iOCT, online supplemental video file ) . Vitrectomy was performed and posterior vitreous detachment was induced. This was followed by a titrated endolaser around the pit at its retinal margin using repeat laser mode at high inter spot interval. Dye-assisted fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling was performed to avoid formation of a full-thickness macular hole. iOCT was applied to confirm successful removal of the preoptic nerve head glial tissue and vitreous fibres, and to precisely judge the pit’s location . This step identified the site for a tuck-in and provided an apt surgical exposure to the optic-disc-pit. Next, pedunculated ILM flaps were fashioned. A tuck-in procedure was performed using these flaps to seal the pit under the guidance of iOCT . Inadvertent deroofing of the foveal outer hole was ruled out with iOCT. Fluid-air exchange was performed keeping the flute needle away from the ILM flaps to avoid damage or extrusion of the flaps. This was followed by injection of 14% C3F8 gas.\n\n【10】### Supplementary video\n\n【11】\\[bcr-2023-254884supp001.mp4\\]\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【15】(A) Intraoperative OCT horizontal scan (before ILM peeling) showing the outer lamellar macular hole (yellow arrow), subretinal fluid (yellow star) and retinoschisis.

The optic-disc-pit was sealed well. The subretinal fluid decreased dramatically though with a persistent outer macular hole. The foveoschisis had also reduced signalling recovery of the maculopathy . Eight months after the surgery, best-corrected visual acuity improved to 20/60. The optic-disc-pit remained sealed with continued resolution of macular oedema and successful closure of the outer macular hole .\n\n【17】ODM occurs in up to 25%–75% of optic-disc-pits. 1 The evidence of the fluid origin from the optic-disc-pit is supported by the OCT finding of communication between the retinal fluid and the pit itself. 2 3 It is known that resolution of macular fluid and regain of visual function following surgery is a slow process happening over months to years as noted in our case too. 3 To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of iOCT-guided management of ODM enabled by locating the otherwise clinically ‘probable’ site of the pit, confirming the ‘clear’ prepit area before the tuck-in, and further a successful tuck-in itself.\n\n【18】### Learning points\n\n【19】   Preoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) is useful for diagnosis and postoperative OCT is essential to understand healing in optic-disc-pit maculopathy, which is a slow process. OCT performed during the surgery provides the connection between the OCT evaluations before and after the surgery.\n\n【20】   Intraoperative OCT is useful to the operative surgeon for confirmation of the optic-disc-pit location, dissection over the pit area and performing the tuck-in procedure.\n\n【21】   Cleaning of the pit area, and removal of glial tissue and vitreous fibres around the optic-disc-pit may enable a permanent tuck-in and sealing of the pit. This step needs to be performed carefully to avoid damage to the retinal nerve fibres entering the disc and can be well observed with intraoperative OCT during the surgery.\n\n【22】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【23】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【24】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

It is more common in premature infants but can also be seen in adults with necrotising enterocolitis (ECNA) or non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia. ECNA is a cause of PVG with very few cases described in literature and with high mortality. It is a multifactorial condition and the eliciting factors include infection, ischaemia and protracted ileus. 1 The radiographical findings are impressive since it is very difficult to suspect it straightforward and diagnosis comes when the presentation is fulminant. 2\n\n【5】Our case is a 67-year-old male retired painter diagnosed with pT2N0M0 bladder urothelial carcinoma, with a medical history of type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate. Discussion in joint Multidisciplinary Team recommended radical cystectomy with no neoadjuvant chemotherapy. According to the surgeon’s preferences, preoperative bowel preparation, opioid analgesia and prolonged fasting were avoided. Nevertheless, we did not strictly adhere to Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol. The patient underwent open radical cystectomy with cutaneous ureterostomy as planned, received antibiotics on induction, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, meticulous fluid management and no epidural anaesthesia was administered. No intraoperative complications were encountered, with minimal blood loss and no concerns of mesentery/bowel injury. Postoperative intensive care unit admission was not deemed necessary by the operating team. Early nutrition and opioid analgesia were avoided with introduction of parenteral nutrition for the first 72 hours. Minimal surgical drainage was reported. Twelve-hour post procedural clinical review revealed abdominal distention while the patient complained of nausea, suggestive of possible postoperative bowel obstruction, and a nasogastric tube was inserted. Although his symptoms seemed controlled, they persisted until 72 hours postoperative when he became tachypnoic and mildly acidotic (pH 7.3, lactate 2.3 mmol/L). His biochemistry results showed white cell count of 14.200 ×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 46 mg/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 38 mL/min and creatine of 2.2 mg/dL with a baseline of 87 and 1.15, respectively.\n\n【6】Urgent high dependency unit transfer and non-contrast CT scan were arranged. Imaging demonstrated not only a massively air-filled colon but also air in the colonic wall (pneumatosis coli) and PVG extending peripherally to the hepatic branches . On exploratory laparotomy, the ascending colon and approximately 120 cm of terminal ileum appeared necrotic and were removed. Although the typical ‘skip lesions’ of intestinal ischaemia were missing and the mesenteric vessels were patent, the condition was consistent with necrotising enterocolitis. During dissection, the respective mesentery appeared thickened with tense adhesions, but tissue sampling was avoided to minimise iatrogenic damage. Acute sclerosing mesenteritis was suspected as possible cause, nonetheless no histological evidence exists. Pathology report confirmed full thickness intestinal ischaemia scattered through the specimen. The initial operation was straightforward and to our knowledge, no surgical mishap took place which may have caused the above complication. The only compounding factor recognised was the prolonged paralytic ileus which is a common occurrence after major abdominal surgery. Hirobe et al showed that paralytic ileus was one of the most common complications that occurred in 22.2% of the patients post radical cystectomy. 3 Case demonstrating PVG in X-ray was successfully managed conservatively. 4 Nevertheless, ultrasonography and CT scan are considered more sensitive in detection of PVG than conventional radiography. 5\n\n【7】<img/>\n\n【8】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【10】Abdominal X-ray showing distended bowel loops  and bilateral single-J ureteric stents appropriately sited through cutaneous ureterostomy.\n\n【11】<img/>\n\n【12】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【14】Axial plane of non-contrast CT scan.

Diagnosis of this disease primarily depends on the isolation and detection of the pathogen in a blood sample collected from the peripheral vein, catheter port and haemodialysis circuit and in catheter port swabs. 2 However, some CRBSI may present atypically with persistent low-grade fever without chills and rigour. 3 These may lead to diagnostic confusion and delay in detecting CRBSIs.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A male patient in his 40s with end-stage diabetic nephropathy on maintenance haemodialysis through a cuffed tunnelled catheter presented with a history of intermittent, low to moderate-grade fever for 3 weeks. The fever was associated with generalised weakness and night sweats but not with chill and rigour. During this time, he complained of exertional breathlessness, mild intermittent cough, and loss of appetite. Furthermore, he complained of left axillary pain for 2 days.\n\n【12】He denied pain or discharge at the site of the cuffed tunnelled catheter. He did not have complaints of any nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, upper respiratory symptoms, blood in sputum, sore throat, earaches, pain in the abdomen or pain during micturition.\n\n【13】He had been diagnosed with end-stage chronic kidney disease (ESKD) and had been on maintenance haemodialysis thrice weekly for the last 6 months with an average interdialytic weight gain of 2 Kg. At admission, his haemodialysis access was cuffed tunnelled catheter through the right internal jugular vein (IJV). He also had poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, anaemia and coronary artery disease. His surgical history included left brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) surgery on his left arm 1 month ago.\n\n【14】Physical examination revealed the patient had tachycardia of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/76 mm Hg and normal saturation at room air with a respiratory rate of 20/min. On auscultation, there were reduced breath sounds on the left side, and normal heart sounds. On local axillary examination, there was focal tenderness in the left axilla, but no palpable mass or skin colour alteration could be detected. The catheter site showed no heat, erythema, swelling or tenderness. Thrill was present in the left AVF. Inspection of the bilateral extremities was otherwise within normal limits. The abdomen was soft and non-tender, with no clinical evidence of visceromegaly.\n\n【15】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【16】Chest radiography revealed left hydropneumothorax with multiple focal pulmonary nodular opacities.

However, lung infections like mycobacterial and fungal infections were considered due to the respiratory symptoms, cavitary nodules, and loculated hydropneumothorax on CT.\n\n【47】The common differential diagnosis for cavitary lung nodules includes tuberculous and atypical mycobacterial infection, fungal infection, and septic embolus.\n\n【48】Though the reverse halo sign around lung nodule on CT is commonly associated with mucormycosis and COVID-19, other causes of reverse halo sign from infective aetiology include other fungal infections like invasive aspergillosis, tuberculosis, and bacterial pneumonia.\n\n【49】Pain in the left axilla had two clinical differentials diagnosis: axillary lymphadenopathy and axillary abscess.\n\n【50】Treatment\n---------\n\n【51】The patient was started on piperacillin–tazobactam on an empirical basis as per departmental policy to provide broad-spectrum gram-positive and gram-negative coverage. Initially, haemodialysis was continued with the cuffed tunnelled catheter through the right IJV for a few days. After culture from axillary discharge detected MRSA, which was sensitive to vancomycin, the antibiotic was switched from piperacillin–tazobactam to vancomycin. Vancomycin was initiated with a loading dose of 25 mg/kg and was administered thrice weekly during the last hour of dialysis, with the maintenance dose between 7.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. As vancomycin trough level monitoring is not routinely possible for most patients due to financial limitations and the long turnaround time of vancomycin test results, our institution protocol is to use lower maintenance doses of 7.5 mg/kg on the first two dialysis sessions of the week having an interdialytic gap of 2 days and higher maintenance dose 10 mg/kg during the third session after which there is a longer interdialytic gap of 3 days. Subsequently, after isolation of MRSA, the cuffed tunnelled catheter in the right IJV catheter was removed due to the possibility that the persistent fever, endocarditis and cavitary lung nodules could be related to a metastatic infection. The catheter was replaced with a non-tunnelled left femoral catheter for maintenance haemodialysis.\n\n【52】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【53】By the tenth day of admission, the fever had subsided with an increase in appetite. During the admission period, blood cultures obtained regularly at an interval of 4 days remained persistently negative. The patient was discharged home on the 22 day of admission and was advised to continue an intradialytic maintenance dose of intravenous vancomycin for 4 weeks. He was asymptomatic during follow-up for 1 month. The biochemical follow-up of the patient after the initiation of vancomycin is summarised .\n\n【54】<img/>\n\n【55】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【56】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6</u>\n\n【57】Flowchart showing biochemical follow-up of the patient after the initiation of vancomycin (flowchart by D Saha). CRP, C reactive protein; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; TLC, total leucocyte count.\n\n【58】Discussion\n----------\n\n【59】The incidence of CRBSIs is higher in non-tunnelled catheters than in tunnelled catheters. However, the chances of infection due to tunnelled catheters are 5–10 times higher than those due to haemodialysis access through AVF or arteriovenous graft. 4\n\n【60】Metastatic infection causing endocarditis, septic arthritis and pulmonary septic emboli is a serious complication of CRBSI, leading to significantly higher mortality. The probability of metastatic infection depends on the infective aetiology and is highest with S. aureus . 5 Colonisation with MRSA is more common in haemodialysis patients than in peritoneal dialysis patients or the normal population. Approximately 20% of those colonised with MRSA eventually develop bacteraemia. 6 MRSA has been identified as the aetiologic agent in approximately 21% of cases of infective endocarditis. 7\n\n【61】In our case, though the clinical possibility of CRBSI was very high due to the presence of fever and tunnelled catheter, there was a diagnostic delay in establishing a definite aetiology because of negative blood cultures. However, blood cultures may be negative in up to 20%–30% of suspected CRBSIs. We present a summary of common preanalytical errors that result in false negative blood cultures and perspectives of our case in table 2 . 8\n\n【62】View this table:\n\n【63】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【64】Table 2\n\n【65】Common preanalytical errors that result in false negative blood cultures in relation to our case\n\n【66】The other notable observation in our case was the lack of a high fever or signs of sepsis despite the patient suffering from infective endocarditis. Though fever is the most common finding in infective endocarditis patients, there is no diagnostic utility in assessing various fever patterns in infective endocarditis. Fever may have variable severity and may or may not be associated with chills. So the possibility of indolent presentation of infective endocarditis must be considered in clinical practice. 9 Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and ESKD with intermittent haemodialysis are known risk factors for immune dysfunction. 10 11 In our case, uncontrolled diabetes and chronic maintenance haemodialysis could have led to mild immune dysfunction, which may have resulted in the indolent presentation of the disease.\n\n【67】Cavitary nodules on chest CT in patients with a short or intermediate history of fever narrow the common differential diagnosis to infective causes, which include typical and atypical mycobacterial infection, fungal infection and pyogenic septic emboli. Other common but non-infective causes of cavitary lung nodules include malignancies, rheumatoid nodules and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. 12 In our patient, the cavitary nodules were likely due to pyogenic septic emboli, and these lesions gradually resolved with successful antibiotic therapy.\n\n【68】A reverse halo sign in chest CT is defined as a lung lesion with central ground-glass opacity with a peripheral rim of consolidation. Though this sign is common in mucormycosis and COVID-19, it can also be found in other infections like invasive aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, mycobacterial tuberculosis and bacterial pneumonia. Other less common causes include malignancy, pulmonary infarction, and sarcoidosis. 13\n\n【69】### Learning points\n\n【70】   Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is common in patients with chronic kidney disease on haemodialysis.\n\n【71】   Clinical presentation of metastatic MRSA infection with infective endocarditis may be indolent with cardiovascular and respiratory stability with the absence of fever spikes, chill and rigour.\n\n【72】   Common infective causes of cavitary nodules in the lung are typical and atypical mycobacterial infection, fungal infection and pyogenic septic emboli.\n\n【73】   Uncommon infective causes of reverse halo sign on CT chest need to be remembered and include bacterial pneumonia, septic embolism, mycobacterial infection, invasive aspergillosis, in addition to common infective aetiology of reverse halo sign-like mucormycosis infection and COVID-19.\n\n【74】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【75】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【76】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【77】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【78】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Pavan Wakhare and Dr Nilesh Shinde have been involved in the care of the patient and have helped in the drafting of the article.

Here, we exemplify why this is not the case.\n\n【5】We report a child, born at 38 weeks to non-consanguineous parents, who presented to the paediatric team at 4 months of age with poor feeding, developmental delay, dysmorphic features and failure to thrive. Facial features included hypertelorism, bilateral ptosis, down-slanting palpebral fissures, a high-arched palate, long fingers and toes and macrocephaly.\n\n【6】A clinical diagnosis of a RASopathy was suspected, and the patient’s DNA was analysed for pathogenic variants in 15 genes within the Ras-MAPK pathway (a targeted gene panel)—up-to-date available testing at the time. A maternally inherited variant in NF1 c.3218\\3232dup22 was identified and reported as a variant of uncertain significance. This variant was also present in his mother (father was not available for testing). Finding this variant was unexpected, but as it was maternally inherited and as his mother displayed a similar phenotype, a provisional diagnosis of Noonan-NF1 (Neurofibromatosis type 1)-related disorder was made. In view of the NF1 variant of unknown significance and unclear fit with clinical phenotype, he went on to have duo whole exome sequencing which did not identify any relevant pathogenic variants.\n\n【7】At 7 years of age, he was re-referred to Genetics clinic from Neurosurgery due to a new development of cervical vertebral abnormalities. Advancements in genomic testing meant that both the patient and mother were able to undergo further agnostic duo exome sequence analysis. The patient was then found to be heterozygous for a SKI missense variant (c.59C>T, p.Thr20Met Class 4 variant)—this was not present in the mother.\n\n【8】A patient previously diagnosed with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) had a similar variant. 2 Our patient’s phenotype had evolved over time, making a diagnosis of SGS more obvious when finally detected on exome sequencing.\n\n【9】This report illustrates the importance of clinical phenotyping and repeated clinical review of patients to aid diagnosis. Detailed clinical phenotyping enabled a diagnosis to be made in this patient even when initial exome sequencing was deemed negative.\n\n【10】Investigative genetic technology will continue to advance, yet this makes clinical phenotyping even more crucial as a diagnosis must fit with both the genetic and phenotypic picture. Further advancements in promising technology will progress genomic medicine. 1 3 Yet research into improving phenotyping algorithms may be just as important in coming to a diagnosis. It has been suggested that this area may be potentially overlooked and that current algorithms may lack accuracy when it comes to clinical phenotyping. 4 Due to the importance of clinical phenotyping, further research into phenotyping algorithms should be undertaken; genome sequencing is here to stay, but clinical phenotyping remains an important diagnostic tool.\n\n【11】### Learning points\n\n【12】   Clinical phenotyping remains important in diagnosing genetic conditions despite advancements in genomic testing.\n\n【13】   Repeated clinical review of patients with potential genetic conditions will aid in diagnosis due to evolving phenotype.\n\n【14】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【15】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【16】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

It is an intermediate-grade malignancy that rarely metastatizes, but has a high recurrence rate. Diagnosis is established by histopathology. 1 Here, we describe a typical presentation of DFSP in a woman and the utility of dermoscopy and radiologic imaging in the diagnosis and management.\n\n【5】A woman in her 40s presented with an asymptomatic enlarging lesion on her right shoulder from past 1 year. Examination revealed a firm, non-tender, skin-coloured to brown multilobular plaque measuring about 1.5×1.5 cm . Polarised dermoscopy (using DermLite DL3, 3Gen, San Juan Capistrano, California, USA) from different areas of the lesion revealed white homogeneous structureless areas surrounded by linear serpentine and branching vessels , linear serpentine vessels on a pink background  and pigment network over a whitish background . The clinico-dermoscopic diagnosis of DFSP was confirmed by histopathology showing monomorphic spindle-shaped cells, without atypia or mitoses, diffusely infiltrating the dermis and subcutis in whorls or storiform pattern. Epidermis showed increased melanisation of basal layer . Immunohistochemistry was not performed due to lack of facilities. CT delineated a well-defined soft tissue attenuation mass extending into subcutaneous plane  and also confirmed absence of chest metastases . Based on the radiological delineation of the tumour, a wide excision with 2 cm margins was performed and the wound closed primarily. Intraoperative frozen sections and postoperative histological assessment revealed tumour-free resection margins. Regular follow-up (once in 3 months) was advised.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【9】Skin-coloured to brown circumscribed plaque with multilobular surface (A).

The trunk, shoulders and pelvic region are frequently involved. Other forms include morphea-like, atrophoderma-like and angioma-like DFSP. Majority of the patients exhibit a t(17;22)(q22;q13) translocation predisposing tumour formation following trauma. 1 2 Common dermoscopic features in DFSP include pink background, hypopigmented or depigmented areas, arborizing telangiectasia, linear vessels, shiny white structures and pigment network. 3 We observed similar features. The homogeneous white areas correspond to diffuse fibroblast aggregates, telangiectasia to the dilated vessels and pigment network to the increased basal layer melanisation.\n\n【15】Microscopically, DFSP is a tumour localised to deep dermis and subcutis showing diffuse infiltration of monomorphic cells in whorled or storiform patterns. The cells show small oval or spindle-shaped nuclei with scanty cytoplasm and low mitotic rate. Immunohistochemically, majority show positivity with CD34 and negativity with FXIIIa, SMA, desmin, S100 and cytokeratins. Histological variants include a fibrosarcomatous type (showing high mitotic index and marked nuclear atypia) and a pigmented variant (Bednar tumour). 1 2 4 On CT imaging, DFSP commonly shows well-defined isodense cutaneous or subcutaneous nodule without calcification. We noted similar features. MRI usually shows a well-defined isodense nodule compared with muscle on T1-weighted images, and on ultrasound, as a low echogenic mass with rich vascularity. 5\n\n【16】Although metastasis and fibrosarcoma transformation are rare, being locally infiltrative, DFSP has a high postoperative relapse rate. Hence, the principal aim of surgery is to ensure clean tumour-free resection margins. Mohs micrographic surgery is hence considered ideal. Wide excision with at least 2 cm margin is recommended if the latter is not possible. For recurrent lesions requiring wide and deep resection and/or for facial lesions, ensuring complete excision to achieve tumour-free resection margins and achieving best possible aesthetic outcomes are necessary. In this regard, pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap and anterolateral thigh perforator free flap reconstructions have been employed to good effect. 6 7 Most of the recurrences after primary excision tend to occur within the first 3 years with a median of 32 months noted in a study. 1 8 9 Hence, a quarterly to half-yearly follow-up during this period and a lifelong annual follow-up thereafter is recommended. Complete physical, cutaneous and systemic examination should be performed at each visit and robust evaluation done only when metastasis is suspected. 1 8\n\n【17】### Learning points\n\n【18】   Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare fibrohistiocytic tumour that is considered intermediate between benign dermatofibroma and malignant fibrosarcoma.\n\n【19】   Although histologically exhibits banal features, DFSP is a locally infiltrative tumour accounting for its high recurrence rate following excision and can rarely metastatize.\n\n【20】   Diagnosis of DFSP is established by histopathology. Dermoscopy and radiological assessment are useful non-invasive adjuncts to assert the clinical diagnosis. The latter also helps in delineating the tumour extent to facilitate optimal surgical resection and also in ruling out distant metastases.\n\n【21】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【22】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【23】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

He was referred to our clinic to remove the left maxillary third molar and four supernumerary teeth because of the bite in the buccal mucosa. He had no significant medical history, except for hay fever, or congenital deformities. Two maxillary central impacted supernumerary teeth were removed at 11 years of age. He had no family history of supernumerary teeth, congenital deformity, or colorectal tumours. However, his younger brother had a congenitally missing tooth. In the intraoral examination, four supernumerary teeth around the left maxillary were noted: one supernumerary tooth on the palate side and three supernumerary teeth on the buccal side . The panoramic radiograph showed no residual deciduous teeth and congenital loss of the permanent teeth. Cone-beam CT showed four supernumerary teeth around the left maxillary second molar, and these teeth were single-rooted and thinly curved . All supernumerary teeth and the left maxillary third molar were removed under local anaesthesia. All supernumerary teeth showed microdontia with single roots. Each crown form was different. Conical crowns, incisor-like crowns and crowns with 2 and 4 cusps were noted. The length and width of the supernumerary teeth were 9–13 and 3–5 mm, respectively .\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】(A) Intraoral photograph (mirror image) showing four supernumerary teeth around the left maxillary second molar.

Although the mechanism of occurrence of the supernumerary teeth is unclear, the phylogenetic theory, tooth germ dichotomy theory, and dental lamina hyperactivity theory have been advocated. 7 8 In this case, the dental lamina hyperactivity theory was considered because there was no fusion with the second or third molars, and the developmental time was independent.\n\n【10】### Learning points\n\n【11】   Multiple supernumerary teeth with four or more teeth occur in cleidocranial dysplasia and Gardner syndrome.\n\n【12】   Multiple supernumerary teeth are rare in non-syndromic patients and are mainly impacted.\n\n【13】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【14】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【15】Obtained.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Prof. Tomohiro Ando for his valuable comments.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

She had long-standing poor left visual acuity (VA) due to a compressive optic neuropathy treated by surgery in childhood. She also had chronic angle closure glaucoma, treated with bilateral laser peripheral iridotomies (PIs) and left lensectomy. She was otherwise healthy with no active other medical conditions.\n\n【5】On examination, VA was 6/9.5 and 6/24 in right and left eyes, respectively. She had a left relative afferent pupillary defect, patent bilateral PIs, left pseudophakia and intraocular pressure of 12 mm Hg bilaterally. There was no evidence of intraocular inflammation. While the right optic disc was normal, the left eye had significant cupping and pallor. There was symmetrical perivascular nummular pigmentation with associated chorioretinal atrophy most notable at the superotemporal vascular arcades . Autofluorescence imaging highlighted the extent of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) atrophy in the same distribution, with less marked mottling of RPE autofluorescence nasally . Optical coherence tomography showed preserved foveal photoreceptor structures, no macular oedema/schisis and absent retinal nerve fibre layer in the left eye, in keeping with advanced optic neuropathy. Static perimetry showed advanced visual field loss in the left eye likely due to the advanced optic neuropathy and an early ring scotoma in the right eye more marked inferiorly in keeping with the distribution of retinal atrophy . Rod responses were absent on full field electroretinogram and cone responses were delayed and attenuated with the pathognomonic bright flash a-wave amplitude greater than 30 Hz flicker amplitude. Panel-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) detected a homozygous likely pathogenic mutation (c.305C>A,p.Ala102Asp) in the NR2E3 gene (15q23) which has been reported as responsible for autosomal recessive enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS), also known as Goldmann-Favre syndrome.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【9】Widefield colour Photographs (T200x camera, Optos plc, UK) of the right (A) and left (B) eyes showing predominantly superotemporal perivascular nummular pigmentation and outer retinal atrophy/pallor.

On slit lamp examination, the anterior chamber was quiet  with total cupping in both eyes. The intraocular pressure (IOP) in L/E was 28 mm Hg and 26 mm Hg in the right eye (R/E), which were not controlled despite maximal medical treatment. Needling was performed in the L/E after the gonioscopy affirmed the patency of the ostium. This was done using a slit lamp and no antimetabolite was used. There was no intervention in R/E because there was no perception of light. After 2 weeks of needling, the patient’s IOP kept increasing, necessitating a repeat gonioscopy, which revealed vitreous in the ostium . 1 After pupillary dilation, zonular dialysis and a localised cataract were observed at the 11 o’clock position , confirming vitreous prolapse from the site of zonular dialysis and its eventual passage into the surgical iridectomy, thereby blocking the internal ostium. The vitreous behind the iris was captured using anterior segment optical coherence tomography in the L/E . 2 It was assumed that there was prior zonular dialysis with localised cataractous changes prior to the needling, which could have occurred during the initial surgery. During needling, however, the pressure difference between the anterior and posterior segment causes vitreous prolapse from the zonular dialysis area, eventually blocking the internal ostium. Intrableb scarring, fibrosis, encapsulation in the subconjunctival space, or blockage of the internal ostium with iris, are all common causes of postoperative trabeculectomy failure. 3 None of these events occurred in our case; rather, it was caused by a blockage of the internal ostium with vitreous. The source of this vitreous was a pre-existing zonular dialysis tract that prolapsed vitreous postneedling, blocking the internal ostium and resulting in high IOP. Bleb needling has been reported to be performed successfully up to 30 years after trabeculectomy. 4 A rare complication of bleb needling is vitreous prolapse through the iridectomy site. 5 The prolapsed vitreous may be the only cause of high IOP, resulting in trabeculectomy failure. To control the high IOP, an anterior vitrectomy was performed to remove the prolapsed vitreous strands from the ostium along with a nasal goniotomy. This resulted in a functional bleb with good IOP control.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】(A) Clinical photo of the anterior segment.

This followed detection of bilateral renal artery stenosis during investigation for severe hypertension refractory to medical therapy. CT angiography revealed diffuse wall thickening of the abdominal aorta, in keeping with an aortitis. However, there was no serological or clinical evidence suggestive of a vasculitic process. Medical history included cranial diabetes insipidus, subclavian artery stenosis and spinal stenosis requiring surgery, over the course of 8 years. These findings led to consideration of Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), a form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, where there is abnormal proliferation of histiocytes which causes tissue fibrosis and sclerosis of the long bones. Subsequent plain radiographs of the long bones revealed appearances consistent with a diagnosis of ECD. Thus, a diagnosis of an LCH/ECD overlap syndrome was made.\n\n【2】   hypertension\n   interventional radiology\n   renal medicine\n   rheumatology\n   vasculitis\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

ECD belongs to a group of conditions known as rare histiocytoses and has been recently recognised as a neoplastic disease. The hallmark of ECD is symmetric osteosclerosis of the long bones due to the build up of CD68+ and CD1a− histiocytes, which manifests as bone pain, with leg pain being the most common symptom. 2 3 ECD is a heterogeneous disease, a great mimicker and is underdiagnosed. 1 As ECD is multisystemic, vascular involvement may mimic large vessel vasculitis (eg, Takayasu’s arteritis). We report the case of a male patient investigated for large vessel vasculitis, who was eventually diagnosed with an ECD and LCH overlap syndrome, 8 years after initial presentation. This case was particularly thought-provoking due to the challenge and complexity of the diagnosis and the multiple and varied complications.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】This report describes a male lawyer in his 50s, presenting with a history of hypertension, cranial diabetes insipidus (DI), subclavian stenosis, spinal stenosis and a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH).\n\n【12】Medications included bisoprolol 10 mg daily, amlodipine 5 mg daily, doxazosin 8 mg daily, simvastatin 20 mg nocte and minoxidil 400 mg daily. He was a non-smoker, who drank less than 20 units of alcohol per week. Family history was unremarkable.\n\n【13】The initial diagnosis of cutaneous LCH was made following presentation with alopecia and patchy erythema affecting the head, neck and torso. Skin biopsy findings were consistent with LCH and he was treated with immunosuppression, using azathioprine, which was continued for several years. That same year he was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus (DI) and prescribed desmopressin. The DI was complicated by intermittent severe hyponatraemia, which on one occasion induced an epileptiform seizure. In the following year, he developed back pain, which was related to dural thickening and a tumour involving the cranial dura and spine, which required spinal decompression surgery. Biopsy of the spinal tumour demonstrated inflammatory changes only. Cladribine chemotherapy was commenced, after the spinal cord histiocytic process was operated on.\n\n【14】Seven years after the initial diagnosis of cutaneous LCH, the patient was noted to have developed refractory hypertension. The refractory hypertension was investigated with CT imaging which revealed changes suggestive of aortitis, with arterial wall thickening and bilateral renal artery stenosis, leading to a rheumatology referral. On review, the patient did not have weight loss, fevers or night sweats. There were no symptoms of claudication, but mobility had declined since the operations for spinal stenosis. He did not have bony pain, chest pain or dyspnoea.\n\n【15】On examination, blood pressure (BP) was raised in both arms. The left arm BP measured 140/100 mm Hg and the right arm BP was 180/110. The patient remained hypertensive despite medical management with: bisoprolol 10 mg daily, amlodipine 5 mg daily, doxazosin 8 mg daily and minoxidil 400 mg daily. ACE inhibitors were not used in light of the severe renal artery stenosis, as they may precipitate deteriorating renal function. The subclavian pulse on the left was weaker than the right, in keeping with previous subclavian stenosis. Pedal pulses were palpable. The peripheries were warm and well perfused with no trophic changes. There was no detectable lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\n\n【16】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【17】Review of the CT angiography revealed diffuse wall thickening of the abdominal aorta , a left subclavian artery stenosis, severe stenosis of a single right renal artery and severe ostial stenosis of the superior left renal artery , with complete occlusion of the inferior left anomalous branch, with stenoses also affecting the coeliac axis and inferior mesenteric artery. Laboratory investigations demonstrated normal liver function. Renal function showed urea 7.4 mmol/L, creatinine 112 mmol/L, eGFR 61 mL/min, which was the baseline. The C reactive protein (CRP) level was mildly raised at 19 g/L. Since the chemotherapy treatment there was a chronic normocytic normochromic anaemia, haemoglobin 82 g/L and thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 34×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, attributable to the cladribine chemotherapy. ANA, ANCA, complement factors 3 and 4, rheumatoid factor, immunoglobulins, cryoglobulins and a full virology screen were normal or negative. Urinalysis was negative in all parameters. Bone marrow biopsy revealed trilineage dysplastic features; no excess of blasts were seen. The myeloid lineage cells showed shift to the left and mature myeloid cells were reduced. CD34 positive cells were mildly increased in numbers.\n\n【18】<img/>\n\n【19】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【21】CT angiogram showing (A) diffuse wall thickening of the abdominal aorta . (B) Significant narrowing at the origin of the right and left renal arteries . (C) Marked improvement in the calibre of the left renal artery 6 months after left renal artery angioplasty.\n\n【22】To further investigate the aortic wall thickening, an通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> F-FDG PET/CT was performed which revealed no evidence for FDG avidity in the vasculature.\n\n【23】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【24】A number of factors made the diagnostic process complicated. The presence of aortic wall thickening, left subclavian and visceral artery stenoses with a raised CRP left open the diagnosis of a large vessel vasculitis. However, the absence of systemic symptoms or other signs of chronic inflammation including a normal serum albumin level made this diagnosis less likely. However, interpretation of the blood tests was complicated by the previous chemotherapy. The latter was held responsible for the normochromic normocytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia and this was confirmed following bone marrow analysis. Arterial wall thickening on a CTA scan does not necessarily equate to active inflammation and to investigate this further an通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> F-FDG-PET/CT scan was performed. The lack of any evidence for FDG avidity in the arterial wall at sites of thickening or elsewhere, while not completely excluding a large vessel vasculitis, suggested there was no detectable arterial wall inflammation. As a consequence of these findings and the pre-existing diagnosis of LCH the possibility of ECD was considered. ECD is a known mimic of large vessel vasculitis. Plain radiographs of the long bones (femurs, tibia and fibula) were performed and demonstrated irregular thickening of the cortices, a marked striated appearance of the lower femora, with areas of sclerosis and patchy lucency, a classic finding in ECD . A diagnosis of LCH/ECD overlap, with xanthogranulomatous tissue inﬁltration affecting multiple systems including: the long bones, central nervous system (CNS) and dura, skin, arterial tree and the retroperitoneum was subsequently made.\n\n【25】<img/>\n\n【26】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【27】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【28】Plain radiographs showing irregular thickening of the cortices, a striated appearance of the lower femora, with areas of sclerosis and patchy lucency.\n\n【29】Treatment\n---------\n\n【30】Following a multidisciplinary team discussion involving rheumatologists, radiologists and haematologists, the treatment priority was considered to be control of the refractory hypertension. The patient underwent successful angioplasty of both the right renal artery stenosis and that involving the superior left renal artery. The arteries were balloon-dilated (to 6 mm on the left and 5 mm on the right), resulting in much improved angiographic appearances postintervention . Although attempts were made to cross the occluded segment involving the proximal portion of the left lower pole anomalous renal artery, these were unsuccessful. Following the procedure the blood pressure fell from 241/122 mm Hg to 130/80 mm Hg. The reduction in blood pressure was noted in the right arm, and was not measured in the left arm due to the left subclavian artery stenosis. Following the renal artery angioplasty the dose of doxazosin and bisoprolol were reduced prior to discharge. He was subsequently withdrawn from antihypertensive medication at the follow-up appointment.\n\n【31】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【32】Although blood pressure control remained satisfactory, 1 year postprocedure hypertension returned and a repeat CT angiogram scan revealed recurrent right renal artery stenosis. Angiography confirmed wide patency of the left renal artery branches and a recurrent tight stenosis of the ostium of the right renal artery. Angioplasty allowed dilatation of the artery to 6 mm with excellent antegrade flow into the right kidney. However, a small number of filling defects in the periphery of the right upper pole were consistent with thrombus. A 3-month follow-up MRA showed no restenosis and the blood pressure remains well controlled currently at 132/82.\n\n【33】Ongoing care is provided by haematology, dermatology and rheumatology for the ECD and LCH overlap syndrome. The BRAF V600E mutation found in 50% of ECD patients was not detected. Our patient has evidence of LCH on histology, accompanied by imaging findings pathognomonic of ECD. Coexistence of both conditions is rare but some cases have been reported. 4 It has been suggested that overlap cases typically present with LCH and later progress to ECD. 5 This would be in keeping with our patient’s course.\n\n【34】The patient remains well. A follow-up cardiac-gated通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> F-FDG-PET scan excluded cardiac involvement. Ongoing issues include mild thrombocytopenia, related to the cladribine chemotherapy. In the event that the LCH relapses, interferon-α and/or other biological therapy will be considered.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】ECD is a very rare disease and considered to be a form of non-LCH, resulting from the overproduction of histiocytes. 1 First identified by Jakob Erdheim, an Austrian pathologist, and William Chester, an American cardiologist, in 1930, they referred to it as ‘lipoid granulomatosis’. Dr Ronald Jaffe reported a third case in 1972, naming the condition Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD). 4 The current prevalence of ECD is unknown. The disease is poorly recognised, diagnosis is complicated and hence ECD is likely under diagnosed. 1 ECD has a male to female ratio of 2.4 to 1 and typically presents between 50 and 70 years of age. 1 6\n\n【37】Although the exact aetiology of ECD is unknown, it has been proposed that proliferation of CD68+ and CD1a− histiocytes results in infiltration and accumulation in organs, resulting in tissue fibrosis. 2\n\n【38】BRAF V600E gene deregulation has been implicated in ECD, with BRAF V600E mutations detected in 54% of those with ECD and 38% with LCH, while the mutation was absent in those with the other histiocytoses. 7 The mutation results in uncontrolled generation of histiocytes via activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. 7 ECD predominantly affects the skeleton (95%), CNS (40%), skin, the retroperitoneum including kidneys (40%–50%) and the cardiorespiratory organs (40%–60%). 1 3\n\n【39】Definitive diagnosis of ECD is through biopsy, demonstrating abnormal proliferation and accumulation of CD68+ and CD1a− histiocytes. 1 In this case, biopsy was unattainable, and the diagnosis was made on circumstantial evidence. The differential diagnosis is wide and includes LCH, Paget’s disease and POEMS syndrome, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG). A bone biopsy is needed to differentiate histologically and immunophenotypically between the histiocytosis. 8\n\n【40】### Clinical manifestations\n\n【41】Osseous involvement is present in 95% of patients at the time of diagnosis. 9 Retroperitoneal disease manifests as renal impairment, secondary to renal artery stenosis or ureteric obstruction. 8 Up to 50% of patients have cardiorespiratory involvement. 9 Periaortic fibrosis and arterial infiltration results in high risk of mortality, due to myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy and valvular disease. 10 CNS involvement is common, varying from periorbital changes, central diabetes insipidus, cerebellar syndromes and symptoms secondary to mass lesions. 11\n\n【42】As in our patient, ECD may mimic vasculitis with the thoracic and abdominal aorta commonly affected (48%). 12 Periarterial thickening affecting the left subclavian artery is seen in 11% of patients, as in our patient. 12 Very few cases of ECD with vascular involvement have been reported and included a 70-year-old woman with ECD mimicking vasculitis. 13 The patient was treated for presumed large vessel vasculitis with immunotherapy, based on imaging findings, but rapidly developed spinal column and mesenteric ischaemia and died of multiple organ failure due to septic shock. 13 Histology of the large vessels and subdural area revealed ‘inflammatory changes with accumulation of foamy macrophages with CD68 +histiocytes’, specific for ECD, and the BRAF V600E mutation was present. 13\n\n【43】The Mayo Clinic multidisciplinary Histiocytosis Working Group have developed an algorithm for initial diagnosis, including three major and four minor features, which should prompt diagnosis of histiocytic neoplasms. 3 Of these features, the patient described had four of these, including DI, long bone involvement with lytic lesions, medium vessel involvement and retroperitoneal tissue involvement. For diagnosis, they recommend a full body FDG PET-CT, biopsy of FDG-avid tissue, BRAF V600 E mutation testing and staging studies. 3 Ultimately, the presence of central DI with bony pain should prompt urgent consideration of ECD and LCH. 3\n\n【44】For active disease, interferon-α is the mainstay of treatment, with 70% survival rates at 5 years. 9 For those with a BRAF mutation, the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib has been shown to be effective in the VE-Basket study, achieving 55% overall response and further research is ongoing. 14 There is a role for additional biological agents. 15 Anakinra has shown the best clinical response rate (50%), while tumour necrosis factor-α inhibition (infliximab or etanercept) has not proved to be effective. 15\n\n【45】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【46】At the beginning, symptoms started benignly and were easy to shrug off as something else. I remember early xanthelasma appearing (‘high cholesterol’) and excessive thirst first (‘dehydration’). Subsequently, my skin also started to redden in places. It very slowly worsened and holes had appeared in the skin on my head, middle back and my ear canals were weeping and gooey. This was attributed to ‘work stress’, ‘exposure to the sun’ and ‘diet’. There was a dermatological breakthrough with a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. ‘Mission accomplished’, my skin started clearing up with medication and my diabetes insipidus was under control. However, new adverse symptoms accumulated afterwards, causing multiple problems. These required running repairs and treatments with the help of brilliant medical support and my extraordinary wife that never gave up striving for an answer. Diagnosis, while welcome, always leaves me flat in comparison with the efforts, care and expertise of others to keep me on the road during the difficult time. I would sum the experience as: bafflement, blind alleys, uncertainty, complexity, resolve, perseverance, near misses, luck, inspiration, hope and recovery.\n\n【47】### Learning points\n\n【48】   Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD) is an extremely rare condition and a form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, characterised by an accumulation and infiltration of histiocytes in tissue.\n\n【49】   ECD with vascular involvement may mimic large vessel vasculitis.\n\n【50】   CT/MRI/PET scans, although helpful, cannot definitively differentiate ECD and large vessel vasculitis. ECD can be distinguished from large vessel vasculitis by: the presence of bony pain, classical bone radiograph findings and the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation.\n\n【51】   Definitive diagnosis of ECD is through dedicated plain radiographs of the long bones and biopsy of affected tissue, showing abnormal proliferation and accumulation of CD68+ and CD1a− histiocytes.\n\n【52】   The Mayo Clinic Histiocytosis Working Group algorithm provides a framework for the diagnosis of histiocytic neoplasms.\n\n【53】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【54】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【55】Consent obtained directly from the patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Admission vitals documented a blood pressure of 147/45 mm Hg with a pulse pressure (PP) of 102 mm Hg; otherwise, his initial admission note did not document any abnormal cardiovascular physical examination findings. On morning rounds, the general medicine team observed exaggerated visible distension and collapse of the bilateral carotid arteries ( online supplemental video 1 ). The finding, known as Corrigan’s pulse, indicates chronic aortic valvular regurgitation (AR). 1 The wide PP and Corrigan’s pulse prompted the examiner to reposition the patient to an upright sitting and forward leaning position in order to move the heart closer to the chest wall and increase the audibility of a potential AR murmur. 2 A blowing III/VI, decrescendo diastolic murmur was present along the left upper sternal border, the typical murmur of chronic AR. 1 A laterally displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI) was present, but other peripheral findings of AR or signs of congestive heart failure were absent.\n\n【7】### Supplementary video\n\n【8】\\[bcr-2023-255094supp001.mp4\\]\n\n【9】Corrigan’s pulse was first defined by Dr D J Corrigan in April 1832 in The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal article, ‘On Permanent Patency of the Mouth of the Aorta, or Inadequacy of the Aortic Valves’. He described ‘visible pulsation of the arteries of the head and superior extremities…\\[which\\] are suddenly thrown from their bed, bounding up under the skin’. 3 Dr Corrigan observed that this finding results from the large stroke volume followed by the exaggerated collapse of the large vessels on the diastolic return of blood to the left ventricle and, thus, loss of diastolic distention of the large vessels when AR is present . 3 4\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【13】Still images from online supplemental video 1 showing rapid systolic upstroke (A) and subsequent diastolic collapse (B) of the carotid artery in our patient with chronic AR.

What is seen at the bedside in a patient with Corrigan’s pulse is the marked contrast between the high stroke volume and quick carotid upstroke followed by a rapid decline in arterial pressure during diastole, indicated by the wide PP. AR, aortic valvular regurgitation; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; PP, pulse pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\n\n【18】Observing Corrigan’s pulse prompted the examiner to appropriately position the patient to best auscultate the murmur of AR. The classic diastolic murmur increases the probability of AR (likelihood ratio (LR) = 9.9), providing a pretest probability of 41% for moderate to severe AR. 1 The positive LR of moderate to severe AR with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≤50 mm Hg and PP of 80 mm Hg is 19.3 and 10.9, respectively. Therefore, the post-test probability of moderate to severe AR with a DBP of 45 mm Hg was greater than 90% prior to a transthoracic echocardiogram. The location of the murmur, peripheral pulse findings and wide PP were atypical of other valvular heart diseases causing diastolic murmurs such as mitral stenosis or pulmonic regurgitation.\n\n【19】The medical team presented diagnostic and management options to the patient and family. The patient’s family members declined further evaluation, including transthoracic echocardiography, and instead opted for clinical surveillance, citing his advanced dementia and physical disability due to osteoarthritis rather than cardiopulmonary symptoms.\n\n【20】Corrigan’s pulse and other peripheral pulse findings, while unreliable predictors of AR severity, should prompt a more detailed cardiovascular evaluation and can reveal clinical exam findings highly predictable of AR. 1 5 Frequently, AR can be diagnosed with appropriate bedside manoeuvres, direct observation and Bayesian reasoning based on these exam findings rather than pursuing further diagnostic testing.\n\n【21】### Learning points\n\n【22】   Corrigan’s pulse is a distinctive clinical exam finding for chronic aortic valvular regurgitation (AR).\n\n【23】   Corrigan’s pulse results from rapid distension of the large vessels followed by exaggerated diastolic collapse due to loss of diastolic distention of the large vessels as blood regurgitates from the aorta into the left ventricle.\n\n【24】   When the typical diastolic murmur is present, a diastolic blood pressure of ≤50 mm Hg and a pulse pressure of ≥80 mm Hg increase the probability of moderate to severe AR.\n\n【25】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【26】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【27】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

It has been emphasised that a persistent asymptomatic oral erythroplasic patch when present in high-risk sites such as the ventral surface of the tongue or the floor of the mouth may be the earliest and primary sign of oral cancer. 2 The middle-aged and the elderly are usually affected, with a slight male gender predilection. The prevalence is only about 0.02%–0.2%. The aetiopathogenesis is unclear, yet a strong association with usage of tobacco and alcohol has been cited in the literature. 1 In about 85% of cases, histological signs of squamous cell carcinoma are seen on histological evaluation. 2 Erythroplakia is generally a diagnosis of exclusion and needs to be differentiated from other red oral lesions , such as erosive oral lichen planus, erythematous candidiasis, oral mucositis, pemphigus vulgaris, mucous membrane pemphigoid and systemic lupus erythematosus, with biopsy performed in addition to a thorough history-taking session and meticulous clinical examination. 3\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Flow diagram showing the differential diagnosis of oral erythroplakia.\n\n【9】A 51-year-old male patient reported with burning sensation in the tongue for 2 months.

Peripheral nerve blocks stand out as an efficient strategy within the context of multimodal analgesia. The hypothesis is that continuous pericapsular nerve group block, when combined with lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block, can provide excellent analgesic coverage for hip surgeries. Continuous infusion systems can prolong analgesia, minimising opioid consumption, adverse effects and providing faster recovery. We describe a case of efficient analgesia, in which a catheter was positioned between the iliopsoas muscle plane and the iliopubic eminence for total hip arthroplasty.\n\n【2】   pain\n   rehabilitation medicine\n   osteoarthritis\n   hip prosthesis implantation\n   anaesthesia\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

However, patients can present intense pain in the immediate postoperative period, resulting in immobility, increased risk of complications and greater opioid consumption, generating adverse effects and prolonged hospitalisation. 1\n\n【10】The difficult management of pain is explained by the complex innervation of the hip joint, in which the articular branches of the femoral, obturator and accessory obturator nerves are responsible for the sensory innervation of the anterior capsule. 2\n\n【11】Additional anaesthetic techniques, such as peripheral nerve blocks, are part of a multimodal analgesic strategy and are often used to allow better management of acute pain. The inadequate treatment can lead to persistent painful status. 3\n\n【12】Despite of innumerous nerve blocks for this purpose, some may fail because they do not cover the entire innervation of the anterior hip capsule. 2 Our hypothesis is that the pericapsular nerve group block (PENG block), described in 2018, 4 by allowing the deposition of local anaesthetic between the psoas muscle tendon plane and the iliopubic eminence, associated with the lateral cutaneous nerve block thigh, would enable efficient analgesia, without causing motor block. 2\n\n【13】In addition, the application of continuous infusion systems could provide prolonged postoperative analgesia, with little interference in the routine of the service, due to the use of elastomeric pumps with local anaesthetic coupled to the perineural catheter, through single injection. 3\n\n【14】In this paper, we report the case of a patient who underwent total hip arthroplasty, with a history of thrombophilia, in which the PENG block was performed, with a continuous technique, and a single shot block of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh.\n\n【15】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【16】A man, with thrombophilia (Factor V Leiden mutation) and recurrent episodes of deep vein thrombosis, on Rivaroxaban 20 mg/day (suspended 2 days before) was admitted to the operating room for right hip arthroplasty due to coxarthrosis and aseptic necrosis of the head of the femur, resulting in an important functional limitation of the hip. The preoperative pain score was 8/10 on the verbal numerical scale (VNS).\n\nAfter standard multiparametric monitoring and installation of venoclysis with J18G in the left upper limb, simple spinal anaesthesia was performed with a 25G Quincke needle, L2–L3, via median, with 15 mg of isobaric bupivacaine, sensitive level at T10. He was sedated with propofol in an infusion pump (Terumo), controlled target in plasma ( Fast Marsh model ), of 1.5 µg mL <sup>−1 </sup> . At the end of surgery, the PENG block was performed with an 18G Tuohy needle, guided by ultrasound, under aseptic technique. Proper positioning of the catheter was checked using the ultrasound (USG) colour Doppler feature . Bolus with 15 mL ropivacaine 0375%+10 mg dexamethasone was performed and coupled to the elastomeric infusion system (EasyPump II LT B|Braun), filled with ropivacaine 0,2% at 2 mL/hour . Then, the region around the left lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was infiltrated with 6 mL ropivacaine 0.375%, guided by ultrasound, to contemplate the incised region. The postoperative pain score was 3/10 on the VNS .\n\n【18】<img/>\n\n【19】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【21】(A) Needling through the technique in plane with Tuohy 18G needle and linear USG probe.

There was no opioid consumption.\n\n【31】The patient was followed by the anaesthesiology service until the time of hospital discharge (2 days), and the perineural catheter was then removed with no signs of infection. Lower limb muscle strength remained preserved throughout the hospital stay.\n\n【32】The analgesic strategy used allowed an efficient control of pain, besides having ensured that the patient sat out of bed the next morning, underwent physiotherapy and walked 48 hours after surgery.\n\n【33】The patient continues in rehabilitation, with good clinical evolution, without pain complaints in the operated limb and functional improvement, progressing in motor physiotherapy.\n\n【34】Discussion\n----------\n\n【35】In this study, we demonstrate a case in which continuous PENG block (using a perineural catheter and elastomeric infusion system) was performed, associated with the lateral cutaneous nerve block of the thigh, in total hip arthroplasty surgery, in a patient with thrombophilia.\n\n【36】In this context, the nerve supply of the hip joint has been described in detail in various studies. The hip capsule is divided into two parts: anterior and posterior, with nociceptive fibres mostly present on the anterior part while the posterior part has mechanoreceptors. An anatomic study by Gerhardt et al. 5 demonstrated that proximal branches of both the femoral and obturator nerves provide innervations to the anterior hip capsule. The accessory obturator nerve was found to innervate the medial capsule, which has sensory fbers. 6 In a cadaveric study of the PENG block, injected dye stained the entire anterior hip capsule area innervated by the articular branches of femoral, obturator, and accessory obturator nerves area. 6\n\n【37】Since total hip arthroplasties are a highly complex procedure, it can present an enormous challenge in adequate pain management. 7 8 Pain is a risk factor for increased postoperative complications, such as immobility (risk for deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolic complications) and risk of delirium, especially in the elderly. 9 10\n\n【38】Due to this technique, it was achieved pain control for a longer time, without motor impairment, ensuring early walking and recovery. In addition, patient was considerably content with minimal interference in the service’s routine.\n\n【39】Thus, peripheral nerve blocks are part of an arsenal of multimodal analgesic strategies in the perioperative context of orthopaedic surgery. 11\n\n【40】Dulaney-Cripe demonstrated that the fascia iliac compartment block continuous infusion was effective in controlling pain and reducing opioid consumption in elderly patients undergoing corrective surgery for hip fracture. 12 However, some studies discuss the fact that there are possible failures of one of the nerve branches in this approach, requiring larger volumes of local anaesthetic for better efficacy. 13 This point must be taken into account, as motor blockade in the quadriceps muscles (femoral nerve territory) is possible, resulting in a delay in postoperative walking.\n\n【41】O’Reilly et al showed that, despite chemical and physical thromboprophylaxis, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis was still high (around 8.9% in hip surgeries). Therefore, early ambulation is a very important factor for these patients. 14\n\n【42】The continuous PENG block technique, associated with the lateral cutaneous nerve block of the thigh, appears as an efficient and safe perioperative analgesic approach, allowing an upstanding coverage of the hip joint territory, acting specifically on sensitive branches, which enables walking and recovery precocious. 15\n\n【43】Nevertheless, some precautions must be taken with the continuous technique: the procedure must be performed using aseptic technique, associated with ultrasonography; confirmation of the proper positioning of the catheter must be done through the colour doppler ultrasound feature; perform catheter aspiration, aiming at detecting eventual migrations of the catheter tip; the catheter should preferably be tunnelled and fixed to the patient’s skin. 16\n\n【44】As the infusion system is automatic and does not require periodic handling, it can be a point to be discussed as a strategy to reduce the risk of catheter-related contamination. However, all the care inherent in handling these longer-lasting devices must be taken. It is noteworthy that although the literature is still limited, there are few reports of complications resulting from the performance of PENG block, such as injury to nerve structures, intravascular injection and toxicity by local anaesthetics.\n\n【45】More studies should be carried out on the technique in question, in order to provide a better dimension of its real risks and benefits. However, we encourage the use of the technique, mainly because it is easy to perform and has a fast learning curve.\n\n【46】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【47】A month after hospital discharge, I attended the return appointment, extremely grateful and satisfied with the pain control and the evolution of the case. At the present moment, I am in physical rehabilitation, progressing in motor physiotherapy and awaiting surgery on the opposite hip.\n\n【48】### Learning points\n\n【49】   Major orthopaedic surgeries can cause difficult-to-treat pain, delaying hospital discharge.\n\n【50】   Peripheral nerve blocks are highlighted as an efficient analgesia strategy within the multimodal therapeutic arsenal.\n\n【51】   The hypothesis is that continuous pericapsular nerve group block, when combined with the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, can provide excellent analgesic coverage for total hip arthroplasty surgeries.\n\n【52】   The result of this case report demonstrates that the use of a continuous infusion system, through an elastomeric pump and perineural catheter, is an effective and safe method for analgesia, after total hip arthroplasty, enabling early ambulation and recovery, in addition to lower consumption of opioids.\n\n【53】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【54】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【55】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【56】### Ethics approval\n\n【57】This research was approved by institutional human ethics committee number 51917421.8.3001.5259 (dated 21 October 2021).\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We are grateful for the efforts of the entire team in carrying out this attempt, in the search for better clinical results for our patients.

This pain was treated with conventional analgesic therapy.\n\n【5】Five years ago, the patient reported a severe low back pain (LBP) with bilateral radiculopathy in the lower limbs without ‘red flags’. The medical history included diabetes, controlled hypertension and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. At that moment the patient was not taking any anticoagulation therapy. CT revealed moderate spinal stenosis in L3-L4 and root compression due to herniated disc protrusion in L4-L5.\n\n【6】Despite 6 months of several systemic multimodal analgesic therapies (increasing doses and rotation of strong opioids/adjuvants by the WHO ladder), the LBP prevented the patient from physiotherapy having a strong impact on daily living activities (DLA), mood and willingness to live.\n\n【7】The pain intensity (9-10 on the visual analogue scale) with bilateral radiculopathy (L4-L5 dermatomes distribution, Lasègue sign positive and without neurological deficits) had the characteristics of an intractable pain through conventional treatment. An invasive analgesic technique was then considered with patient’s consent. The patient was informed of the protocol safety when the criteria are followed strictly, and of the general and rare specific risks, namely dura-mater accidental puncture, subdural haematoma, urinary retention and local/systemic infection.\n\n【8】A protocol of continuous epidural technique with a tunnelled catheter ( Box 1 ) was then initiated. A diagnostic and therapeutic technique was used with a single-shot lumbar epidural for immediate and prolonged relief of severe bilateral pain and functional disability (6.25 mg of levobupivacaine, 14 mg of betamethasone dipropionate and 1.5 mg of morphine). After 2 weeks without pain, there was an LBP recurrence requiring the protocol’s second stage to be followed ( box 1 ).\n\n【9】Box 1\n\n【10】### Protocol of lumbar continuous epidural technique with tunnelled catheter\n\n【11】#### Patient inclusion criteria\n\n【12】   Informed consent signed by the patient\n\n【13】   Collaborative and oriented patient, able to acknowledge the procedure\n\n【14】   Family support or caregivers able to understand the procedure\n\n【15】   Transport availability for the patient with accompanying person\n\n【16】   Absense of anticoagulation therapy and recent haemostasis evaluation\n\n【17】   Absence of epidural technique contraindications\n\n【18】   Pain unit with an available team to follow-up and execute sterile dressings\n\n【19】   Available emergency service 24/7\n\n【20】#### First stage of the protocol\n\n【21】   Diagnostic and therapeutic single-shot epidural bolus via interlaminar, foraminal or sacral approach performed at the moment of acute low back pain with unilateral or bilateral radiculopathy\n\n【22】   Assessment of pain relief\n\n【23】   10 mL bolus solution test administered with:\n\n【24】       6.25 mg of levobupivacaine 0.625% (2.5 mL levobupi 0.25%), 14 mg of betamethasone dipropionate (or other non-particulate corticosteroid), 6.5 mL of saline solution (SS)\n\n【25】       1-2 mg of morphine only in non-opioid-naive patients under previous systemic opioid medication\n\n【26】#### Second stage of the protocol\n\n【27】   Performed in case of severe pain recurrence as long as the effectiveness of the single-shot epidural is confirmed\n\n【28】   Undertake complementary analytical and imaging tests to further exclude contraindications to the technique\n\n【29】   Continuous interlaminar or foraminal epidural technique is performed with or without imaging control at the lumbar intervertebral level\n\n【30】   Subcutaneous double-needle tunnelling  of the epidural catheter is performed in order to increase safety:\n\n【31】       Promote safer tunnelling and better fixation of the catheter by reducing the possibility of its inadvertent externalisation\n\n【32】       Reduce the risk and likelihood of infection by moving the catheter exit place away from the initial puncture\n\n【33】       Reduce risk of contamination with extended periodical waterproof sterile dressings, always by the pain unit team, avoiding unnecessary exposure and manipulation by less-skilled professionals\n\n【34】   An elastomeric infusion pump (EIP) with duration of 1, 2 or 5 days connected to the tunnelled epidural catheter is filled with:\n\n【35】       Levobupivacaine doses between 10 and 16 mg/day (final concentration of levobupi 0.08%–0.125%) or ropivacaine 10–13 mg/day (0.08%–0.1%)\n\n【36】       Morphine (2–5 mg/day) (optional in non-opioid-naive patients, if no contraindications)\n\n【37】       Example: A 65 mL capacity EIP for 5 days and perfusion of 0.5 mL/hour, filled with 13 mL of levobupi 0.5% (65 mg) + 52 mL SS or 8.7 mL of ropivacaine 0.75% (65 mg) + 56.3 mL SS\n\n【38】       Important: Before adapting the EIP, it has to be administered a 10 mL bolus of the same solution of the EIP via the epidural catheter (10 mL of levobupi 0.1% or ropivacaine 0.1%).

The original thalamic pain has been controlled with mild analgesic therapy.\n\n【61】This clinical case demonstrates that a technique widely used in other contexts can be adjusted for outpatient treatment of non-cancer pain, as long as the safety criteria are strictly respected. Studies confirm that continuous epidurals with opioids, anaesthetics and corticosteroids for LBP result in the control of disabling pain crises, reducing doses of systemic opioids with significant improvement of quality of life. 1 2\n\n【62】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【63】About 5 years ago, I had very intense low back pain, hindering my movements and dramatically affecting my daily life. Since various conventional treatment for more than 6 months failed to alleviate my pain, an epidural procedure was suggested, which I accepted having full trust on the pain unit team. During two and half months, I had a catheter ‘in my spine’ with a pump with medication that completely relieved my pain. This treatment also allowed me to recover my movements and I never felt again that very strong pain. For the last 4 years, I have had a normal life. Myself and my family are very grateful for the recommended treatment.\n\n【64】### Learning points\n\n【65】   Continuous outpatient epidural analgesia is a safe and effective procedure to alleviate disabling low back pain with uni/bilateral radiculopathy, if the protocol is strictly followed in carefully selected patients.\n\n【66】   Despite being a widely used technique by specialists in chronic pain and obstetric anaesthesia, it is important to revisit it for low back pain since it is accessible and able to alleviate suffering due to refractory or intractable pain. However, the originality of the article is based on the specific context in which the protocoled technique is performed.\n\n【67】   Despite the legitimate concern of healthcare professionals regarding the performance of invasive techniques in an outpatient setting, one should underline the capacity of this treatment to exponentially reduce the doses of systemic opioids and adjuvant analgesics, minimising side effects and risk of addiction while improving the patient’s quality of life.\n\n【68】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【69】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【70】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Given the chronicity of the complaints, a CT scan  was conducted and revealed the herniation of the caudate lobe of the liver protruding through the right diaphragmatic crura, probably through the inferior vena cava foramen, into the thoracic cavity.

This condition has almost always been misdiagnosed on chest roentgenograms as hydatid cyst, pulmonary sequestration or pulmonary tumour, which were then followed by unnecessary surgical interventions. 3 Treatment of a liver herniation associated with trauma or acute spontaneous diaphragmatic rupture will usually require urgent surgery. Uncomplicated cases, however, depending on the extent of the herniation may be followed conservatively or may eventually be scheduled for elective surgery. The cause of distorted liver function tests in our patient was probably due to the impaired drainage of the caudate lobe. On 3-month follow-up, the patient had similar liver function tests (ALT: 40 U/L (normal range: 10–35 U/L); AST: 38 U/L (normal range: 8–36 U/L)).

It accounts for only 1.6% of all head and neck malignancies and 0.2%–8% of all MMs. 1 The significance lies in early detection of the lesion because MM has a poor prognosis, and oral MMs are worse in this regard compared with those on the skin. About a third of all oral MMs are seen on the palate with a definite male gender predilection. They can arise from naevus or pigmented macules or de novo like in this case. Clinical appearance is generally an irregular asymmetric patch >6 mm in size with colour variation and a raised rough surface with a history of constant growth. Oral MM has been classified pigmented or non-pigmented and nodular, macular or mixed depending on the clinical appearance. Regional lymphnode metastasis and distant metastasis to the bone, lungs and liver have also been reported in advanced cases. 2 Physiologic pigmentation, melanotic macule, smoker’s melanosis, drug-induced melanosis, melanocytic naevus and pigmentation due to systemic causes like Addison’s disease, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, etc may be considered in the differential diagnosis. 3 Histologically atypical melanocytes, with hyperchromatism and nuclear pleomorphism in the junction of the epithelium and connective tissue together with immunohistochemical markers positive for S-100, HMB-45 are considered confirmatory for the diagnosis of MM. 1 2 Radical excision with disease-free margins is the mainstay of treatment in MM with recurrence in about 20% of cases.\n\n【5】A 60-year-old manreported with black spots in the right side of the palate. History revealed that the patch appeared on the palate a month back which steadily increased in size but was asymptomatic. On physical examination, an irregular black patch was seen in the left side of the posterior maxillary alveolus in relation to 1517 region  involving the alveolar mucosa buccally  and the hard palate . The lesion was 3 cm×1.5 cm in size, black in colour interspersed with shades of grey. The borders were irregular but well-defined, surface smooth and it was rough to touch, unscrapable, non-tender on palpation. A provisional diagnosis of MM was made and the patient was subjected to haematologic, radiologic and histopathologic investigations.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【9】Irregular brownish-black patch present on the left side of the (A) maxillary alveolus extending both (B) buccally (C) and palatally in relation to molar teeth.\n\n【10】Panoramic radiograph revealed haziness in the right maxillary antrum with the obliteration of the outline of the antral floor .

(A) Original magnification 10×; (B) 40× and (C) atypical junctional melanocytes, spindle and round cells in the connective tissue were strongly positive for S-100.\n\n【20】Primary oral MM is extremely rare accounting for about 0.2%–8% of all MMs. It is seen in the elders aged >60 years, clearly exhibiting a male gender predilection. 4 MM usually arises from the epidermal melanocytes de novo and the hard palate and the maxillary gingiva are the most common intraoral sites as observed in this case as well. MM poses a diagnostic challenge as there are no pathognomonic clinical features. Hence, an asymptomatic blackish-brown pigmented patch needs to be excised due to its tendency of rapid metastasis.\n\n【21】Surgical resection is the most preferred treatment modality for oral MM. Though once considered resistant to radiotherapy, adjuvant therapy involves the use of radiation for local control. 5 Chemotherapy and immunotherapy are other adjuvant therapies which are being used recently with favourable results. 6 The prognosis is extremely poor with a 5-year survival rate <30% which is attributed to diagnostic delays and distant metastasis. In this case also, the patient delayed undergoing surgery and passed away within 3 months of diagnosis.\n\n【22】MM of the oral cavity is not only rare but also lethal. An oral physician is the most likely person to observe and diagnose this rapidly progressive lesion early and save lives. Therefore, it is imperative to increase awareness among dentists, regarding considering MM in the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic irregular melanotic lesions.\n\n【23】### Learning points\n\n【24】   Malignant melanoma is an exceedingly rare oral malignancy which is extremely aggressive and a rapidly spreading tumour.\n\n【25】   The clinical presentation may be misleading due to the asymptomatic nature of the lesion and needs to be investigated thoroughly.\n\n【26】   Early diagnosis and prompt treatment could be lifesaving as the prognosis is very poor.\n\n【27】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【28】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【29】Consent obtained from next of kin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The APW in often of the distal type (either type 2 or 3), which results in the pulmonary branches being widely separated and the IAA is often distal to the emergence of the left subclavian artery (type A). 1\n\n【25】Newborns with Berry syndrome are usually critically ill. The aortic origin of the RPA results in early pulmonary overcirculation due to an obligatory left-to-right shunt. Simultaneously, the perfusion of the lower body organs is entirely dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus due to an IAA. 2 Early clinical management is pivotal and includes diuretics and positive pressure ventilation to address the pulmonary congestion, as well as, when necessary, maintaining the arterial ductus patent with prostaglandin E1 infusion.\n\n【26】Despite optimal medical stabilisation, most require urgent surgery. Staged repair, consisting of pulmonary banding followed by a later surgical correction, can be considered, particularly in premature or small-for-gestational-age infants. 3 However, the treatment of choice is single stage repair. Various surgical techniques are available, namely, APW closure and RPA connection with the main pulmonary artery can be done by either direct anastomosis or by several flap techniques. 4–7 Management of the IAA depends on its location and distance of both aortic ends. It can be carried out using various techniques such as end-to-end anastomosis or an extensive mobilisation and reconstruction of the aorta, requiring patch augmentation or conduit interposition. 8\n\n【27】Berry syndrome, despite being rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of critically ill neonates presenting with severe coarctation presentation phenotype and signs of asymmetric pulmonary congestion.\n\n【28】### Learning points\n\n【29】   Berry syndrome is a potential cause of heart failure in neonates.\n\n【30】   Asymmetrical pulmonary congestion and the ‘butterfly sign’ should raise clinical suspicion about this entity.\n\n【31】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【32】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【33】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

However, ICI therapies, such as pembrolizumab, are associated with significant immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) affecting all organ systems. Cutaneous manifestations are common with clinical presentations including maculopapular rash, psoriasiform rash, bullous dermatitis, lichenoid eruption, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). ICI lichenoid eruptions present later than maculopapular and psoriasiform rashes, most commonly 6–12 weeks after initiation of immunotherapy. 1 Lichenoid eruptions have been reported in 0.5%–6% of patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies. 2 Systemic glucocorticoids are the mainstay of therapy for most high-grade IRAEs. High-potency topical steroids can be considered for grade 1 ICI bullous dermatitis—when the disease involves <10% body surface area (BSA)—but for grades 2–4, systemic corticosteroids are recommended. 3–5 However, the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines do not address management recommendations for ICI lichenoid eruptions.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A woman in her 80s presented to the emergency department for a diffuse, progressive rash with pruritus. She had active metastatic bladder cancer and developed a rash 92 days after the initiation of immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. Two weeks before admission, the patient’s skin lesions evolved from scattered pruritic macules to diffuse plaques covering all extremities, despite conservative management with topical triamcinolone, oral antihistamines and holding pembrolizumab. She denied constitutional symptoms, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspnoea or chest pain.\n\n【12】On admission, she was afebrile and normotensive with a pulse rate of 74 beats per minute and SpO2 of 95% on room air. A physical examination of the patient revealed cachexia, mild oropharyngeal mucositis, angular cheilitis and a right subclavian port without surrounding erythema or purulence. A focused dermatological examination was significant for diffuse violaceous plaques and erosions with adherent haemorrhagic crusting on her face, bilateral upper and lower extremities, and dorsal surfaces of her hands . Multiple lesions on the upper and lower extremities exhibited purulence. The left lower extremity also had erosions with a negative Nikolsky sign. There were no targetoid or dusky lesions, facial swelling, conjunctivitis or lymphadenopathy. The patient’s laboratory findings were notable for a normal leucocyte count with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein at 39 mm/hour (normal range: 0–29 mm/hour) and 95.9 mg/L (0–8.0 mg/L), respectively. Due to our concern for secondary impetiginisation of the lesions, the patient was started empirically on empiric antibiotic therapy.\n\n【13】<img/>\n\n【14】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【16】Violaceous plaques and erosions involving the right hand (top) and right upper extremity (bottom) at the time of admission.\n\n【17】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【18】We obtained multiple skin biopsies for pathological examination, including perilesional direct immunofluorescence (DIF) and tissue culture. The fluid cultures grew Proteus mirabilis and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The skin biopsies demonstrated lichenoid dermatitis with eosinophils and focal subepidermal clefting .

High magnification of H&E specimen showing lichenoid dermatitis with eosinophils (bottom).\n\n【23】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【24】Our differential diagnoses for this patient’s rash prior to biopsy results included neutrophilic dermatoses, immunobullous disorders and drug eruption. The clinical presentation was inconsistent with life-threatening drug-related dermatoses, such as SJS or drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms based on the absence of significant truncal involvement, painful or dusky skin lesions, Nikolsky sign, odynophagia, facial swelling, atypical lymphadenopathy, fevers or eosinophilia. Destruction of the basal layer of the epidermis is characteristic of lichenoid interface dermatitis and may result in focal subepidermal clefting. Although subepidermal clefting with eosinophils is characteristic of certain immunobullous disorders, such as bullous pemphigoid, the presence of lichenoid interface dermatitis seen in this case is most consistent with lichenoid drug eruption as DIF was negative for any specific dermatosis, which supports the diagnosis of drug eruption over immunobullous disorder. 3\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】The patient was started empirically on intravenous vancomycin and cefepime due to our concern for purulent cellulitis and bacterial superinfection of progressive cutaneous eruptions in an immunocompromised host. Following pathology results demonstrating a lichenoid eruption attributed to immunotherapy, the patient was started on prednisone 1 mg/kg daily with a plan for the continuation of systemic steroids for 4–6 weeks pending clinical improvement to ≤grade 1 symptoms. The patient completed a 7-day course of oral antibiotics for superimposed cellulitis.\n\n【27】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【28】At a follow-up visit with dermatology 1 week after discharge, the patient had clinical improvement of all lesions. Based on recommendations from dermatology and oncology, pembrolizumab was permanently discontinued. One month after hospital discharge, the patient experienced complete resolution of her cutaneous lesions. Due to the progression of metastatic disease and extensive side effects of previously attempted therapies, the patient elected to pursue palliative therapies without further oncological treatment.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】Lichenoid dermatitis with eosinophils may be seen in a variety of clinical syndromes, including lichenoid drug eruptions. Although subepidermal clefting with eosinophils is characteristic of certain immunobullous disorders (eg, bullous pemphigoid), interface dermatitis, intraepidermal acantholysis and keratinocyte necrosis are most specific for paraneoplastic pemphigus. 1 The patient was diagnosed with a lichenoid eruption due to ICI toxicity from pembrolizumab and superimposed soft tissue infection.\n\n【31】Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for IRAEs and do not reduce the anti-tumour effects of checkpoint inhibitors. 3–5 Although the current NCCN guidelines do not explicitly address lichenoid eruptions related to ICI therapy, they recommend treating grades 3–4 bullous dermatitis and other severe IRAEs with prednisone or methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg daily until clinical improvement to ≤grade 1 symptoms. 5 Additionally, infliximab, rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin are supportive therapies that can be used for clinically refractory disease, but they are not used as first-line therapies.\n\n【32】No studies have shown a consistent correlation between checkpoint inhibitor side effects and anti-tumour effects. The NCCN recommends resuming prior immunotherapy agents in patients with grades 1–2 ICI bullous dermatitis once lesions are mild/localised, requiring only topical steroids (grade 2 disease involves 10%–30% BSA with painful blisters). Further immunotherapy is contraindicated in all grade 4 dermatological toxicity cases, including SJS and TEN. 5 This patient exhibited grade 3 symptoms (>30% BSA involvement without electrolyte/fluid abnormalities); therefore, resuming pembrolizumab at any dose or transitioning to a different immunotherapy agent would not be recommended due to the concern for life-threatening complications. Accordingly, pembrolizumab was permanently discontinued in this patient.\n\n【33】### Learning points\n\n【34】   Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) lichenoid eruptions present later than maculopapular and psoriasiform rashes, most commonly 6–12 weeks after initiation of immunotherapy.\n\n【35】   Immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) include a broad spectrum of cutaneous reactions (eg, maculopapular, psoriasiform, eczematous and lichenoid eruption subtypes). Lichenoid eruptions have been reported in 0.5%–6% of patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies.\n\n【36】   Steroids are the mainstay of treatment for IRAEs. Individuals with grade 1 ICI bullous dermatitis can receive high-potency topical steroids, whereas individuals with grades 2–4 IRAEs should be treated with systemic steroids.\n\n【37】   Severe ICI toxicity (grades 3–4) is a contraindication to further immunotherapy; however, little prospective research exists on this subject. Additional trials should be performed to evaluate the risks and benefits of ongoing immunotherapy following severe ICI toxicity, especially in the absence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis.\n\n【38】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【39】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【40】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

In this case, it was the contralateral side, thus representing multiple anatomical sites of arterial aneurysmal changes associated with systemic hypertension.\n\n【14】The bacillary layer describes the complex comprised of photoreceptor inner segments, which consist of a vitread myoid zone (MZ) and sclerad EZ, and the photoreceptor outer segments. 6 Ramtohul et al described BALAD’s OCT hallmarks including an anterior border comprising a split hyper-reflective MZ (with external limiting membrane (ELM) anteriorly) and a posterior border of variable reflectivity contiguous with EZ adherent to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). 6 Typically BALAD is also associated with subretinal fluid (SRF, 77%) ± intraretinal fluid (6%) though BALAD contents are more hyper-reflective than SRF. Classically BALAD is associated with primarily choroidal pathology (eg, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease) where increased vascular hydrostatic forces overcome the weak apposition of MZ and EZ. 7 Haemorrhagic BALADs have been described secondary to choroidal neovascularisation associated with both age-related macular degeneration and macular telangiectasia type 2. 8 9\n\n【15】Few cases of RAM with haemorrhagic BALAD have been described which resolved with observation, intravitreal tissue plasminogen activator or vitrectomy. 10 Here, we describe the first report of RAM-associated BALAD resolving with focal laser. The mechanism of RAM-associated BALAD is acute violent extravasation of blood/fluid which is forced between the most weakly opposed layers, leaving the anterior portion of MZ adherent to ELM anteriorly and the EZ secured to RPE posteriorly. This may go underdiagnosed as the multilayered retinal haemorrhages associated with RAM may mask this transient phenomenon. However, recovery of functional VA (mean 20/40) is typically achieved within approximately 2 weeks. 6\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】   Bacillary layer detachment may arise from choroidal and retinal vascular pathology with sufficient hydrostatic force to overcome the weak apposition of ellipsoid zone and myoid zone.\n\n【18】   Though visual acuity may improve to 20/40 level within 2 weeks, further resolution with restoration of near normal anatomical structure may take several months.\n\n【19】   Systemic hypertension is a risk factor for both intraocular and intracerebral arterial aneurysms and control of this risk factor may prevent blinding or life-threatening complications.\n\n【20】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【21】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【22】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The patient was a man in his 30s with no comorbidities other than atopic dermatitis. Over the course of 2 weeks after the first COVID-19 vaccination, systemic oedema gradually appeared. He was referred to the nephrology department for investigation of the systemic oedema. On admission, he presented with pitting oedema in his lower extremities. Initial examinations revealed massive urinary protein and decreased serum albumin, at 13.9 g/g Cr and 1.5 g/dL, respectively. Renal biopsy was performed, and minimal change disease was diagnosed. Prednisolone 60 mg/day was promptly started on the 5th day of hospitalisation, and complete remission was achieved on the 12th day. Prednisolone was once tapered off in 1.5 years successfully though minimal change disease was relapsed in 1 month after the steroid withdrawal.\n\n【2】   COVID-19\n   Nephrotic syndrome\n\n【3】https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported (CC BY 4.0) license, which permits others to copy, redistribute, remix, transform and build upon this work for any purpose, provided the original work is properly cited, a link to the licence is given, and indication of whether changes were made.

Currently, various COVID-19 vaccines are being administered worldwide, which show preventive effects for COVID-19 infection. Most reported side effects of the vaccines are mild or of moderate severity (ie, do not prevent daily activities) and are limited to the first 2 days after vaccination. 2–4 Major side effects of these vaccines are uncommon.\n\n【10】New-onset minimal change disease (MCD) requiring treatment after COVID-19 vaccination has been reported previously. MCD is the leakage of large amounts of protein into the urine due to increased permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier. The involvement of vaccination in the onset and recurrence of MCD has been known, and most cases develop within 2 weeks after vaccination. Thirty cases of new-onset MCD after COVID-19 vaccination have been reported worldwide, including 16 cases related to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 5 cases related to the Moderna vaccine, 5 cases related to the AstraZeneca vaccine, 2 cases related to the Sinovac vaccine and 2 cases related to the Janssen vaccine. 5–30 Only two full case reports of new-onset MCD following the Moderna messenger RNA (mRNA)-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been reported. 12 29 In addition, both reports describe short-term treatment courses.\n\n【11】In this case report, we present a case of new-onset MCD following the first injection of the Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We successfully maintained remission with steroid monotherapy and completely terminated steroids after 1.5 years. We report our findings with pathology and literature review.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】The patient was a man in his 30s with a history of atopic dermatitis and obesity with a body mass index of 31 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . The day after the patient received the first dose of the Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, he experienced low-grade fever and swelling at the site of the injection. The fever and local swelling improved after 1 day, but leg oedema appeared 2 days after vaccination. Over the course of 2 weeks, generalised oedema, palpitations and shortness of breath gradually worsened. He visited a local doctor and was prescribed a diuretic, but the symptoms did not improve. Therefore, 15 days after the vaccination, the patient was referred to our department and was admitted that day.\n\n【14】On admission, his blood pressure was 142/93 mm Hg and heart rate was 81 beats per minute. His body weight had increased from 90 kg to 101 kg with systemic oedema. Blood tests revealed serum creatinine 0.85 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 17.2 mg/dL, serum albumin 1.5 g/dL, Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 363 mg/dL. In addition, a high degree of proteinuria with urinary protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 13.9 g/g Cr was observed, meeting the diagnostic criteria for nephrotic syndrome. A 24-hour urinary collection revealed proteinuria of 18 346 mg/day, and the selectivity index of urinary protein was 0.094. Antibody screening tests such as antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and antiglomerular basement membrane were all negative. Total haemolytic complement (CH 50) and the serum complement levels of C3 and C4 were within normal range. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E level was markedly elevated at 2620 IU/mL. A PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. However, the SARS-CoV-2 anti-S antibody titre was 452 U/mL using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S RUO (Roche Diagnostics K.K.) and 2650.3 AU/mL using the ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott Japan), which was markedly elevated. CT examination showed normal kidney size and ascites effusion.\n\n【15】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【16】Renal biopsy was performed the day after admission. The histological findings are shown in figure 1 . Twenty-three glomeruli were detected, one exhibited global sclerosis and the others were normal. Immunofluorescence staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, C1q and fibrinogen were all negative. Electron microscopy showed normal thickness of the glomerular basement membrane and diffuse foot process effacement. These pathological findings were compatible with MCD.\n\n【17】<img/>\n\n【18】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【20】Renal biopsy findings.

Alb, serum albumin; PSL, prednisone; UPCR, urinary protein-creatinine ratio.\n\n【27】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【28】On the 12th day, the UPCR decreased to 0.1 g/g Cr and complete remission was achieved. After the remission, time was required to manage the side effects of high-dose steroids (eg, blood glucose control and osteoporosis prevention), and the patient was discharged on day 34 of hospitalisation when the dose was reduced to moderate-dose steroids. Two months after discharge, serum creatinine was 0.62 mg/dL, serum albumin 4.6 g/dL and UPCR was 0.14 g/g Cr. The patient remained in complete remission for more than 1 year and PSL was completely tapered off approximately 1.5 years after the onset. However, 1 month after completion of PSL treatment, a relapse of nephrotic syndrome was observed, so PSL 20 mg was restarted, and remission induction was achieved quickly. The second vaccination was not administered based on consultation with the patient. We suggested that if the patient wanted to be vaccinated in the future, another type of COVID-19 vaccine, such as inactivated vaccine, could be administered, but the patient did not wish to be vaccinated.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】This case highlights the risk of new-onset MCD after mRNA vaccine administration. Several case reports in regard to the association of MCD with the Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been published previously. Full case reports of new-onset MCD cases after Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are few and no reports mention long-term outcomes. In MCD, a state of hyperpermeability of glomerular capillaries occurs, resulting in highly selective proteinuria. Although the exact pathogenesis has not yet been elucidated, injury of podocytes by circulating factors released by T cells is thought to be the main mechanism. 31 32 This case highlights the rare but potential risk of MCD after mRNA vaccine administration. There are several case reports of new-onset MCD after mRNA vaccination, and the chronological causality is convincing. 5–30 Although the mechanism is unclear, this case raises the question of whether the mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may lead to rapid development of MCD within a few days following vaccination.\n\n【31】The inevitable question is whether the timing of COVID-19 vaccination and the onset of nephrotic syndrome were too close together. The timing of MCD onset or relapse was reported at a median of 7 days following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 33 On the other hand, four cases of new-onset MCD within 1–2 days following COVID-19 vaccination have been reported. 9 14 15 27 Therefore, the COVID-19 vaccine is estimated to have the potential to trigger an immune response that leads to the development of MCD within 2 days. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 anti-S antibody titre was markedly elevated in this case, suggesting hypersensitivity to the mRNA vaccine. The antibody titre, measured using the Roche test after the first vaccination, was reported to be about 100 U/mL in a population without previous infection; the titre was 452 U/mL in this case, more than four times higher. 34 In comparison, the antibody titre in a previously infected population was reported to be about 10 000 U/mL. 34 In this case, SARS-CoV-2 anti-S antibody titre is in an intermediate range and previous subclinical infection with SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out completely. This finding may explain the brief time between vaccination and onset of MCD.\n\n【32】In combination with COVID-19 vaccination, atopic disease may have predisposed this patient to developing MCD. Pre-existing atopic dermatitis has been associated with the development of MCD through IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, which could imply that those with atopic dermatitis become more susceptible to potential allergic stimulation such as mRNA vaccination, leading to MCD, than those without atopic dermatitis. Additionally, MCD is frequently observed in patients with bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis, and the relationship between IgE-mediated type I allergy and MCD has been highlighted. 35–37 In this case, the background disease was atopic dermatitis, and the blood test at the time of admission showed high IgE levels, indicating that the patient was predisposed to hypersensitivity and developing MCD following vaccination. Similarly, Salem et al reported a case of new-onset MCD following the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a 4os woman with asthma. 11 In this case report, as in the present case, a short period of 5 days was observed between mRNA vaccination and the onset of MCD. Accumulation of cases in the future may suggest an association between atopic disease and MCD after mRNA vaccination.\n\n【33】Steroid sensitivity of new-onset MCD after mRNA vaccination is often good, and there are no case reports of spontaneous remission. Most previously reported cases without underlying disease describe remission induced with steroids alone. 5–30 In this case, complete remission was quickly achieved with PSL 60 mg/day (1 mg/kg), and the steroid response was particularly good. However, a relapse of the nephrotic syndrome was observed soon after the steroid treatment was terminated, so careful follow-up is necessary. Based on case reports to date, early detection of nephrotic syndrome after COVID-19 vaccination and therapeutic intervention are important factors. Nephrologists and allergy specialists involved in vaccination need to be well informed of the possibility of side effects and ensure that patients receive adequate follow-up after vaccination. COVID-19 vaccine is an effective vaccine that can significantly reduce infection. This case report is not to deny vaccination, but to show the necessity of proceeding with vaccination after being aware of the possible side effects. The limitation in this case is the coincidental temporal association. In other words, we cannot deny the possibility that the vaccination and the onset of MCD were unrelated and occurred by chance. More studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between MCD and mRNA vaccines.\n\n【34】### Learning points\n\n【35】   Although the causal relationship is uncertain, minimal change disease following mRNA vaccination has been reported.\n\n【36】   As a possible pathogenic mechanism, the mRNA vaccination may have affected the immune regulatory system, especially the T-cell profile, causing podocyte damage.\n\n【37】   In addition, the patient had atopic dermatitis as a background disease, and it is thought that the predisposing factor was an atopic disease characterised by a Th2-dominant immune state.\n\n【38】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【39】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【40】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

This was subsequently switched to a formula low in long-chain triglycerides, which was steadily increased, with an interruption for a contrast study due to bilious aspirates.\n\n【16】The baby’s weight fell by 17% in the first fortnight with significant resolution of ascites over the 3 weeks before he was discharged to his local neonatal unit.\n\n【17】The cause of his chylous ascites remains unknown. All investigations, including karyotype, cranial ultrasounds and abdominal ultrasound, were normal. Echocardiogram on day 1 of life showed a structurally normal, but slightly hypertrophied, heart with a patent ductus arteriosus and patent foramen ovale. The baby is now well and thriving.\n\n【18】Congenital chylous ascites (CCA) is the accumulation of chyle (lymphatic fluid rich in triglycerides, particularly chylomicrons) in the peritoneal cavity in infants under 3 months. Diagnosis is made from analysis of the fluid. CCA is very rare, particularly as an isolated finding. Due to its rarity, there is no reported incidence or established gold standard management.\n\n【19】Chylous ascites can be secondary to many pathologies, particularly malignancies, trauma and surgical damage to the lymphatic system. CCA results from abnormalities of the abdominal lymphatic system. 1 Obstructed lymphatic flow at lymphaticovenous and lympholymphatic channels raises intralacteal pressure causing subsequent extravasation 2 while maldevelopment of the vessels may cause idiopathic ‘leaky lymphatics’. 1–4\n\n【20】Initial treatment is conservative, with avoidance of long-chain triglycerides. This may mean keeping the baby nil by mouth with total parenteral nutrition or using formulas low in long-chain fatty acids. This aims to slow lymphatic flow and reduce intestinal secretions. 1 Paracentesis can alleviate abdominal pressure and respiratory distress; however, drainage of large volumes of fluid should be done cautiously due to the resultant protein loss.\n\n【21】Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, has been used to reduce lymphatic excretion of chyle. It is postulated to work through a reduction of splanchnic blood flow, intestinal motility and fat absorption. 5 6\n\n【22】If a prolonged period of conservative measures is unsuccessful, surgery is sometimes required to identify and ligate a site of lymphatic leak.\n\n【23】Consequences of significant chyle leak into the peritoneum include malnutrition and immune deficiency, secondary to protein and lymphocyte loss. 1\n\n【24】In summary, this is a case of severe, isolated, CCA requiring premature delivery of the baby with paracentesis during the caesarean section. The baby responded well to conservative management with an excellent outcome.\n\n【25】### Learning points\n\n【26】   Isolated congenital ascites is rare. Congenital chylous ascites is especially rare meaning that there is no universal approach to management.\n\n【27】   The underlying pathology is usually an abnormality of the abdominal lymphatic system—structural or functional—including raised intralacteal pressure due to obstructed drainage.\n\n【28】   Management aims to reduce lymphatic leak. This is primarily through conservative means with avoidance of long-chain fatty acids ± paracentesis or ascitic drainage. Sometimes, however, surgery is required to identify and repair the source of chyle leakage.\n\n【29】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【30】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【31】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thank you to Dr Leigh Dyet for reading the article and making suggestions.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The inferior portion of the swollen right vulvar tissue was grossly oedematous with an area tearing apart and bleeding (white arrow). The abdomen was soft, with a palpable bladder. Using topical lignocaine and inhaled nitrous oxide for analgesia a urinary catheter was placed, which drained 1 L of clear urine. Analgesia administered included intravenous paracetamol, intravenous dexketoprofen and intravenous morphine.\n\n【10】The patient was taken to theatre for examination under anaesthesia; a large labial wall defect on the inferior border of the swelling was found and no incision was necessary. A significant amount of organised haematoma was removed by manual evacuation. The haematoma was solidified and appeared to have self-limited with a tamponade effect. It did not extend into the vaginal wall, and the cavity was extensively washed out with and packed with a povidone–iodine wick.

The patient had leucomatous corneal opacity involving the visual axis with pseudophakia, best corrected visual acuity of 3/60, and intraocular pressure (IOP) of 26 mm Hg  on timolol and brimonidine. The anterior chamber was shallow but angle structures were not visible on gonioscopy due to the media opacity. The patient was diagnosed with right eye healed keratitis with secondary glaucoma, and plans were made for endoscopic angle evaluation and subsequent surgery. A 23 gauge probe used with an endocyclophotocoagulation unit (Endo Optiks, Little Silver, NJ, USA) was inserted into the anterior chamber through the main port used for phacoemulsification and used to visualise the anterior chamber angle under a cohesive viscoelastic preparation (sodium hyaluronate). 1 The examination revealed synechial closure of the angle with the iris occluding the trabecular meshwork (TM) . Goniosynechialysis was undertaken using an iris repositor to expose the TM, followed by an ab interno needle goniectomy using a 26 gauge needle to strip off the TM . 2 In the postoperative period, the IOP was 14 mm Hg with one medication (timolol) at 3 months’ follow-up with no change in the visual acuity.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Right eye with healed keratitis scar.\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【12】Endoscopic image of nasal angle (A) showing synechial closure of angle, (B) goniosynechialysis using an iris repository, and (C) bent ab interno needle goniectomy using a 26 gauge needle.\n\n【13】The presence of corneal opacity has been a major limiting factor while performing ab interno surgery for glaucoma management.

Since 12 years she was following a multimodal management of a rectal cancer with no recurrence since. An abdominal CT scan was performed and demonstrated a mechanical ileus with proximal jejunal dilation (47 mm) without free peritoneal air or fluid. She was taken to the operation room for a laparotomy with extended adhesiolysis and peritoneal washing. At the end of the surgery, a central catheter was placed in the right jugular vein under ultrasound guidance for parenteral nutrition (Omegaflex) to cover the period of oral fasting during her abdominal recovery. On the eighth day after surgery, the central line became dysfunctional and was switched on a guide wire. The patient was recovering well from abdominal surgery but developed a sudden transient paraesthesia of her right lower limb concomitant to the reinitiation of her parenteral nutrition. A CT scan of the brain followed by an MRI showed multiple ischaemic lesions in the right anterior cerebral artery and the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery territories 通用删除1(英):<u>(shown in figure 1 )</u>.

All treatments administered by the central venous line were stopped and the central line was removed surgically by cervicotomy. 1–3 A second reading of the brain MRI confirmed the ischaemic lesions were related to the lipids of the parenteral nutrition administered intra-arterially.

Excluding oesophageal rupture is important, as delaying treatment increases the risk of mortality. We discuss a case of DKA complicated by vomiting, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium and air in the epidural space. Instead of fluoroscopic oesophagography, chest CT was used to investigate oesophageal rupture. We present an overview of case reports and retrospective studies illustrating the utility of chest CT in the investigation of oesophageal rupture over fluoroscopic oesophagography.\n\n【2】   Diabetes\n   Oesophagus\n   Pneumomediastinum\n   Radiology\n   Gastrointestinal surgery\n\n【3】http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2023-255018\n\n【4】Statistics from Altmetric.com\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】Request Permissions\n-------------------\n\n【6】If you wish to reuse any or all of this article please use the link below which will take you to the Copyright Clearance Center’s RightsLink service.

Its presence in Boerhaave syndrome, a transmural oesophageal rupture caused by severe straining or vomiting, is associated with a mortality risk of 15% to 43%. 3 4 Death may result from an infectious mediastinitis or compression of the great vessels by an increased mediastinal pressure. 5 6 Spontaneous pneumomediastinum, on the other hand, generally has a good prognosis and is self-limiting. 7\n\n【11】Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) often experience retching and vomiting, which can lead to both alveolar and oesophageal rupture, making differentiating between spontaneous and secondary pneumomediastinum a challenge. 8 Although fluoroscopic oesophagography is considered the imaging study of choice for diagnosing oesophageal rupture, its use in emergencies is limited by the inability of critically ill patients to change positions and swallow contrast medium. 9 Alternatively, upper endoscopy may be performed but could enlarge a perforation’s size and risks the need for surgery. 10 Despite these difficulties, every effort has to be made to exclude oesophageal rupture because if surgery is required, its delay beyond 24 hours increases morbidity and mortality. 10\n\n【12】Here, we present a case of DKA complicated by pneumomediastinum, in which fluoroscopic oesophagography was unavailable and feasible.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A man in his 20s, with a body weight of 84 kg, presented late in the evening to the emergency department with vomiting and reduced consciousness. Four years prior, he was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. According to his family, he had been ill for 3 days, complaining of nausea, abdominal pain and having diarrhoea. While feeling unwell, had not been using insulin therapy. Since 1 day, he had vomited repeatedly, developed laboured breathing and became increasingly lethargic. He had not experienced fever, coughing or haematemesis, or reported of chest pain or pain when swallowing. He had no other medical history or history of trauma.\n\n【15】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【16】Physical examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale of 13 (E3M6V4). Kussmaul breathing pattern was present with a frequency of 35 bpm. He was tachycardic and had a systolic blood pressure of 79 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of 60 mm Hg. In the chest and neck region, subcutaneous emphysema was felt. Thoracic excursions were symmetric and no tracheal deviation was detected. Breathing sounds were heard bilaterally with inspiratory crepitations on the right lower side of the chest. Heart sounds were normal and no distended jugular veins or Kussmaul’s sign were observed.\n\n【17】Laboratory analysis of his blood showed a glucose of 48 mmol/L (864 mg/dL), Na+ 117 mmol/L, K+ 6.0 mmol/L, Cl− 86 mmol/L, creatinine 196 umol/L, albumin 41.8 g/L, c-reactive protein 296 mg/L, white cell count of 37×10 <sup>9/L </sup> and an arterial blood gas with a pH of 6.84, pO2 of 8.1 kPa (61 mm Hg), pCO2 of 2.2 kPa (17 mm Hg), HCO3− of 2.9 mmol/L and lactate of 1.5 mmol/L. The effective osmolality was calculated to be 282 mOsm/L. The anion gap was 28 mEq/L, providing a delta anion gap/delta HCO3- ratio approximating one. Urine analysis confirmed ketonuria. His ECG showed a sinus tachycardia without ST-segment deviations or T-wave alterations. Respiratory virus PCR testing of COVID-19 and influenza were negative.\n\n【18】A chest X-ray showed subcutaneous emphysema at the upper chest and radiolucent streaks outlining the heart and aortic arch, indicating a pneumomediastinum . Additionally, there were consolidations in the right lower lobe and behind the heart. A CT scan without intravenous contrast material of his chest and neck was made to evaluate the extent of the pneumomediastinum and whether airway or oesophageal injury was present . Pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium were seen without evidence of rib fractures, tracheal or oesophageal injury. Air extended superiorly from between the clavicles to the cranial base and was also visible in the epidural space of the spinal canal. No pneumothorax was present. Aspiration pneumonia was suggested by the combined findings of gastric dilatation, stasis of gastric content in the lower half of the oesophagus and consolidations in the lower lobes of both lungs.\n\n【19】<img/>\n\n【20】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【22】Anteroposterior chest X-ray (upper image) with a corresponding coronal CT image (lower left image) and illustration (lower right image).

A small amount of air is visible in the spinal canal.\n\n【31】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【32】Our patient was diagnosed with DKA complicated by a pneumomediastinum and an aspiration pneumonia. The DKA may have been precipitated by a (viral) gastroenteritis or respiratory infection and worsened by discontinuation of insulin therapy.\n\n【33】The pneumomediastinum resulted from his laboured breathing, retching and vomiting, increasing alveolar pressure and causing alveolar rupture. Oesophageal rupture was unlikely as the patient did not experience fever, had no history of chest pain or pain when swallowing and had a CT-scan without oesophageal wall thickening, periesophageal fat stranding and effusions. Although the lower posterior mediastinum contained air, we regarded this to be of alveolar origin spreading diffusely into all mediastinal compartments, rather than originating from the oesophageal lumen.\n\n【34】We considered using fluoroscopic oesophagography to rule out oesophageal rupture, but at the time of presentation the fluoroscopy suite and qualified technologist were unavailable. Also, due to his reduced consciousness and gastroparesis, drinking contrast material would have risked further aspiration. CT oesophagography was not performed, as there were no standardised protocols in place.\n\n【35】Treatment\n---------\n\n【36】Treatment of his pneumomediastinum was supportive with antiemetics and close monitoring for complications. The DKA was treated according to national protocols. 11 We initiated intravenous antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and placed a nasogastric tube to resolve gastric retention. This tube was seen to be positioned correctly on X-ray imaging and no bloody gastric content was aspirated.\n\n【37】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【38】After 2 days of insulin therapy, the blood pH and anion gap had normalised. He remained haemodynamically stable without the use of vasopressors, seemingly confirming the absence of an oesophageal rupture.\n\n【39】Despite high-flow oxygen therapy, blood oxygen levels deteriorated and work of breathing increased. Intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was started. A chest CT with intravenous contrast material was repeated to evaluate the presence of mediastinal abscesses and the extent of the pneumomediastinum. It showed a clear reduction of mediastinal air and subcutaneous emphysema . New consolidations had developed in the apical segments. Our patient was later diagnosed with bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and treated with voriconazole. His stool culture was negative for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens.\n\n【40】<img/>\n\n【41】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【42】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4</u>\n\n【43】Axial chest CT images without intravenous contrast from admission (left two images) and with intravenous contrast after 7 days (right two images).

After 3 months, he returned to his daily routine. He currently attends the outpatient diabetic clinic every 2 weeks.\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】Coexistence of DKA and pneumomediastinum was first described in 1937 and has been reported in 90 cases since. 12–14 We reviewed 40 case reports and series with 51 patients having DKA and pneumomediastinum ( online supplemental material 1 ). Forty-five patients had spontaneous pneumomediastinum and were treated successfully with supportive management ( table 1 ). Four patients were diagnosed with oesophageal rupture: two were treated surgically, one had conservative management and one was lost to follow-up. The one death was caused by a pneumonia. Our patient had spontaneous pneumomediastinum, confirmed by a chest CT negative for signs of oesophageal injury and absence of complications during follow-up.\n\n【47】### Supplemental material\n\n【48】\\[bcr-2023-255018supp001.pdf\\]\n\n【49】View this table:\n\n【50】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【51】Table 1\n\n【52】Review of case reports including patients with diabetic ketoacidosis complicated by pneumomediastinum, providing details on the aetiology, used diagnostic modalities, treatment and outcome (N=51).\n\n【53】Spontaneous pneumomediastinum in DKA is thought to result from the Kussmaul breathing pattern, vomiting and retching, increasing alveolar pressure or inducing hyperinflation. 15 Hyperinflation of the alveoli lining pulmonary vessels may result in rupture of their base, with air entering the pulmonary interstitium in between the alveolar membrane and vessel wall. 16 Concurrent hypotension with inadequate filling of pulmonary vessels exacerbates traction on the perivascular sheath and increases the risk of alveolar rupture. 16\n\n【54】Animal experiments show that the mediastinal pressure varies during the respiratory cycle. 17 Similar to the intrapleural pressure, the normal mediastinal pressure is lower than or equal to the alveolar pressure. With inspiration lowering the mediastinal pressure and (forced) expiration, vomiting and retching increasing the alveolar pressure, a pressure difference is created. When alveolar rupture occurs, air follows these pressure differences and travels from the pulmonary interstitium towards the hilum to enter the mediastinum . With ongoing mediastinal insufflation, air may disseminate into contiguous tissue. 16 It can reach superiorly along the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia to the cranial base or may extend posteriorly through the neural foramen, along the sheath of the nerve root and into the epidural space. 16 Rarely, it tracks along the pulmonary venous sheath to the pericardial space and causes a pneumopericardium. 16\n\n【55】<img/>\n\n【56】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【57】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5</u>\n\n【58】Diagram illustrating the emergence of a pneumomediastinum. Air escapes from ruptured alveoli lining the vessel walls into the pulmonary interstitium (on the left). It moves along the vascular sheaths towards the mediastinum. When mediastinal pressure rises, air may spread through the loose mediastinal fascia to subcutaneous tissue of the neck (upper arrow), upper extrimities  or enter the pericardial space (lower arrow).\n\n【59】The most common presenting symptom of pneumomediastinum is chest pain, occurring in 75% of patients. 1 Half of patients experience mild dyspnoea and one-third have a cough or neck pain. 1 Physical examination may be normal, but often subcutaneous emphysema is felt in the neck and upper chest. 1 In 18%, Hamman’s sign is present: an audible crepitation on each heartbeat arising from air in the anterior mediastinum or pericardium. 1 16 Hypotension is unlikely to be caused by pneumomediastinum but may indicate a serious underlying condition, such as a severe pneumonia, oesophageal rupture or DKA. Rarely hypotension is caused by an increased mediastinal pressure compressing the heart and great vessels, known as a ‘tension pneumomediastinum’. 16 Cardiac tamponade from accumulation of air has also been described. 18\n\n【60】Different diagnostic modalities were used to evaluate oesophageal rupture in patients with DKA and pneumomediastinum ( table 1 ). Among 51 patients, 33 had chest CT, 12 had fluoroscopic esophagography and 8 received both. Only six patients had upper endoscopy.\n\n【61】Contrary to fluoroscopic esophagography, CT is readily available in most hospitals and may, in the absence of oesophageal rupture, provide an alternative cause of pneumomediastinum. 9 CT findings suggestive of oesophageal rupture are wall discontinuity and thickening, increased periesophageal fat stranding, mediastinal and pleural effusions and subdiaphragmatic air. 19–21 Two retrospective cohort studies showed that in the absence of these findings, chest CT had a 100% negative predictive value for oesophageal rupture. 22 23 In patients with a negative chest CT, subsequent fluoroscopic esophagography would not show oesophageal contrast extravasation and they were managed without endoscopy or surgery. These findings should be interpreted with caution given the rare outcome, with only 24 out of 206 patients having a surgically, endoscopically or fluoroscopically proven oesophageal perforation. 22 23\n\n【62】When using chest CT for investigating oesophageal rupture, radiologists often use intravenous contrast material to enhance visualisation of the oesophageal wall, mediastinal and pleural abscesses. 9 Addition of intravenous contrast did not improve diagnostic performance or interobserver agreement in the aforementioned studies. 22 23 Our patient received chest CTs with and without intravenous contrast material, providing similar results. However, if no contraindications exist (eg, iodine allergy, renal failure), we suggest adding intravenous contrast material to increase the demarcation of the oesophageal wall and improve the detection of mediastinal pathology. In our institution, we use non-ionic contrast agents (80 mL of iomeron 300 mg/mL) with a 40 s scan delay. Similar CT protocols are used in other institutions. 9\n\n【63】CT esophagography combines the use of oral contrast with chest CT. 9 The patient may lie supine while contrast is administered into the upper oesophagus through a tube inserted at the level of the cricopharyngeal sphincter. No fluoroscopy suite is needed. The addition of oral contrast material increases the positive predictive value of chest CT and provides the exact location of the oesophageal defect. 22\n\n【64】This case report illustrates the diagnostic challenge of investigating the presence of oesophageal rupture in patients with DKA and pneumomediastinum. Although data are limited, we consider chest CT with intravenous contrast as the diagnostic modality of choice. We think that fluoroscopic esophagography is impractical and, in case of a negative CT, of no added value. If doubt remains after negative CT, we recommend CT esophagography. In all cases of suspected oesophageal rupture, we advise that imaging is interpreted by an experienced radiologist, given the rarity of its occurrence.\n\n【65】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【66】The first author translated the patient’s perspective.\n\n【67】I was feeling ill 3 days prior to admission. It was the first time I experienced this kind of weakness. Like my organs were not functioning properly. I was vomiting continuously and was unsure whether to use my insulin. I cannot recall if I used it or not. The last thing I remember is trying to get to my general practitioner. I do not have any recollection of being in the ambulance, emergency department or intensive care unit.\n\n【68】Once I woke up, it was hard to tell my dreams apart from reality. My surroundings felt very surreal. I am glad my friends and family were present the first days after I was off the ventilator. They were the only thing familiar to me in this world of machines. Together with the doctors and nurses, they repeatedly explained to me what had happened. I had been in the intensive care unit for several weeks. I could not believe it at first, but my mother had taken pictures of my time there.\n\n【69】My physical recovery was expeditious. I trained daily with the physiotherapist in the hospital and only stayed shortly at the rehabilitation centre. However, the challenging part was the mental recovery. I would like to advise doctors and nurses in the intensive care unit to take special care of patients the moment they regain consciousness. In my case, the presence of my family members and friends made a huge difference and reduced my anxiety significantly.\n\n【70】My time in the hospital and the recovery afterwards made me more aware of my diabetes. I started to read on nutrition and use my glucose sensor regularly. Previously, I never expected that my diabetes could make me this sick. Sometimes I wonder whether the fungus in my lungs was with me all this time, even before I was put in the intensive care unit.\n\n【71】The patient was asked to comment on his chest computed tomography images showing a pneumomediastinum.\n\n【72】The doctor (SZ) tells me the amount of air in my chest, but outside of my lungs, was visually impressive, but I do not remember having any issues of chest pain, shortness of breath or feeling air bubbles underneath my skin. My mother told me she felt the air bubbles when I was in the intensive care unit. Currently I do not have chest pain or problems when eating or drinking.\n\n【73】### Learning points\n\n【74】   Pneumomediastinum is an uncommon complication of diabetic ketoacidosis and may occur spontaneously and rarely secondary to oesophageal rupture.\n\n【75】   Mediastinal air may spread to adjacent tissue, resulting in pneumopericardium, subcutaneous emphysema in the upper chest and neck, and air in the spinal canal.\n\n【76】   Chest CT is the preferred diagnostic modality for investigating secondary causes of pneumomediastinum, as it is widely available, easy to perform and has a high sensitivity for oesophageal rupture.\n\n【77】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【78】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【79】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【80】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【81】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to acknowledge the Alrijne Academy for their support of research endeavours by students or early career researchers from the Alrijne Zorggroep.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

We report the management of this condition in a low-resource setting. A teenage girl presented to our secondary-level remote rural hospital with haemoptysis. Initial surgery was performed with the facilities available at that time. Four years later, she had a recurrence of haemoptysis and underwent right middle lobectomy. Twenty years after the first surgery, the patient remains healthy. The case is reported for its rarity, the challenging circumstances in which the patient was treated and its successful outcome with long follow-up. Further, we discuss the social and economic factors that affect health-seeking behaviour, the ethical challenges in managing rare conditions (that are usually referred to tertiary care facilities) in a secondary level hospital with respect to the resources available to the institution and patient and suggest modifications to traditional decision-making protocols.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】### First presentation\n\n【12】A teenage girl presented to our remote rural hospital located in Assam in northeastern India. She was studying in school; her father was a marginal farmer and mother a housewife. She had experienced small amounts of haemoptysis at home over several months followed by a large bout, ‘half a bucket’ of fresh blood along with blood spilled on her clothes and the ground. She was taken to a district hospital, transfused 4 units of whole blood and referred to our hospital for further management. She was stable at initial presentation but was still coughing up small amounts of blood-stained sputum. She was afebrile.\n\n【13】Chest X-ray showed a rounded lesion in the lower half of the right lung. The hospital had a Picker 15 mA X-ray machine at that time which did not produce good quality images and the patient was therefore referred for a CT scan to an imaging centre 100 km away. The report of the CT scan was that there was a cystic lesion of the lung, probably a hydatid cyst . Her blood group was O positive, other routine investigations were within normal limits.\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【17】CT scan image at first presentation.\n\n【18】At that time, the nearest large referral hospital was over 12 hours by road and a hospital with reliable lung surgeons was 1400 km away (2 days by train). The patient was not able or willing to travel and there was a significant risk of a life-threatening rebleed. Although lung surgery had not been done at the hospital at that time, the surgeon had experience with the pneumonostomy procedure for hydatid cysts of the lung as well as lung resections and it was proposed that the patient undergo pneumonostomy.\n\n【19】The hospital is situated in a remote rural part of northeast India. It started as a leprosy hospital, closed for 10 years and was reopened by the authors 7 years earlier. The authors had undergone postgraduate training in paediatric surgery and anaesthesia and returned a few months prior to the initial presentation of the patient. At that time, they were the only consultants at the hospital, the nearest telephone was 50 km away (2 hours by road), there was no internet access in the area, electricity was provided by a 15 kVA diesel generator and oxygen procured in cylinders from a major city 400 km away (12 hours by road). The hospital had two junior doctors and an outpatient volume of about 100–125 patients but inpatient volumes were low. The operating room used an ordinary 150 W incandescent bulb for lighting and an antique Bovie Spark-Gap machine for electro-cautery but the surgical instruments required for the proposed surgery, especially an adult chest retractor were available. The hospital did not have an intensive care unit or ventilators at that time but one of the authors was well trained in critical care and several sick patients had been managed successfully with hand ventilation when indicated. Considering the risk of a potentially fatal rebleed and the other constraints described above, the authors felt that they could confidently perform the pneumonostomy procedure with the facilities available after obtaining informed high-risk consent.\n\n【20】Anaesthesia was provided with an Epstein-Mackintosh-Oxford (EMO) apparatus using di-ethyl ether (anaesthetic ether) and atmospheric air . The patient was induced with thiopentone 100 mg intravenously and succinylcholine 100 mg intravenously, followed by pancuronium 4 mg intravenously, intubated with a reusable Rusch 7.0 endotracheal tube and a right posterolateral thoracotomy was done. Monitoring was done with intermittent manual sphygmomanometry, pulse oximetry and electrocardiography. A large firm mass was found in the lung with some areas that were cystic on palpation. Dense adhesions were encountered between the mass and the chest wall; when these were separated, the cystic part of the lesion was inadvertently opened causing the drainage of sebaceous material and a hair ball was removed . Palpation within the cavity showed that part of the wall contained firm material, presumably bone and cartilage. These findings indicated that the patient had a teratoma but the team was unprepared for a major excision. The full extent of the lesion was not obvious and in the absence of facilities for frozen section and an in-house pathologist, a histopathological diagnosis could not be made during surgery. Considering these factors and the significant constraints mentioned above, it was felt that the risks of attempting a major resection were unacceptable. Therefore, the contents of the cavity and part of the cyst wall were removed and the chest closed with a pleural drain. Muscle relaxation was reversed using neostigmine 2.5 mg intravenously with atropine 1.2 mg intravenously and the patient was allowed to recover from the effects of ether in the recovery room. There was no significant intraoperative bleeding and no blood was transfused during surgery. The patient made a complete recovery and was discharged on the 10th postoperative day. As there was no local histopathology service, the excised tissue was sent to a reputed institution in South India. Histopathological examination reported a mature teratoma. The hospital paid the cost of the histopathology examination. The patient was advised a second surgery to remove the remaining tumour. Since she was symptom-free, she was unwilling to undergo a second surgery at that time.\n\n【21】<img/>\n\n【22】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【24】The Epstein-Mackintosh-Oxford apparatus (image used with permission from the Wood Library-Museum of Anesthesiology, USA).\n\n【25】<img/>\n\n【26】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【27】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3</u>\n\n【28】Sebaceous material and hair removed at first surgery.\n\n【29】### Second presentation\n\n【30】The patient presented with recurrent small volume haemoptysis 4 years later . She was married and had her first child at that time. In the intervening period, the hospital had been modernised with better equipment. Chest X-ray, performed this time with a Siemens 100 mA machine, showed a recurrent lesion in the same location that had grown in size . The authors were still the only consultants but there were four junior doctors. The hospital used scarce resources to develop facilities for patients at the cost of facilities for staff who lived without electricity in their quarters for the first 14 years after the hospital was restarted. There was a ‘high-dependency unit’ with multiparameter monitors although a ventilator was yet to be installed. CT scan was not repeated as the chest X-ray clearly showed recurrence of the tumour with calcification along the borders, a histopathological diagnosis was available from the earlier biopsy and the expense of travel and another CT could be avoided. Surgery was planned and done as an elective procedure after obtaining informed consent. Anaesthesia was provided with a BOC Boyle machine using halothane, oxygen and nitrous oxide with the patient induced with thiopentone 100 mg intravenously and succinylcholine 100 mg intravenously, followed by pancuronium 4 mg intravenously with pain relief provided by pentazocine 30 mg intravenously. The patient was intubated with a Portex 24 left double lumen tube, with continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, electrocardiography, end-tidal carbon dioxide and invasive blood pressure. The chest was opened through the previous scar. Extensive adhesions were found between the chest wall and the lesion. Two overlying ribs were partially excised to provide better access. When the lung was freed from the chest wall, it was noted that the entire lesion was within the middle lobe of the lung. The horizontal and oblique fissures were dissected at the hilum until the inferior lobar bronchus was exposed. The vessels and bronchial branches entering into the right middle lobe were divided and ligated, excising the lobe. No obvious cause for haemoptysis was found during surgery. After completion of lobectomy, the double lumen tube was removed and replaced with a Portex 7.0 endotracheal tube; ventilation showed that the upper and lower lobes were inflating well with no air-leak and the chest was closed with a pleural drain . Muscle relaxation was reversed using neostigmine 2.5 mg intravenously and atropine 1.2 mg intravenously. The patient made an unremarkable recovery and was discharged on the tenth postoperative day. A chest X-ray at follow-up about a month after surgery showed only postoperative changes and the patient was not symptomatic. Histology was reported as mature teratoma with no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【31】<img/>\n\n【32】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【33】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4</u>\n\n【34】Timeline of presentations (graphic created by VAI).\n\n【35】<img/>\n\n【36】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5</u>\n\n【38】Chest X-ray prior to second surgery.\n\n【39】<img/>\n\n【40】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【41】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6</u>\n\n【42】Intraoperative photograph after middle lobectomy.\n\n【43】### Follow-up\n\n【44】Sixteen years after the second surgery, the authors met the patient incidentally and found her to be asymptomatic.

She was requested to visit the hospital where a chest X-ray showed some pleural thickening and postoperative changes but no recurrence of the tumour .\n\n【45】<img/>\n\n【46】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【47】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7</u>\n\n【48】Chest X-ray 16 years after second surgery.\n\n【49】Global health problem list\n--------------------------\n\n【50】   The correct diagnosis of rare conditions is more likely to be missed in remotely situated low-resource settings for want of adequate diagnostic facilities.\n\n【51】   Decision making in emergent situations has to take into account objective assessment of the facilities available in the institution, the cost and risk versus benefit of the proposed plan, logistics and the patient’s informed consent.\n\n【52】   Many low-income and middle-income countries have low per capita national investment in healthcare resulting in large out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) causing catastrophic health expenditure and destitution. Further, social and economic factors cause patients from poor communities, especially those living in remote rural areas, to fear visiting hospitals with self-imposed delays and denials of treatment which contribute to poor healthcare outcomes.\n\n【53】   Secondary-level hospitals with limited-resources fear taking on the risks of treating patients with limited financial means. They refer to distant hospitals leaving patients with the choice of either going home untreated or incurring expenses that may push their families into destitution while seeking treatment in distant hospitals.\n\n【54】   Multiple factors lead to inequitable access to ethical medical management.\n\n【55】   Fear of litigation causes doctors and hospitals to ‘play safe’ by following rigid ‘gold-standard’ guidelines, which do not allow the flexibility to treat patients effectively by using services at their disposal and considering the financial means available to patients.\n\n【56】Global health problem analysis\n------------------------------\n\n【57】### Rural hospital facilities\n\n【58】The hospital had facilities to do chest X-rays using a very basic machine and this showed an ill-defined rounded opacity in the right lower zone. To understand the lesion and its relationships better, the patient was referred for a CT scan to a centre 100 km away. The reports of the scan were that there was a cystic lung lesion, probably hydatid. Bronchoscopy, angiography and better radiological facilities were possible only at a large city, 400 km and 12 hours away. Further imaging options were therefore not pursued considering the risks of bleeding in transit and the unwillingness of the patient to be referred further away.\n\n【59】Cystic lesions of the lung include congenital cysts, parasitic cysts and abscesses. Haemoptysis is not a common symptom with most patients having these conditions presenting with cough or fever. In this case, the CT scan was reported by a radiologist in another hospital as a lung cyst, probably hydatid. Pathognomonic findings for teratoma on CT scanning, such as the presence of teeth, were not observed. Our hospital had treated several patients with hydatid cysts of the liver, so a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary hydatid cyst was reasonable at initial presentation to the hospital. An intrapulmonary cystic teratoma was not considered due to its extreme rarity and unusual location, the diagnosis was suspected during the initial exploratory thoracotomy and confirmed by subsequent histopathological examination.\n\n【60】Teratomas are most common in a gonadal location. The most common extragonadal site is the mediastinum. Intrapulmonary location for a teratoma was described in 1839 by Mohr and is very rare with less than 100 cases reported as of 2015. 1 They are commonly found in the upper lobes and the authors are unable to find any report of a right middle lobe location in the literature. Intrapulmonary teratomas may have varied radiological findings and have been confused with hydatid cyst of the lung. 2 Those with thicker walls and/or surrounded by solid areas, nodules or consolidation could be reported as cavitary lesions. They are postulated to arise from pluripotent stem cells of the third pharyngeal pouch or the ventral foregut which migrate along the developing lung bud. 3 Rarely, teratomas of the mediastinum and lung can occur in the same patient. 4 Lung teratomas are often cystic and may contain hair, bone, cartilage, sebaceous material, nervous tissue and skin. They commonly present with dry cough and sometimes with haemoptysis. Trichoptysis has been reported and when it occurs, may facilitate preoperative diagnosis. 4 They occur equally in males and females and present most commonly in the second and third decades of life. Malignant transformation can occur, with the most common pathology being squamous-celled carcinoma.\n\n【61】In this case, it is possible that erosion of surrounding vessels and bronchi led to haemoptysis. No definite cause of haemoptysis was found during surgery and bronchoscopy and angiography were not available.\n\n【62】### Decision making in austere circumstances\n\n【63】At first presentation, the patient was stable after receiving four units of blood at another hospital. Surgery is indicated for life-threatening haemoptysis in a situation in which the cause of bleeding can be treated by the intervention and the origin of the bleeding has been specifically and reliably located (strong recommendation, 1B—SEPAR guidelines). 5\n\n【64】With a presumptive diagnosis of hydatid cyst of the lung, the pneumonostomy procedure was planned. 6 During the surgery, efforts were made to avoid breakage of the cyst and cyst fluid leakage because this can cause anaphylaxis; the anaesthesiologist was aware of this possibility and was prepared to manage it. Further, viable parasite present in leaked cyst fluid can cause implantation and recurrence. The risk of this can be reduced by irrigation of the cyst with scolicidal agents. In this case, the risk was reduced by packing the surrounding area with surgical swabs soaked in a scolicidal agent (10% povidone iodine). Hydatid cysts of the lung are often solitary and grow within lung tissue stretching surrounding bronchi and vessels around them. When an intrapulmonary hydatid cyst is surgically removed, weakened bronchial walls lead to multiple perforations and significant air-leak which can cause collapse of the ipsilateral lung, bronchopleural fistula, significant hospital stay and loss of lung capacity. This can be avoided by using the pneumonostomy technique where the cavity is closed around a tube which is exteriorised to the atmosphere, creating a broncho-atmospheric fistula, similar to a tracheostomy. Since air does not leak into the pleural cavity, the lung does not collapse and patients recover quickly and completely with no loss of lung tissue as the bronchial perforations heal over time. This surgery is simple and easy to perform in a low-resource setting.\n\n【65】At surgery, it was noted that the lesion was adherent to the chest wall and was of variable consistency on palpation. A thinned-out part of the lesion had inadvertently opened during the release of adhesions and thick sebaceous material appeared. When the cavity was opened, a hair ball was found and palpation of the internal surface showed hard, firm and soft areas. These findings indicated that this was an intrapulmonary teratoma but since frozen section facility was not available, it was not possible to have histopathological confirmation or exclude a malignant component. Since there was no intrathoracic or airway bleeding after partial removal of the tumour, it was felt that an immediate rebleed would not occur. It was therefore decided to close the chest with drainage and reoperate after confirming the diagnosis on an elective basis or refer the patient to a specialist centre. When operating in similar challenging situations, partial excision or decompression of an intrapulmonary teratoma presenting with massive haemoptysis may be sufficient to prevent an immediate re-bleed.\n\n【66】The EMO anaesthesia machine was used during the first surgery—this machine was used at our hospital for more than 10 years with excellent results, we stopped using it only after it developed a malfunction and anaesthetic ether was no longer available in India. It was developed for field hospitals during World War II and is a temperature compensated, calibrated, draw-over ether vaporiser, commonly used with hand-operated ‘Oxford’ bellows. 7 Ether is an effective anaesthetic agent and adequate anaesthesia can be provided with atmospheric air in most circumstances. Additional oxygen needs to be supplemented only when required. Ether anaesthesia is safe, even in non-expert hands, although it is slow in onset and recovery. Induction may be hastened by using halothane with an attached Oxford Miniature Vaporizer but this was not available at the hospital. The other disadvantage of ether is its flammability. This is a significant risk when used with oxygen and electrocautery. In our case, oxygen was used only for preoxygenation and haemostasis was achieved primarily using ligatures and pressure with cautery used sparingly when oxygen was not in use. This technology is now considered obsolete and is not taught in modern anaesthesia training programmes. With modern anaesthesia performed by Boyle type machines that use newer anaesthetic agents and with the free availability of pressurised gases, anaesthetic ether is not manufactured in most countries. Penlon, the company that was producing the EMO machine has stopped manufacture due to absent demand. From a global health perspective, the EMO machine may still be used to provide safe, cheap, reliable anaesthesia in situations where electricity and oxygen supply are unreliable; it can be safely administered by trained anaesthesia providers and it should be considered as a realistic option in such resource limited settings. Ether is inexpensive, safe and provides excellent intraoperative pain control which extends several hours into the postoperative period and should be considered as a realistic agent for anaesthesia in situations where surgery needs to be performed under conditions of multiple major resource constraints—such as the conditions described above. 8\n\n【67】Surgical excision provides a complete cure for benign mature teratomas of the lung and that was the procedure adopted at the second surgery. Extensive scarring and adhesions between the lung and chest wall necessitated partial excision of two overlying ribs to gain adequate exposure. Since the tumour was entirely within the right middle lobe, a right middle lobectomy was performed. Symptom-free follow-up 16 years after definitive surgery shows that simple lobectomy of the involved lobe was sufficient for complete cure of this rare condition.\n\n【68】### Financial pressures on patients to pay for healthcare\n\n【69】India has a low national per capita investment in healthcare as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and this results in high OOPE for patients. The resulting financial vulnerability caused by a single large healthcare expenditure is especially acute in remote rural communities and among the poor and marginalised. 9 Within India, healthcare accessibility and outcomes vary enormously. The Government of India has identified eight particularly vulnerable states, including Assam, which are collectively called the ‘Empowered Action Group States’ with under-5 mortality rate, maternal mortality rate and other healthcare indices being used as surrogate markers of healthcare access and outcomes 10 Healthcare outcomes in these states are enumerated in Annual Health Surveys, both nationally and for individual states such as Assam. 11 12 Within most states, urban areas fare better than rural areas. India’s rural:urban population ratio is 72:28 but the bed availability is exactly the opposite 28:72—government healthcare facilities are often poorly equipped/staffed and private ‘for profit’ hospitals almost non-existent in many remote rural areas. 13 14 There are many challenges in attracting and retaining committed manpower in needy rural areas. Professionally, they need to manage with the facilities available to be able to provide healthcare at affordable costs and personally, they face multiple inconveniences at home which they should be willing to accept.\n\n【70】In this case, the income of the family rested on a sole income generating individual, the father, who was a marginal farmer. At the time of presentation, there was no provision for government-funded health insurance and all expenditure would have been out-of-pocket for the family. The fear of the resulting catastrophic expenditure which could lead to sale of vital assets or borrowing at unsustainable terms and destitution led the family to refuse consent for distant referral. Assessment of how much the patient could pay without selling vital assets was used to provide charitable funds for both surgeries.\n\n【71】Other factors that affect healthcare access include lower public confidence in free or subsidised public healthcare services. This leads families to spend beyond their capacity to finance healthcare needs by going to private healthcare providers. 15 Many families live in chronic poverty and a sudden expenditure is coped with by curtailing already limited family budgets for basic necessities like food and schooling. Families with limited means may become destitute as a consequence of decisions to borrow unsustainably to fund health intervention, selling off vital assets, taking children out of school and even resorting to debt bondage. 16 The authors have noted that when a family sells their home or other vital asset to finance healthcare expenditure, it creates a chilling effect in the local community and this fear leads to self-imposed delays and denials of healthcare. A significant percentage of OOPE on healthcare is spent on non-medical expenses. 17 A realistic evaluation of these factors should encourage governments and healthcare institutions to develop strategies to close gaps in access. 18\n\n【72】Our hospital has observed many such events where delay and refusal of treatment, failure to report for follow-up as well as refusal of referral have occurred. 19 The hospital has developed a number of poor-centric strategies to alleviate fear and welcome poor patients to access its services. These strategies include ability-to-pay based pricing, equal access to services to all, hyper-tailored charity, removing cultural barriers through community engagement, revised gold standard treatment protocols as well as recruitment and retention of an efficient workforce. To illustrate one of these strategies, charity is ‘hyper-tailored’ based on the hospital’s assessment of financial distress where patients and their relatives prefer to starve in hospitals to save scarce financial resources to pay for treatment, request discharge before a patient dies as the cost of transporting a dead body is much higher or need to sell vital assets to finance healthcare—these are painful decisions that a non-poor family would not take. Assessment of how much a family can pay without selling vital assets goes into the quantum of charity provided to a family. 20 21\n\n【73】### Medical ethics in difficult circumstances\n\n【74】Fear of litigation causes many hospitals to overinvestigate, refuse treatment and refer patients that they are capable of treating. In addition, tertiary care is not available in most rural areas and distant travel may exceed 1000 km, which causes significant costs besides delay in accessing care which could impact outcomes. The number of cardiothoracic surgeons available in India is inadequate to service the needs of cardiac surgery. There are even fewer who specialise in general thoracic surgery. It is extremely difficult for a patient with a lung problem to access the services of a dedicated thoracic surgeon in what would be considered reasonable travel distance. The amount reimbursed to hospitals by public health schemes for lung surgical procedures is insufficient to meet the costs of thoracic procedures discouraging hospitals from providing thoracic surgical services. 22 Some parts of the country, such as northeast India do not have centres which were operating on such patients at the time when this patient was treated, with referral to mainland India being expensive and requiring significant travel time. The authors have noted that when local hospitals refer to distant hospitals, many poor patients simply go home and may die or suffer complications of untreated disease—this could have been the outcome in our case if the patient had been refused treatment. Each hospital should objectively examine the resources at their disposal and constraints under which they function to accept reasonable risks when the benefits are great.\n\n【75】The four modern principles of medical ethics, beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice, should be used to modify guidelines. 23 In this case, during the first surgery, considering the emergent situation and potential of a fatal rebleed, a simple exploratory thoracotomy, pneumonostomy or as it turned out, partial excision to stop haemoptysis was a reasonable risk to accept and therefore beneficence was exercised. However, in the presence of serious local constraints with the full extent and histopathological diagnosis unknown and contralateral lung protection unavailable, not assuming unacceptable risk and not proceeding with a lung resection was non-maleficence. Understanding the situation of the patient and respecting her wish not to be referred and operating with full informed consent after understanding risks involved is autonomy. Providing all possible access to quality treatment within the capacity of the institution in spite of severe constraints irrespective of poverty and rural residence is justice. Thus, the four pillars of ethical treatment have been employed in this case.\n\n【76】A definitive excision at a second sitting was performed in an elective setting with most of the constraints mentioned above resolved resulting in a successful outcome. This may be the most realistic way to treat such conditions ethically in resource-limited settings and among poor remote rural communities, using a strategy of ‘best possible treatment at the time under the circumstances’.\n\n【77】### Guidelines for ethical and professional treatment in austere environments\n\n【78】‘Gold-standard’ guidelines and protocols assume that the hospital has access to the latest equipment, manpower and when this is not possible, the patient can be transported safely and quickly without affecting the life of the patient or the financial security of the family. This ideal scenario is considerably modified in many countries as described above. Guidelines should be revised on a case-by-case basis taking into account an objective evaluation of the constraints and assets at the disposal of the operating team as well as the financial resources available to the patient to reach ‘revised gold standards’ that are realistic in that particular scenario. In this case, the EMO machine and anaesthetic ether were used in the first operation. Although both are considered obsolete, the older, time-tested equipment and agent are realistic and possibly best choices in many parts of the developing world, including war-torn areas. Our hospital used such a protocol in the management of this patient and also trains Global Health residents, doing their MD (Global Health and Tropical Medicine) course from the Netherlands, to create and use such protocols effectively under challenging circumstances across the globe. 24\n\n【79】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【80】I had an episode of massive coughing of blood 20 years ago and was taken to the local district hospital where four units of blood was transfused. I was referred to this hospital and was referred for a CT scan. An emergency surgery was done. After receiving the biopsy report, I was told that a second surgery was required but I was fine at that time and refused because of fear. I got married 18 months after the first surgery and after giving birth to my first son, I again started coughing out blood. X-ray showed that the tumour had returned and I agreed to a second surgery. Now, 16 years later, I am completely fine. I thank God and the hospital for saving my life.\n\n【81】### Learning points\n\n【82】   Mature teratomas of the lung should be considered in the differential diagnosis of haemoptysis when imaging shows a cystic or cavitary lung lesion.\n\n【83】   Partial excision of a mature cystic teratoma may be sufficient to prevent potential massive haemoptysis in an emergent setting.\n\n【84】   The Epstein-Mackintosh-Oxford apparatus and diethyl ether can be used safely to provide anaesthesia in resource-limited settings.\n\n【85】   Intrapulmonary teratomas can occur in the right middle lobe and treated successfully by right middle lobectomy.\n\n【86】   The social and economic conditions of the patient and resources at hand should be objectively analysed to create ‘revised gold standards’ to treat patients in resource-limited settings.\n\n【87】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【88】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【89】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【90】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【91】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to acknowledge Dr. Joseph Duerksen, visiting anaesthesiologist who donated a left double lumen tube on hearing about this patient and Dr. Kenny David, visiting orthopaedic surgeon who assisted the second surgery.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

A thoracoabdominal CT confirmed the subcentimetric adenopathies (left supraclavicular and bilateral axillary), which suggested lymphocyte proliferation disorder as the most likely diagnosis. Positron emission tomography revealed multiple hypermetabolic adenopathies with low uptake, so low‐grade lymphoproliferative syndrome could not be ruled out .\n\n【10】Given the lack of a definitive diagnosis, the fact that low levels of FDG uptake cannot completely dismiss malignancy, the use of immunosuppressive therapies, and the emotional distress showed by the patient, we asked the surgery department to perform an exeresis of the most accessible one (the left supraclavicular). Its dark colour caught their attention. Once the sample was processed, the department of pathology asked whether the patient had any tattoos.\n\n【11】A diagnosis of pigment-related lymphadenopathy was made .\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【15】Ganglionic biopsy. Lymph node with sinusoidal distension and epithelioid histiocytes, containing exogenous dark material compatible with the pigments in the tattoos.\n\n【16】Our aim with this case is to draw attention to the potential adverse effects of having tattoos. This aesthetic procedure is more and more common in our society (about 60 million people in Europe and 16% of the population in the USA have at least one tattoo). 1 However, there is widespread lack of knowledge regarding how ink degrades under the skin as well as the effects of such degradation. The biggest problem may arise over the long term, as some patients have had reactions months or years following the procedure (it was 6 years in the case of our patient).\n\n【17】Pigment accumulates in the dermis and spreads across the intracellular space, causing haemorrhage, necrosis and inflammation that results in phagocytosis by skin macrophages. Macrophages reach the lymph nodes, where inflammatory reactions can take place and, in many cases, last long after the tattoo has been removed. Sometimes this can be revealed subclinically (autopsies of tattooed patients sometimes reveal the existence of regional adenopathies with pigments). 1\n\n【18】In some cases, malignant skin tumours may develop within the tattoos. The pigments used can degrade with exposure to light, releasing potentially carcinogenic substances via haematogenous spread. 2 It can be difficult to differentiate a neoplastic process from pigment-related lymphadenopathy (in tattooed oncological patients can be mistaken as neoplastic progression). PET/CT can help to avoid unnecessary biopsies. The results were doubtful in the case of our patient, although false positives have been described. 3 Histological confirmation can be necessary under such circumstances. Our differential diagnosis was established with a lymphocyte proliferation, and the final diagnosis was anatomopathological.\n\n【19】### Learning points\n\n【20】   Pigment lymphadenopathy must be part of the differential diagnosis for tattooed patients with adenopathies of unknown aetiology in draining lymph nodes.\n\n【21】   Even though positron emission tomography/CT can produce false-positives, its proper interpretation must be carefully considered to avoid unnecessary exploration.\n\n【22】   A histological diagnosis is not necessary in every patient, but in the event of doubt a differential diagnosis of malignant entities must always be histological.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

DLGNT, diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumour.\n\n【14】DLGNTs typically present in men at a median age of 4 years old. 1 Morphologically, they present as a plaque-like subarachnoid tumour composed of sheets of small round cells. 2 3 These tumours radiographically present with abnormal nodular leptomeningeal thickening and enhancement of basal cisterns, posterior fossa and spinal cord, 4 typically without a specific intraparenchymal focus 1 2 4 ; however, intraparenchymal lesions can be found in the spinal cord. Immunohistochemical staining is typically positive for OLIG2, MAP2 and S-100. A common chromosomal abnormality is the BRAF KIAA-1549 fusion caused by 7q34 duplication. 5–7 DLGNT MC-1 tumours tend to be diagnosed at a younger age and are less aggressive than DLGNT methylation class 2 (MC-2) tumours. 8 Patients with DLGNTs tend to have a worse prognosis if they have an elevated Ki-67, are over 9 years old, have evidence of hydrocephalus, have an intraparenchymal tumour and anaplastic histology. 9\n\n【15】Therapies for DLGNT are non-standardised and have historically included chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. 10–13 Carboplatin, vincristine and temozolomide have been among the most commonly used regimens with reported stable disease or minimal response in some patients. 13 Recurrent 1p deletion and MAPK/ERK pathway activation of DLGNT suggests that targeted therapies including MEK inhibitors may be potential therapeutic option and will likely be a focus for future clinical trials.\n\n【16】DLGNT can be easily missed on initial evaluation since patients may not have findings typically attributed to a spinal lesion and may only present with vague symptoms of increased intracranial pressure with hydrocephalus, highlighting the importance of obtaining neuroimaging of the entire craniospinal axis in patients with non-communicating hydrocephalus. Previous cases have been reported of DLGNT being misdiagnosed as meningitis or other infectious aetiologies, 14 so it is important to include DLGNT in cases of unusual patterns of leptomeningeal enhancement.

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) showed flow void areas within the lesion in the deep choroidal layer segmentation and a normal vascular pattern in the outer retina segmentation . As the lesion was flat, ultrasound B-scan was not done. Based on the findings of the multimodal imaging, we inferred that the lesion was a deep, flat choroidal lesion lacking vasculature and melanin pigment.

It has been widely used to describe the findings in various retinal and choroidal pathologies. Choroidal nevi are benign lesions and most of them contain melanin and appear pigmented. They show hyperreflectance on the infrared channel and appear ‘salmon pink’ on the multicolour image. 3 This is in contrast to the current case where the lesion appeared dark (hyporeflective) on the infrared reflectance channel. This can be explained based on the light absorption properties of melanin. The melanin present in the choroidal melanocytes absorbs the shorter wavelength blue and green wavelength light while reflects the longer wavelength infrared light. 4 Hence, a pigmented choroidal nevus lesion appears white on the infrared reflectance while an amelanotic choroidal lesion appears dark. On the other hand, OCTA is a non-invasive tool to study the blood flow in the retinal and choroidal vessels. Absence of intralesional choroidal vessels and a normal overlying deep retinal vascular plexus suggests the avascular and benign nature of the lesion. Hence, monitoring the vascular alterations with OCTA could be a crucial step in identifying the early transition from a nevus to a melanoma.\n\n【15】Previous studies used swept-source OCT, 5 near infra-red reflectance 6 and multicolour imaging to characterise pigmented and non-pigmented choroidal nevi and to distinguish them from malignant tumours. 3 Absence of pigmentation in amelanotic lesions helps to study the internal architecture and vascular component using MI. A small lesion size, plateau configuration and absence of secondary retinal changes warrant no further intervention except for regular follow-up as in the present case. Other amelanotic-looking choroidal lesions like choroidal osteoma which show back scattering on ultrasound, postinflammatory scars with choroidal thinning and metastatic deposits, which are bilateral, would be differentials in such cases.\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】   Amelanotic choroidal nevus is rare and presents a diagnostic challenge.\n\n【18】   Multicolour imaging is a non-invasive tool to differentiate it from other melanotic and amelanotic, benign and malignant choroidal lesions.\n\n【19】   Increase in size, development of fluid and vascularity should be monitored for during follow-up.\n\n【20】   Serial monitoring with optical coherence tomography angiography could help in recognising early transition to malignant melanoma.\n\n【21】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【22】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【23】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Though these patients are asymptomatic, some of them can develop transient visual obscuration or visual field defects. ODD are known to progressively increase in size with age, which correlates with increased progression of visual field losses. Some of the complications associated with ODD are anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, retinal vascular occlusions, retinal haemorrhages and rarely, peripapillary CNVM. 2 Though there is no definitive treatment for ODD, it is important to differentiate it from true disc oedema and avoid any unnecessary neurological examinations.\n\n【12】CNVM associated with ODD is a very rare complication, but can cause significant visual impairment.

Serum thyroid function testing and haemoglobin A1c were normal, and systemic autoimmune and malignancy testing were negative.

Also known as Gordon’s phenomenon, 3 it was classically described as a finding in Huntington’s disease by Bing, 2 who observed that in some patients, the elevated foot may remain elevated for a few seconds because of repeated quadriceps contractions. 2 3 This sign has also been reported in Sydenham’s chorea 1 4 and more recently stiff-limb variant of stiff-person syndrome. 5 A similar phenomenon of delayed relaxation of reflexes occurs in hypothyroidism (myxedema reflex or Woltman’s sign), best demonstrated in the Achilles tendon. 6 In fact, it was Woltman—along with Moersch—who in 1956 published their seminal paper defining stiff-person syndrome and the characteristic ‘wooden-man’ appearance in 14 cases, the first of which was observed in 1928. 7 While neither diagnostic nor pathognomonic, the hung-up knee jerk is a simple clinical sign that may provide an important clue towards a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome, avoiding misdiagnosis of functional neurological disorder. 5\n\n【11】Stiff-person syndrome is rare, with an estimated prevalence of 1–2 per million. 8 Most cases are thought to be autoimmune, associated with high-titre GAD65 antibodies, often with concurrent thyroid disease or type 1 diabetes. 8 9 However, rare paraneoplastic cases have been described, often without GAD65 antibodies. 8 Inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated pathways leads to hyperexcitability manifesting as muscle spasms and rigidity. 8 9 Electromyography may characteristically show co-contraction of antagonistic muscles. 7 8 Symptoms are generally treated with benzodiazepines and in some cases immunotherapy 8 9 ; response to diazepam is often included in diagnostic criteria. 8\n\n【12】### Learning points\n\n【13】   Stiff-person syndrome is characterised by progressive muscle rigidity and spasms, often affecting the axial and lower limb muscles along with abdominal and thoracolumbar paraspinal muscles causing hyperlordosis.\n\n【14】   The hung-up knee jerk is demonstrated when there is delayed relaxation of the quadriceps femoris after eliciting the patellar tendon reflex and can be seen in stiff-person syndrome as well as Huntington’s disease and Sydenham’s chorea.\n\n【15】   While neither diagnostic nor pathognomonic, this simple clinical sign may be an important clue towards a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome and avoiding misdiagnosis of functional neurological disorder.\n\n【16】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【17】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【18】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Haemangiomas are more commonly found in children, and are termed vascular tumours. Presentation in the adult age group is highly unusual. Haemangiomas are classified as benign, locally aggressive and malignant lesions according to the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification. The patient typically describes the lesion as an indistinct mass that becomes larger or smaller with time. Deep-seated haemangiomas cannot be distinguished from malignant soft tissue tumours without imaging and histopathological studies. Different types of typical haemangiomas have been described, 1 which may demonstrate unique radiological manifestations; however, in many cases, the imaging characteristics are insufficient in reaching a diagnosis. Haemangiomas have a proliferation and then a degeneration phase. First, there is a rapid growth of endothelial cells that form syncytial masses with or without increased blood flow, and this phase is linked to high angiogenic factor levels such as vascular endothelial growth factors and basic fibroblast growth factors. This is followed by an end stage, also called the involution stage, in which complete sclerosis or hyalinisation of the haemangioma matrix occurs. 2 3 These sclerosed haemangiomas are mostly asymptomatic and often incidentally found. Radiological investigations play an important role in diagnosing haemangiomas, as these lesions have typical imaging features. On USG, these appear as hypoechoic lesions with or without vascular flow and as T1/T2-weighted iso/hyperintense lesions on MRI; however, rarely atypical morphologies might also be detected. 4 5 The process of sclerosis changes the radiological characteristics, making their diagnosis nearly impossible by using imaging characteristics only. This may warrant surgical/pathological correlation.\n\n【18】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【19】I was having this swelling in my hand for a long while, it was increasing in size and sometimes it was painful. I came to the hospital and doctors helped me a lot. They could not reach the exact diagnosis, however they operated on it very nicely and sent that excised swelling for testing and told me that it was some non-malignant lesion which gave me a big relief.\n\n【20】### Learning points\n\n【21】   Reduced fat and increased hyalinised material in atypical haemangiomas create diagnostic difficulties in ultrasonography, as this entity mimics nerve sheath tumours and other benign soft tissue neoplastic lesions.\n\n【22】   A sclerosing phenomenon is responsible for the change in the radiological appearance of soft tissue haemangioma, and this needs confirmation by histopathological examination.\n\n【23】   MRI is the choice of investigation for soft tissue lesions, as MRI has inherent high tissue contrast resolution properties. We highlight post-resection histopathological examination for sclerosing haemangiomas as they mimic other benign neoplasms.\n\n【24】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【25】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【26】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Although some mitotic activity is expected to be found in sebaceous glands’ cells, the transformation to sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is very rare. 1 SC accounts for 0.7% of skin malignancy, and it arises from the sebaceous glands’ adnexal epithelium. 2 3 SC was introduced as a separate entity for the first time in 1956 by Straatsma. 4 The pathogenesis of SC remains unexplained by previous studies; however, a few known associated risk factors, such as old age, have been reported; in fact, it has been referred to as a ‘malignancy of the elderly’. Other risk factors, such as exposure to radiation and immunosuppression, have also been described. 5 Additionally, any patient diagnosed with SC must be referred to exclude the possibility of a coexistent autosomal dominant skin condition, the Muir-Torre syndrome, which is characterised by sebaceous neoplasms and internal malignancies. 6 Patients with the Muir-Torre syndrome were reported to have a far less aggressive and earlier presentation of SCs when compared with the de novo SCs course. 7 In these cases, 75% of the SCs are usually found in the periocular area with only 25% diagnosed in an extraocular site at which they are mostly found in the skin of the head and neck or other areas with hair follicles. 8 Photodamage and associated DNA damage were hypothesised to be the reason behind such proclivity to the head and neck region in addition to the higher density of sebaceous glands in the head and neck. 9 The external auditory canal (EAC) extends from the concha laterally to the tympanic membrane medially, and this canal is divided into a cartilaginous outer one-third area and an inner bony two-thirds. Both are lined with stratified squamous epithelium, however, only the outer one-third contains dermal adnexa which can be the origin of sebaceous gland carcinoma. 10 The incidence of SC in the outer one-third of the EAC is considered extremely rare. A recent study reported that less than 15 cases of EAC sebaceous neoplasms are currently available in the literature. 11 However, a comprehensive review of the available literature revealed that only eight case reports of SC originating in the EAC are available, which emphasises the importance of having a high index of suspicion in such cases. This extremely rare carcinoma can lead to misdiagnosis of this condition as an inflammatory one, which can lead to delayed management and an increase in mortality.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A male patient in his late 70s who was a known case of hypertension and controlled with indapamide was seen at our facility. His medical history included a postspinal tumour that had been treated with surgery and radiation more than 40 years ago and had a residual left-sided hemiplegia. He presented to the otolaryngology clinic at Al-Hada Armed Forces Hospital having right ear pain and purulent discharge. His pain had started 6 months before presenting to the clinic and was constant and progressive since then. The pain was associated with a bilateral decrease in hearing for a long time. Local right ear examination revealed a right ear soft granular tissue mass occupying the right EAC mainly in the posterior wall of the canal with bleeding on touch. The right tympanic membrane could not be visualised. The first clinical impression was otitis externa after which a culture was taken from the discharge. The patient was managed with betamethasone and fucidin and given an appointment to assess the response to local medications. By the time of the follow-up appointment, the culture showed no growth; however, the patient did not improve, and right ear otalgia and the purulent discharge had increased in severity. An examination revealed an oedematous canal with pus and a non-visible tympanic membrane.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】A pure tone average test revealed right profound mixed hearing loss and left moderate to severe sensory neural hearing loss. The patient was admitted as a case of right ear mass for biopsy with middle ear exploration. A histological examination with routine H&E staining is demonstrated in figure 1 and shows lobules or sheets of cells separated by a fibrovascular stroma. Infiltrating edges in addition to sebaceous glands with variable degrees of differentiation and atypia were observed. A diagnoses of moderately differentiated SC was made. The patient underwent CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, but no evidence of distant metastases were found on these scans. Figure 2 shows a CT scan with bone window and MRI with intravenous contrast that revealed a large enhanced soft tissue mass occupying the cartilaginous and bony right EAC (epicentre in ECA). This mass produced destruction of the posterior wall of the EAC and invaded the mastoid air cells. Medially, the mass was inseparable from the tympanic membrane. Extension to the hypotympanum questionably involving the fascial recess, while the sinus tympani was spared. The ossicular chain was intact, and inner ear structures were unremarkable.\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【17】Resected mass tissue stained with H&E in different magnifications.

The features suggested an aggressive looking neoplastic mass (EAC malignancy resemble squamous cell carcinoma or other malignancy) rather than an infectious process.\n\n【24】Treatment\n---------\n\n【25】The patient underwent complete debulking of the right ear mass. Fragile eroded skin was observed. The mass originated mainly from the anterior meatal wall occupying all the EAC, it bleeds easily, and it caused widening of the EAC (‘funnelling’); however, intraoperatively the middle ear was spared, and the tympanic membrane and bones were intact. Frozen sections demonstrated clear margins, and histopathology confirmed the excision of moderately differentiated SC.

The patient had been free of recurrence after the radiation, but then he died of an unrelated pulmonary infection.\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】An SC is characterised by slow growth accompanied by a local aggressive and invasive nature. Patients are reported to present late with an advanced tumour and distant metastasis, and the time of presentation and diagnosis has been reported to be from 1–3 years. 12 Similar to our case, most patients who were diagnosed with an EAC SC reported that the onset of tolerable symptoms started years 13 or months before seeking medical attention. 11 Some patients mentioned a long history of chronic ear infection since childhood, 14 and one reported a previously excised sebaceous adenoma presenting 3 years later with malignancy. 15 The age of our elderly 78-year-old patient matched the established data concerning SC predilection in older ages. 16 The median age at diagnosis was 73, which was reported in more than a thousand patients. 17 In a smaller review of 29 Korean patients, the mean age of presentation was 69 years, and an additional interesting finding highlighted a peak in the occurrence of extraocular SC between 70 and 79 years. 7 Specific gender proclivity to developing SC has been previously suggested in which a 54% male predominance was reported 17 ; however, this finding contradicts many substantial published reports 2 16 18 among the systematic review of EAC SC cases ( table 1 ).\n\n【34】View this table:\n\n【35】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【36】Table 1\n\n【37】A systematic review of EAC SC cases published to date.\n\n【38】Female predominance was observed. Our patient had a history of cervical spinal radiation due to a cervical tumour that had occurred 45 years ago. According to the existing body of literature, exposure to radiation is a well-known risk factor. Over 1000 通用删除7(英):<u>(1349)</u> cases of SC in various sites over a period of 31 years were reviewed by Dasgupta et al in which they revealed that 74 (5.4%) of all patients had a history of treatment with radiation treatment. 17 The first report of radiation-induced SC was suggested as a possible risk factor was in 1970 by Martin et al . 19 Multiple reports of SC in areas in which radiation was used to treat other conditions was previously reported. 20 21 Interestingly, diuretic use was also reported as a possible risk factor . 22 A more recent meta-analysis suggested that diuretics, thiazides specifically, are associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. 23 Our patient was taking indapamide to control his blood pressure for a long unspecified period. Indapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic 24 and is considered a photosensitising diuretic that has been found to be associated with skin cancer. These photosensitising diuretics are known to increase the skin cancer risk, especially at chronically sun-exposed areas. 25 However, the EAC is not a sun-exposed site; hence, no clear association between the long history of indapamide use in our patient and his SC diagnosis was found. Additionally, no high-quality evidence linking specific thiazide diuretic use to an increase in the risk of SC is available, which could be attributed to its rarity. Figure 4 summarises all possible risk factors for the development of EAC SC in the current case. Other important risk factors include immunosuppression, genetic factors, such as Muir-Torre Syndrome and p53 and LEF 1 mutations, and pre-existing sebaceous lesions. 5 Without histopathological identification, a wide range of lesions and neoplasms could be suspected. These lesions include benign lesions, such as cholesteatoma (which were excluded by the radiological findings in our case), sebaceoma, adenoma and sebaceous hyperplasia. Malignant ones, such as basal cell carcinoma or ceruminous gland tumours. 26 Differential diagnosis include benign lesions, such as pyogenic granuloma or malignant ones, such as squamous and basal cell carcinomas. 9 Grossly, some of the patients with EAC SC presented with a mass that is fleshy or bleeds on touch 8 15 similar to our presented case. Others reported a painless mass protruding from the EAC. 11 22 Preocular SCs are usually yellow in colour due to their lipid content. 5 An interesting finding among patients with EAC SCs is the proclivity to affect the right ear in particular ( table 1 ). All reported cases occurred in the right ear except for one case. No explanation for this finding has been found yet. The diagnosis of SC is challenging, and a histopathological analysis is needed to achieve an accurate diagnosis and to differentiate mimicking conditions, including benign sebaceous neoplasms tumours and basal cell carcinomas. H&E staining of SC reveals a lobular architecture, foamy cytoplasmic vacuolisation if the tumour is well-differentiated, nuclear pleomorphism and high mitotic activity. 1 SC can resemble either basal or squamous cell carcinoma; hence, immunohistochemical staining can aid in distinguishing SCs from other skin malignancies, such as basal or squamous cell carcinoma or malignant melanoma. Our case’s tissue staining was positive for epithelial membrane antigen, a finding that is consistent with Ansai et al 27 ; however, this type of staining is also positive in cases of squamous cell carcinoma. Cytokeratin 7 (CK-7) was also positive; however, it was reported to be positive in some basal and squamous cell carcinoma cases. 28 Similar to other reported cases of SC, 9 29 our patient also showed negative S100 protein staining differentiating it from other skin malignancies. Cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6) was reported to be positive in three out of five ocular SCs 30 indeed, it was also positive in our case. Cytokeratin 19 shows focal positivity with sebaceous tumours and strong positivity with basal cell carcinomas thus facilitating their distinction. 31 Other high and low-molecular-weight cytokeratins, respectively have also been used to distinguish SCs from squamous or basal cell carcinomas. 32 Surgical excision with wide local excision is the cornerstone of SC treatment regardless of its site. 7 9 Surprisingly, lymph node metastasis was reported to affect only 1.3% based on a large database study, and only 23 patients out of 1349 (1.7%) needed regional lymph node sampling or dissection. 17 To date, no consensuses on the use of postoperative radiotherapy can be found; however, based on tumour extension and metastasis, such radiotherapy might be indicated. 33 Available data suggest that combining both surgical and radiological methods can aid in lowering the reoccurrence rate. 34 Prognosis after SC excision has been linked to a high risk of recurrence. 2 Thus, long-term follow-up is warranted since distant metastasis have been reported 11 years after the initial diagnosis. 35\n\n【39】<img/>\n\n【40】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【41】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4</u>\n\n【42】All possible risk factors for external auditory canal (EAC) sebaceous carcinoma that our patient presented with (drawn by SAS).\n\n【43】### Learning points\n\n【44】   Sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is a rare skin malignancy and is usually present in the periocular area.

To the best of our knowledge, osteonecrosis of the knee as a part of long COVID-19 syndrome has not been documented. Corticosteroids are being used extensively in moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. We report two cases who developed osteonecrosis of the knee after being treated for COVID-19 infection. In our case series, the mean cumulative dose of prednisolone was 1156.5 mg (900–1413 mg), which is less than the cumulative dose reported in literature for osteonecrosis of the knee. In our case series, the patients developed symptomatic osteonecrosis at a mean interval of 73 days after initiation of steroid therapy, with the earliest presenting at 25 days. Early diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the knee on high clinical suspicion by MRI would help in early intervention with bisphosphonate therapy.\n\n【2】   COVID-19\n   Orthopaedics\n   Drugs: musculoskeletal and joint diseases\n\n【3】http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-248583\n\n【4】Statistics from Altmetric.com\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】   COVID-19\n   Orthopaedics\n   Drugs: musculoskeletal and joint diseases\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Increasing evidence suggests that COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems such as respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal systems as a part of ‘long COVID-19’ syndrome. Long-COVID-19 syndrome is a term used to describe the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection, including ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 infection (from 4 weeks to 12 weeks) and post-COVID-19 syndrome (≥12 weeks) after the onset of COVID-19 infection. 1 Symptoms of long-COVID include fatigue, palpitations, chest tightness, cognitive impairment or ‘brain fog’, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, diarrhoea, joint and muscle pains, tinnitus, skin rashes, etc. 2 Given the short history of the pandemic, the long-term complications of COVID-19 infection are yet to be studied.\n\n【8】Even though many drugs have been tried to treat COVID-19 infection, corticosteroids have been proven to be life-saving. However, corticosteroids have been shown to be a predisposing factor for developing avascular necrosis (AVN). 3 A resurgence in AVN cases following COVID-19 infection is likely due to the rampant use of corticosteroids. 4 AVN of the femoral head has been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection treated with corticosteroids. 5 However, osteonecrosis of the knee following COVID-19 infection has not been reported previously in the literature. An early diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the knee is important to prevent subsequent arthritis and the need for surgery. If diagnosed in the early stages, osteonecrosis of the knee responds well to bisphosphonate therapy. 6\n\n【9】Here we report two cases of symptomatic osteonecrosis of the knee as part of the long-term complications of COVID-19 infection. This is the first case series of knee osteonecrosis reported worldwide as part of long COVID-19 syndrome.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】### Case 1\n\n【12】A woman in her 20s with no medical comorbidities was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and managed at home. The patient was treated with oral methylprednisolone 16 mg three times a day for 15 days (cumulative steroid dose equivalent to 900 mg of prednisolone). She developed pain in both knees 25 days after diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, which did not settle on conservative management. On suspicion, an MRI of both knees was done, which confirmed bilateral osteonecrosis of femoral condyles and patella . The patient was started on oral alendronate 70 mg/week in two divided doses along with a single dose of intravenous zoledronic acid 5 mg. This was supplemented with calcium, vitamin D and anti-inflammatory medications. On follow-up at 3 months, Pain Visual Analogue Score reduced from 8 to 2, and the patient was comfortable with no progression of the osteonecrosis on follow-up radiographs. The patient was able to resume her routine activities comfortably.\n\n【13】<img/>\n\n【14】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【16】MRI of a female patient in her 20s confirming osteonecrosis of both condyles and patella: (A,B) left knee and (C,D) right knee.\n\n【17】### Case 2\n\n【18】A male patient in his late teens presented to us with complaints of pain in the right knee and both hips.

The interval between initiation of corticosteroid therapy and development of symptomatic osteonecrosis was 25 days in the first case and 4 months in the second case, with a mean duration of 73 days. Both patients were started on oral alendronate 70 mg/week in two divided doses along with a single dose of intravenous zoledronic acid 5 mg. Both patients were clinically better on follow-up at 3 months with no progression of osteonecrosis on radiographs.\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】Osteonecrosis most frequently affects the hips, followed by the knee. 7 Osteonecrosis of the knee was first described by Ahlbäck et al in 1968 8 and can be classified as 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (also called primary osteonecrosis) usually affects the elderly population and single condyle; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> secondary osteonecrosis (also called atraumatic osteonecrosis) usually affects younger individuals and both condyles; it is usually associated with corticosteroid use, renal disease, haematological disorders, etc; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> post-arthroscopy usually affects a single condyle. 9\n\n【27】Multiple classes of drugs have been studied for the management of moderate and severe COVID-19 infection. Among those, corticosteroids have been found to be life-saving in severe cases of COVID-19 infection. 10 However, they are also known to be an independent risk factor for the development of osteonecrosis. The pathogenesis of osteonecrosis is not entirely understood but is believed to be multifactorial. Vascular occlusion, fat cell hypertrophy, fat emboli, hypercoagulability and vascular endothelial dysfunction are some of the mechanisms postulated in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis. 11 It is postulated that hypercoagulability, leucocyte aggregation and endothelial dysfunction, in addition to the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 infection, can contribute to the development of osteonecrosis. 12\n\n【28】Studies have shown that cumulative doses of steroids may be an important factor for osteonecrosis. 13 However, there is no consensus regarding the exact dosage and duration of steroid usage, which can lead to the development of osteonecrosis. A review of literature showed reports of osteonecrosis of the knee with cumulative doses ranging from 1012 mg to 6562 mg of prednisolone. 3 14–16 In our patients, the cumulative dose ranged from 900 mg to 1413 mg of prednisolone with a mean dose of 1156.5 mg.\n\n【29】After initiation of corticosteroid therapy, osteonecrosis can develop as early as within 1 year. 13 Oinuma et al , in their case series, showed that osteonecrosis of the hips and the knee could be detected in 44% of patients with systemic lupus erythematous at an average of 3.1 months from corticosteroid therapy use. 17 However, rare cases have been reported even within 1 month of initiation of corticosteroid therapy, as reported by Yildiz et al in a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. 18 In the cases we report here, one of the patients developed symptomatic osteonecrosis of the knee very early (25 days after initiation of corticosteroid therapy) with an average onset at 73 days.\n\n【30】In our case series, one patient with knee osteonecrosis had concomitant AVN of the hips. Patients with osteonecrosis of the hip often present with referred pain in the thigh and knee owing to the sensory distribution of the obturator and femoral nerves. 19 Therefore, a thorough clinical examination of the knee joint with high suspicion for the possibility of concomitant osteonecrosis of the knee is necessary for diagnosis and intervention.\n\n【31】The primary objective for treating osteonecrosis of the knee is to address pain, slow the disease progression and prevent bone collapse and joint arthritis. Multiple treatment options exist in the form of conservative, medical and surgical management; however, no standard therapeutic management protocols exist. 20 Arthroplasty remains the mainstay of treatment of osteonecrosis once arthritis sets in. Agarwala et al showed that osteonecrosis of the knee responds well to medical management with combination bisphosphonate therapy in the early stages, but it is imperative to diagnose and intervene early. 6 The protocol followed by the author was a single intravenous dose of 5 mg of zoledronic acid with 70 mg oral alendronate weekly divided into two doses. Jureus et al showed good outcome in 59% of patients with knee osteonecrosis treated with oral bisphosphonates in their study. 21 Kraenzlin et al in their case series showed that patients treated with combination bisphosphonate therapy (intravenous pamidronate and oral alendronate) had rapid improvement in pain score and radiological consolidation of the area of osteonecrosis. 22 Sixty-seven per cent of patients in their series showed complete resolution of bone marrow oedema in follow-up MRI at 2–3 months. Bisphosphonate therapy is now considered a standard option for the treatment of osteonecrosis with good clinical outcomes. 23 Our patients were started on bisphosphonate combination therapy with good clinical response.\n\n【32】### Learning points\n\n【33】   Corticosteroids have been proven to be life-saving in the present COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【34】   Patients seem to be more susceptible to osteonecrosis following COVID-19 infection, as witnessed by an increased incidence, at a lower dose of corticosteroids and early onset of symptomatic osteonecrosis.\n\n【35】   In the early stages, osteonecrosis of the knee responds well to bisphosphonate therapy.\n\n【36】   Early diagnosis by MRI on clinical suspicion would help in early intervention with bisphosphonate therapy in patients with knee joint complaints following COVID-19 infection.\n\n【37】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【38】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【39】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

On inspection, the area of discomfort was localised in the region of teeth #36 and #37. There was mild erythema and swelling in the region. There was no facial swelling, cervical lymphadenopathy or trismus on physical examination. Intra-oral examination did not reveal tenderness, pus discharge, bleeding or any other secondary symptoms. A composite restoration was noticed on tooth #37. The patient had a history of surgical removal of tooth #38 6 months prior. Panoramic radiograph did not show any significant findings. The patient was advised to maintain good oral hygiene and gargle with saltwater three times per day for 2 weeks. A review was scheduled after 2 weeks during which the patient did not report any change in the symptoms.

One report found only two primary tracheal tumours detected in 9000 autopsy cases. 1 Pleomorphic carcinoma, a subtype of sarcomatoid carcinoma, is rare in any organ. To date, only three cases of sarcomatoid carcinoma in the trachea have been reported. 2–4 Epithelial–mesenchymaltransition (EMT) is related to metastasis and resistance to therapy. 5 Generally, surgical resection is considered useful for tracheal tumours. We searched the literature, but did not find any cases of a primary tracheal tumour developing after CRT for a head and neck tumour. We report a case of rare primary tracheal tumour related to EMT.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 66-year-old male patient received chemoradiotherapy (CRT) (intensity modulated radiation therapy: IMRT, 66 Gy/33Fr, and docetaxel) for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx 2 years before this event. He was a former smoker with a history of two cerebral haemorrhages. He developed dyspnoea and wheezing lasting about a month, and visited a local otolaryngologist. His vital signs were normal. On auscultation, wheezing was heard. The doctor suspected bronchial asthma, and performed blood tests and a CT scan to exclude other diseases. Blood tests showed no significant abnormal findings, including tumour markers. The CT scan showed a tumour causing narrowing of the trachea, so the doctor consulted a respiratory physician in the same facility. The situation was considered life-threatening and the patient was intubated using a bronchoscope and placed on a mechanical ventilator. The tumour obstructing the trachea was identified using a bronchoscope . The large tumour had a stalk and bled easily. The next day, the patient became feverish and developed hypoxaemia. Bilateral consolidations of the base of the lungs were observed by chest X-ray. Blood tests showed elevated inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein. The patient was diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and antibiotic treatment by intravenous drip of tazobactam/piperacillin 13.5 g/day was initiated. Four days later, the patient was sent to our hospital for intensive treatment for VAP and treatment of the tracheal tumour.\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【15】Bronchoscopic findings of the tracheal tumour.

We initially considered the tumour as a metastasis of laryngeal cancer previously treated, but the location was near the second tracheal cartilage and different from location of the first malignancy. A week later, the truncated part of tracheal tumour had obstructed the tracheal tube, compromising his breathing. We exchanged the tube and submitted the tissue truncated in the tube to a pathologist. We considered the part of tumour was accidentally resected by tracheal tube sliding. Histopathological findings (H&E staining) of the tumour showed both an epithelial and a spindle cell component (mesenchymal component) in the same specimen . In immunohistochemical staining, the epithelial component stained epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, and the mesenchymal component stained mesenchymal markers such as Zeb-1 and Twist. In the part of the epithelial component in contact with the mesenchymal component, the transitional component was observed. In the mesenchymal component (spindle cell component), E-cadherin was negative, and Zeb-1, Twist and Snail/Slug were positive, so EMT was suspected . Expression of Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation, was similar in both component.

Pathological findings showing the epithelial and spindle cell components were decisive in diagnosis. The spindle cell component was greater than 10%, and from this result we diagnosed the tumour as pleomorphic carcinoma, a subtype of sarcomatoid carcinoma.\n\n【36】Treatment\n---------\n\n【37】We continued antibiotic treatment for VAP and performed a tracheostomy 10 days after re-intubation. The tumour was located near the second tracheal cartilage and we made a tracheotomy at the third tracheal cartilage to avoid the tumour. We considered bronchoscopic resection for remaining tracheal tumour, but decided not to do it because the tumour was prone to bleeding and the stem was too large and we understand that bronchoscopic resection of tracheal tumour is at high risk and is generally performed only in the operating room under general anaesthesia for patients in good general condition. Although we considered the option of complete resection of the tumour, we chose RT through the tumour board meeting because surgery after CRT for laryngeal cancer would have entailed an increased risk of complications including necrosis and rupture of previously irradiated structures. RT (IMRT, 60 Gy/30Fr) was performed and avoided damage of normal tissues around the tumour as much as possible.\n\n【38】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【39】Two months have passed since he received RT and the patient is alive. However, we cannot yet evaluate the outcome of treatment because there was no evaluable lesion. In the future, we will evaluate the outcome based on recurrence and metastasis of the tumour, and survival.\n\n【40】Discussion\n----------\n\n【41】Tracheal tumours cause varying degrees of dyspnoea depending on tumour size, and are often misdiagnosed as bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 6 In this case, because the patient received CRT for laryngeal cancer 2 years before this episode, we suspected a metastatic tumour originating from laryngeal cancer. However, the pathological type of the tracheal tumour was different from that of the previous laryngeal cancer. The tracheal tumour was diagnosed as pleomorphic carcinoma, a subtype of sarcomatoid carcinoma. Furthermore, tracheal metastasis of laryngeal cancer is extremely rare, and metastatic tracheal tumours generally originate from breast cancer, colorectal cancer or renal cancer. 7 Histopathological findings in this case demonstrated the transitional component (the epithelial and mesenchymal component), and we concluded that EMT had developed in this tumour. EMT has been studied extensively relating to mechanisms of cancer metastasis and recurrence. 8 9 At the transcriptional level, E-cadherin is repressed by a number of E-cadherin transcriptional repressors (EcTRs), including Zeb-1, Zeb-2, Snail/Slug, E12/E47 and Twist. Expression of these EcTRs in tumour epithelial cells is inversely correlated with E-cadherin expression and associated with increased invasiveness/metastasis and poorer clinical prognosis. 10 The expression of EcTRs results in repression of the epithelial phenotype and promotion of EMT. 11 EcTRs are present in mesenchyme and repress transcription of E-cadherin and induce to mesenchymal feature. One report studied the relationship between sarcomatoid carcinoma and EMT, and this case showed one of the typical patterns of EMT. 12 However, no study has found a relationship between tracheal sarcomatoid carcinoma and EMT. It has been reported that sarcomas were seen in just 3.8% of tracheal tumours. 13 Only three cases of tracheal sarcomatoid carcinoma have been reported. 2–4 The higher value of Ki-67, the more the cell proliferation and tumour invasion ability. In this case, 22.4% of Ki-67 expression in epithelial component and 24.0% in spindle cell component were low compared with median 62% (range, 20% to 87%) expression in pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma of 17 patients reported in Japan. 14 Pleomorphic carcinoma is a subtype of sarcomatoid carcinoma, and is defined as an epithelial tumour including more than 10% spindle and/or giant cells. 15 This case was compatible with the characteristics of pleomorphic carcinoma. Several reports identify complete resection as the first choice for treatment of primary tracheal tumours. 16 However, as the patient had undergone CRT for laryngeal cancer, we considered surgical resection to have a higher risk of complications including necrosis of the trachea and ruptured suture. We thus selected RT for this patient. However, the effect of RT can be considered to be limited. The Netherlands Cancer Registry reports median survival of 91 months in cases of resection without RT, 82 months in cases of resection with RT, 11 months for patients who underwent only RT and 3 months for patients who did not receive either therapy. 17 We should note that this result included cases of palliative RT, but it is clear that RT is inferior to resection. We should consider other treatment options for unresectable tracheal tumours, and we need to follow-up this case carefully.\n\n【42】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【43】I only remember the moment before I was connected to the ventilator. I will do what I can to ensure the success of my treatment and rehabilitation.\n\n【44】### Learning points\n\n【45】   We should consider tracheal tumour as a differential diagnosis in patients with symptoms such as shortness of breath and wheezing similar to bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n【46】   We should add tracheal tumours in the list of differential diagnosis in post-irradiated cases with tumour of larynx, hypopharynx, and supraglottic region.\n\n【47】   We should treat cases of such difficult malignant tumour with specialists through tumour board meeting.\n\n【48】   There have been few reports of primary tracheal tumours related to epithelial–mesenchymaltransition, and we need to investigate further.\n\n【49】   We need to develop effective treatments for tracheal tumours that are difficult to resect.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

At the 6-week follow-up, he remained well and was symptom free.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】Congenital midgut malrotation can be undiagnosed until adulthood. Some patients may present acutely with a mid-gut volvulus, whereas others might present with a vague chronic abdominal pain due to intermittent volvulus and internal herniation. In our case report, the most challenging area was the diagnosis.\n\n【28】CT scan (with oral and intravenous contrast) is the best non-invasive diagnostic modality to diagnose malrotation. It allows the visualisation of the position of the duodenojejunal flexure in relation to the midline. The normal anatomical location of the duodenojejunal flexure is left to the midline. If it is found to be positioned right to the midline, then this is a diagnostic sign of malrotation . The CT will also show the position of the ascending colon, which is usually very mobile in patients with malrotation and lies in the left side of the abdomen. This excessive mobility of the colon puts it at risk of volvulus. CT scan could also be used in acute presentations as it is good to diagnose complications, which could arise in patients with malrotation (eg, small bowel internal hernias and colonic volvulus).\n\n【29】In this case, intraoperative inspection confirmed the site of the duodenojejunal flexure right to the midline . It also showed the ascending colon being very mobile and positioned to the left of the midline . Once the duodenojejunal junction was reduced back to its position, we closed the mesenteric defects to prevent the small bowel herniating through these windows postoperatively .\n\n【30】It is important to note here that the position of the appendix in patients with malrotation could be in the left of the abdomen. Hence, the clinical picture of appendicitis could be misleading as the symptoms will present in the left abdomen rather than the usual right iliac fossa.\n\n【31】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【32】Before the surgery, I had abdominal pain and lots of noises coming from my belly.\n\n【33】I did not have any problems during my recovering, I just had back pain due to the amount of time I stayed in bed, but it has gone since I come back to my normal activities.\n\n【34】The experience at the hospital was good, the way the doctor and nurses took care of me during my stay at the hospital was great.\n\n【35】### Learning points\n\n【36】   Adult presentation of intestinal malrotation should be considered in the differential diagnoses of patients presenting with vague and non-specific colicky abdominal pain.\n\n【37】   Abdominal CT imaging is the gold standard for diagnosing intestinal malrotation.\n\n【38】   Patients should be offered surgery especially if symptomatic to avoid acute complications such as bowel volvulus and ischaemia.\n\n【39】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【40】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【41】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The majority of cases of awareness during general anaesthesia occur when neuromuscular blocking agents are used (1: 8200 with neuromuscular blocking agents vs 1: 135 900 without). 3\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】We describe the case of a 42-year-old man (75 kg, 177 cm), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) II for smoking (20 pack-years) as the only history. He presented to the emergency department due to headache and one episode of vomiting. Headache initially was relieved by simple analgesia which subsequently became resistant to therapy. CT angiography demonstrated right intraventricular haemorrhage without a clear source of bleeding. MRI found a stable right thalamic haematoma probably originating from a leaking arterial-venous malformation. A cerebral arteriography performed the next day concluded that the haematoma probably originated from a branch of the right posterior cerebral artery. The neurologically asymptomatic patient was scheduled for an elective embolisation of the arterial-venous malformation under general anaesthesia 1 week later. The patient was fasted for at least 6 hours before anaesthesia and received no premedication. Standard monitoring included a three‐lead ECG, non‐invasive blood pressure, end‐tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide and peripheral pulse oximetry. To monitor the depth of anaesthesia, we used the SedLine Brain Function Monitor (Masimo). The bilateral SedLine electroencephalogram (EEG) Sensor was installed on the patient’s front . The front electrodes were not visible on the operator’s X-ray screen  and did not disturb at any moment the operator during the procedure. The cable of the sensor was conducted posteriorly with respect to the patient’s head and kept out the field of the radiological image . Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with a target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol (Orchestra Base Primea, Fresenius Kabi) using the pharmacokinetic model of Schnider et al . 4 Analgesia was assured with intermittent boluses of sufentanil 0.2 µg/kg. The lungs were normoventilated (end‐tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 4.6–6.0 kPa) with 50% oxygen–air mixture. Neuromuscular block was induced with rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg and maintained with intermittent boluses of 0.2–0.3 mg/kg to obtain a deep neuromuscular block (post tetanic count of 2) measured with acceleromyography on the patients left thumb (IntelliVue NMT Module, Philips). After intubation an invasive arterial line was placed in the right radial artery. We used the Patient State Index (PSI) of the SedLine Brain Function Monitor to titrate the depth of anaesthesia targeting a PSI between 25 and 50. 5 Relatively low calculated doses of propofol were necessary to maintain a stable depth of anaesthesia, with calculated effect-site concentrations of about 2.6 µg/mL  and a PSI of about 27 . The neuroradiological intervention was uneventful but was ended after 2 hours without embolisation of the arteriovenous malformation as no source vessel could be identified. The target-controlled perfusion of propofol was stopped (local time 13:30, total perfusion time 2 hours and 18 min, total propofol dose 1043 mg) and 2 min later (local time 13:32) the patient received sugammadex intravenously (4 mg/kg) to reverse deep neuromuscular block with a train of four count of 0 (post-tetanic count was not done before reversal). Very rapidly thereafter without any stimulation the patient aroused from anaesthesia (local time 13:33) ( video 2 ). The patient was extubated 4 min after the injection of sugammadex with a propofol effect site concentration of 2.0 µg/mL  and a train of four ratio of 100%. After extubation (13:37) the patient displayed eye opening but had difficulty responding to questions ( video 3 ). During stable anaesthesia, the raw EEG showed a very slow and depressed brain activity with zero EMG activity and spectral edge frequencies (the frequency below which 95 precent of the total electroencephalogram power is located) of around 10 Hz for both hemispheres and a PSI around 27. The event of immediate arousal from anaesthesia was followed by a very steep increase in the PSI index (up to 80 and more) with an EMG activity of 80% and a spectral edge frequency of about 17 Hz . Spectrogram analysis showed a monotonous content in the delta range in the first part followed by a complex and increasing electrical brain activity. The white bars indicate background artefacts due to movement.\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【15】The RD SedLine EEG Sensor installed on the patient’s forehead.

After 6 days of an uneventful hospital stay, he returned home without any neurological deficit. Five months later, the arteriovenous malformation was treated successfully with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. The patient received regular postoperative follow-up which was uneventful.\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】In this case report, we describe a case of rapid arousal form anaesthesia after the reversal of deep rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block with sugammadex despite still significant calculated doses of propofol at the effect site. Signs of light anaesthesia have been reported after sugammadex administration in several dose-finding studies. 6 7 Chazot et al reported a case who immediately awoke after sugammadex administration in absence of any stimulation with still adequate anaesthesia under propofol and remifentanil. 8 In this patient brain function monitoring was done with Bispectral Index (BIS) (BIS; Aspect Medical System, Norwood, Massachusetts, USA) and Neurosense (Neurowave System, Cleveland, Ohio, USA). In 2020, a randomised clinical trial by Le Guen et al in 51 patients showed that despite constant perfusion with propofol and remifentanil, sugammadex causes signs of awakening in the absence of documented post-operative awareness. 9 The BIS monitor was used to monitor anaesthetic depth. Sugammadex is reported in the literature to have a very low affinity for other molecules such as propofol. 7 8 Consequently its direct interference with the depth of anaesthesia (in terms of displacement of the hypnotic agent) is considered to be clinically irrelevant. The case presented here differs from the previous ones in that the Sedline Brain function Monitor Masimo was used. This monitor produces a parameter called PSI derived from a proprietary algorithm by processing a high-resolution four-channel EEG with advanced artefact filters. 10 The PSI has been clinically validated to measure the depth of anaesthesia and sedation. 11 12 The calculation of the PSI takes about 2 min. It uses parallel signal processing engines to extract a clearer EEG signal for computing PSI. It is thus less influenced by artefacts arising from neuromuscular blockade which limit other monitoring techniques as previously demonstrated by Schuller et al . 13 In particular, the BIS has been shown to be highly influenced by peripheral electromyography which contributes considerably to the diagnosis of high BIS, and is particularly essential for determining BIS >80. 14 The bilateral Masimo Sedline electrodes are radiolucent and were not disturbing during the neuroradiological procedure. The patient underwent 2 hours of general anaesthesia using a Propofol TCI according to the pharmacokinetic model of Schnider et al , 4 with a calculated effect site concentration of about 2.6 µg/mL. The patient was kept under deep neuromuscular block (post-tetanic count 2) due to the inherent safety requirements of the neuroradiological intervention. The lecture of the PSI, the interpretation of the bilateral raw EEG and the density spectral array (DSA), allowed us to titrate the anaesthetic drugs to the minimum dosages for effective and safe hypnosis. Intracerebral pathologies might give asymmetric BIS values, but the thresholds at which the extent and type of intracranial pathologies affect BIS are largely unknown. 15 16 This should be kept in mind using brain function monitoring in neuroradiological interventions. Our patient had a normal neurological examination before the procedure and the intracerebral bleeding had happened 1 week before the intervention. There was no asymmetry in the DSA. We might, therefore, believe that the calculated PSI correctly reflected anaesthetic depth in this patient. At the end of the procedure, only 2 min after having stopped the propofol perfusion the patient emerged very rapidly and unexpectedly after the administration of sugammadex at a dose of 4 mg/kg. This immediate awakening was documented by Masimo Sedline monitoring. Postmedication excluded signs and symptoms suggestive of awareness. TCI are used routinely to simplify the administration of intravenous drugs during general anaesthesia and to increase its precision but there are large variations in measured serum concentrations. 17 One might argue that anaesthetic depth of the patient was already very superficial at the moment we stopped the propofol perfusion, and that the indicated effect site concentrations are calculated and not measured values, but this would have been reflected in a higher PSI value which was about 27 at this moment and which indicated adequate anaesthesia. It is very improbably that the 2 min interruption of the propofol perfusion induced this very rapid arousal (about 2% of total propofol perfusion time). We believe that the observed effect of sugammadex is indirect and might be mainly explained by the afferentation theory. The latter was first described by Lanier et al on a sample of dogs 18 and later taken up by Vasella et al . 19 The afferentation theory predicts that stimulation of the neuromuscular spindles will produce cerebral stimulation. Cortical activity has therefore a peripheral component deriving from muscular proprioceptive afferences. Neuromuscular block would lead to a ‘peripheral silence’ which sugammadex could interrupt. Compared with previous reports, we used a neuromonitoring method that does not depend on peripheral electromyography, which, therefore, allows us to study more precisely the changes in cortical activity which were observed after the administration of Sugammadex.\n\n【47】In conclusion, this case illustrates the possibility of unexpectedly rapid emergence from effect site-targeted propofol anaesthesia on reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex. A potential explanation behind this phenomenon could be the sugammadex-induced indirect increase of central stimulation via the reactivation of ascending central pathways originating from neuromuscular spindles. These observations argue for the need of further research between the interaction of neuromuscular blockade and depth of anaesthesia.\n\n【48】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【49】Here there are some words about my experience under general anaesthesia: ‘I fell asleep very easily, without stress, but I was scared of awakening with nausea. When I woke up, it was as if nothing had happened. I woke up very well. I also vividly remember well what we had talked about just before I fell asleep and especially an awakening without nausea and without having the “head among the clouds‘ (Translated from French)\n\n【50】### Learning points\n\n【51】   Reversal of rocuronium induced neuromuscular block with Sugammadex may induce rapid arousal from anaesthesia.\n\n【52】   This rapid arousal might be explained by the afferentation theory.\n\n【53】   Brain function monitoring to avoid awareness and titrate depth of anaesthesia could be of utmost importance in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents.\n\n【54】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【55】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【56】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Labs revealed a haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 9.1% and a random blood glucose of 200 mg/dL, consistent with new-onset diabetes mellitus. Nasopharyngeal COVID-19 PCR test returned positive. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral attenuation of the kidneys and air in the bladder, which was confirmed by pelvic ultrasound. Gas subsequently resolved 2 days later after treatment with antibiotics, and a diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made. Emphysematous cystitis in the paediatric population is an extremely rare condition with four cases reported in the literature. Furthermore, there has been a reported association between COVID-19, cystitis and non-typical course of urinary symptoms.

The most commonly affected patients are elderly, immunocompromised women. Diagnosis is usually confirmed through imaging. 2\n\n【8】The exact pathogenesis is poorly understood. A glucose-rich environment may contribute to gas-producing microbe proliferation. 3 In addition, there is typically impaired transportation of the formed gas due to either anatomical obstructions or to local inflammation. 4 Furthermore, the literature suggests a relationship between COVID-19 and cystitis, but the mechanism remains unclear, ranging from COVID-19-induced cytokine production to ACE2 receptor interactions in the bladder and kidneys. 5 6 This reported COVID-19-associated cystitis may be complicated by urinary tract infections and other comorbidities that exacerbate inflammation and infection. 6\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A 15-year-old female adolescent with a medical history of urinary tract infections, left ureteral reflux and a family history of type 1 diabetes initially presented to urgent care for right flank pain. She reported diffuse abdominal pain for about 1 month with worsening pain, radiation to the right flank, nausea and vomiting. She denied pneumaturia. Patient denied other symptoms and was afebrile. Physical exam revealed significant right costovertebral angle tenderness.\n\n【11】Her left ureteral reflux was diagnosed at 5 years of age and was grade 1. The patient also has a history of smoke exposure and a lack of toilet paper at her step-parent’s home, for which she has had to drip-dry. She had multiple prior urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the past according to her mom. Following some lifestyle changes, the patient’s UTIs had resolved until this event.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】The patient was afebrile at the time of presentation and remained afebrile during the entire hospitalisation despite other evidence of significant systemic inflammation including a C-reactive protein of 22.4 mg/dL and a white blood cell count of 17 400/mcL with 74% neutrophils. Blood culture and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) were not obtained. Urinalysis showed pyuria, haematuria, bacteriuria, leucocyte esterase, nitrites, 3+ketones and 3+glucose. A routine COVID-19 test through nasopharyngeal swab came back positive. Point of care glucose and an HbA1c were also 200 mg/dL and 9.1%, respectively. A venous blood gas revealed pH 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in venous blood (PVCO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 36 mm Hg, partial pressure of oxygen in venous blood (PVO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 72 mm Hg, bicarbonate 18.5 mmol/L, CO <sub>2 </sub> 20 mmol/L and a base deficit of −6.9. Serum ketones were negative. CT scans showed gas-forming cystitis  along with bilateral attenuation suggestive of pyelonephritis.

In addition, blood glucose findings, the HbA1c of 9.1%, and positive urine glucose and ketones indicated new-onset diabetes mellitus with a state of diabetic ketoacidosis. The CT scan revealed mottled areas of increased radiolucency and a small area of complete radiolucency with an air–fluid level enclosed by the bladder wall, confirming free air within the bladder. No intraluminal air was identified (commonly described as a cobblestone or ‘beaded necklace’ appearance). 7 8\n\n【28】The differential for emphysematous cystitis includes reflux air from a renal abscess, enterorenal fistula formation, retroperitoneal perforation, psoas abscess, or urological or radiological interventions such as catheter insertion. 9 However, this patient lacked any history of trauma, medical interventions such as nephrostomy or foley insertion, and imaging did not reveal abscesses elsewhere. Characteristic imaging findings of emphysematous cystitis are air within the bladder lumen and/or wall. 2 10 While most cases involve gas within the bladder wall, not all cases include said imaging findings. Some studies suggest radiographic findings present 50%–85% of the time. 10–12 Given the patient’s signature risk factors such as smoke exposure and prior history of grade 1 vesicoureteral reflux, new-onset diabetes mellitus, history and imaging findings, a diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made. Urine culture was as expected with E. coli . 1 In addition, the concurrent COVID-19 positivity provides another point of interest.\n\n【29】Treatment\n---------\n\n【30】Whereas uncomplicated cystitis can be managed with a short course of oral antibiotic in the outpatient setting, current guidelines recommend parenteral antibiotics for emphysematous cystitis, usually an empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic such as ceftriaxone. 2 Emphysematous urinary tract infections are often associated with more complex and serious urinary tract disease (such as pyelonephritis), and urological consult for possible nephrectomy and addressing anatomic anomalies is advised. 4 Urology consult discussed further evaluation for possible neurogenic bladder once the acute infection had resolved. This patient was treated initially with ceftriaxone; antibiotic coverage was narrowed with cefazolin on day 2 as the urine culture grew E. coli susceptible to first-generation cephalosporins. Parenteral antibiotics were continued for a 7-day course following the recommendations of the urology consult, then transitioned to oral cephalexin on the day of discharge with a 7-day course planned in the outpatient setting (14 days of total antibiotic therapy). The patient’s diabetes was managed with insulin and intravenous fluids, and she was otherwise asymptomatic despite COVID-19 positivity.\n\n【31】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【32】After initiating antibiotic treatment and managing the patient’s new-onset diabetes, the patient’s right flank pain gradually resolved. Repeat pelvic ultrasound on hospital day 3 did not show findings suggestive of emphysematous cystitis. After a 7-day hospital stay, she returned home with a full recovery.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】Emphysematous cystitis is a relatively rare and complicated urinary tract infection. Almost all documented emphysematous cystitis have been in adults. 13 Most cases typically include complex underlying comorbidities. 9 Of the four paediatric cases reported thus far, one had bilateral pelviureteric junction obstruction, one had spastic quadriplegia and pancreatitis, one with concomitant urosepsis and another presenting following a bone marrow transplant complicated by gut-associated graft-versus-host disease. 14–17 The key identifying features are characteristic imaging findings of gas in the bladder and/or bladder wall on CT scan and strong focal echoes on ultrasonography. Many sources indicate that radiographic detection does not necessarily need to be present in all cases, with 50%–85% of cases of gas-forming UTIs containing such findings. Thus, diagnosis should be made with the entire clinical picture in mind. 2 10–12\n\n【35】The pathogenesis for emphysematous cystitis is not well understood. Some hypothesise that high glucose levels provide an environment favourable for gas-forming organisms such as E. coli . Subsequently, urinary tract infections play a central role in the disease process, providing a mechanism by which organisms can reach the bladder. 2 Shokeir et al described urinary tract obstruction being present in all their patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis without diabetes mellitus and in half of their patients with diabetes mellitus. 4 Furthermore, Grupper et al discussed how inflammation may increase local pressures, impair circulation, leading to gas accumulation, additional infarction, and provide a good culture medium for gas-forming bacteria, creating a vicious cycle. 2 Clinical guidelines currently recommend parenteral antibiotics followed by urology consult for possible cystectomy. 1 This patient’s symptoms resolved on antibiotic treatment and diabetes management, and she did not develop any characteristic COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n【36】All the previously reported cases have had significant concurrent obstructive and inflammatory processes. While this patient has the signature risk factors such as type 1 diabetes and ureteral reflux, COVID-19 also has a documented history of urinary tract shedding and frequency. 18 The patient’s elevated HbA1c and random glucose are common findings in acutely ill patients with diabetes; however, prior studies have suggested that COVID-19 may directly infect human pancreatic beta cells, inhibiting their functioning and predisposing this patient to urinary tract infections secondary to hyperglycaemic-induced bacterial overgrowth. 19 Prior research has also suggested that COVID-19 can increase urinary frequency and may be a cause of viral cystitis. 6 20 The exact mechanism by which the virus interacts with the urinary system is not well understood but is thought to involve an increase in inflammatory cytokines released into the urine and/or directly expressed by the bladder. 6 COVID-19 has a well-documented history of inducing inflammation and targeting ACE2 receptors to enter target cells. The kidneys and bladder have high and medium expressions, respectively. 5 Finally, there remains the possibility that this patient’s COVID-19 positivity is purely incidental, playing no role in the pathogenesis of her disease process. A general state of poor health, such as diabetes, is a known predisposing factor. 21 While that is a consideration, it is important for medical professionals to stay vigilant about not only the possible complex interplay between COVID-19 and diseases of the urinary system but also about the possible underlying factors contributing to atypical presentations of urinary tract infections.\n\n【37】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【38】Initially I was just so overwhelmed with everything. I was used to urinary tract infections, but they always went away with antibiotics. This time the worsening back and abdominal pain had me worried. I feel much better now, but I am worried about something like this happening again in the future. (Patient)\n\n【39】When the doctor told me that (the patient) had diabetes and that her COVID-19 test came back positive, it was a lot to take in. I knew we had a family history of autoimmune disease, but I didn’t expect to deal with so much at one time. I am glad, however, that we were able to catch her diabetes early on, and I hope that this case can help others out there. (Mother of the patient)\n\n【40】### Learning points\n\n【41】   Complex presentations of urinary tract infections, such as this patient’s concurrent diabetic ketoacidosis, infectious status, medical history, family history and social/environmental history warrant further diagnostic workup.\n\n【42】   Emphysematous cystitis is an extremely rare condition in the paediatric population even among those with characteristic predisposing factors. 14 In a child with emphysematous urinary tract infections, there is almost certainly underlying anatomical abnormalities, diabetes mellitus or both.\n\n【43】   COVID-19 may have complex interactions with the urinary system, especially in patients with a medical history of conditions that affect or involve the urinary tract.\n\n【44】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【45】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【46】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

He had already been evaluated and discharged by an otorhinolaryngologist. He had Parkinson’s disease as relevant medical history. Laboratory tests were within normal parameters. Upper digestive endoscopy showed an extrinsic compression in the upper 1/3 of the oesophagus. A CT scan of the cervical, thoracic, abdominal and pelvic regions was normal.

What is now being more widely recognised in the literature than previously, autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitidies have been reported to have significant morbidity and potentially fatal complications without prompt recognition and treatment. Approximately half of patients with a thymoma are also found to have paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes, the most common being myasthenia gravis. 2 However, these cases only involve the peripheral nervous system since autoimmune antibodies block or destroy muscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and spare the central nervous system (CNS). There are limited case reports of thymoma associated paraneoplastic encephalitis (TAPE) involving inflammation of the limbic or extralimbic areas of the brain, which can potentially lead to progressive neurologic decline and death without proper diagnosis and treatment. 3 Here we review an intriguing case report of a patient whose presentation was consistent with TAPE.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A 59-year-old man with no significant medical history was in his usual state of health until 5 days prior to a visit to his primary care physician with a chief complaint of a ‘strong bitter taste in his mouth’. This was associated with expressive aphasia, short-term memory deficits and confusion, all primarily noticed by his wife. Throughout his progressive development of symptoms, he also started having occasional staring spells, and intermittent right hand spasms, preliminarily thought to be simple partial seizures. He took no regularly scheduled medications, and had no known drug allergies. Medical and surgical history was only notable for benign colorectal adenomas. Social history included: never smoker, social alcohol user and no recreational or illicit drug use. He denied any recent travels outside of his local area and denied constitutional symptoms, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, chest pain, or shortness of breath.\n\n【11】On presentation, his temperature was 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure was 115/81 mm Hg, heart rate of 95 beats/min, respirations were 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. His body mass index (BMI) was 27.05 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . Physical exam findings were significant for expressive aphasia, mild cognitive deficits most notably with short-term memory loss (unable to recall three simple items after 5 min). Remainder of neurological exam was unremarkable: cranial nerves 2-12 intact, no sensory or motor deficits, no limb ataxia and normal gait. Remainder of physical exam was unremarkable.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】His primary doctor ordered an outpatient MRI brain without contrast, which revealed a large confluent area of signal intensity involving the left medial temporal lobe and hippocampus. The patient was urgently referred to our hospital for further work up and evaluation.\n\n【14】On admission, his initial metabolic panel and complete blood count labs were unremarkable, with a white cell count of 9.9 x10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. A repeat MRI brain with and without contrast demonstrated T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities of the left frontal and medial temporal lobe and right cingulate gyrus (which is part of the limbic system) with minimal enhancement . Initial report from the neuroradiologist who reviewed the MRI images with the consulting inpatient neurologist determined that the findings were not suggestive of any sort of primary or metastatic malignancy, but, in fact, remarked that this pattern was pathognomonic for herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. A continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) showed abnormal left frontotemporal periodic lateralised epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) with probable electrographic seizures from the left temporal regions, also consistent with HSV encephalitis. However, lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing was negative for HSV 1&2 DNA amplification, and was also rather unsuggestive of infection (only showing elevated protein with no pleocytosis). However, given the MRI findings and clinical presentation, the patient was empirically treated with acyclovir (intravenous, 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours) for suspected HSV encephalitis, as the primary hospital team pursued further investigation.\n\n【15】<img/>\n\n【16】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【18】Axial and coronal views of MRI brain T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences shown demonstrating predominantly R cingulate gyrus, L frontal and L medial temporal lobe hyperintensities.\n\n【19】During the course of the hospitalisation, his cognitive status continued to decline despite antiviral treatment, and his expressive aphasia also continued to worsen. Further serum and CSF analysis (sent to Mayo Clinic Laboratory) testing for an expanded autoimmune encephalitis panel only revealed a positive serum muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) binding antibody ( table 1 ). It is important to note that muscle AChR antibody is associated with causing myasthenia gravis involving the peripheral nervous system. Ultimately, the full results of both the serum and CSF autoimmune encephalitis panel returned otherwise negative for the usual culprit biomarkers of autoimmune encephalitis, such as anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies, voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) complex antibodies, leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) antibodies, gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABA <sub>B </sub> ) receptor antibodies, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibodies, contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2) antibodies and anti-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antibodies. The muscle acetylcholine receptor antibodies were also positive in the serum, but, because they only target muscular receptors in the peripheral nervous system, they are not pathogenic to the CNS despite concurrent presence in the CSF ( table 2 ). On further literature review, there have been a handful of case reports of very similar clinical presentations of suspected encephalitis in the setting of thymoma tumour found to have GABA <sub>A </sub> or GABA <sub>B </sub> receptor antibodies. 4 Although the patient tested negative for GABA <sub>B </sub> receptor antibodies, the status of anti-GABA <sub>A </sub> receptor antibodies presence in this patient is unfortunately unknown due to lack of testing.\n\n【20】View this table:\n\n【21】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【22】Table 1\n\n【23】CSF autoimmune encephalitis panel results\n\n【24】View this table:\n\n【25】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【26】Table 2\n\n【27】Serum autoimmune encephalitis panel results\n\n【28】Furthermore, a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast, as well as a whole body PET-CT scan, was performed to rule out occult primary malignancy. From this workup the patient was found to have bilateral subsegmental pulmonary emboli, and a partially calcified 4.0×2.3×1.5 cm anterior mediastinal mass, most likely representative of a thymoma .\n\n【29】<img/>\n\n【30】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【32】Coronal view of whole body PET/CT scan showing increased uptake in anterior mediastinum and a partially calcified 4.0×2.3×1.5 cm anterior mediastinal mass (shown by arrow).\n\n【33】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【34】This case involves an immunocompetent host who presented with a rather rapid and acute development of expressive aphasia, cognitive impairment (short-term memory deficits), staring spells, and intermittent right hand spasms. The differential diagnosis considered for this clinical presentation included infectious causes (viral/bacterial encephalitidies), vascular causes (cerebrovascular accident), seizures and primary psychiatric disorders (acute psychosis or schizophrenia), among others.\n\n【35】Viral and bacterial meningitis causing encephalitis are perhaps the most common causes of acute encephalitis in an otherwise healthy individual, though, as mentioned earlier, the epidemiology landscape of this may be shifting as we develop more testing abilities for determining other aetiologies of encephalitis. There is a wide range of infectious aetiologies including herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, Neisseria meningitidis and Listeria monocytogenes , just to name a few. However, given the lack of fever, leukocytosis and bland CSF results, infectious aetiology was unlikely in this patient. Although his initial MRI findings were highly characteristic of changes seen with HSV encephalitis, his clinical presentation was not consistent with this diagnosis. Moreover, no other objective data supported HSV infection, as well as the lack of clinical improvement with intravenous acyclovir treatment.\n\n【36】Vascular causes such as a stroke could present with neurological findings such as expressive aphasia, cognitive impairment, and have complications such as seizures. However, the time course and progressive development of his symptoms did not fit with the clinical presentation of a cerebrovascular accident and also essentially ruled out with MRI brain imaging.\n\n【37】Seizures can also present with acute onset of neurological deficits, but are usually more episodic and short lived without constant symptoms. Continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) was also performed on this patient that did not show any global epileptic activity, aside from the aforementioned PLEDs. Similarly, new onset primary psychiatric disorder did not fit this clinical picture in someone without prior personal or family history of any psychiatric disorders.\n\n【38】Treatment\n---------\n\n【39】After the discovery of the anterior mediastinal mass, thymoma and known associated paraneoplastic syndromes were considered. TAPE was thought to be the leading diagnosis that encompassed all of this patient’s clinical presentation, supported by lab and imaging findings. The patient was started on intravenous immunoglobulin G (total dose of 2 g/kg, divided into 3 days), as well as high dose intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone 1000 mg for 5 days). His clinical status began to improve shortly thereafter. In addition, he underwent a successful video assisted thoracoscopic surgery for tumour resection, and pathology revealed the anterior mediastinal mass to be a type B2–B3 thymoma. Unfortunately, it is unclear if the thymoma tissue expressed muscle ACh receptors because further testing was not performed. He subsequently was discharged home with improving clinical symptoms and had close outpatient follow-up.\n\n【40】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【41】The patient underwent an MRI brain with and without contrast 1 month post-hospitalisation, which showed significant interval resolution of the previously described bilateral hemispheric cortically based lesions. Unfortunately, 3 months after the patient was discharged, he experienced a generalised tonic–clonic seizure that required re-hospitalisation. Repeat MRI on re-admission showed recurrence of multifocal bilateral T2/FLAIR hyperintersities signifying widespread inflammation, notably in brand new areas when compared with his first admission’s MRI . The patient was again treated with high dose intravenous steroids (solumedrol 1 g daily), but this time was also treated with plasma exchange (PLEX) therapy (which was thought to clear the autoantibodies quicker). The patient’s clinical symptoms improved after steroid and PLEX therapies and was subsequently discharged home on a steroid taper (with oral prednisone), as well as levetiracetam 1500 mg orally twice daily for seizure prophylaxis. Repeat MRI brain imaging 3 and 6 months status post his second admission showed interval resolution of the new brain lesions and his neurological status returned to baseline, with no further recurrences of disease to date.\n\n【42】<img/>\n\n【43】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【44】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3</u>\n\n【45】MRI brain T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences shown with four axial views, advancing from superior to inferior from A to D. MRI obtained on second admission showing new areas of hyperintensities and inflammation.\n\n【46】Discussion\n----------\n\n【47】Autoimmune or paraneoplastic causes of encephalitis are becoming more recognised, especially as laboratory testing for autoantibodies continue to advance. Recent literature reveals that these aetiologies of encephalitis are perhaps more common than previously thought. 5 This is taking into account that refinement in immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence assay and cell-based assay lab testing has made important recent diagnostic advancements in shedding light on autoantibody mediated encephalitis.\n\n【48】Although this patient was ultimately found to have muscle ACh receptor binding autoantibodies in both CSF and serum, positivity for this particular antibody is not specific and or sufficient enough to be diagnostic of ‘antibody positive’ autoimmune encephalitis. In fact, it is important to acknowledge that muscle ACh receptor binding antibodies are not pathogenic to the CNS, and is not responsible for this patient’s presenting encephalitis. Historically, neurologic symptoms found in the setting of positive antibodies to CASPR2 receptor or LGI1 were considered to be part of the ‘classical’ syndrome highly suggestive of limbic encephalitis. 5 Ultimately, this patient’s workup did not reveal positive results for any other autoantibody biomarkers, and the muscle ACh receptor antibodies were likely an incidental finding that fit with the discovery of his thymoma. The specific, autoimmune culprit responsible for his encephalitis remains unknown. However, given his clinical improvement with immunosuppressive therapy and tumour resection, we believe that his diagnosis is compatible with TAPE, despite not having a definitive autoantibody identified.\n\n【49】It is important to recognise that not all patients with autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitis have associated autoantibodies, and the lack of either serum or CSF autoantibodies does not exclude a potential autoimmune process. In all patients, consideration of alternative aetiologies is essential, as treatment decisions must often be made before imaging, EEG, or confirmatory antibody test results are available. Infectious aetiologies in particular should be excluded before initiating immunosuppressive therapies. In more than half of patients found to have paraneoplastic encephalitis syndromes, the neurologic symptoms on average preceded discovery of a tumour or cancer diagnosis by weeks to months. Therefore, there should be a low threshold to perform imaging for malignancy screening. 6 The most frequent malignancies associated with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis are lung cancer (usually small-cell lung cancer), seminoma and other testicular tumours, thymoma, breast cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. 7 Prior literature reported association between limbic encephalitis due to thymoma and VGKC antibodies, but as more case reports come forth, the list of ‘responsible’ autoantibodies has continually developed to include even more different biomarkers, as evidenced by the extensive list of antibodies tested in the expanded autoimmune encephalitis panel both in the serum and CSF for this patient.\n\n【50】In an effort to delineate the potential pathophysiology of autoimmune encephalitis, it has been proposed that preceding CNS infections can play a role in triggering autoimmune flares; however, this has only been demonstrated in limited case studies with HSV encephalitis. NMDA receptor antibody mediated encephalitis has been associated with the diagnosis and treatment of HSV encephalitis, with 20%–30% of patients who were NMDA receptor antibody-negative in serum and CSF at the time of HSV infection seroconverted to positive NMDA receptor antibodies in the setting of relapsing symptoms confirmed not to be from recurrent HSV infection. 8 However, in this particular patient, it is unlikely that he had HSV infection triggering autoimmune encephalitis, as there was no confirmed evidence of CNS HSV infection, as well as alternative findings of a thymoma tumour.\n\n【51】Finally, it should be stressed that early consideration and recognition for autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitidies is the only way to ensure prompt initiation of treatment. Early immunotherapy and cancer directed therapy (including tumour resection, if indicated) have been shown to have favourable outcomes, improved speed of neurological recovery, and reduced risk of relapses. Over 75% of patients with proper diagnosis and treatment had clinical resolution of neurological symptoms at 24 months from initial onset. 9 Without treatment, progressive neurologic deterioration can occur over months to years, eventually resulting in death.\n\n【52】As our knowledge of antibody mediated autoimmune encephalitis continues to grow, we hope that emerging number of case reports, such as this one, contributes to our understanding of the diagnostic algorithms, treatment options and prognosis of this previously under-recognised aetiology of limbic encephalitis.\n\n【53】### Learning points\n\n【54】   Although unusual, there are several case reports of thymoma associated paraneoplatic syndromes involving limbic or extralimbic areas of the central nervous system, rather than the peripheral nervous system as seen in myasthenia gravis associated with thymomas.\n\n【55】   Not all patients with autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitidies have associated antibodies, and the lack of either serum or CSF autoantibodies does not exclude a potential autoimmune process.\n\n【56】   In greater than 50% of patients found to have paraneoplastic syndromes, the neurological symptoms precede discovery of a tumour or cancer diagnosis by weeks to months; therefore, there should be a low threshold to perform imaging for malignancy screening.\n\n【57】   There are rare cases of autoimmune encephalitis developing following HSV infections causing encephalitis, and prompt diagnosis and treatment with immunotherapy improves symptoms and outcomes.\n\n【58】   In paraneoplastic encephalitis, early immunotherapy and cancer directed therapy (including tumour resection, if indicated) have been shown to have favourable outcomes, improved speed of neurological recovery, and reduced risk of relapses.\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to acknowledge the following individuals for their assistance in this case: Iris Ma, MD; Elizabeth Kim, MD, MS; and Glenn D.

The patient had a fever and exhibited the signs of poor feeding 2 days before presentation. On presentation, respiratory failure, shock and comatose were noted. Echocardiography revealed slightly decreased apical and posterior wall motion compared with the data obtained 7 months ago. ECG showed no remarkable changes from the previously obtained data . The results of the laboratory examination were as follows: troponin T level, 0.52 ng/mL; creatine kinase level, 254 U/L; and brain natriuretic peptide level, 419.0 pg/mL. Contrast-enhanced CT showed no anomaly or contrast defects of the coronary arteries. We suspected septic shock because of the patient’s fever and shock. Mechanical ventilation and the administration of fluid bolus, norepinephrine, dobutamine and antibiotics were initiated. Subsequently, the patient’s circulatory status improved.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】ECG on admission (A) and the day following admission (B). The latter shows slow ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【9】Slow ventricular tachycardia occurred on the day following admission , and apical wall motion was further reduced ( video 1 ). The patient was subsequently diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) based on transient regional left ventricular hypokinesia that extended beyond a single epicardial vessel distribution, presence of sepsis as a physical trigger, abnormality noted on ECG, and elevated levels of troponin T and brain natriuretic peptide, according to the diagnostic criteria for paediatric TC. 1 Although mexiletine infusion partially succeeded in controlling ventricular arrhythmia, his blood pressure decreased because of recurrent arrhythmia. The blood pressure increased with the administration of dobutamine. We suspected acute myocarditis as a differential diagnosis; thus, we planned to transfer the patient to another centre for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. After several hours, his arrhythmia disappeared. Wall motion improved after a week ( video 2 ). His blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative. The patient was extubated after 7 days; he was discharged 19 days after admission without any morbidity.\n\n【10】Video 1 Echocardiography on the day following admission shows reduced left ventricular apical wall motion.\n\n【11】Video 2 Echocardiography 7 days after admission shows improved wall motion.\n\n【12】TC is typically triggered by stress and is characterised by transient left or right ventricle dysfunction with various wall motion abnormalities (typically apical left ventricular wall motion). 1 It is rare in children, particularly young children. 2 Very few cases of TC development in children with congenital heart diseases (CHDs) have been reported. 3 4 To the best of our knowledge, the present case is the first report on TC development in a child with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect. Although changes on ECG in children with TC are reported, 1 arrhythmia has not been indicated, as per our knowledge. Myocardial hypoxia and surgery for CHD may affect stress response. Although TC is often triggered by sepsis in severely ill adults, 5 insufficient information is available for children. 2 TC triggered by sepsis and septic cardiomyopathy partially overlap. 6 Therefore, future studies are warranted to determine the association of TC with CHD and sepsis in children. Thus, when children with CHD who are suspected of having any infection present with decreased cardiac function, TC may be a possible cause in addition to myocarditis and septic cardiomyopathy.\n\n【13】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【14】The patient’s mother said, “I wish I had noticed something wrong with this boy a little earlier.”\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】   When children with congenital heart diseases who are suspected of having any infection present with decreased cardiac function, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be a possible cause in addition to myocarditis and septic cardiomyopathy.\n\n【17】   Children with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can develop arrhythmia.\n\n【18】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【19】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【20】Parental/guardian consent obtained.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Dr Suzu Imamura for treatment of the patient and Dr Keiichiro Mizuno for critical advice on the manuscript.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

He had congenital deafness but no other medical problems. He had received a diagnosis of ichthyosis vulgaris several years ago and was treating the condition with topical emollients. Further questioning confirmed a positive family history; his maternal grandfather had been affected with the same skin changes, whilst his mother was reported to have had a milder presentation, with scale only affecting the shins. He has no brothers and one unaffected sister. He has no offspring.\n\n【5】On examination, there was polygonal brown scaling affecting all four limbs; with involvement of the trunk including the neck. Palms were not affected with no hyperlinearity of the palmer creases. The flexures were spared and hair and nail examination were unremarkable .\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【9】(A) Polygonal scale on the lower legs. (B) Scale on the back. (C) Scale on the extensor aspect of the arms.\n\n【10】Given the family history and clinical findings, X-linked ichthyosis (XLI) was suspected, and a steroid sulfatase (STS) level requested. This was markedly low at 2.5 pmol/mg/hour consistent with a biochemical diagnosis of XLI. Subsequently genetic testing involving targeted microarray analysis demonstrated a 1.6 Mb interstitial deletion of the short arm of the X chromosome within band p22.31. This loss included the STS gene confirming the diagnosis of XLI.\n\n【11】He was referred to ophthalmology to assess for associated ophthalmic complications and was noted to have corneal guttata. There had been no history of cryptorchidism. He had no neurological disability or psychiatric issues. He was subsequently commenced on acitretin 10 mg daily and achieved an excellent response to treatment.\n\n【12】XLI was identified as a unique entity affecting only males in 1965 by Wells and Kerr. 1 It affects approximately 1:6000 males 2 and represents an inborn error of metabolism associated with a deficiency of the enzyme STS. Ninety per cent have a complete STS gene deletion, while 10% have a partial deletion or point mutation. Contiguous defects can occur when there are deletions of neighbouring genes. STS deficiency results in impaired hydrolysis of cholesterol sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, with resultant accumulation of cholesterol 3-sulfate in the epidermis. High levels of this metabolite can inhibit transglutaminase-1, which explains the partial overlap with lamellar ichthyosis. 3\n\n【13】Typical presentation is with desquamation and erythema in the first year of life. There may be failure of progression of labour due to low or absent placental oestrogen. Later in childhood a symmetrical polygonal brownish scale becomes apparent on the limbs, neck and trunk. Flexures are usually spared. Scaling typically continues into later life. Palms are not hyperlinear distinguishing XLI from ichthyosis vulgaris. Infants do not present with a collodian membrane unlike lamellar ichthyosis.\n\n【14】Associations include cryptorchidism in up to 20%, asymptomatic corneal opacites and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 4 Rodrigo-Nicolás et al reviewed 30 patients with XLI and observed that 13% had epilepsy and 30% had an ADHD diagnosis. 5 There is also emerging evidence of an association between XLI and development of atrial fibrillation/flutter in middle age, 6 as well as Dupuytren’s contracture. Post operative bleeding complications are reported to occur in 3.5% of those carrying the deletion verses 0.5% of non-carriers. 7\n\n【15】Distinguishing the clinical variant of ichthyosis can be challenging, particularly when the patient presents later in life such as in this case. It highlights the importance of eliciting family history in reaching the correct diagnosis.

Her relatives provided a history of rat poison (rodenticide) intake (approximately half packet, the full packet contains 10 g of zinc phosphide (Zn <sub>3 </sub> P <sub>2 </sub> ); therefore, we estimated that she had ingested approximately 5g a few hours earlier. Immediately after routine basic investigations and stabilisation, gastric lavage was performed. On physical examination, her vital signs were normal, except for tachycardia (pulse rate 130 beats/min). She was able to follow one-step commands. Deep tendon reflexes were vigorous with bilateral extensor plantar responses. Extraocular movements were regular without nystagmus. After 2 days of hospitalisation, she began to exhibit behavioural changes, worsening confusion and disorientation, and over the next few hours, her condition rapidly deteriorated. With these features in mind, central nervous system (CNS) involvement was suspected, and a MRI scan of the brain was performed, which revealed symmetrically distributed diffusion restriction in bilateral periventricular supratentorial white matter with a reversal in apparent diffusion coefficient images. The sulcal spaces were effaced in bilateral cerebral hemispheres signifying brain oedema. However, the remaining MRI sequences 通用删除1(英):<u>(T1, T2, fluid attenuated inversion recovery and susceptibility weighted images)</u> did not reveal any abnormality . This white matter diffusion restriction without any abnormality on other MRI sequences has many differentials like toxic leucoencephalopathy, cranial irradiation, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, antimicrobial medications (eg, metronidazole), environmental toxins and drug abuse. Based on the history and MRI features, a diagnosis of leucoencephalopathy secondary to chemical rodenticide ingestion was made. As there is no specific antidote, the patient was managed conservatively. After a few days, her neurological symptoms gradually resolved, and she was able to perform her daily activities independently ( table 1 ). After 3 weeks, a follow-up MRI brain scan showed complete normalisation of MRI abnormalities, and  she remains under follow up.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】MRI of the brain in the axial plane.

Phosphides such as aluminium phosphide and Zn <sub>3 </sub> P <sub>2 </sub> are among the most commonly used in India. When ingested, these phosphides react with gastric acid and form phosphine gas, which is highly lethal. 1 As these rodenticides are cheap and readily available on the market, ingestion (as a suicide agent) has become a public health problem, especially in rural areas. 2 Although clinical and laboratory properties of metal phosphide poisoning have been described in the literature, very few clinical-radiological correlations of such cases have been published. Radiographic findings pertaining to pulmonary and abdominal complications have been described in previous reports of Zn <sub>3 </sub> P <sub>2 </sub> poisoning. 3 In our opinion, awareness of these MRI features would help emergency physicians or toxicologists/radiologists to detect this complication early and plan the appropriate treatment. To evaluate the CNS complications, MRI is the choice of investigation as it can be used to differentiate various types of leucoencephalopathy. It was found that this type of leucoencephalopathy can be treated symptomatically and is usually resolves with time. Here, we have described typical CNS imaging features in a patient with Zn <sub>3 </sub> P <sub>2 </sub> poisoning, which, as far as we know, has not been reported in the literature.\n\n【18】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【19】My daughter took rat poison and because of emotional distress we brought her to the hospital immediately, after which doctors did their best to treat her.

The patient was born with bilateral clubfoot as an isolated musculoskeletal defect and underwent multiple corrective surgeries throughout his childhood and adolescence, with interval evolving deformity between surgeries. Previous operations included an Achilles tendon release, posteromedial release, and a corrective triple foot arthrodesis, which resulted in overcorrection and subsequent formation of skew foot bilaterally. His mobility was impaired secondary to deformity and pain, with a large impact on quality of life. At the time of referral, the patient was considering amputation with prosthesis to restore functional mobility. Examination and X-rays revealed complex bilateral deformity showing skew foot hallmarks of hindfoot valgus, midfoot supination, and forefoot adduction, with longitudinal arch flattening . Remnants of clubfoot were present with toes skewed medially with fixed flexion. The patient was planned for and underwent right foot reconstruction using the following methods: calcaneal dome osteotomy through non-union of subtalar joint with lateral bone block to correct the valgus deformity and the calcaneal pitch; calcaneocuboid joint osteotomy; dorsiflexing osteotomy of the first metatarsal; corrective first metatarsophalangeal joint arthrodesis; flexor tenotomies of lesser toes and transfixation with K-ires.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Preoperative plain film and clinical photograph showing acquired iatrogenic skew foot deformity of the right foot.\n\n【9】The skew deformity of the right foot was successfully corrected, with achievement of a plantigrade foot and restoration of functional anatomy .

Pain was significantly improved and the patient does not currently require analgesia. The medial incision was initially slow to heal (expected outcome given surgical lengthening of medial side of foot with consequent stretching of already thin tissue over bone). PICO (negative pressure wound therapy device) vacuum dressing was applied with good progress on healing. Following time for healing, similar corrective surgery on the left foot will be planned.

It presents bilaterally in 50%, and as an isolated deformity in 80%, with 20% associated with musculoskeletal syndromes. The gold standard for treatment is the Ponseti Method—repopularised in recent years, it involves serial external manual manipulation and recasting to gradually realign the foot. 1 It carries a 90% success rate, but also a 30% rate of recurrence. Prior to the adaptation of the Ponseti Method, surgical correction was more common—this carried an increased complication burden, including secondary deformity and overcorrection to skew foot as seen in this case. 2 Non-operative management has a lower success rate in correcting deformity, but can help improve functionality. Surgical correction is complex, given the need to correct the hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot—it is usually only considered where symptoms significantly impair patient quality of life. The goal of surgery is to restore a pain-free, functional plantigrade foot.\n\n【19】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【20】Being born with a severe case of bilateral talipes has caused me a number of issues in life, and I’ve had numerous surgeries on both feet in repeated attempts to remedy the issues, such as my walking abilities. While all in all they were somewhat successful, they’ve all still left me with difficulties in walking and with pain. Immediately in the weeks after this surgery I noticed a significant drop in resting pain within the foot. As I am not currently back to full walking capabilities, I cannot speak for it if it has aided in my overall comfort when walking, but it looks hopeful.\n\n【21】### Learning points\n\n【22】   The Ponseti method of serial external manipulation and casting is the gold standard for correction of clubfoot, with over 90% success rate and fewer complications than surgical correction.\n\n【23】   Skew foot surgical correction is complex and involves correction of hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot. It is considered where symptoms and deformity significantly impact quality of life.\n\n【24】   The goal of surgical skew foot correction in adults is to restore a pain-free, functional plantigrade foot.\n\n【25】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【26】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【27】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 1.78 logMAR in the right eye and 0 logMAR in the left eye. Cycloplegic retinoscopy revealed a refractive error of a −15 dioptre sphere with a −3.5 dioptre cylinder at 180° in the right eye. The patient had right exotropia of 10 prism diopters on modified Krimsky’s test with full extraocular motility. He had no stereopsis and demonstrated right eye suppression on sensory examination. Dilated fundus examination was performed, which showed the presence of a myelinated retinal nerve fibre layer in the right eye along the superior and inferior temporal arcades covering the whole posterior pole with a dull foveal reflex . The left eye fundus was normal . The axial length of the right eye was 27.60 mm and that of the left eye was 22.07 mm. Optical coherence tomography was performed, which depicted parafoveal hyper-reflective retinal nerve fibre layer in the right eye and left eye was normal . An optical correction was prescribed in the form of a contact lens in the right eye and occlusion therapy was given in the left eye. There was no improvement in the visual acuity after 6 months of amblyopia treatment and the patient was explained about the possible need for strabismus surgery in the future. Straatsma syndrome is defined as myelinated nerve fibre with myopia and amblyopia. 1 Myelination of the optic nerve begins from the lamina cribrosa and the lamina cribrosa acts as a barrier at term. Defects in the lamina cribrosa or ectopic oligodendrocyte progenitor cells lead to the myelinated retinal nerve fibre layer. 2 Amblyopia, if detected early in life, can be treated with good visual outcomes. 3 4\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】(A) Fundus photo of the right eye showing extensive myelination of the retinal nerve fibre layer.

On specific questioning, he described the largest lesion starting as a small brown mark that grew rapidly to its present size over approximately 1 year.

The evidence is scarce on best choice once first-line therapy fails. Beta-blockers had been used in the past successfully but with concerns about safety. The ultrashort acting beta-blockers like esmolol can be used more safely in this scenario, and should be reconsidered, particularly given the mechanism of ventricular arrythmias in these poisonings.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A woman in her 30s presented to a remote hospital after a very large intentional amitriptyline overdose of up to 10 g (up to 128 mg/kg). Her medical history included only major depressive disorder, and there was no family history of arrythmia or cardiac disease.\n\n【12】She required immediate intubation for persisting coma and seizures. Sodium bicarbonate and hyperventilation were initiated for electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria of widened QRS and coma, and titrated to a pH of 7.55. After discussion with a toxicology specialist, intralipid was commenced and aeromedical retrieval was arranged. The aircraft was diverted to our hospital after two inflight episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) requiring defibrillation.\n\n【13】At our hospital, the patient continued to have frequent and intractable ventricular tachycardia progressing to fibrillation, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. She had aggressive electrolyte replacement aiming for potassium levels of 4.5–5, magnesium levels>1.3 mmol/L and normal ionised calcium. Multiple repeated doses of sodium bicarbonate up to 1600 mmols and hypertonic saline 1500 mmols were administered, titrated to achieve a pH of 7.55, and Na>155. The ECG showed sinus tachycardia with increasingly broader complexes progressing to monomorphic VT of 200 beats/min with increasing automaticity then deteriorating to ventricular fibrillation, with no features of a torsades pattern or Brugada criteria. Further infusion of intralipid was given (6 hours after the first) and further magnesium infusion and then lidocaine infusion were all given without apparent effect. Inotropes and pressors were required to maintain a perfusing mean arterial blood pressure of >60 mm Hg.\n\n【14】In view of the failure to resolve the arrhythmias and echocardiographic evidence of reducing ventricular function after multiple defibrillations, the patient was discussed with a tertiary cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) for consideration of extra-corporeal cardiac support (ECMO). To support the progressively lower cardiac output and to facilitate transfer an intra-arterial balloon pump (IABP) was inserted.\n\n【15】Despite the above treatments, the patient continued to have VT/VF, a total of 28 episodes requiring CPR and defibrillation over the next 8 hours. It was observed that after a successful defibrillation the ECG would normalise when the rate was below 100 and begin to have progressively longer QT interval as the rate increased. Given that all treatment goals were being met and arrhythmias were continuing, a trial of intravenous esmolol (ultra-short acting B-blocker) was given. The patients heart rate initially reduced to 60 beats/min and slowly increased to 100 over the next 30 min with no arrhythmias occurring.\n\n【16】When the heart rate returned above 100 beats/min, the ECG again displayed increased QRS duration (>200 ms) and automaticity, provoking ventricular tachycardia which soon deteriorated to VF. An esmolol infusion was recommenced, targeting a heart rate of 80–100 beats/min. The ECG now showed a rate of 98 beats/min with QRS duration of 120 ms. The patient had no further arrhythmias with this therapeutic manoeuvre and was stable on transfer to the tertiary cardiac centre, with a reducing inotrope requirement. Attempts to stop or wean the esmolol infusion resulted in recurrence of tachycardia then VT/VF and the esmolol was continued for 72 hours. The IABP was weaned within 48 hours, and the patient extubated on day 7.\n\n【17】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【18】There was no family history suggesting that the patient had an underlying familial or genetic tendency to VF such as Brugada syndrome, where the use of amitriptyline can block sodium channels I <sub>Na </sub> I <sub>to </sub> and I <sub>Kr </sub> leading to unmasking of Brugada ECG phenotype, or exacerbate a Congenital prolonged QT syndrome. 1 2 It is unlikely that she had undiagnosed critical coronary arterial disease in view of her age and subsequent follow-up. The patient had taken one of the largest overdoses we are aware of, as much as 10 g of amitriptyline, and this was evidenced by retrospective amitriptyline levels from the day of admission being beyond the limits of the assay (>1000 µmols/L), quantifiable by day 4 as 994 µmols/L and normalising to 232 µmols/L by day 10 . Some people with cytochrome p phenotypes can have delayed clearance of amitriptyline, but this is not routinely assessable.\n\n【19】<img/>\n\n【20】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【22】Amitriptyline/nortriptyline levels versus days from presentation. The tricyclic levels from the first days of the admission were higher than the upper level of the assay.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】The most common mode of death in tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdoses that reach hospital is refractory hypotension with progressive cardiac dysfunction due to contractile failure. The mechanisms leading to low cardiac output and hypotension are numerous. 3\n\n【25】Spontaneous ventricular tachycardias and fibrillation are less common, but dramatically increase the risk of death. Slowed depolarisation and subsequent repolarisation of the cardiac action potential throughout myocardial conducting and contractile tissue leads to a relatively longer refractory period owing to use-dependant sodium channel blockade. 4–6 Acidosis, hypokalaemia, hypoxaemia, hyperthermia, hypotension and excessive adrenergic stimulation may also predispose to arrhythmias. 7 Blockade of the hERG human potassium channel by amitriptyline may also cause increased automaticity and arrhythmias in this setting of excessive adrenergic activity. 8\n\n【26】In animal models, it appears that the combination of increased sinus node rate and prolonged QRS is key to the occurrence of VT/VF here. 6 9 Models first proposed in the 1970s predicted that block produced by tertiary amine local anaesthetics (like amitriptyline) may be enhanced by depolarisation, and that recovery from depolarisation-induced block is time dependant. As the heart rate increases, the diastolic period is shortened and there is insufficient time for complete drug unbinding between beats. The increasing presence of drug-associated (blocked) sodium channels reduces maximum sodium current and conduction velocity in cardiac muscle, resulting in QRS prolongation, and increases the likelihood of re-entrant type arrhythmias. 10\n\n【27】Prevention of sinus tachycardia in experimental amitriptyline toxicity by sinus node destruction, beta-blockers, direct vagal stimulation, physostigmine and specific bradycardia agents like zatebradine effectively prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmias, as well as reduce QRS prolongation. 6 9 11 12\n\n【28】Beta-blockade infusion was chosen in our patient to reduce the heart rate because we observed that the QRS and QT prolongation increased with rate, and arrythmias and triggered automaticity occurred exclusively when the heart rate was >110 and QRS prolonged, and we hoped to prevent the tachycardia and ventricular arrythmias despite the risks of reduced cardiac contractility.\n\n【29】Any potential reduction in contractility or blood pressure could be offset by careful titration of esmolol to a safe rate, the restoration of a perfusing rhythm, and in extremis the use of a cardiac support device such as IABP or ECMO. In this case, we minimised the dose of esmolol by titrating to a pulse range of less than 100 beats/min and more than 80beats/min. The malignant rhythm reappeared once the pulse rate was over 110 beats/min at several different times in her course. It was a successful intervention suggested by the fact that premature cessation of esmolol infusion on two occasions led to tachycardia and recurrence of ventricular tachycardia then fibrillation.\n\n【30】Currently first-line therapy of amitriptyline cardiac toxicity is generous use of IV sodium bicarbonate to provide sodium ions and alkalinisation. 13–16 Five to 7.5% hypertonic sodium has been shown to have as good or better effect than dilute sodium bicarbonate in reversing hypotension and QRS, and both are more effective than alkalinisation by hyperventilation alone, suggesting that the sodium dose is important. 17 Intra-lipid infusion (‘lipid rescue’) was recommended by the toxicologist, commenced at the referring hospital and was continued as recommended, with no apparent benefit. Positive anecdotes of successful use of intralipid are not supported by clinical trails and human or animal models so far. 18–20\n\n【31】There is no consensus over the recommended ‘second line’ therapy of magnesium, lidocaine or phenytoin for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and sodium channel blockers such as flecainide, procaianamide and amiodarone are strongly contra-indicated. 21–24 There are no trials comparing them, but currently small case series and animal models favour lidocaine. 5 23 Physostigmine was observed to reduce anticholinergic symptoms, tachycardia and arrhythmias, but avoided due to adverse events. 25 Long-acting beta-blockers have been used in past decades, with some successful cases but significant concerns about reducing ventricular contractility and worsening shock. 26–29\n\n【32】The antiarrhythmic mechanism of betablockers is complex and depends on the specific mechanism of the arrhythmia. 30 In this situation, the ventricular arrhythmias may have been caused by triggered activity due to afterdepolarisations in a situations where the action potential is already prolonged by the rate dependant block, as well as the profound sympathetic stimulation of cardiac arrest.\n\n【33】We propose that in cases of severe amitriptyline toxicity complicated by intractable ventricular tachycardia and arrhythmias unresponsive to the typical first-line and second-line medications, and where all care has been given to controlling homeostasis by optimisation of potassium, magnesium, calcium, pH, oxygenation and perfusing blood pressure, that a titrated short acting beta-blocker infusion can be considered\n\n【34】### Learning points\n\n【35】   Resistant ventricular arrythmias greatly increase the risk of death in tricyclic antidepressant toxicity and can be difficult to treat.\n\n【36】   The type of sodium channel blockade caused by tricyclics means that recovery from depolarisation-induced block is time dependant, suggesting that an increased heart rate can lead to greater risk of ventricular arrythmia occurrence.\n\n【37】   Second line medications to treat VT or VF in TCA toxicity have poor evidence and efficacy, and although extra-corporeal cardiovascular support is an option, it is not always available.\n\n【38】   In severe amitriptyline toxicity complicated by intractable ventricular arrhythmias unresponsive to the typical first and second-line therapies, and attention to homeostasis, that a titrated short acting beta-blocker infusion can be considered, and may be lifesaving.\n\n【39】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【40】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【41】Consent obtained from next of kin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The dental surgeon observed the coagulation profile and found an increased prothrombin time (PT) of 16.7 s (range 9–14 s) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 44.2 s (range 27–39 s). Both PT and APTT were performed on STA R Max3 (Diagnostica Stago France) automated coagulation analyser using citrate vials \\[BD Vacutainer plastic citrate tubes of 2.7 mL (0.109 M, 3.2% buffered sodium citrate)\\] with STA-NeoPTimal reagent for PT and STA -Cephascreen for APTT. Suspecting a clotting abnormality, the patient was referred to a specialised coagulation laboratory for further evaluation. There was neither a previous bleeding episode nor any bleeding disorder in his family. Complete blood count showed haemoglobin of 18.7 g/L, haematocrit of 56.3%, red blood cell (RBC) count of 6.75×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, white cell of 10.8×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and platelet count of 375×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. The haematocrit and RBC counts were elevated for age and gender. On further enquiry, the patient’s personal history was significant for chronic cigarette smoking for the last 8 years. The laboratory specialist suspected secondary polycythaemia (smokers’ polycythaemia) behind the abnormal results. The blood sample in the blue top tube confirmed high haematocrit . To maintain an anticoagulant to plasma ratio of 1:9, 0.1 mL of the citrate was removed from the vial and a blood sample was collected afresh in the modified vial. 1 Repeat tests were within normal limits. The latest results were communicated to the patient and the surgeon. The preanalytical variable of high haematocrit resulted in erroneous clotting results, thereby causing a delay in surgical extraction of the affected tooth.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Two blue-top vials are depicted. The vial on the left shows the index case with high haematocrit while the vial on the right is from a patient with normal haematocrit (kept for comparison).\n\n【9】Despite advances in laboratory instrumentation incorrect or inappropriate test results are occasionally reported to clinicians, most often due to circumstances beyond the control of the laboratories performing the tests. 2 The term ‘preanalytical phase’ includes all aspects of medical laboratory diagnostic procedure that occurs before the analytical phase. Preanalytical variables can arise at any point before sample testing, including sample collection, handling, transportation, processing and storage. Due to this, it is the most vulnerable part of the total testing process, where most laboratory errors occur. 3 However, not all factitious test results and laboratory errors necessarily transcribe into significant harm for the patient. Nonetheless, the consequences of incorrect test results might still be clinically worthwhile and lead to several unwanted clinical outcomes or adverse economic consequences, especially in resource-constraint settings. 4 Blood samples with high haematocrits like those seen in neonates, severe dehydration, burn patients, polycythaemia vera, smokers, high altitude residents may result in factitiously elevated clotting times. This happens as excess citrate in the sample relative to plasma binds to the calcium that is added to the clotting assay via the testing reagent. Calcium, an essential requirement for the clotting process is thus unavailable, hence clotting times are spuriously prolonged. Laboratories may create vacuum tubes with a reduced volume of the anticoagulant to overcome the issue of a high haematocrit. Alternatively, the appropriate citrate may be removed and the tube recapped as was done in this case. 5 The method used for adjusting citrate concentrations needs to be validated by each laboratory before use. In the current case, falsely prolonged ‘screening’ coagulation test influenced a clinical decision to undertake further investigations causing unnecessarily delay in the surgery and raising anxiety in the patient. Knowledge about this preanalytical issue prevented unwarranted diagnostic workup including mixing studies, testing for factor assays and inhibitors.\n\n【10】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【11】I was amazed on understanding how my increased haematocrit had caused the laboratory error. My anxiety and distress were finally relieved on knowing that the clotting results were within normal limits and I could safely undergo my dental extraction.\n\n【12】### Learning points\n\n【13】   Preanalytical phase is the most vulnerable part of the total testing process.\n\n【14】   Laboratory physician must be careful in interpreting unadjusted samples with high haematocrit.\n\n【15】   In patients with high haematocrit, the citrate concentrations must be adjusted for accurate results.\n\n【16】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【17】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【18】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Over the month prior to presentation, the patient noticed two growing nodules over his right distal forearm. He reported occasional bleeding of the lesions with trauma but denied associated pain or pruritus. Over-the-counter salicylic acid gel for treatment of presumed warts did not improve his symptoms. Further history revealed he had been off antiretroviral therapy for one year and had been potentially scratched by a cat prior to the development of the cutaneous nodules. On examination, he had two violaceous, umbilicated nodules with overlying haemorrhagic crust on his right distal forearm without regional lymphadenopathy . Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Laboratory testing demonstrated a mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase (55 U/L), and normal alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. Complement fixation antibody titer for Histoplasma yeast was 1:8, but urine Histoplasma antigen was undetectable. Rapid plasma reagin was unreactive, and interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis was negative. Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana antibody titers were negative. Abdominal and pelvic CT displayed two subcentimeter hepatic hypodensities with peripheral enhancement and numerous splenic hypodensities associated with abdominal lymphadenopathy . A punch biopsy of the skin was performed , and Warthin-Starry staining demonstrated clusters of bacteria, confirming the diagnosis of bacillary angiomatosis (BA) . HHV8 staining was negative. In addition to the cutaneous lesions, his hepatosplenic lesions were thought to represent bacillary peliosis, a rare manifestation of splenic and hepatic involvement of Bartonella , most commonly B. henselae . 1 2 Parenteral therapy is generally recommended for bacillary peliosis; however, because of the patient’s initial improvement on oral doxycycline 100 mg two times per day, the infectious diseases team recommended oral doxycycline for 3 months. Doxycycline was chosen over erythromycin because of its more favourable side effect profile, but either can be used in treatment based on consensus guidelines. 3 4 At a six-month follow-up visit, the skin lesions and fevers had resolved.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Violaceous, umbilicated nodules with overlying haemorrhagic crust over the right distal forearm.\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【12】CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealing numerous hepatosplenic hypodensities.\n\n【13】<img/>\n\n【14】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3</u>\n\n【16】Punch biopsy with H&E staining, demonstrating vascular proliferation and clusters of pleomorphic basophilic bacilli in the stroma.\n\n【17】<img/>\n\n【18】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4</u>\n\n【20】Positive Warthin-Starry stain revealing clusters of bacteria.\n\n【21】Bacillary angiomatosis is a vasoproliferative disease caused by B. henselae and B. quintana .

Cutaneous lesions of KS can be clinically indistinguishable from BA and must be considered in the differential in HIV-infected patients. Thus, histopathology is required for diagnosis. BA pathology shows lobular capillary proliferation with endothelial swelling, neutrophils and leucocytoclasia. Bacteria aggregates are detected with Warthin-Starry staining. 6 Histological features of KS include spindle cell proliferation with intervening slit-like spaces and erythrocyte extravasation. 7 Additionally, HHV8 staining is typically positive.

Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy characterised by proximal muscle weakness, various cutaneous manifestations and molecular evidence of muscle inflammation. Inflammatory arthritis, Raynaud’s phenomenon and the presence of autoantibodies are also common, as was the case with our patient. Several studies have shown that the risk of cancer is greater in patients with dermatomyositis than in those with polymyositis, and the diagnosis of malignancy peaks within the first year after the diagnosis of the myopathy. The exact mechanism of the association between malignancy and inflammatory myopathy, namely dermatomyositis, remains poorly understood. 3 4 Some studies suggest that this link might be explained by the observation of the expression of common autoantigens between neoplastic cells and damaged muscle tissue in patients with dermatomyositis.\n\n【10】Several types of cancer have been associated with inflammatory myopathy, namely ovarian, cervical, lung, breast, pancreatic, colorectal, gastric, 5 nasopharyngeal carcinoma 6–8 and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Also, common cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma have been reported in 13 cases to date. 9 More rarely, laryngeal neoplasia has been described as presenting as polymyositis 10 and dermatomyositis. 11 The presence of malignancy does not appear to affect the severity of distribution or duration of the weakness, but cancer-associated myositis responds more poorly to treatment compared with myositis in the absence of malignancy. 12 13\n\n【11】To our knowledge, this is the first case of dermatomyositis associated with vocal fold carcinoma. This case illustrates the importance of an early diagnosis of paraneoplastic dermatoses, accelerating the diagnosis of potentially life-threatening neoplasia.\n\n【12】### Learning points\n\n【13】   All patients newly diagnosed with polymyositis or dermatomyositis should be evaluated for the possibility of an underlying malignancy.\n\n【14】   The presence of malignancy does not appear to affect the severity of distribution or the duration of weakness, but cancer-associated myositis responds more poorly to treatment compared with myositis in the absence of malignancy.\n\n【15】   An early diagnosis of paraneoplastic dermatoses is key to anticipate the diagnosis of potentially life-threatening neoplasia.\n\n【16】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【17】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【18】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I would like to thank Dr Helena Greenfield for revising the manuscript.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

However, there are no clear protocols regarding the preoperative use of denosumab before en bloc resection. There are a few reports of recurrent cases after en bloc resection; however, the association with the use of denosumab is unknown. We present the clinical, radiological and histopathological findings of a case of Campanacci grade III GCTB at the distal end of the ulna, which resulted in soft tissue recurrence after en bloc resection with the preoperative use of denosumab.\n\n【2】   musculoskeletal and joint disorders\n   orthopaedics\n   orthopaedic and trauma surgery\n   prosthesis failure\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Tumours often occur in the epiphysis and metaphysis of long bones, half of which are located around the knee. 1\n\n【10】In the distal forearm, the distal radius is the most affected site, accounting for 10% of all GCTB cases, followed by GCTB of the ulna accounting for 3%–6%; however, GCTB of the hand is relatively rare, accounting for 2%–3% of cases. 2 3\n\n【11】Traditionally, the only treatment option for GCTB was surgery; however, after the approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2013, denosumab has been more actively used as a medication for GCTB. Denosumab binds to and inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand; its ability to reduce the formation and activation of osteoclasts has been effectively used for unresectable GCTB or preoperative downstaging of cases with extraskeletal extension. However, some of the recent evidence suggests that the preoperative use of denosumab is associated with higher postoperative recurrence in cases involving bone curettage; therefore, it should be used with caution. 4 5 While there is no consensus on how to use denosumab when performing en bloc resection, a few case reports have suggested that it is suitable for clarifying the resection margin, thereby facilitating surgery.\n\n【12】In this study, we report a rare case of GCTB at the distal end of the ulna that developed soft tissue recurrence despite en bloc resection. Furthermore, we review the outcomes of distal ulna GCTB over the past 10 years during the denosumab era. The patient referenced in this case report provided written consent after being informed that all clinical data from the case would be submitted for publication. This study was approved by our institutional review board.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 26-year-old woman presented at our institution after experiencing progressive swelling and pain in the left wrist of her non-dominant hand over the previous 7 months. She had no history of trauma; however, the primary doctor diagnosed it as a postfracture condition. At a local clinic, the patient underwent observation for 3 months and was prescribed painkillers without any rehabilitation or X-ray examination. During our initial examination, we observed that the patient exhibited a limited range of motion (ROM) in the wrist, with 45°, 50°, 90° and 20° of extension, flexion, pronation and supination of the forearm, respectively. She had severe pain on the ulnar side of her wrist joint; however, there was no numbness in her fingers. The blood test findings were normal, and the possibility of metabolic diseases, infection or osteomyelitis was considered to be low.\n\n【15】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【16】Radiography  and MRI revealed an expansive Campanacci grade III osteolytic lesion. T1-weighted images showed low-signal to iso signal intensity, and T2-weighted images revealed heterogeneous high-signal and mixed low-signal areas due to haemosiderin and fibrosis. In addition, gadolinium-based MRI scans showed prominent contrast effect, which is typical of GCTB. Incisional biopsy was performed using local anaesthesia, and a pathological diagnosis of GCTB was made.\n\n【17】<img/>\n\n【18】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【20】(A) Subarticular lytic expansile lesion of the distal ulna in the epiphysis and metaphysis showing a ‘soap bubble appearance’.

Denosumab was administered with a 2-week interval between the first and second doses and every 4 weeks thereafter for a total of five doses. After five injections of denosumab, the patient’s wrist pain resolved and the ROM improved to 60° of supination, 60° of dorsal flexion and 70° of volar flexion. X-ray imaging revealed tumour shrinkage and osteosclerosis of the margins .\n\n【23】Surgical resection was performed under general anaesthesia 5 months after the first presentation. En bloc bone resection and ulnar stabilisation were performed using the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon because the original tumour was Campanacci grade III, which has a high reported rate of local recurrence, particularly in areas where it is difficult to perform curettage treatment, such as the distal forearm or finger bones. A portion of the ulna, measuring 7 cm, was resected. The ECU tendon was cut into half at the distal end, passed through a hole at the end of the ulna and fixed to the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon. Subsequently, the extensor retinaculum was partially inverted and sutured to the ECU tendon to stabilise the ulnar bone .\n\n【24】<img/>\n\n【25】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【26】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2</u>\n\n【27】(A) Postoperative radiograph of the wrist after the first operation during which a 7 cm resection of the distal end of the ulna was performed.

MRI revealed the recurrence of an oval-shaped tumour measuring 6 cm in the soft tissues of the distal ulna, with an internal signal similar to that of a GCTB—low T1 and iso signal to high T2 signal. In addition, the tumour displayed a contrast effect, similar to that of a GCTB .

A review of the literature of the past 10 years since denosumab was first clinically used revealed that there were 19 reports describing 44 cases of Campanacci grade II and III distal ulnar GCTB ( table 1 ).\n\n【47】View this table:\n\n【48】   View inline\n   View popup\n\n【49】Table 1\n\n【50】Case reports of Campanacci grade II and III distal ulna giant cell tumour of bone in the previous 10 years\n\n【51】In 13 cases, bone curettage was performed in the initial surgery, 6–11 in which at least three were grade III cases. However, there was local recurrence in all grade III cases, 7 11 suggesting that en bloc resection is necessary in such conditions. Among the patients who underwent en bloc resection in the first surgery, only one exhibited local recurrence; this was a soft tissue recurrence, as noted in the present case. 12 Tendons or implants were used for reconstruction in 15 cases (15/35, 42.9%), 9 13–20 and all these cases exhibited favourable postoperative results. The most common method for stabilisation of the ulnar stump is using the ECU tendon. 9 13 17 In three studies, prosthetic reconstruction with implant arthroplasty of the distal radioulnar joint was reported, 14–16 while reconstruction of the distal radioulnar joint using an iliac bone block and screws—a modification of the Sauvé-Kapandji procedure—was reported in two studies. 18–20 Ferguson et al 13 and Papanastassiou et al 9 reported that reconstruction was not essential based on case comparisons of their own studies. In fact, in more than half of the reviewed cases, no reconstruction was performed, and almost all obtained favourable results (average Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scoring system score: 88.7%, range 30%–100%). Although the indication remains controversial, unlike in cases of trauma, reconstruction of the distal ulnar portion may not be mandatory in cases of slow-growing tumours if the tumour size is relatively small. However, considering that in most cases there was no long-term follow-up, we believe that it is better to consider reconstruction, particularly in younger patients when the disadvantages of reconstruction are not significant. In the present case, we obtained favourable results by resecting 7 cm (distal one-third portion) of the ulna and reconstructing it using the ECU tendon, which is the most common reconstruction method.\n\n【52】Denosumab was used as a preoperative adjuvant in three cases (3/45, 6.7%). 11 21 22 In all cases, denosumab was used in the same dosage and manner (120 mg every 4 weeks with additional loading doses of 120 mg on days 8 and 15 of the first month) for 3–6 months. In addition, denosumab was used only preoperatively in all three cases. There were no reports of decreased efficacy when used at the time of recurrence, as in this case. McCarthy et al 21 described the effects of a short preoperative course of denosumab on distal forearm GCTB, and all patients experienced some pain relief after initiating denosumab. They suggested that the origin of pain may be multifactorial, including mechanical stress from tumour-related pressure, expansion of the periosteum, loss of structurally significant bone and mechanical failure. In addition, the production of prostaglandins, endothelin and other noxious factors by the tumour itself is known to cause pain. Similar to that report, in our case, short-term preoperative denosumab use resulted in pain alleviation and improvement in ROM of the wrist. Sanchez-Pareja et al 22 reported that a slight tumour enlargement was observed immediately after denosumab use. Although there was some concern regarding sarcomatous changes, they ultimately concluded that the changes were a reactive phenomenon. In our case, osteosclerosis was observed, as reported in other studies, 21 22 which might have facilitated the removal of the tumour but did not reduce its size.\n\n【53】A recent review of the preoperative use of denosumab in treating GCTB 5 suggests that it should be avoided owing to the risk of tumour cells getting trapped in the sclerotic bone cortex and that bone curettage is the treatment of choice. However, there is no definitive indication regarding its use when en bloc resection is performed. 4 5 23 In our case, the sclerosis of the mass edges and the degree of swelling that reduced the patient’s pain and ROM restriction proved advantageous and facilitated surgical resection; however, soft tissue recurrence was a disadvantage. It is possible that dormant tumour cells that remained in the soft tissues could have been activated when denosumab was discontinued after the surgery. 24\n\n【54】Given the effect of denosumab on the tumour, it may be necessary to continue its use as adjuvant therapy even after surgery; however, evidence on the safety of long-term denosumab use in young patients has not been established. 24 25 Furthermore, a previous report discussed a rare case wherein sarcomatous changes were observed after denosumab use. 26 Therefore, the effects of long-term use of denosumab in young patients with GCTB require further investigation, and more case studies are necessary. Furthermore, there is no report that denosumab use could contribute to soft tissue recurrence. Tumour recurrence in the soft tissues after en bloc resection itself is rare (1.5%–3.1%). 27 It is also possible that there are consequences to denosumab discontinuation; nevertheless, details of the pharmacological effects are unknown.\n\n【55】In summary, we report a rare case of distal ulnar GCTB where soft tissue recurrence occurred despite performing en bloc resection. A review of the literature revealed that patients with grade III distal ulnar GCTB require at least en bloc resection; however, reconstruction may not be mandatory in some cases. Preoperative denosumab use alone may be insufficient to achieve acceptable oncological outcomes. It is also possible that denosumab may be less effective at the time of tumour recurrence. The duration and appropriate dose of denosumab should be investigated in future research.\n\n【56】### Learning points\n\n【57】   This is a rare case of giant cell tumour of bone wherein the patient developed soft tissue recurrence despite undergoing en bloc resection.\n\n【58】   It is unclear whether the use of denosumab affected the soft tissue recurrence.\n\n【59】   The therapeutic effect of denosumab at the time of recurrence was possibly poor.\n\n【60】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【61】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【62】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Physical examination demonstrated macrocephaly and left hemiplegia with hyperreflexia. CT revealed a large hyperdense mass centred in the right parietal lobe . MRI demonstrated reduced diffusivity, mixed solid and cystic features, heterogeneous enhancement and susceptibility artefact . The radiographic differential included infantile high-grade glioma, embryonal tumour (atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour, embryonal tumour with multi-layered rosettes) and anaplastic ependymoma. The patient underwent near total tumour resection. Histopathological findings revealed a highly cellular tumour composed of cells with round uniform nuclei with open chromatin, small distinct nucleoli and scant cytoplasm . Tumour cells showed immunohistochemical reactivity for NKX2.2 and CD99 with a high Ki67 proliferation index . A sarcoma targeted gene fusion panel confirmed the presence of an EWSR1::FLI1 fusion, consistent with a diagnosis of primary intracranial Ewing sarcoma (ES). Staging evaluations included a whole-body positron emission tomography scan, bone marrow study and cerebrospinal fluid cytology, all of which excluded evidence of systemic disease. The patient was treated with focal proton radiation therapy followed by an Ewing tumour-based chemotherapy regimen of vincristine, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide. The patient has no evidence of disease 3 years post therapy with normal development and mild left hemiparesis.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】   Download figure\n   Open in new tab\n   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1</u>\n\n【8】Neuroimaging features of a primary intracranial Ewing sarcoma.
