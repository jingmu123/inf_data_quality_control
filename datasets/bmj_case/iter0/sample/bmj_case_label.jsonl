The 2019 edition of the Nosology & Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders classifies osteogenesis imperfecta into type 1 (non-deformation with persistently blue sclerae), type 2 (perinatal lethal form), type 3 (progressively deforming type), type 4 (moderate form), 1 type 5—which is accompanied by interosseous calcification/hyperplastic callus—and other types. Type 1 is the most common type of osteogenesis imperfecta among adults.\n\n【10】In more than 90% of cases, osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by genetic mutations ( _COL1A1, COL1A2_ ) affecting type I collagen, which is a major component of connective tissue, especially in the bones and ligaments. Clinically, patients with osteogenesis imperfecta exhibit susceptibility to fracture, growth disorders, hearing loss, hyperextension of the joints and skin and valvular disease. In 1965, Manschot demonstrated that osteogenesis imperfecta is associated with thinning of the cornea and sclera as well as blue scleral findings. 2 In 2014, Wallace _et al_ 3 reported an association between osteogenesis imperfecta and open-angle glaucoma. Other typical ocular findings are myopia and keratoconus. However, only three case reports have described macular neovascularisation (MNV) occurring in the context of osteogenesis imperfecta. 4–6\n\n【11】In this report, we discuss a case in which MNV resulted in metamorphopsia and decreased visual acuity in a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta, exhibiting a novel _COL1A1_ gene mutation (p.Tyr165\\*).\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A woman in her 30s who reported experiencing metamorphopsia and diminished visual acuity in her right eye for 1 month was referred to Oita University Hospital for detailed examination. Although she had four fractures during her childhood, she had no history of systemic illness. She also disclosed that her otolaryngologist had diagnosed hearing loss, the cause of which remained unknown. Blue sclerae were also observed in two of the patient’s children (both male). The elder son, who was 9 years old, had several histories of fractures and was short in stature. The younger son, who was 7 years old, had a history of fractures in early childhood.\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】Decimal visual acuity was 0.4×−3.5D in her right eye and 1.2×−3.5D in her left eye. Ocular pressure was 14 mmHg in her right eye and 15 mmHg in her left eye. Axial length was 23.97 mm in her right eye and 23.96 mm in her left eye. Both eyes exhibited blue sclerae ( figure 1 ). Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) indicated that corneal thickness was 421 µm in the right eye and 427 µm in the left eye. There were no noteworthy findings in the optic media, and her left fundus was normal. However, her right fundus exhibited a greyish-white exudative lesion with haemorrhage, extending into the parafovea and serous retinal detachment (size: 2 papillae) ( figure 2A ). Fundus autofluorescence images showed a faint hypofluorescence consistent with the range of serous retinal detachment and a hypofluorescence in the area of the subretinal haemorrhage ( figure 2B ). A highly reflexive exudative neovascular complex above the retinal pigment epithelium was also observed on OCT images ( figure 3A ). There was no local thickening of the choroid or compression of the choriocapillaris, and the thickness of the choroid was almost normal. OCT angiography B-scan clearly demonstrated a blood flow signal consistent with the exudative lesion in the parafovea ( figure 3B ). Reconstructed composite images showed clear subretinal vascular networks ( figure 3C ). Based on the above, the patient was diagnosed with type 2 MNV.\n\n【16】<img/>\n\n【17】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【18】Figure 1\n\n【19】Photograph of the anterior segment of the eye at the first visit (blue sclerae).

(C) The composite image of OCTA shows the clear subretinal vascular networks (yellow arrow).\n\n【28】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【29】Osteogenesis imperfecta was suspected based on the presence of blue sclerae, the patient’s history of hearing loss/fracture and the results of a bone mineral density test. Relative to the Young Adult Mean, bone mineral densities for the right femur, left femur and lumbar spine were 62%, 60% and 72%, respectively, which were lower than the standard value of 80% or more. Genetic analysis via next-generation sequencing revealed a novel variant of a nonsense mutation in _COL1A1_ (heterozygous, c.495T>A, p.Tyr165\\*). Furthermore, the relevant spot was confirmed by Sanger method ( figure 4 ). Based on the above results, a definitive diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta was made.\n\n【30】<img/>\n\n【31】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【32】Figure 4\n\n【33】We performed Sanger sequencing of the coding exon of the _COL1A1_ gene using following primers: 5′-TGATCTGGACCTCCCAAGC-3′(sense) and 5′-CACATCACACCAGGAAGTGC-3′(antisense). _COL1A1_ mutation (heterozygous, c.495T>A, p.Tyr165\\*) was confirmed (red arrow).\n\n【34】Treatment\n---------\n\n【35】After ruling out pregnancy, an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab was administered on the day of the visit.\n\n【36】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【37】One month after the initial diagnosis, serous retinal detachment had disappeared, and corrected visual acuity had improved to 0.7 in the right eye. Two months later, corrected visual acuity in the right eye had improved to 1.2. OCT and OCT angiography revealed a marked reduction in the neovascularisation signal when compared with that observed before treatment ( figure 5 ). However, 1 month later, mild serous retinal detachment was observed again, although corrected visual acuity in her right eye remained unchanged at 1.2. A second injection of ranibizumab into the vitreous body promptly attenuated the exudative changes. After 25 months, she has had no relapse of the lesion, and corrected visual acuity in the right eye remains unchanged at 1.2.\n\n【38】<img/>\n\n【39】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【40】Figure 5\n\n【41】Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and angiography (OCTA) images obtained 2 months after treatment.

(B) OCTA B-scan clearly demonstrated a blood flow signal consistent with MNV reduction. (C) The composite image of OCTA shows that MNV had diminished dramatically (yellow arrow).\n\n【42】Discussion\n----------\n\n【43】The present report is the first to discuss a case of MNV associated with osteogenesis imperfecta in Japan. Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta exhibit blue sclerae due to scleral thinning and transparency of the choroid, resulting from collagen abnormalities. This sign can also be observed in patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. In general, in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, abnormalities in type I collagen reduce ocular rigidity, resulting in axial elongation of the globe and myopia associated with the development of posterior staphyloma.\n\n【44】Bruch’s membrane is composed of five layers. From the retinal side, these layers are the basement membrane of retinal pigment epithelial cells, the inner collagen layer, the elastic plate, the outer collagen layer and the basement membrane of choroidal capillaries. Since the inner and outer collagen layers contain type I collagen, _COL1A1_ mutation may explain weakening of Bruch’s membrane in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. In all previous reports of MNV associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, the presence of lacquer cracks was confirmed. 4–6 Rishi _et al_ reported that a 12-year-old girl developed a lacquer crack after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, speculating that the temporary increase in intraocular pressure after intravitreal injection or contraction of the retinal pigment epithelium associated with the retraction of MNV caused the Bruch’s membrane to rupture. Bellanca _et al_ 5 reported lacquer cracks in a 28-year-old man with osteogenesis imperfecta who did not use antivascular endothelial growth factor drugs. Despite treatment for MNV, the patient developed lacquer cracks, which may have been due to decreased tension and ankylosis of the eyeball resulting from eyeball elongation.\n\n【45】In the present case, no clear lacquer cracks were observed either before or after treatment. Although refractive errors can develop over a long period of time, the error observed in our patient was smaller than that indicated in previous reports, and no conspicuous extension of the ocular axis was observed. In addition, we speculate that the nonsense mutation (p.Tyr165\\*) in _COL1A1_ detected in our patient was not a dominant-negative mutation but instead represented a null allele due to nonsense codon-mediated mRNA degradation, resulting in haploinsufficiency. Therefore, although susceptibility to fracture and mild hearing loss were observed in the present case, systemic symptoms remained mild and did not interfere with daily life. We believe that lacquer cracks did not occur given that the patient exhibited only mild weakening of Bruch’s membrane.\n\n【46】Some reports have described genetic mutations affecting other types of collagen, which have also been associated with fragility of Bruch’s membrane. Corominas _et al_ 7 reported an association between exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and _COL8A1_ gene mutation. According to their report, hyperpigmentation of the macula occurred in patients with early AMD exhibiting the _COL8A1_ mutation, who exhibited a greater degree of myopia than those without the mutation. Previous mouse studies have suggested that structural changes in Bruch’s membrane associated with the _COL8A1_ mutation lead to the onset of AMD. Thus, abnormalities in collagen fibres may lead to fragility of Bruch’s membrane, thereby resulting in structural changes and contributing to MNV. Indeed, we speculate that such weakening occurred in our patient due to changes in type I collagen in both the inner and outer layers, resulting from _COL1A1_ mutation.\n\n【47】Fortunately, in the present case, rapid improvement of the exudative changes and suppression of relapse were achieved with only two intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. Furthermore, since MNV was located slightly inferior to the fovea centralis, improvements in visual acuity were better than those reported for previous cases. 4–6 Since fragility of Bruch’s membrane represents the basis of onset, recurrence and relapse are likely in patients exhibited MNV, highlighting the need for regular follow-up.\n\n【48】In conclusion, we discussed a case of MNV associated with osteogenesis imperfecta due to a nonsense mutation in _COL1A1_ (p.Tyr165 \\*). We believe that thinning of the cornea and sclera decreased the rigidity in the globe, and weakening of Bruch’s membrane due to abnormalities in type I collagen contributed to the onset of MNV in our patient.\n\n【49】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【50】(The author translated the patient’s perspective into English.)\n\n【51】From an early age, I felt that my eyes were of a different colour from the people around me. I did not really care because I thought this was because the pigment of my body was lighter than the others.\n\n【52】Since I was in elementary school, I had repeated fractures and my wrists and fingers remained bent. My vision gradually became myopic. I had never been told that these are symptoms of this disease (osteogenesis imperfecta).\n\n【53】This time, my field of vision suddenly became unclear, landscapes were distorted, and my vision became blurry; it became difficult for me to see. I even hit the wall several times. I went to an ophthalmologist because I was afraid that I would lose my eyesight.\n\n【54】For the first time, I learnt the blue colour of the white of my eye (conjunctiva), the repeated fractures I experienced and macular neovascularisation in my eyes were symptoms of osteogenesis imperfecta.\n\n【55】The two injections I received into my eyes were very scary. Thanks to that I am getting better and living the same life as before. However, I am worried that it may recur every time I come to the hospital for a regular check-up.\n\n【56】I was worried that my two sons had inherited it, so my sons also underwent genetic testing. Turns out that both of them had inherited the disease; this shook me more than when I discovered that I had the disease.\n\n【57】I really did not want them to inherit it. It took me some time to make up my mind that I had to deal with this illness along with my two children.\n\n【58】Since both my children have low bone density, they experience several fractures and sprains. Hence, I have spoken with the school teachers and have told them that my children need to avoid strenuous exercises and that they should not bump into other people. I think my children will be more anxious because they are planning to receive intravenous drip treatment, but I would like to face this illness and live.\n\n【59】### Learning points\n\n【60】*   Osteogenesis imperfecta was suspected based on the presence of blue sclerae, the patient’s history of hearing loss, fracture and the results of a bone mineral density test.\n    \n*   Rapid improvement of the exudative changes and suppression of relapse were achieved with only two intravitreal injections of ranibizumab.\n    \n*   Thinning of the cornea and sclera decreased the rigidity in the globe, and weakening of Bruch’s membrane due to abnormalities in type I collagen may have contributed to the onset of macular neovascularisation in our patient.\n    \n*   Since fragility of the Bruch’s membrane represents the basis of onset, recurrence and relapse are likely in patients exhibited macular neovascularisation, highlighting the need for regular follow-up.\n    \n\n【61】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【62】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【63】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【64】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【65】We would like to thank Editage (www.editage.com) for English language editing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

It is an intermediate-grade malignancy that rarely metastatizes, but has a high recurrence rate. Diagnosis is established by histopathology. 1 Here, we describe a typical presentation of DFSP in a woman and the utility of dermoscopy and radiologic imaging in the diagnosis and management.\n\n【5】A woman in her 40s presented with an asymptomatic enlarging lesion on her right shoulder from past 1 year. Examination revealed a firm, non-tender, skin-coloured to brown multilobular plaque measuring about 1.5×1.5 cm ( figure 1A ). Polarised dermoscopy (using DermLite DL3, 3Gen, San Juan Capistrano, California, USA) from different areas of the lesion revealed white homogeneous structureless areas surrounded by linear serpentine and branching vessels ( figure 1B ), linear serpentine vessels on a pink background ( figure 1C ) and pigment network over a whitish background ( figure 1D ). The clinico-dermoscopic diagnosis of DFSP was confirmed by histopathology showing monomorphic spindle-shaped cells, without atypia or mitoses, diffusely infiltrating the dermis and subcutis in whorls or storiform pattern. Epidermis showed increased melanisation of basal layer ( figure 2A ). Immunohistochemistry was not performed due to lack of facilities. CT delineated a well-defined soft tissue attenuation mass extending into subcutaneous plane ( figure 2B ) and also confirmed absence of chest metastases ( figure 2C ). Based on the radiological delineation of the tumour, a wide excision with 2 cm margins was performed and the wound closed primarily. Intraoperative frozen sections and postoperative histological assessment revealed tumour-free resection margins. Regular follow-up (once in 3 months) was advised.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Skin-coloured to brown circumscribed plaque with multilobular surface (A).

The trunk, shoulders and pelvic region are frequently involved. Other forms include morphea-like, atrophoderma-like and angioma-like DFSP. Majority of the patients exhibit a t(17;22)(q22;q13) translocation predisposing tumour formation following trauma. 1 2 Common dermoscopic features in DFSP include pink background, hypopigmented or depigmented areas, arborizing telangiectasia, linear vessels, shiny white structures and pigment network. 3 We observed similar features. The homogeneous white areas correspond to diffuse fibroblast aggregates, telangiectasia to the dilated vessels and pigment network to the increased basal layer melanisation.\n\n【15】Microscopically, DFSP is a tumour localised to deep dermis and subcutis showing diffuse infiltration of monomorphic cells in whorled or storiform patterns. The cells show small oval or spindle-shaped nuclei with scanty cytoplasm and low mitotic rate. Immunohistochemically, majority show positivity with CD34 and negativity with FXIIIa, SMA, desmin, S100 and cytokeratins. Histological variants include a fibrosarcomatous type (showing high mitotic index and marked nuclear atypia) and a pigmented variant (Bednar tumour). 1 2 4 On CT imaging, DFSP commonly shows well-defined isodense cutaneous or subcutaneous nodule without calcification. We noted similar features. MRI usually shows a well-defined isodense nodule compared with muscle on T1-weighted images, and on ultrasound, as a low echogenic mass with rich vascularity. 5\n\n【16】Although metastasis and fibrosarcoma transformation are rare, being locally infiltrative, DFSP has a high postoperative relapse rate. Hence, the principal aim of surgery is to ensure clean tumour-free resection margins. Mohs micrographic surgery is hence considered ideal. Wide excision with at least 2 cm margin is recommended if the latter is not possible. For recurrent lesions requiring wide and deep resection and/or for facial lesions, ensuring complete excision to achieve tumour-free resection margins and achieving best possible aesthetic outcomes are necessary. In this regard, pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap and anterolateral thigh perforator free flap reconstructions have been employed to good effect. 6 7 Most of the recurrences after primary excision tend to occur within the first 3 years with a median of 32 months noted in a study. 1 8 9 Hence, a quarterly to half-yearly follow-up during this period and a lifelong annual follow-up thereafter is recommended. Complete physical, cutaneous and systemic examination should be performed at each visit and robust evaluation done only when metastasis is suspected. 1 8\n\n【17】### Learning points\n\n【18】*   Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare fibrohistiocytic tumour that is considered intermediate between benign dermatofibroma and malignant fibrosarcoma.\n    \n*   Although histologically exhibits banal features, DFSP is a locally infiltrative tumour accounting for its high recurrence rate following excision and can rarely metastatize.\n    \n*   Diagnosis of DFSP is established by histopathology. Dermoscopy and radiological assessment are useful non-invasive adjuncts to assert the clinical diagnosis. The latter also helps in delineating the tumour extent to facilitate optimal surgical resection and also in ruling out distant metastases.\n    \n\n【19】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【20】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【21】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Over the month prior to presentation, the patient noticed two growing nodules over his right distal forearm. He reported occasional bleeding of the lesions with trauma but denied associated pain or pruritus. Over-the-counter salicylic acid gel for treatment of presumed warts did not improve his symptoms. Further history revealed he had been off antiretroviral therapy for one year and had been potentially scratched by a cat prior to the development of the cutaneous nodules. On examination, he had two violaceous, umbilicated nodules with overlying haemorrhagic crust on his right distal forearm without regional lymphadenopathy ( figure 1 ). Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Laboratory testing demonstrated a mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase (55 U/L), and normal alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. Complement fixation antibody titer for _Histoplasma_ yeast was 1:8, but urine _Histoplasma_ antigen was undetectable. Rapid plasma reagin was unreactive, and interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis was negative. _Bartonella henselae_ and _Bartonella quintana_ antibody titers were negative. Abdominal and pelvic CT displayed two subcentimeter hepatic hypodensities with peripheral enhancement and numerous splenic hypodensities associated with abdominal lymphadenopathy ( figure 2 ). A punch biopsy of the skin was performed ( figure 3 ), and Warthin-Starry staining demonstrated clusters of bacteria, confirming the diagnosis of bacillary angiomatosis (BA) ( figure 4 ). HHV8 staining was negative. In addition to the cutaneous lesions, his hepatosplenic lesions were thought to represent bacillary peliosis, a rare manifestation of splenic and hepatic involvement of _Bartonella_ , most commonly _B. henselae_ . 1 2 Parenteral therapy is generally recommended for bacillary peliosis; however, because of the patient’s initial improvement on oral doxycycline 100 mg two times per day, the infectious diseases team recommended oral doxycycline for 3 months. Doxycycline was chosen over erythromycin because of its more favourable side effect profile, but either can be used in treatment based on consensus guidelines. 3 4 At a six-month follow-up visit, the skin lesions and fevers had resolved.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Violaceous, umbilicated nodules with overlying haemorrhagic crust over the right distal forearm.\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealing numerous hepatosplenic hypodensities.\n\n【13】<img/>\n\n【14】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【15】Figure 3\n\n【16】Punch biopsy with H&E staining, demonstrating vascular proliferation and clusters of pleomorphic basophilic bacilli in the stroma.\n\n【17】<img/>\n\n【18】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【19】Figure 4\n\n【20】Positive Warthin-Starry stain revealing clusters of bacteria.\n\n【21】Bacillary angiomatosis is a vasoproliferative disease caused by _B. henselae_ and _B. quintana_ . Cats are a reservoir for _B. henselae_ , and cat licks, scratches and bites often precede BA development. 2 _Bartonella_ spp replicate within erythrocytes and can spread haematogenously to the skin, bone, lymph nodes and brain. 1 5 Cutaneous lesions present as friable red-purple papules, nodules or ulcers. 2 6 The differential diagnoses of BA include pyogenic granuloma, atypical mycobacterial infection, cutaneous tuberculosis, endemic fungal infection and Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS). Cutaneous lesions of KS can be clinically indistinguishable from BA and must be considered in the differential in HIV-infected patients. Thus, histopathology is required for diagnosis. BA pathology shows lobular capillary proliferation with endothelial swelling, neutrophils and leucocytoclasia. Bacteria aggregates are detected with Warthin-Starry staining. 6 Histological features of KS include spindle cell proliferation with intervening slit-like spaces and erythrocyte extravasation. 7 Additionally, HHV8 staining is typically positive. Treatment with oral or intravenous erythromycin or doxycycline is recommended with close monitoring for relapse. 3 4\n\n【22】### Learning points\n\n【23】*   Bacillary angiomatosis, caused by infection with _Bartonella henselae_ or _B. quintana_ , is characterised by violaceous papulonodules on the skin and is most commonly seen in the setting of AIDS.\n    \n*   The cutaneous lesions of bacillary angiomatosis may mimic Kaposi’s sarcoma, and skin biopsy is necessary to distinguish these two diagnoses.\n    \n*   Rarely, bacillary angiomatosis can be complicated by splenitis or hepatic involvement, termed bacillary peliosis.\n    \n\n【24】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【25】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【26】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Although the IOP was initially in the low teens after surgery, we found an increase in IOP at 6 months follow-up to 26 mm Hg which required ocular hypotensive therapy. Gonioscopy was performed to view the site of goniectomy and revealed a crumpled strip of Trabecular meshwork (TM) which had readhered to its original location blocking the canal ( figure 1A ), and this was further confirmed on anterior segment Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) ( figure 1B ). On reviewing the surgical video of the same patient, we identified a large strip of TM floating in the anterior chamber, which was left in situ without removal ( figure 1C,D ).\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】In open angle glaucoma patient (A) at 6 months postoperative follow-up gonioscopy showing the strip of TM crumpled and reattached to its original location (red arrow), (B) the crumpled and reattached TM was confirmed with AS-OCT (blue arrow), (C) while goniectomy showing strip of TM in the angle (sharp yellow arrow), (D) while during irrigation and aspiration (I&A) the same strip of TM freely floating in the anterior chamber (green broad arrow).\n\n【10】To prevent this reattachment of TM after Minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS) procedures which involve stripping of the TM, we recommend cutting of the TM strip using micro vitreo-retinal scissors which ensures patency of the canal in the postoperative period ( figure 2A,B,C,D ). Another option is to pierce the TM creating an initial cut and then stripping the adjacent TM up to the cut to create a free-floating strip which can be removed with a forceps.\n\n【11】<img/>\n\n【12】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【13】Figure 2\n\n【14】Modified technique of goniectomy in another open angle glaucoma patient, where (A) showing the strip free hanging TM cutting with micro vitreo-retinal scissors (green arrow), (B) cut end of the strip of TM removing from the angle and anterior chamber (yellow arrow), (C) AS-OCT confirmed the widely opened goniectomy cleft without any overhanging strip in the angle (white broad arrow), immediately after cutting the strip of TM, (D) at 6 weeks follow-up the same confirmed with AS-OCT widely opened and without any narrowing of the goniectomy cleft.\n\n【15】In conclusion, while performing ab-interno goniotomy/goniectomy and stripping of the TM, there is a risk of readhesion of the TM.

Our case presents a 45-year-old woman diagnosed with pelvic endometriosis in her youth. She underwent several vaginal surgeries due to pelvic organ prolapse, symptoms of stress incontinence and decreased urinary flow. One year after her most recent vaginal surgery, she developed a tender lump in the lower part of the anterior vaginal wall. A urethral diverticulum was suspected, but a diagnostic puncture and biopsy unexpectedly showed histologically verified endometriosis. As the cyst recurred, surgical excision of all visible endometriosis tissue was performed. After 3 years of follow-up, the patient remained without recurrence. This case illustrates the risk of atypical implantation of endometriosis related to repeated urogynaecological surgery and that treatment requires surgery with thorough removal of all visible tissues.\n\n【2】*   obstetrics and gynaecology\n*   urological surgery\n*   vulvovaginal disorders\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

It is an oestrogen-dependent condition and, therefore, mainly present in the reproductive years. The prevalence is approximately 5% among fertile women. Pelvic endometriosis accounts for most cases with main localisations in ovaries and peritoneum (uterovesical fossa, ovarian fossa, pouch of Douglas). 1\n\n【10】Vaginal endometriosis is predominantly described as being part of deep infiltrating endometriosis in the posterior fornix. 2 However, endometriosis can also be diagnosed in more distal parts of the vagina, where it accounts for less than 1% of extrapelvic cases. 3 This case draws attention to a rare location of endometriosis after repeated urogynaecological surgery in order to enable early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】Our 45-year-old patient was referred to a urogynaecological clinic due to stress incontinence, decreased urine flow and nycturia. Despite the urine flow, she was planned for a tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) and anterior colporrhaphy. However, a cyst in the lower part of the anterior vaginal wall was identified, and surgery was postponed.\n\n【13】The patient had menarche at the age of 14, followed by regular periods without significant dysmenorrhoea. In her early 20s, she underwent laparoscopy two times: one diagnostic laparoscopy due to infertility without any signs of endometriosis, and one laparoscopy due to pain in which case peritoneal endometriosis was diagnosed. No deep endometriosis was found. She was treated with oral contraception for 1.5 years.\n\n【14】She had three spontaneous pregnancies and uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at the age of 25, 26 and 33. At the age of 34, she underwent laparoscopic sterilisation.\n\n【15】After her pregnancies, she developed symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse. During her 30s and early 40s, she underwent three vaginal operations: Manchester operation (including amputation of cervix and anterior colporrhaphy), anterior colporrhaphy and posterior colporrhaphy.\n\n【16】Her medical history included well-treated hypothyroidism and depression. There was no history of smoking or alcohol abuse. Body mass index was 30.9.\n\n【17】One year after the last vaginal surgery, she experienced pain and irregular periods with spotting. Vaginal examination revealed a tender process in the anterior vaginal wall at the level of the bladder neck.\n\n【18】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【19】Ultrasonography revealed a cystic structure with suspicion of a urethral diverticulum. The T1-weighted images from an MRI scan showed a hyperintense 1.5 cm large cystic structure in the anterior vaginal wall, about 3 cm from the vaginal introitus, compatible with a blood-filled cyst ( figure 1 ). The vaginal cyst was punctured, and a histological evaluation of a biopsy revealed endometriosis. No further treatment was initiated as the patient had no additional symptoms.\n\n【20】<img/>\n\n【21】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【22】Figure 1\n\n【23】The endometriosis infiltration shown on MRI in coronal and sagittal plane.\n\n【24】Eight months later, a tender process was discovered at the same location, but without dyspareunia or bleeding. However, the patient still suffered from stress urinary incontinence and decreased urine flow.\n\n【25】The patient was then referred to The Endometriosis Centre at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet. Examination showed an infiltration in the lower third of the anterior vaginal wall, and ultrasonography disclosed a cyst close to the urethra with ground glass echogenicity measuring 1.5×2 cm close to the urethra. MRI confirmed the preliminary results and also visualised additional related smaller cysts.\n\n【26】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【27】A urethral diverticulum or a benign cyst was suspected at first due to the patient’s urinary stress incontinence and concomitantly decreased urinary flow. To exclude another relevant differential diagnosis as Gartner duct cyst, Skene’s gland cyst and haemangioma, a biopsy was made.\n\n【28】Treatment\n---------\n\n【29】While awaiting the indicated surgical excision, the patient had developed cyclic pain from the process. It was treated with oral progestin (Provera 5 mg/day) for 1 month without success.\n\n【30】The surgery was initiated with a cystourethroscopy to ensure a normal urethra. The vaginal mucosa was opened in the lower part of the anterior wall. By sharp dissection, the vaginal cysts were excised from the location next to the bladder floor close to the urethra ( figure 2 ). In total, three cysts were enucleated, the largest with a diameter of 2.5 cm. Classical endometriosis cyst content was found. All visible endometriotic tissues were removed. Finally, the patient had an intrauterine hormonal device (IUD).\n\n【31】<img/>\n\n【32】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【33】Figure 2\n\n【34】Surgical excision of the endometriosis cysts from the anterior vaginal wall.\n\n【35】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【36】Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of endometriosis. The IUD was removed due to migraine after 6 months.\n\n【37】Before the originally planned urogynaecological surgery, a follow-up MRI scan showed no recurrence of endometriosis, and the patient underwent anterior colporrhaphy and TVT with success. At 3 years of follow-up, the patient was still without recurrence of endometriosis.\n\n【38】Discussion\n----------\n\n【39】This case illustrates that endometriosis may implant in the distal part of the anterior vaginal wall after repeated urogynaecological surgery.\n\n【40】Vaginal endometriosis is usually found in the posterior fornix. The pathogenesis for this location is still debated. However, a widespread understanding is that it arises from the rectovaginal septum as part of deep endometriosis. 4\n\n【41】Endometriosis in the distal part of the anterior wall of the vagina is rare, and the origin for this placement is unknown.\n\n【42】At the time of the examination of our patient, there were no similar cases to be found in the present research. However, while writing this case, an Australian case with a similar location of endometriosis has been reported. 5 That case presents a patient with uncomplicated vaginal deliveries but without a history of gynaecological surgeries in contrast to our case.\n\n【43】Direct spreading of endometrial tissue and implantation during vaginal delivery should be considered, as endometrial tissue hypothetically could implant during delivery. But in that case, large numbers of vaginal endometriosis would be expected. Our patient’s symptoms occurred more than 10 years after her last delivery, which is a long time for asymptomatic proliferation of endometrial tissue. For these reasons, direct spreading is a less likely explanation.\n\n【44】A more plausible explanation is iatrogenic dissemination (implantation) after comprehensive vaginal surgeries (two anterior colporrhaphies) prior to a diagnosis of endometriosis. Especially, the Manchester operation including amputation of cervix and anterior colporrhaphy could lead to iatrogenic dissemination of endometrial tissue. This assumption is based on the fact that scar endometriosis is well known 6 7 and theories of endometrial tissue spillage during surgery have been described before. A large Swedish register study found a hazard risk of 1.8 for general pelvic endometriosis in women, who had had a previous caesarean section, compared with women with only vaginal delivery. 8 This corresponds with the general understanding, that the risk of postsurgical endometriosis does not correlate to a preoperative diagnosis of endometriosis. In case stories, the anticipation is that postoperative endometriosis is found after laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy with morcellation of the uterus. 9 10 In a case–control study with 464 women undergoing hysterectomy (277 of them had a laparoscopic supravaginal hysterectomy (LSH) with morcellation; 187 had a transvaginal or abdominal hysterectomy without morcellation), a rate of 1.4% of postoperative endometriosis was found after hysterectomy, with no difference between the LSH group and the control group. 11 Our patient was diagnosed with peritoneal endometriosis nearly 30 years before the latest vaginal surgery. Based on previous case stories, iatrogenic implantation due to repeated vaginal surgery is the most likely explanation for this rare location, even though the mentioned case–control study did not find such a connection.\n\n【45】The symptomatology of endometriosis depends on the location of the endometrial tissue, but commonly dysmenorrhea, chronic pain, fatigue and infertility are described. 12 The broad symptomatology and delayed diagnosis can lower the health-related quality of life significantly for the patients. 13\n\n【46】This patient had a tender distal vaginal swelling and occasional irregular bleeding and associated pain. In the beginning, the pain was unspecific but became cyclic. The main complaints from the patient were urinary incontinence (stress type) and decreased urinary flow. Therefore, a urethral diverticulum or a benign cyst was suspected at first. Under usual conditions, a TVT would not be planned for patients with urinary incontinence and decreased urinary flow, but in this case, the decreased flow was most likely due to obstruction by the endometriotic nodule in the lower anterior vaginal wall. Because of the rare location, endometriosis was not suspected initially, even though the patient was diagnosed with endometriosis in the past. To our knowledge, no studies have shown that patients with previously described endometriosis have a higher risk of scar endometriosis than the background population.\n\n【47】The evidence for treating extragenital endometriosis is limited and mainly published in case reports and case series. 14 In this case, the conservative hormone treatment of the vaginal endometriosis infiltration was unsuccessful with limited relief of pain. Only surgical excision removed the obstruction.\n\n【48】Despite advanced surgery, recurrence of parietal endometriosis lesions occurs in 5% of cases in the literature. 15 However, recurrence incidence varies as it is non-uniformly defined in the literature. 16 The present patient underwent one surgery with removal of all visible endometriotic tissues with no recurrence reported after 3-years of follow-up.\n\n【49】### Learning points\n\n【50】*   The symptomatology of endometriosis is extensive.\n    \n*   Endometriosis must be suspected in patients presenting with a tender swelling in the distal part of the vagina.\n    \n*   Atypical implantation of endometrial tissue is a possible risk after repeated urogynaecological surgery.\n    \n*   Time from surgery to the onset of symptoms can extend over years.\n    \n*   Treatment of atypical endometriosis requires surgery with thorough removal of all visible tissue.\n    \n\n【51】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【52】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【53】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Of note, our patient did not have any history of cutaneous melanoma. MRI revealed a retroperitoneal complex cystic lesion anterior to the right kidney ( figure 1D ) which contained dependent complex material reflecting blood products (arrow). On precontrast T1 sequences, nodular high signal along the anterior aspect of this lesion ( figure 1A , arrow) demonstrated enhancement of postgadolinium injection ( figure 1B , arrow), indicating the presence of melanin. Enhancement of the capsule of this lesion was also be appreciated ( figure 1B,C ). This large, complex cystic lesion was closely related but separate, appearing to the adjacent renal parenchyma with mass affect and distortion of the adjacent anterior renal parenchyma.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】MR images of a large retroperitoneal mass.

This cystic mass also demonstrated dependent complex material internally representing blood products (D, arrowhead) and enhancement of the thickened and irregular wall (C) on the coronal postcontrast T1-weighted imaging.\n\n【9】Following an uncomplicated radical right nephrectomy and histopathological analysis, this lesion was identified as a pararenal malignant melanotic nerve sheath tumour (MMNST). Figure 2 demonstrates the gross specimen with the large, melanin pigmented brown pararenal tumour (star) and the adjacent normal right renal parenchyma and perirenal fat. The cavity and cystic compartments of the tumour contained fresh haemorrhage as was seen as dependent complex material on MRI ( figure 1D ).

Previously, melanotic schwannomas were thought to have been generally benign entities with only occasional cases of a more aggressive course. 2 A recent, large clinicopathological, immunohistochemical and gene expression profiling study of 40 cases found these tumours to have a local recurrence and distant metastases rates of 35% and 42%, respectively. 3 In this series, 8 of the 11 patients with metastases developed within 48 months of diagnosis. These tumours are often associated with Carney complex (an autosomal dominant tumour predisposition syndrome with skin pigmentary abnormalities, myxomas and endocrine tumours), although clinical course cannot be predicted by morphological features.\n\n【15】Given the limited number of published cases of this tumour, data on treatment and follow-up are limited. 3 Therefore, close patient follow-up in a multidisciplinary team setting with regular radiological imaging is important in identifying local and metastatic recurrence. Finally, the most common location for MMNST is a paravertebral location; however, these tumours can arise anywhere within the retroperitoneum as in our case, and maintaining a broad differential which includes neurogenic tumours is important for atypical lesions of the retroperitoneum.\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】*   Melanotic schwannomas have been recently reclassified as malignant melanotic nerve sheath tumours to reflect better understanding of the significant malignant potential of this rare tumour, which was previously thought to be benign.\n    \n*   Maintaining a broad differential in the diagnosis of lesions of the retroperitoneum, including nerve-based soft tissue tumours, is important when imaging features are not definitive.\n    \n*   These rare tumours require close multidisciplinary follow-up with regular radiological imaging an important component.\n    \n\n【18】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【19】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【20】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

In acute IPO, a transient and reversible imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neural factors is responsible for motor impairment and small bowel or colonic dilatation. 2 In chronic IPO, the motor impairment is caused by permanent alterations of the smooth muscle, enteric nerves or interstitial cells of Cajal. 3 Signs and symptoms of IPO lasting more than 6 months define the chronic form, which is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of <1/100 000. 4 Acute IPO may be secondary to severe trauma, drugs or infections. Chronic IPO may be idiopathic or secondary to such systemic diseases as scleroderma, amyloidosis, and neurological or infectious disorders.\n\n【10】_Giardia lamblia_ (also known as _G. intestinalis_ or _G. duodenalis_ ) 5 is the most common protozoal intestinal parasite isolated worldwide, 6 7 with seroprevalence rates ranging from 2% to 7% in high-income countries 8 to 20%–40% in resource-limited settings. 9 In Northern and Central Italy, the estimated prevalence of giardiasis is around 2%. 10 _G. lamblia_ infection may present with acute symptoms including diarrhoea, malaise, abdominal cramps and weight loss or with chronic symptoms related to malabsorption. 11 _G. lamblia_ infection has shown to alter gastrointestinal (GI) motor function 12–14 and to increase the risk of such functional bowel disorders as dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 15–17 We have reported the case of a woman presenting with IPO caused by _G. lamblia_ infection for whom the treatment of the infection led to the complete resolution of the condition.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A female in her 40s was referred to our gastroenterology clinic because of malaise, nausea, reduced appetite, abdominal distention, loose stools (two evacuations per day without macroscopic blood) and weight loss (−Δ 5 kg, ie, 10% of body weight in the last 6 months). Symptoms had started 6 months earlier and significantly worsened in the last 2 weeks. Clinical evaluation revealed a cachectic woman with a body mass index of 18 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> and with severe abdominal distention. Blood tests including glucose and thyroid function did not reveal any gross abnormality. Abdominal X-ray showed dilated small bowel and the presence of air–fluid levels. Abdominal ultrasound with intestinal assessment showed remarkable gastric dilatation with maximum gastric diameter of 6.5 cm and substantial residual food despite overnight fasting, distended ileal loops and an ‘onion bulb-shaped’ tract of small intestine compatible with intestinal intussusception ( figure 1 ).\n\n【13】<img/>\n\n【14】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【15】Figure 1\n\n【16】Doughnut or bull’s eye sign at abdominal ultrasound, suggestive for small bowel intussusception.\n\n【17】The patient reported a family history of ovarian cancer, coeliac disease and ulcerative colitis. She did not refer any foreign travel in the last year and any contact with either domestic or wild animals. Her profession was not at increased risk of infectious diseases. She also denied taking any medication or illicit drugs. The patient was hospitalised.\n\n【18】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【19】CT enterography was performed ( figure 2 ), showing dilated (diameter >3 cm) 18 and bundling small bowel loops with diffuse air–fluid levels in absence of mechanical obstructing lesions and increased thickness or hyperenhancement of the small bowel wall.\n\n【20】<img/>\n\n【21】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【22】Figure 2\n\n【23】CT enterography showing dilated and bundling small bowel loops without mechanical obstructing lesions or increased thickness of the small bowel walls.\n\n【24】Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a macroscopically normal mucosa. Multiple stomach biopsies showed mild gastritis; _Helicobacter pylori_ was absent. Duodenal biopsies revealed intraepithelial lymphoplasmocytosis with increased number of CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (40 CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocytes out of 100 enterocytes) and villous atrophy, consistent with modified Marsh 3a type ( figure 3 ). Coeliac disease was ruled out by normal levels of IgA, antitissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG), antigliadin IgG and IgA and antiendomysium IgA, and negative genotyping of the human leucocyte antigens (HLAs) for HLA DQ-2 and HLA DQ-8.\n\n【25】<img/>\n\n【26】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【27】Figure 3\n\n【28】Duodenal biopsy showing intraepithelial lymphoplasmacytosis with incremented number of CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (40 CD3+ intraepithelial lymphocytes out of 100 enterocytes) and villous atrophy, consistent with modified Marsh 3a.\n\n【29】Colonoscopy did not evidence any obstructing lesion. To further exclude a mechanical obstruction, capsule endoscopy was performed (after permissive patency capsule examination), revealing a diffusely normotrophic small bowel mucosa and a slowed (362 min) small bowel transit time (median small bowel transit time 157.0–240.5 min). 19\n\n【30】Faecal calprotectin and blood count were normal as well as C reactive protein, procalcitonin plasma levels, vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> , electrolytes, iron levels and transferrin saturation. Folates were slightly reduced (3.1 ng/mL, normal levels >3.8 ng/mL).\n\n【31】The diagnosis of IPO was made on the basis of the presence of dilated small bowel loops with air–fluid levels and in absence of any mechanical obstruction assessed by cross-sectional imaging and endoscopy.\n\n【32】Secondary causes of IPO and of Marsh 3a villous atrophy were revised (see the Differential diagnosis section).\n\n【33】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【34】Our patient’s symptoms had begun 6 months earlier and worsened in the last 2 weeks. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of IPO considered both acute and chronic forms. Clinical history and physical examinations excluded the most frequent causes of acute pseudo-obstruction or Ogilvie’s syndrome including surgery, severe trauma or acute infections. The patient denied the use of drugs affecting GI motility such as opioids, anticholinergic, alpha-2-adrenergic agonists, antipsychotics, calcium channel blockers, and cytotoxic and dopaminergic drugs. Diabetes, hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism were ruled out by normal glycaemia, thyroid-stimulating hormone and serum calcium levels.\n\n【35】Clinical history and physical examination excluded progressive systemic sclerosis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and neurological disorders such as stroke, encephalitis, dermatomyositis and myotonic dystrophy. Amyloidosis was ruled out by normal gastric biopsies. Absence of anti-Hu antibodies and antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies excluded any paraneoplastic or autoimmune form of pseudo-obstruction. 20–22\n\n【36】Infective causes of acute and chronic pseudo-obstruction were considered. Bacterial stool cultures for _Shigella_ , _Salmonella_ and _Campylobacter_ were negative as well as interferon gamma release assay and serologies for HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, _Borrelia burgdorferi_ , _Toxoplasma gondii_ , _Toxocara_ and _Strongyloides stercoralis_ . 22\n\n【37】Differential diagnosis of Marsh 3a villous atrophy considered coeliac disease, which was ruled out by negative serology and negative HLA DQ-2 and DQ-8 genotyping. Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma was unlikely as strongly associated with coeliac disease. Drug-related villous atrophy was excluded as our patient did not take such medications as olmesartan, ipilimumab, colchicine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate and azathioprine. Tropical sprue is an endemic condition in certain parts of the world such as South Asia, the Caribbean, and Central and South America, but it is unlikely in Italy. Crohn’s disease may cause villous atrophy but was excluded by cross-sectional imaging and normal faecal calprotectin. Collagenous sprue and Whipple disease were excluded by histological examination of duodenal biopsies. Common variable immunodeficiency was unlikely because of the normal levels of IgM and IgG and the reported normal response to vaccines.

The parasite was found in the duodenal biopsies at a second look after the finding on stool examination ( figure 4 ). Autoimmune enteropathy, another rare cause of villous atrophy, was unlikely as it requires a diagnosis of exclusion. 23\n\n【39】<img/>\n\n【40】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【41】Figure 4\n\n【42】Revised duodenal biopsies showing _Giardia lamblia_ trophozoites (arrows) in the duodenal lumen close to the mucosal surface.\n\n【43】Treatment\n---------\n\n【44】The patient was treated with metronidazole, 500 mg three times a day for 7 days with rapid regression of symptoms.\n\n【45】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【46】Three month after treatment, upper GI endoscopy was repeated and multiple duodenal biopsies displayed normotrophic villi, with slight residual lymphoplasmocytic infiltration, and normal levels of CD3+ intra-epithelial lymphocytes ( figure 5 ). _G. lamblia_ trophozoites were absent in the duodenal biopsies and in the stools.

According to our search through the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, this is the first reported case of giardiasis presenting with a dilated small bowel mimicking IPO. The rapid and complete resolution of both symptoms and small bowel dilatation after _Giardia_ eradication suggests that small bowel dilatation was due to an unbalance of reversible mechanisms controlling the intestinal tone. Gut tone is under the influence of cholinergic muscarinic excitatory and adrenergic, cholinergic nicotinic and nitric oxide (NO)-like inhibitory transmitters. 25 An increased release of NO has been shown to play a pivotal role in the control of infections with numerous microbes including _G. lamblia_ . 26 In vitro studies showed that NO inhibits _G. lamblia_ growth, and studies on NO synthase-deficient mice revealed a reduced clearance of the parasite in vivo. 12 These findings raise the hypothesis that an enhanced release of NO might underlie the reduced small bowel tone in our patient. In line with this hypothesis, a significant increase in NO synthase-containing cells has been reported in the myenteric plexus of the small intestine of patients with chronic IPO, suggesting that NO overproduction may be related to the pathogenesis of ileal dilatation in these patients. 27\n\n【53】_G. lamblia_ infection has been recognised as one of the causes of postinfectious IBS and functional dyspepsia (FD). 15 16 The pathogenesis of these syndromes after bacterial or parasitic infection is probably multifactorial and is still insufficiently understood, 28 but increased levels of inducible NO synthase associated with mast cell degranulation were found in the duodenal biopsies of subjects with IBS and FD, 29 30 suggesting that NO dysregulation might be involved in the mechanism of postinfectious IBS and FD.\n\n【54】_G. lamblia_ infection caused a histopathological pattern in our patient which was almost indistinguishable from that of coeliac disease. 31 In this condition, anti-tTG and negative HLA DQ-2 and DQ-8 genotyping maintained their diagnostic ability to discriminate between coeliac disease and giardiasis. 32 This result is in line with the almost 100% negative post-test probability previously reported for negative HLA DQ-2 and DQ-8 genotyping in patients with a clinical suspicion of coeliac disease. 33\n\n【55】The recognition of the parasite in the duodenal lumen of our patient occurred only after a second look, suggesting that diagnosis might be difficult for the pathologist. 34 In line with this observation, 18% of false negatives were reported in a retrospective histological analysis of duodenal samples from 567 cases of giardiasis presenting with celiac-like duodenal histology. 35 In this context, the microscopic analysis of duodenal aspirate might have represented another diagnostic option, although not superior to the analysis of duodenal biopsies when available. 36\n\n【56】Abdominal ultrasound with intestinal assessment showed the presence of transient small bowel intussusception that was not confirmed at CT enterography. The transient nature of small bowel intussusception was previously reported in an observational study of 25 paediatric patients, none of whom had persistent intussusception requiring surgery. In this study, four patients with persistent symptoms had an underlying disease requiring treatment, two of them with giardiasis, suggesting that _G. infection_ may predispose to transient small bowel intussusception. 37\n\n【57】### Learning points\n\n【58】*   _Giardia lamblia_ infection could rarely present as intestinal pseudo-obstruction.\n    \n*   The histological diagnosis of giardiasis via duodenal biopsies is possibly difficult but should be considered, particularly for patients presenting with duodenal atrophy.\n    \n*   Transient small bowel intussusception at abdominal ultrasound with intestinal assessment should raise suspicion of _G. lamblia_ infection.\n    \n\n【59】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【60】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【61】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

This article describes the experience of 6 years of treatment with dental implants in a patient with secondary loss of tooth and mineral imbalance (osteopenia) due to vitamin D deficiency, in collaboration with endocrinologist. Along with basic dental care, special medicine was prescribed for this pathology. The bone system was monitored through regular blood tests, skeletal bone densitometry and X-ray of the maxillofacial region. This management plan allowed dental implants to be maintained in good condition for 7 years.\n\n【2】*   dentistry and oral medicine\n*   endocrine system\n*   calcium and bone\n*   global Health\n*   healthcare improvement and patient safety\n\n【3】http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-235585\n\n【4】Statistics from Altmetric.com\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】*   dentistry and oral medicine\n*   endocrine system\n*   calcium and bone\n*   global Health\n*   healthcare improvement and patient safety\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】The problem of dental row restoration has remained relevant for many years. Dental implants have been used actively for the past 30–40 years for dental rehabilitation of patients with partial secondary absence of teeth. The most popular criteria for success at the implant level are mobility, pain, radiolucency and loss of peri-implant tissues (>1.5 mm), as well as the absence or presence of peri-implantitis, suppuration and bleeding. The main success factors at the prosthetic level were technical complications/prosthetics, adequate function and aesthetics for 5 years. Patient satisfaction criteria included discomfort and paraesthesia absence, satisfaction with appearance and ability to experience/taste. Success in implant dentistry should ideally measure the long-term primary outcomes of the implant prosthetic complex. 1\n\n【8】However, due to the technogenic impact and world environmental situation, this type of treatment is becoming less effective, leading to the increasing risk of dental implant failure, mainly because of associated metabolic disturbances such as osteopenia and osteoporosis. 2–4 The number of people who were not previously at risk of osteoporosis, such as menopausal women with decreased oestrogen levels, is increasing, and the association with age and gender is becoming less obvious.\n\n【9】Currently there are no contraindications for dental implants in patients with osteoporosis. However, the implant stabilisation process may be different for patients with this pathology. A longer implant stabilisation period is noted compared with healthy patients. A more thorough study of bisphosphonate use is required since there is currently insufficient information. There is also evidence of patients with osteoporosis taking bisphosphonates. Intravenous administration of these drugs increases the risk of developing osteonecrosis compared with oral administration. The presence of osteoporosis does interfere with the mechanical stability of dental implants, although this does not adversely affect their osseointegration. 5–8 It can be assumed that, if the primary mechanical stability in patients with osteoporosis is longer, then it is worth revising the terms of orthopaedic treatment and the load on the implant. Here, we will focus on osteoporosis caused by an imbalance of vitamin D. There are studies that prove a direct link. 9 Adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium is considered an important component in treating osteoporosis. 10 The deficit is especially pronounced in women older than 50 years, which is also confirmed by studies. 11 It can be concluded that the imbalance of vitamin D indirectly affects the implant engraftment. In the Russian Federation and other countries, more and more scientists are paying attention to the need for an integrated approach for treating patients with secondary partial absence of teeth and metabolic disturbances, by adding endocrinologists to the medical team and working closely with them.\n\n【10】An analysis of the current situation in Russia and the scientific literature revealed the need for further randomised and multicentre studies to develop a comprehensive algorithm for examining and treating patients in this category.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 51-year-old woman presented at a private dental clinic in 2013 with complaints of recurrent pain in the left temporomandibular joint (TMJ), difficulty chewing solid food and a prolonged absence of teeth in the lower jaw.\n\n【13】On examination, the facial configuration was unchanged, the opening of the mouth was not limited. There was an S-shaped deviation of the lower jaw, with an amplitude of more than 2.5 cm, and a click in the region of the left TMJ, in which hypermobility and slight pain were noted during palpation.\n\n【14】From the side of the oral cavity, the patient lacked teeth at positions 3.6, 3.7 and 4.6. The mucous membrane was pale pink and moderately moist. Palpation was painless. The width of the alveolar ridge when measured with a surgical caliper was 8 mm (area 3.6), 8.2 mm (area 3.7) and 7.8 mm (area 4.6).\n\n【15】An initial intraoral photo of 3.6, 3.7 and 4.6 tooth was taken. According to available clinical data, a preliminary diagnosis was made by a parallel method. A provisional diagnosis of TMJ dysfunction was made. To clarify the diagnosis, we proposed performing an MRI and condylography, but the patient refused.\n\n【16】When conducting cone beam CT, the mandible parameters were as follows: the height and width of the alveolar ridge (to the canal of the lower alveolar nerve) for 4.6 tooth was 6×12 mm, for 3.6 tooth was 6.5×14 mm and for 3.7 tooth was 6.8×13.5 mm ( figure 1 ).\n\n【17】<img/>\n\n【18】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【19】Figure 1\n\n【20】Cone beam CT of the patient before dental implantation.\n\n【21】At the preoperative stage, haematology, biochemistry, haemoglobin A1c, coagulogram, parathyroid hormone (PTH), antibodies to thyroid peroxidase, triiodothyronine and thyroid stimulating hormone lab tests were performed.\n\n【22】According to the results, the patient’s indicators were within the reference values for haematology and biochemistry. However, the coagulation system result indicated the PTH level was above normal (7.36 compared with normal values for a given age and gender, which do not go beyond 6.9 pg/L).\n\n【23】She had a history of long-term use of oral contraceptives and had not reached menopause at the time of dental implant installation.\n\n【24】To verify the diagnosis and further examination, the patient was referred to a gynaecologist–endocrinologist. As an additional assessment, a skeleton densitometry was performed, which revealed decreased bone density in the lumbar vertebrae to 0.831 and the left femoral head to 0.71. The patient was diagnosed with osteopenia. Then, a sequential treatment was carried out. After investigation, the endocrinologist prescribed 70 mg of alendronic acid orally once a week, along with daily calcium 500 mg two times per day and Alpha D3-Teva at 1 µg.\n\n【25】After the targeted treatment began, a series of dental measurements were performed. Therapeutic and surgical sanitation of the oral cavity was complete.\n\n【26】Alfa Bio DFI implants (Alpha-Bio Tec, Israel) with dimensions of 3.75×10 mm (position of missing 4.6 tooth), 3.75×11.5 mm (position of missing 3.6 and 3.7 teeth) were installed.\n\n【27】Antibacterial (Augmentin 625 mg three times per a day for 7 days), anti-inflammatory and analgesic therapy (nimesulide for pain) were prescribed, along with antiseptic baths of the oral cavity (water solution of chlorhexidine 0.05%).\n\n【28】The postoperative period was unremarkable. During the first postoperative follow-up, the gingiva in the surgical field were slightly swollen, without pathological changes. According to the patient, there was no pain. Sutures were removed on the seventh day, and the patient was given individual hygiene recommendations. Control examinations were carried out 3 months later.\n\n【29】Healing abutments were installed 3 months after dental implantation over two visits because of economic considerations ( figure 2 ). Two and four weeks later (total terms of gum formation), the orthopaedic stage was provided ( figures 3 and 4 ), and the implant crowns were fixed (transocclusion fixation for 4.6,; cement fixation 3.6 and 3.7).\n\n【30】<img/>\n\n【31】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【32】Figure 2\n\n【33】Inserted healing abutment in position 4.6 of dental implant.\n\n【34】<img/>\n\n【35】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【36】Figure 3\n\n【37】Condition of tissue in position 4.6 of dental implant after healing abutment removal in 2 weeks.\n\n【38】<img/>\n\n【39】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【40】Figure 4\n\n【41】View of the oral cavity after prosthetic stage.\n\n【42】The patient was followed by an endocrinologist and a dental surgeon for 6 years.

The treatment of the gingival bed and the implant shaft, and X-ray of this area with subsequent fixation of the crowns was carried out. The condition of soft tissue was excellent, and oral hygiene was satisfactory ( figure 5 ), the displacement of dental rows was also diagnosed.\n\n【46】<img/>\n\n【47】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【48】Figure 5\n\n【49】The view of oral cavity 6 years after prosthetic stage.\n\n【50】According to the results of the X-ray examination, after 6 years, the dental implants were well-positioned, with no critical resorption of the bone tissue surrounding them ( figure 6 ).\n\n【51】<img/>\n\n【52】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【53】Figure 6\n\n【54】Cone beam CT of the patient 6 years after dental implantation.

The patient’s therapy was changed for 2 months after the endocrinologist prescribed 7000 IU of oral cholecalciferol drops (14 drops every day for 8 weeks, then 1000 IU continuously).\n\n【57】<img/>\n\n【58】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【59】Figure 7\n\n【60】Densitometry results 6 years after dental implantation. The endocrinologist had considered the decrease of bone density level in the main reference points and changed antiresorptive therapy on vitamin D.\n\n【61】After 2 months, the vitamin D and PTH returned to normal range, and maintenance therapy with vitamin D3 was prescribed (1000 conventional units once per day). Further examination was recommended to exclude metabolic syndrome (due to the presence of hypertension and increased body weight—in 6 years, the patient’s body mass index (BMI) had increased from 25 to 29.2).\n\n【62】The patient gave oral and written consent for the clinical examination, investigation, treatment and use of materials.\n\n【63】Global health problem list\n--------------------------\n\n【64】*   In recent years, the percentage of patients with mineral imbalances, such as vitamin D deficiency (not only in women aged more than 50 years and patients with endocrine disease), affecting the bones and teeth has been increasing.\n    \n*   There is a problem of dental implant integration in patients with mineral imbalance.\n    \n*   There is a requirement for a management protocol for patients with mineral balance disturbances, including examinations and the endocrinologist’s prescriptions.\n    \n\n【65】Global health problem analysis\n------------------------------\n\n【66】Currently, the number of people with mineral balance disturbances is increasing. This condition, including osteoporosis, causes an imbalance in remodelling and bone resorption, and can lead to increased risk of bone fractures. Today a connection has been established, not only with somatic diseases but with changing lifestyles of people around the world. 9\n\n【67】According to the WHO statistics, osteoporosis has become an important public health problem worldwide. One in three women and one in five men over the age of 50 years will have an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetime. 10\n\n【68】According to You _et al_ , today, the risk for osteoporosis is significantly associated with age, vitamin D intake, metabolic equivalent of task scores, weight, neck and hip circumference, waistline in the population. Also, the role of fat distribution, erectile dysfunction, menopause and alcohol abuse in osteoporosis should be given more consideration in clinical practice. 11 There is an increasing number of patients with a history of osteoporosis. This forces us to seek the best treatment options in oral surgery.\n\n【69】Currently, more and more factors affect long-term dental implantation, resulting in patients with partial secondary absence of teeth, including various disorders affecting bone mineral metabolism that were previously associated with an increase, for one reason or another, of the thyroid hormone, and found in postmenopausal women. In the last 5 years, endocrinologists have correlated vitamin D deficiency and PTH concentration, and therefore, the status of mineral metabolism. 12–14 Moreover, we want to note that, in recent years, this relationship has been less and less characteristic of the risk group for osteoporosis (white women older than 50 years with established menopause), and has become more and more characteristic of young and middle-aged patients, which may be associated with lifestyle (prolonged stay in enclosed spaces, low insolation, diet and nature and so on). Against the background of such changes, the risk of an unfavourable outcome of surgical treatment of patients with partial secondary absence of teeth naturally increases when dental implants are installed. 4–8 Therefore, a close cooperation between the dental surgeon and endocrinologist is now required, since timely antiresorptive therapy can increase the 5-year survival of implants to 100%, regardless of the patient’s age and gender.\n\n【70】Thus, considering the growth of hormonal imbalance in patients with partial secondary absence of teeth, the collaboration with endocrinologists to correct the existing metabolic disorders to increase the survival time of dental implants and surgical treatment, in general, remains relevant.\n\n【71】Recent scientific works are aimed at assessing bone tissue changes during dental operations. For example, some patients take constant hormone replacement therapy, or have hyperparathyroidism, thyrotoxicosis and hyperprolactinemia. The surplus of glucocorticoid hormone induces osteoporosis, and patients have poor primary stability of the implants due to osteogenesis inhibition\n\n【72】Oki _et al_ investigated the effects of continual intermittent influence of PTH on dental implant stability in the presence of osteoporosis, using rabbit models and creating artificial osteoporosis with the use of PTH in different forms before and after implantation. 15 The authors measured the implant stability coefficient immediately and after 2 and 4 weeks. According to a histological study, the quality and quantity of bone around dental implants were better in the groups of animals with adequate compensating therapy for osteoporosis.\n\n【73】Recent studies show the success of additional substances for covering dental implant surfaces, like lithium chloride application, increases osseointegration. Tests have shown that the properties of this material can improve its primary component. Lithium chloride stimulates osteogenesis and differentiation of osteoblasts. 16 Thus, this material can be used to treat patients with osteoporosis.\n\n【74】Dentists do not have clear guidelines on managing patients with disturbance of mineral balance. This may impair the treatment with dental implants, as these patients take bisphosphonates on an ongoing basis. For example, one article reveals a problem, dentists hesitate to help people with osteoporosis. In this group of patients, the risk of developing osteonecrosis increases; dental manipulations can provoke its development if there is no clear sequence of actions. 17 Several known risk factors are associated with the development of antiresorptive-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, including invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction, dental implant or apical/periodontal surgery. 18 This study recommends focusing on the prevention of odontogenic infection to reduce the number of invasive open bone manipulations. However, even when all attempts to avoid surgery have been made, the chance of its need remains. The resumption of antiresorptive therapy is recommended 2 months after implantation. Discontinuation of medicines is recommended for 2 months with the consultation of an endocrinologist.\n\n【75】Summarising all data presented in the article, the method of temporararily stopping bisphosphonates before implantation is widespread to achieve bone healing, but there are no clear recommendations for oral surgeons in case of other diseases or conditions connected with the disturbance of mineral balance. That is why the risk of complications after dental implantation increases in these patients. Dentists should be aware of the manifestations of osteoporosis, and know how to assess the laboratory test results and risk factors that cause complications during manipulation and how to treat them in collaboration with an endocrinologist.\n\n【76】Schwarz _et al_ analysed the studies and considered osteoporosis, osteopenia, thyroid disease, hepatitis, BMI as well as radiation and chemotherapy as potential risk factors for implant loss, but observed no association with peri‐implantitis. They decided that it could be questioned whether existing studies evaluating risk factors/indicators for peri‐implantitis were adequately powered to detect associations with rare disorders, and that evidence suggesting systemic conditions (other than diabetes) to be a risk factor/indicator for peri‐implantitis was limited. 19\n\n【77】### Learning points\n\n【78】*   Patients with a partial secondary loss of teeth must be recommended to get blood test performed for key signs of mineral imbalance and other diseases before dental implantation (this analysis should be performed only for patients at risk: women over 50 years, and patients with endocrine pathology, mineral imbalance and osteoporosis).\n    \n*   If bone mineral metabolism disorder is detected, patient should consult an endocrinologist for further investigations and, if necessary, special therapy with vitamin D for the indication.\n    \n*   Timely and adequate therapy prescribed by endocrinologist increases the 5-year success rate of dental implants to 100%, regardless of the patient’s age and gender.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

In this case report, we diagnosed type A dissection based on the presence of an ascending aortic intimal flap and aortic valvular regurgitation noted by sonographic investigation that was missed with CTA. The bedside sonographic assessment predicated the decision for operative intervention.\n\n【7】### Supplemental material\n\n【8】\\[bcr-2022-253577supp001.pdf\\]\n\n【9】A patient with known connective tissue disorder and prior type B aortic dissection presented to the emergency department following cardiac arrest after three prehospital defibrillations with return of spontaneous circulation. On arrival, the patient was obtunded with the only meaningful history from family being 1 day of chest pain prior to collapse. Initial ECG revealed ST segment elevations in the inferior distribution and anteroseptal ST segment depressions, with right bundle branch block without ST segment changes on repeat ECG ( figure 1A ). Vital signs showed a temperature of 36.3°C, blood pressure of 106/52 mm Hg, heart rate of 56 bpm and oxygen saturation of 100% on 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). In addition to continuous analgosedation, an esmolol drip was titrated considering the history of a type B aortic dissection ( figure 1B–E ).\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 1\n\n【13】(A) Repeat ECG show ST segment changes with right bundle branch block.

Asc Ao, ascending aorta; Desc Ao, descending aorta; Ao Rt, aortic root; CTA, CT angiography; LA, left atrium; LV, left ventricle; RA, right atrium; RV, right ventricle; PT, pulmonary trunk; PV, pulmonary vein; SVC, superior vena; cava; VB, vertebral body.\n\n【14】Although clinical presentation and history were highly suspicious for an extension of a type A dissection into the coronary vasculature, we considered an acute coronary syndrome causing ventricular fibrillation and a spontaneous coronary artery dissection of the right coronary artery as alternative diagnoses.\n\n【15】Surprisingly, CTA radiologic interpretation revealed redemonstration of the type B aortic dissection without a type A component ( figure 1F–I ). As the current hospital did not have invasive cardiothoracic surgery capability but could medically manage type B dissections, the inconsistency of CTA results to the clinical picture presented a challenging dilemma. Point-of-care echocardiography was immediately performed by the emergency medicine team, demonstrating aortic regurgitation and an extension of a flap towards the aortic valve cusp in the area of an aneurysmal thoracic aortic root ( video 1 ). The case was presented to the receiving invasive cardiothoracic surgical consultant with communication of both sonographic and CTA imaging. The radiology attending of record performed a review of the imaging and did not feel their report showed a type A component. In consideration of the point-of-care ultrasound findings, the patient was transferred for emergent operative intervention and noted to have type A dissection with extension and subsequent aortic valve cusp rupture. The patient survived to discharge.\n\n【16】Video 1 Transthoracic echocardiography shows extension of an intimal flap with aortic regurgitation\n\n【17】The identification of direct sonographic signs, such as the presence of intimal flap or intramural haematoma with thickening of aortic walls greater than 5 mm, or indirect signs including ascending aorta enlargement 4 cm or greater, pericardial tamponade or effusion, or aortic valve regurgitation, can augment clinical decision making. 5 As this case report proves, situations where the CTA misses the type A component of an aortic dissection are notable.

Such incidents are characterised by a small punctiform entry wound and the normal colour of skin. The internal damage caused by these injuries can be severely devastating in nature. These injuries required emergent surgical debridement and irrigation. Postoperatively intensive physiotherapy is required for the successful return of hand function. The final functional outcome depends on the initial latency to treatment, nature of injected material, location and volume of injection and postoperative physiotherapy.\n\n【2】*   trauma\n*   plastic and reconstructive surgery\n*   physiotherapy (rehabilitation)\n*   accidents\n*   injuries\n*   radiology\n\n【3】http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2019-231112\n\n【4】Statistics from Altmetric.com\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】*   trauma\n*   plastic and reconstructive surgery\n*   physiotherapy (rehabilitation)\n*   accidents\n*   injuries\n*   radiology\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】High-pressure injuries (HPIs) are very rare entities affecting the hands. These injuries are caused by the guns ejecting high-pressure jet streams emitting streams at pressure exceeding thousands of pounds force per square inch (psi). The incidence of these injuries is one in every 600 hand traumas. On an average, only one to four HPIs to hand are treated by even high-volume centres in an entire year. 1\n\n【8】Paint, solvents, automotive grease and diesel oil include the most commonly injected materials in HPIs. This high pressure leads to diffusion of injected material into the tendon sheath, along neurovascular bundles and fascial planes. Thus closed and poorly distensible compartment-like digital and palmar tissues are badly affected. Overall deleterious effect is due to the raised pressure in the closed compartment, direct toxic effect of the chemical injected, mechanical impact of injury and secondary infections. 2–4\n\n【9】These injuries are mostly underestimated because of small entry wound and initial benign look on inspection. Further, they occur accidentally during the leakage of pipes or during cleaning of the apparatus. The whole incident is over in a fraction of a second, that its severity is overlooked. 4 5\n\n【10】This article reports a case of a high-pressure chemical injection Injury to the hand with extensive internal damage of soft tissue in comparison with the punctiform external wounds, its management and an early return of the hand function.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 42-year-old right-handed industrial worker was brought to the trauma centre 3 hours after sustaining an injury to his left hand from the high-pressure chemical jet that he was operating. The nozzle of the chemical pipe line accidentally opened and momentarily came into contact with the palm of left hand. The chemical that he was handling was ferric oxide. The pressure in the pipeline was around 4000 psi. There was minimal bleeding at the scene. On arrival in the trauma centre, he complained of severe pain and swelling in the hand, exacerbated by any active movement. He had one 1 cm entry wound marks on his left palm in the thenar region about 5 cm distal to the distal wrist crease. The entry wound and adjacent skin over the palm was very tender. There were no exit wounds visible. There was obvious swelling in the hand when compared with the opposite hand. Radial and ulnar pulses were palpable. The capillary refill time was delayed in the index and middle finger and normal in the rest of fingers. His vital signs were within normal limits. Sensory function of the hand was intact. Motor function was present, but he experienced severe hand and forearm pain on active and passive flexion and extension of left hand fingers and wrist. The range of finger movements was restricted ( figure 1 ).\n\n【13】<img/>\n\n【14】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【15】Figure 1\n\n【16】A small punctiform entry wound in the thenar aspect with no exit wound.\n\n【17】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【18】Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the left forearm, elbow and hand confirmed the presence of subcutaneous emphysema extending from palmar region till midforearm. Radiopacity could be seen in the mid palmar region extending till the distal flexor forearm compartment. No bony injuries were seen ( figure 2 ).\n\n【19】<img/>\n\n【20】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【21】Figure 2\n\n【22】Anterior, posterior and lateral view of radiograph showing the presence of radio dense material in the palm and distal forearm.\n\n【23】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【24】The differential diagnosis in the acute setting includes a crush injury to the hand, compartment syndrome of the hand, fractures of the hand and digits or just a localised benign laceration of the digit or palm. If the patient presents late, several days after the initial injury, then one must also be suspicious for flexor tenosynovitis or an infections of the digits and hand.\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】He was initially treated with intravenous augmentin (amoxicillin and clavulinic acid) 1.2 g intravenous and tetanus toxoid 0.5 mL intramuscularly. He had ongoing pain that was treated with analgesics. He underwent an emergency surgical exploration of left forearm and hand. First, the entry wound was extended proximally to the hand and forearm. A fasciotomy was performed in the dorsum of hand in the second and forth metacarpal spaces. The wound revealed a large amount of dark brown colour dye (ferric oxide) in the palm and distal flexor compartment. The material had penetrated and coated every distinguishable local anatomical structure. The anterior compartment muscles were soft. Neurovascular structures were identified and were intact. Thorough irrigation of the hand and anterior compartment with normal saline was performed and the wounds were left open and dressed ( figure 3 ).\n\n【27】<img/>\n\n【28】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【29】Figure 3\n\n【30】Debridement of necrotic tissue and the presence of chemical agent (ferric oxide) in the palm.\n\n【31】Postoperatively, he was treated with intravenous augmentin and adequate analgesia was given. After 2 days, a second debridement was performed. More of chemical could be removed and the stained tissues assessed for viability. Thorough irrigation was done. Again, after two more days, the wounds were explored. Further debridement of non-viable tissue followed by copious irrigation was done. Almost all of the contaminant chemical was now flushed out. The wounds were loosely approximated with interrupted non-absorbable sutures.\n\n【32】Postoperatively, splintage was provided to the upper extremity in the functional position. The patient was continued on intravenous augmentin for the next 24 hours. Adequate analgesia and elevation of the hand was ensured. Patient remained afebrile for 24 hours and was discharged home on oral augmentin and paracetamol for pain. After 10 days, all wounds healed. Supervised physiotherapy was started.\n\n【33】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【34】After 4 months on serial follow-ups, the surgical scar had healed well and he had normal motor and sensory functions of the left hand and forearm. He had recovered complete active and passive range of motion of fingers and wrist. He had a normal sensory function but the maximum grip strength had diminished slightly ( figure 4 ).\n\n【35】<img/>\n\n【36】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【37】Figure 4\n\n【38】Normal motor and sensory function 4 months post operation.\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】Rees in the year 1937 first described the high-pressure jet injury with diesel fuel. In 60% of cases, the non-dominant hand is involved. Index finger is involved in nearly 50% of such injuries, followed by the thumb. In 10% of cases, the palm and other regions are involved. 1 6\n\n【41】Paints, solvents, automotive grease and diesel oil include the most commonly injected materials. Diffusion of high kinetic energy in a closed anatomical compartment results in a devastating soft tissue and vascular injuries. If the operating temperature of the injected solvent is very high then it accentuates the injury by burning the underlying soft tissues and skin. These substances produce chemical irritation, acute and chronic inflammatory reactions with draining sinuses and fibrosis. Most devastating of all the chemicals is the paint solvent, which can result in amputation in 60%–80% of cases. 4 5\n\n【42】Various mechanisms that are responsible for these injuries these includes:\n\n【43】1.  Pressure—a pressure of 7 bar in enough for skin penetration. As the pressure increases, direct contact with skin is not required for infiltration into the subcutaneous tissues. The injected fluid preferentially follows the path of least resistance along the neurovascular bundle and fascial planes. The ultimate consequence is traumatic dissection of tissue, compression of neurovascular bundles, vascular spasm, tissue ischaemia and oedema. A compartment syndrome may develop.\n    \n2.  Chemical nature of substance—some chemicals have cytolytic properties which can result in intense inflammatory response, tissue destruction and necrosis. Consequently, a severe fibrosis may set in and can lead to impairment of hand function.\n    \n3.  Infection—it can happen primarily during the HPI but secondary infections are more common which may be due to ischaemia and necrosis. 1 3 7 8\n    \n\n【44】Initially, the patient may present with very minimal complaint, mostly with a small punctiform skin wound. Pain and swelling may develop after several hours. Sensory and motor impairment may be discovered later on. On an average, a patient seeks medical advice only after 9 hour of injury. The instantaneous nature of the event and Initial benign appearance of the injury may result in delays in seeking treatment. 1\n\n【45】Radiological investigations are mandatory to know the extent of damage and involvement. Subcutaneous and soft tissue emphysema can be appreciated and its extent gives a good indication of the spread of the substance. Since there is involvement of fascial planes, the radiography must include proximal and distal regions for evaluating the extent of involvement. Imaging should be repeated after every surgical debridement.\n\n【46】If vascular compromise is suspected then urgent angiography should be performed for the evaluation of vascular injury site and extent. According to few authors, presence of distal pulse does not exclude an arterial injury and preoperative angiography should be performed. 6\n\n【47】HPIs are surgical emergencies and patients need an immediate consultation and intervention. An early debridement must be performed in order to decrease the morbidity. Sooner the surgical intervention lowers the morbidity. Initial management include quick brief into history including the type of chemical, distance of jet from the skin surface and time of injury. High suspicious of extensive internal injury should be kept in the mind. Careful neurovascular examination followed by the radiological evaluation of site of injury and adjacent regions should be done. Tetanus prophylaxis, broad spectrum antibiotics and adequate analgesics should be given. Splinting and limb elevation should be done and urgent surgical decompression and debridement and copious irrigation should be done under adequate anaesthesia. Multiple episode of debridement and irrigation may be required over the time. Postoperatively aggressive physiotherapy should be done.\n\n【48】The final hand function depends on various factors which include nature of injected substance, pressure at which it is injected, volume of injected substance and the site of injury. Solvent and paints have extensive cytolytic property. Moreover solvents have lower viscosity, and hence their spread and diffusion is very quick across tissue planes. Higher the pressure, more the volume of jet injected and therefore, more devastating the injury. The fingertip has smaller expansion capacity compared with the palm and hence a faster development of compartment syndrome. 4 7 9 10\n\n【49】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【50】It was just like another day of work for me but I never realised that a little mistake will put me into a massive trouble for next few months. While working with high-pressure chemical injecting device, in a fraction of second it came into contact with my left hand. After the incident, I had a look at my hand and I realised there was a small wound in my hand and minimal to no bleeding. I could feel the pain and the difficulty in the hand movement. It became difficult for me to continue with the work. At that point I contacted few of my colleagues. They advised me to visit the local practitioner for the first aid since it was just a punctiform wound. But pain was increasing in intensity. I rushed to the emergency and trauma centre. Their team of doctors examined me and quickly got the investigations done. They showed me the X-rays and informed me regarding the severity and seriousness of injury. I was shocked to see the amount of chemical which had entered through that trivial-looking wound. The doctors advised me for an emergency surgery in order to save my hand. I consulted my family and gave consent for the surgery. A team of doctors operated on my left upper limb. After the first surgery, they informed me how much of chemical was present and they tried their best to remove as much as chemical as possible. One day later, dressing was opened to assess the wound and doctors decided to go in for a surgery again to remove the dead tissues and chemicals which were remaining. After 48 hours, I was again in the operation theatre. This time doctors had removed almost all of the chemicals and dead tissues. After that they used to assess and dress the wound everyday for the next 5 days and later on alternate day for the next 10 days. There was a sigh of relief once all of my wounds were healed. The next big thing on my mind was to regain the functionality. My treating doctors in consultation with the physiotherapist put me on a strict physiotherapy protocol. Initially it was very painful, even at the slightest of the movement. But my doctors and physiotherapist motivated me and I followed the physiotherapy protocol religiously. I could see the movements of my hand returning and it improved as days passed by. After 4 months of physiotherapy, I was able to move my fingers and hand comfortably. I returned to my work and daily routine. It was a great relief for my wife and family members . The doctors and my family supported me really well to bring me to a normal life. I realised how important it is to follow the precautions while working with these kinds of instruments. A moment of carelessness can lead to a very severe physical and mental trauma. It’s better to be safe than to feel sorry in the end.\n\n【51】### Learning points\n\n【52】*   high-pressure injuries (HPIs) are rare industrial injuries, which if not addressed early and aggressively can lead to high degree of morbidity.\n    \n*   Initial presentation of HPI can be very mystifying and can baffle the treating surgeon.\n    \n*   Early, aggressive and serial debridements and fasciotomy should be done for their early management\n    \n*   For an early return of function, an aggressive supervised physiotherapy protocol should be followed.\n    \n*   There should be regular workshops and awareness campaign on the regular basis for the industrial workers on the proper handling of high-pressure injection devices while operating and in case of some event, a quick referral to the competent centre.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Four hours before the onset of symptoms, he had eaten raw horse mackerel and salmon sushi. He had a 26 pack-year smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and hyperuricaemia. He appeared ill, but was conscious with a blood pressure of 200/116 mm Hg and heart rate of 87 beats per minute. He had severe and persistent epigastralgia accompanied with left lumbar back pain, but his abdomen with no signs of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cell count (12.0 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), C reactive protein (0.65 mg/dL) and creatine phosphokinase (306 U/L), but troponin I was negative, lactate (1.4 mmol/L), and d-dimer (0.6 µg/mL) levels were within normal ranges. Electrocardiography revealed no abnormalities.\n\n【5】Initially, gastric anisakiasis was suspected because of the typical acute severe epigastralgia, which occurred within 12 hours of ingesting raw or undercooked seafood infested with nematodes of the genus Anisakis. 1 However, in this case, he had eaten sushi made with defrosted seafood, which was not a typical cause of gastric anisakiasis because parasitic anisakis is killed by freezing at −20°C. 2 Although there is a wide range of diseases that can cause abdominal pain in the emergency room, vascular diseases should be suspected, especially when physical examination findings are lacking in patients with acute severe abdominal pain. 3 Based on these findings, we decided to perform a contrast-enhanced abdominal CT to differentiate vascular diseases. The CT showed a dissection of the coeliac artery trunk and splenic infarction ( figure 1 ). Therefore, spontaneous isolated coeliac artery dissection (SICAD) was diagnosed. He was admitted into the high care unit and was fasted. Blood pressure-lowering therapy, analgesics, and anticoagulation were started. His abdominal pain was relieved and blood pressure was well controlled on the second day of hospitalisation, and discharged on the 18th day of hospitalisation. Ultrasonography before discharge and after 1 year showed no change in the size of the false lumen, and no aneurysm formation in the coeliac artery.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic CT showed a dissection of the coeliac artery trunk (white arrow heads) and splenic infarction (white arrows) (A: axial section and B: sagittal section).\n\n【10】SICAD without aortic dissection is considered an extremely rare condition. With the increasing use of CT to evaluate abdominal pain, SICAD has been diagnosed more frequently. 4 The male-to-female ratio of SICAD patients was 9:1 with a high age prevalence in the 50s. Approximately 40% of patients with SICAD have hypertension or a smoking history. 4 The main clinical manifestation of SICAD is a sudden onset of abdominal pain, 4 although some cases are asymptomatic and incidentally found on CT. 5 Among the morphological classification of SICAD, this case was diagnosed with type IIA, intramural haematoma only. 4 The coeliac artery branches into the common hepatic artery, left gastric artery and splenic artery, and the most documented end-organ infarction associated with SICAD is splenic infarctions, which occur in 11.2% of cases. 6 The gold standard for the diagnosis of SICAD is CT angiography of the abdomen. Conservative management, including fasting, blood pressure reduction and pain control, was considered to be the most common initial treatment for SICAD. Complications of severe intestinal ischaemia or ruptured aneurysms are absolute indications for endovascular treatment or surgery.\n\n【11】### Learning points\n\n【12】*   Spontaneous isolated coeliac artery dissection (SICAD) is a rare disease.\n    \n*   SICAD is more common in middle-aged men and the main clinical manifestation is a sudden onset of abdominal pain.\n    \n*   Vascular diseases should be suspected, especially when physical examination findings are lacking in patients with acute severe abdominal pain.\n    \n\n【13】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【14】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【15】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Here, we report a case of sudden and recurrent hearing loss following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in coincidence with detection of intralabyrinthine schwannoma and subsequent improvement on oral and then intratympanic steroid treatments.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A man in his 20s with normal vital records and blood pressure was referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) clinic for two times of sudden hearing losses of the left ear within three months following the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination. The oral steroids became ineffective for the recurrent hearing loss after initial effects to improve from the first hearing loss ( figure 1A ). He experienced the progressive hearing loss along with a continuous ringing and buzzing sound in the left ear, a slight spontaneous vertigo at the later stage of recurrent hearing loss, but no position-evoked vertigo was reported.\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】Figure 1\n\n【17】The timeline of clinical symptoms and treatments, audiometric and hearing measurement data, and MRI images of intralabyrinthine schwannoma.

No pure tone average abnormality or hearing loss symptoms were reported before vaccination.

Subsequent treatments with pseudoephedrine and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for suspected allergic otitis media with effusion did not show any improvement. Therefore, to improve ear congestion before the first audio test, the patient took antiallergic cetirizine HCI orally at a dose of 10 mg every 24 hours for 2 weeks (day 9–24) that restored the patient’s left ear hearing almost back to normal based on patient’s self-report and the first audiometric test on day 26 ( figure 1B , Audiogram 1), in which the tympanogram exhibited a normal bilateral type A pattern and masked bone conduction.\n\n【20】Unfortunately, 1 week later starting on day 31, the patient suffered from a second left-ear hearing loss with no response to the immediately resumed, 5-day cetirizine treatment, leading to impaired left ear hearing from most of the frequency range by day 44 ( figure 1B , Audiogram 2). For a differential diagnosis of Meniere’s disease which might be associated with fluctuating hearing losses, a high dose of oral steroid treatment of prednisone (60 mg/day for day 44–50 and tapered off through 5 days) was given but ineffective to improve. The third audiometric test on day 60 indicated a progressive sensorineural hearing loss of the left ear for low frequency compared with the normal right ear ( figure 1B–D , Audiograms 2 and 3), with a marginal decrease in word discrimination (%) ( figure 1E ), using the W-22 wordlist in the audio tests.\n\n【21】The patient was referred for videonystagmography test on day 76 which showed that the left ear had 93% weakness in the caloric testing and 50% directional preponderance to the right ( online supplemental figure 1 ). Tracking and optokinetic tests displayed asymmetrical optokinetics and decreased intensity for the left side compared with the right side ( online supplemental figures 2; 3 ).\n\n【22】### Supplemental material\n\n【23】\\[bcr-2022-249316supp001.pdf\\]\n\n【24】### Supplemental material\n\n【25】\\[bcr-2022-249316supp002.pdf\\]\n\n【26】### Supplemental material\n\n【27】\\[bcr-2022-249316supp003.pdf\\]\n\n【28】Considering Meniere’s disease does not normally present with sudden hearing loss neither progressive hearing loss after oral steroid treatment, we hypothesised that an inflammatory response might be triggered by the second dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and associated with two times of hearing losses. However, additional factors associated with the hearing loss needed to be determined.\n\n【29】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【30】A gadolinium-enhanced MRI was then performed at ENT on day 94, identifying a mass of about 6 × 4 mm labyrinthine schwannoma in the left vestibule ( figure 1F,G ). The images also revealed a reduction in the left side endolymph fluid ( figure 1H,I ). Thus, an internal labyrinthine schwannoma in the left side vestibule with extension into both the superior and lateral semicircular canals was detected.\n\n【31】The patient showed progressive left ear hearing loss on day 103 ( figure 1B–E , Audiogram 4) along with left ear ringing and mild vertigo ( figure 1A ). To identify potential risk factors associated with hearing loss, additional blood tests were performed showing normal complete blood counts (with differential analyses) and normal rheumatoid factor results without detection of autoimmune response. The comprehensive metabolic panel and blood lipid laboratory tests were also normal, largely excluding the possibility of metabolic dysregulation caused hearing damage. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were positively detected after vaccination ( online supplemental figure 4 ).\n\n【32】### Supplemental material\n\n【33】\\[bcr-2022-249316supp004.pdf\\]\n\n【34】Treatment\n---------\n\n【35】Suspecting an inflammatory response against the labyrinthine schwannoma following the two-dose vaccination, an intratympanic steroid injection of dexamethasone (10 mg/mL) was given once on day 103 by the ENT doctor to completely fill the left middle ear. Three days after the first local steroid treatment (day 106), the patient reported disappearance of the left ear ringing and buzzing. The hearing test revealed an average of 20 dB improvement in the left ear hearing on day 111 ( figure 1B–E , Audiogram 5). The patient then received the second intratympanic injection of 10 mg/mL dexamethasone to the left middle ear on day 117, resulting in a significant hearing recovery and word recognition score back to normal, shown by a hearing test on day 138 ( figure 1B–E , Audiogram 6).\n\n【36】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【37】Since the second treatment of local steroid injection on day 138, the patient had not reported any vertigo or further hearing loss for the following 4 months. The 7th audio test on day 252 showed a stable result similar as Audio 6 verifying the long-term improvement on the hearing ( figure 1B–E , Audiogram 7).\n\n【38】Discussion\n----------\n\n【39】The patient had no previous MRI scanning record nor hearing disorder history prior to COVID-19 vaccination. Considering that intralabyrinthine schwannoma would normally take years to develop without any symptoms, it most likely had developed before vaccination in this young patient. The fact that treatment with oral and intratympanic anti-inflammatory steroid medications to treat sudden and recurrent hearing loss implicates a possible immune response triggered to the pre-existing intralabyrinthine schwannoma following COVID-19 vaccination. However, there is no conclusive proof of causation between the vaccination and hearing loss.\n\n【40】A systematic review on auditory complications estimated a 7.6% of COVID-19 patients experienced with hearing loss, 14.8% with tinnitus and 7.2% with vertigo. 4 An earlier report of several Iranian patients experienced hearing loss in one ear, as well as vertigo. 5 Another case study reported an Egyptian man developed sudden hearing loss without any other coronavirus symptoms was tested positive for coronavirus. 6 Further research is necessary to determine if and/or how the SARS-CoV-2 infection 7 or COVID-19 vaccination induces acute otitis or hearing loss. In addition to other common clinical symptoms of respiratory virus infection (cough, fever, headache, loss of taste or smell and sore throat, etc), a variety of relatively rare clinical symptoms, including skin changes, eye problems, severe confusion (delirium) and sudden hearing loss are possibly increasing. 5 6\n\n【41】While the American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery guidelines for sudden hearing loss (below) need to be followed, this case demonstrates that when oral steroids lose effects on persistent and progressive hearing loss, advanced examination for possible organic diseases as well as timely and intensive immune suppression via intratympanic injections to the local microenvironment are necessary for a full recovery. It is critical for young patients to prevent permanent hearing loss and avoid possible surgical interventions. These data also suggest that vaccinated patients who suffer from inflammatory reactions and adverse effects should seek cautious evaluations, close symptomatic monitoring and strategic immune-suppressive treatment.\n\n【42】### The American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery guidelines for sudden hearing loss\n\n【43】1.  Clinicians should distinguish sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss. A sudden hearing loss is defined as a loss that occurs within a 72-hour period.\n    \n2.  Audiometric evaluation should be obtained within the first 2 weeks of the occurrence to prove the hearing loss.\n    \n3.  MRI is obtained to rule out retrocochlear involvement.\n    \n4.  The patient is offered corticosteroid, either oral or intratympanic.\n    \n\n【44】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【45】When I first heard I had a tumour in the left ear, I was completely shocked and started to search online for any possible explanation and treatment. There was no such information available, so I felt helpless. I had prepared for permanent loss of my left ear hearing. After experiencing all the up and downs along with all the tests and treatment trials, I am extremely grateful for the final improvements. The submission and ultimate publication of this case report will absolutely help similar patients in the future.\n\n【46】### Learning points\n\n【47】*   This is a rare case of two sudden, recurrent progressive hearing losses which have immediately followed the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination and coincided with detection of labyrinthine schwannoma.\n    \n*   Effective communications between the patient and a multidisciplinary team including otolaryngologist, virologists and cancer immunologists for differential diagnosis with MRI are pivotal to identify the association with COVID-19 vaccination and schwannoma.\n    \n*   Following the ear, nose and throat guidelines, implementation of the intratympanic steroid injection approach is effective to mitigate the local aggressive inflammatory response and ultimately restore the hearing.\n    \n\n【48】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【49】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【50】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【51】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【52】Thanks to the team effort publishing the case report which may help other patients recover from sudden and/or recurrent hearing loss.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Excessive recreational use can cause spinal cord myelopathy. Previous studies have discussed the medical management. However, none have specified the sensorimotor rehabilitation management. This case report documents the investigations, physical rehabilitation and functional outcomes in two cases of N <sub>2 </sub> O-associated myelopathy. Both presented with lower limb strength and sensorimotor integration impairments resulting in ataxic ambulation. Dorsal column signal abnormality was observed on T2-weighted MRI in one case. Myelopathy was diagnosed based on clinical presentation and both were treated with vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> . Rehabilitation was conceived and specified using the Rehabilitation Treatment Specification System (RTSS). Both cases achieved independent indoor gait on hospital discharge, and full function at 9 months in one case. Appropriate and timely medical management and reasoned rehabilitation provided excellent functional outcomes for N <sub>2 </sub> O-related myelopathy. By using the RTSS, reasoned rehabilitation efficacy can be tested in the future.\n\n【2】*   Neurology (drugs and medicines)\n*   Healthcare improvement and patient safety\n*   Medical management\n*   Spinal cord\n*   Physiotherapy (rehabilitation)\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

The UK lifetime-user prevalence rate from a non-probabilistic sample is 38.6%; typical users appear to be male clubbers in their 20s. 7 The catering industry’s development of small 8 g steel recharging canisters for whipped cream dispensers containing pressurised N <sub>2 </sub> O (bulbs, whippits, nangs) has made them ubiquitous to buy cheaply (50p–£2 per canister 8 ) usually in packs of 100. Use from large cylinders (2–10 kg) has become more prevalent recently. 9 N <sub>2 </sub> O remains legal to buy in the UK although this is now under review 10 not least due to recent media concern about the increase in chronic abuse, 11 and the alarming increase in use reported in the Netherlands, which has led it to plan for formal controls in 2023. 12 Consuming N <sub>2 </sub> O directly from the canister is dangerous—the pressure (~200 kPa) can cause barotrauma, 13 and the temperature of the gas near the outlet (−55°C 14 ) can cause frostbite injuries. 15 Instead, the gas is typically transferred into balloons via either the whipped cream dispenser or a secondary device (creamers or crackers) easily available that can dispense the canister gas into balloons inserted over the device spout. The preferred recreational use is to inhale or rebreathe the N <sub>2 </sub> O via the balloon at parties and festivals. 16\n\n【11】Although recreational N <sub>2 </sub> O use is relatively safe compared with other drugs, acute harm includes falls, accidental injury, confusion 7 or vomit aspiration. 17 Acute death is rare. A 2016 systematic review of case reports found evidence of 29 case deaths mostly due to acute asphyxiation due to hypoxia with users consuming N <sub>2 </sub> O with a mask or plastic bag. 18 In the UK, 17 deaths were reported between 2006 and 2012 19 mainly due to accidental asphyxia when N <sub>2 </sub> O displaces oxygen if used in enclosed spaces. 20 Most users inhale low doses per session (1–2 canisters), but overuse exists (~100 canisters), which can lead to persistent neurological sequelae. Chronic clinical toxicity is due to N <sub>2 </sub> O’s interaction with vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> converting it from an active to an inactive form by irreversible oxidation. 21 By impairing methylation reactions and DNA synthesis, oxidation results in an accumulation of homocysteine and impaired maintenance of the myelin sheath. 22 Thus, B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency from excessive N <sub>2 </sub> O use can cause demyelination of the central and peripheral nervous system and a diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration (SACD). If demyelination presents in the spinal cord, the dorsal columns are classically affected, with sometimes the lateral but rarely the anterior columns. The associated diagnostic procedures, neural impairments (progressive vibratory and proprioceptive sensory abnormalities, ascending paraesthesia, ataxic gait, hyporeflexia or hyper-reflexia, and rarely muscle weakness and loss of sphincter control 23–25 ), and medical treatment options have been described in medical case reports and observational studies of SACD of the spinal cord previously. 22 25–36\n\n【12】In contrast, _rehabilitative_ treatment options for N <sub>2 </sub> O abuse SACD are not as pervasive in the literature. It is as if patients are expected to recover naturally with cursory reassurance and good luck. One published case study advocates physicians to be cognisant that tailored rehabilitation for a patient’s functional and neuropsychiatric impairments can limit the extent of neurological damage, 37 and another clinical review advises medical clinicians to refer to physiotherapy if a patient’s mobility is affected. 38 Yet, rehabilitation treatment is not well specified even in these welcome cases.\n\n【13】This lack of rehabilitation specificity is not unusual in research into rehabilitation treatment efficacy where objective definitions of treatments of interest, or even ‘usual care’, 39 are required. For surgical or pharmacological treatments, it is usual for active treatment ingredients to be obvious and be specified as chemical structures or anatomical results. In contrast, rehabilitation specification is challenging for several reasons. A binary definition of rehabilitation is tenuous because there are non-binary categories of rehabilitation, 40 rehabilitation ingredients are not obvious, rehabilitation treatments attempt to change multiple interacting patient functions (eg, muscle strength, movement fluidity, participation in occupation) and specific treatment ingredient definitions do not exist, let alone their downstream effect on patient function. 41 To date, the active ingredients of treatment at the macro level of acute inpatient rehabilitation are rarely specified, which equates with the ‘black box’ approach where little insight into the active treatment ingredients is given which is a typical criticism in the rehabilitation science and clinical communities. 42 The recently developed coherent framework (the Rehabilitation Treatment Specification System (RTSS)) addresses the black box problem by developing methods that specify, and ultimately measure, the rehabilitative content (ingredients), that via theoretical or observed processes (mechanisms of action), cause a change in desired systems (targets). 43 Because of relative rarity of both the clinical condition and the specification of its rehabilitation using the RTSS, the following report of two cases with spinal cord injury post-N <sub>2 </sub> O overuse is intended to provide an exemplar of holistic medical and rehabilitation management. It was prepared following the Case Report guidelines. 44\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】The patients were both male. Case 1 was in his early teens (mass 71.7 kg, height 183.0 cm, body mass index (BMI) 21.4 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and case 2 was in his 20s (54.1 kg, 173.5 cm, BMI 18.0 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) on presentation to our large, urban hospital emergency department. Case 1 presented with a 2-day history of gradually worsening lower leg weakness, sensory disturbance in a stocking distribution, reduced balance and mobility. Case 2 presented with a 3-month history of altered leg sensation/weakness commencing with bilateral distal sensory disturbance progressing to pins and needles in a stocking distribution with bilateral leg weakness and reduced mobility.\n\n【16】Neither disclosed any medical history, nor recalled using other recreational drugs except for case 1 who chose to smoke cannabis occasionally. Both confirmed consuming five to six units of alcohol socially per week. History of N <sub>2 </sub> O consumption was similar for both cases and varied from 50 to 100 canisters per month (usually with large quantities in a single sitting). However, both cases describe an acute escalation in consumption to 100–200 canisters in the week prior to hospital admission. Case 1 was in full-time education, and case 2 worked part time as a football coach. Both cases lived in rented flats; case 1 with his mother, and case 2 with his parents and siblings.\n\n【17】Both patients presented with normal cognition, orientation and fluent speech. The cranial nerves and upper limb examination were normal. There were no cerebellar signs. The sensorimotor lower limb impairments ( table 1 ) included distal lower limb weakness measured using the Medical Research Council ordinal rating scale 45 and translated into diminished ambulatory function with both cases requiring aids to transfer or walk. Neither case presented with any urinary or bowel dysfunction.\n\n【18】View this table:\n\n【19】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【20】Table 1\n\n【21】Clinical features and investigation findings at initial assessment\n\n【22】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【23】Methylmalonic acid (MMA) serum levels were elevated above the normal threshold level of 243 nmol/L, 46 more so in case 1 ( table 1 ) indicative of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency. Serum folate levels in both cases were unremarkable (3.8 μg/L and 4.9 μg/L for cases 1 and 2, respectively; both within the normal range of 3.1–20.5 µg/L). Other investigations are summarised in table 1 .\n\n【24】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【25】Thorough history taking identified a gradual onset of symptoms over several days, ruling out a vascular cause of neurological dysfunction such as spinal or cerebral stroke. Further neurological assessment and clinical investigations ( table 1 ), along with a history of excessive N <sub>2 </sub> O intake, led to a diagnosis of SACD of the spinal cord causing sensorimotor myelopathy.\n\n【26】Treatment\n---------\n\n【27】### Case 1\n\n【28】Intramuscular hydroxocobalamin injections (1 mg) were provided daily for 1 week and then on alternate days for a further week. The patient was advised to cease all recreational drug use including N <sub>2 </sub> O inhalation. Physiotherapy treatment (total with therapist 445 min) was provided in 11 sessions over a 12-day inpatient stay (mean 40.5 min/session). Clinical assessment revealed bilateral lower limb sensorimotor weakness, and a total score of 7 out of 56 on the Berg Balance Scale (BBS—a 14-item ordinal measure that assesses static balance, functional mobility and falls risk 47 ) indicated difficulties in functional mobility and balance particularly a reliance on visual sensory cues, and poor planning of whole body transitional movement and reactions to centre-of-mass excursions. Seeing as the mean (±SD) BBS for a sample of ambulatory spinal cord injured-paraplegic participants (American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale D (AIS-D)) 48 is 44.8 (±13.0), 49 case 1’s functional mobility and balance deficits at initial assessment were profound, a finding supported by their slow observed average (10 m) self-selected gait velocity (0.29 m/s) indicative of a home-only ambulator. 50 Overall activities of daily living function was moderate (modified Barthel Index 51 12 out of 20). The aims of physical rehabilitation treatment were safe community ambulation with or without walking aids. Treatment specification was undertaken based on the RTSS 43 ( table 2 ) and includes interventions designed to affect volitional rehabilitation behaviour using a behaviour change model that considers three essential conditions: capability, opportunity and motivation (COM-B system). 52\n\n【29】View this table:\n\n【30】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【31】Table 2\n\n【32】Treatment specification based on the RTSS for cases 1 and 2\n\n【33】### Case 2\n\n【34】Intramuscular hydroxocobalamin injections (1 mg) for 1 week were provided which was reduced to alternating days for a further week. He was also prescribed oral paracetamol 1 g four times a day, codeine phosphate 30 mg four times a day and gabapentin 300 mg three times a day for symptom control. Similarly to case 1, the patient was also advised to cease recreational N <sub>2 </sub> O inhalation. Physiotherapy treatment (370 min) was provided in 12 sessions over a 14-day inpatient stay (30.9 min/session). Assessment revealed similar impairments to case 1: bilateral lower limb sensorimotor weakness ( table 1 ). A combined time of 0/120 s on the modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (CTSIB-M—a performance measure quantifying postural standing control under four sensory conditions each tolerated for up to 30 s for a maximum score of 120 s 53 54 ) indicated their sensorimotor balance control was profoundly impaired. In fact, case 2’s impairments were so profound compared with case 1; they were unable to ambulate at all and required maximal assistance to transfer safely. The aims of treatment were nonetheless the same as in case 1 and remained safe community ambulation with or without walking aids. Treatment specification was undertaken based on the RTSS ( table 2 ).\n\n【35】While folic acid treatment was not indicated to correct abnormal serum folate levels in either of our cases, it should be noted that correcting any diagnosed folate insufficiency should be undertaken only after initial phase B <sub>12 </sub> replacement to prevent worsening of the neurological spinal cord degeneration. 55\n\n【36】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【37】Cases 1 and 2 improved with treatment and their MMA concentration levels were within the normal range prior to hospital discharge. There were however residual sensorimotor deficits. In case 1, plantarflexor strength was graded at 5/5 on reassessment prior to hospital discharge, but dorsiflexion strength had only recovered to 3/5 bilaterally. Proprioception was no longer impaired at the ankle, but distal impairments remained bilaterally. In addition, there were residual sensory impairments to light touch on the left in an L1–S1 and on the right an L5 dermatomal distribution. He was independently mobile with foot-up splints (due to dorsiflexor fatigue over longer distances) and two elbow crutches up to 45 m but could not ambulate outdoors. Average gait speed increased from 0.29 to 0.41 m/s, an increase of 0.12 m/s, which is a clinically meaningful difference 56 but still less than the comfortable average gait velocity threshold of 0.49 m/s that delineates community from household-only ambulation. 50 His sensorimotor recovery translated to a meaningful improvement in his BBS (47 of 56), and a Barthel score of 17 out of 20 on discharge. The patient was duly referred to local community physiotherapy services available at their discharge residence for treatment as specified.\n\n【38】On discharge, case 2 had residual impaired sensation to light touch bilaterally in an L4–S1 dermatomal distribution. Proprioception at the first metatarsals remained absent bilaterally. He was independently mobile indoors with two elbow crutches up to 60 m and was able to control the knee avoiding recurvatum during stance phases in ≥90% of gait cycles. Indoor independent gait velocity at discharge was 0.38 m/s. However, he could not ambulate outdoors independently similarly to case 1. His recovery translated to an improved CTSIB-M (71/120 s) revealing residual reliance on visual sensory information, and a Barthel score of 19 out of 20. He too was duly referred for outpatient therapy for treatment as specified; no community therapy options were available at his discharge residence.\n\n【39】Case 1 chose to not participate in further therapy or medical follow-up. In contrast, case 2 attended further physiotherapy and was reviewed in an outpatient medical clinic 3 weeks post-hospital discharge. He was ambulating independently but self-reported mildly impaired balance. While proprioception was intact on clinical examination, he presented with symmetrical, lower limb impaired light touch sensation in a stocking distribution, and could only tolerate the Romberg position (eyes closed) 57 for 22 s without excessive sway or losing balance.\n\n【40】At a subsequent outpatient medical clinic review at 9 months post-hospital discharge, case 2 reported a full recovery including being able to sprint on a treadmill in his physiotherapy sessions. Repeat neurophysiology tests showed improved conduction velocities and normal sensory studies; however, compound muscle action potentials in the lower limbs remained below the normal range.\n\n【41】Discussion\n----------\n\n【42】We observed profound sensorimotor impairment caused by excessive N <sub>2 </sub> O abuse which led to SACD of the spinal cord in two cases. The cases presented with typical features that collectively confirmed the diagnosis. First, a clinical myelopathy anatomically localised to the spinal cord (confirmed by MRI studies in case 1); second, evidence of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency; and lastly, an absence of identifiable central or peripheral nervous system pathology in keeping with the clinical findings. 23 The lack of confirmatory imaging studies in case 2 is not unusual—a published series of 54 patients with dorsal column injury reported low sensitivity with imaging confirming the diagnosis only in 8 patients (14.8%). 58 Previous literature has reported excessive N <sub>2 </sub> O use and vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency cases whose main presenting symptoms were weakness, paraesthesia and ataxic gait, 22 28 32 falls, 31 33 absent or impaired deep tendon reflexes and diminished vibration sense, 26 29 hyporeflexia, 34 limb proprioceptive abnormalities 27 30 and wide-based steppage gait, 35 not dissimilar to the present cases.\n\n【43】While resolution of symptoms following vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> therapy is sometimes incomplete in older patients (mean (±SD) age 55.9 (±15.5) years), it tends to be complete in younger patients (39.8 (±18.8) years). 23 So it was not surprising that the two young cases presented in this paper progressed in their recovery and made a near full sensorimotor recovery at 9 months, at least in the second case. Because their sensorimotor function returned to near normal, we can presume that the two cases did not re-abuse N <sub>2 </sub> O while we followed them up. If they had re-abused N <sub>2 </sub> O inhalation during the follow-up period, then B <sub>12 </sub> would have been deactivated very rapidly with a commensurate deterioration in neurology and we would have expected to have observed a relapse in balance and ambulation dysfunction. 59 Re-abuse could be a sign of addiction to N <sub>2 </sub> O although N <sub>2 </sub> O inhalation addiction is contentious within the literature. 18 60 61 While clinical discourse to persuade cessation of use appears to have been successful in these two cases, clinicians should be aware that patients presenting with acute recreational N <sub>2 </sub> O toxicity should be provided with necessary psychosocial support if difficulties in self-selected cessation of abuse are suspected. 38\n\n【44】The positive outcomes overall in the two cases presented here are almost certainly due to the medical diagnostic procedures and subsequent clinical decision to commence vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> treatment in a timely way with regular monitoring. What is less clear is whether the equally timely and novel specification of rehabilitation interventions using the RTSS led to a more reasoned and tailored physical therapy approach. To our knowledge, this is the first specified rehabilitation report using the RTSS in cases of this type. By acting as a coherent framework for specifying rehabilitation interventions based on the clinician’s treatment theory, the RTSS fractionates multidimensional and progressive rehabilitation interventions into entities (treatment components) that are amenable to clinical adoption (including among clinical colleagues) and empirical research. 41 Thus, the specification described herein acts first as a reasoned approach for fellow rehabilitation clinicians to use with these patients downstream of the acute hospital; second, as an example for other clinicians treating similar cases; and lastly, as a record of the specified treatment to inform researchers. It is worth noting though that the treatment specifications provided are examples peculiar to the two cases presented. They are not meant as a prescriptive regime for all patients presenting with sensorimotor system impairments due to recreational N <sub>2 </sub> O toxicity and functional B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency. Nonetheless, we contend that in successfully specifying the treatment in this way, the patient’s treatment was reasoned and tailored and thus verifies the RTSS’s utility.\n\n【45】The impairments (bilateral lower limb sensorimotor) and aims of treatment (restitution of normal ambulatory function) were specified identically between cases. Treatments were also identical based on organ function targets (muscle strengthening and stretching), and skills and habits targets (function balance and ambulation practise tasks). Representation targets were identical too. They were designed to influence cognitive processes when managing the musculoskeletal integrity and injurious falls risks inherently associated with distal lower limb paralysis, and ensure the consequences of failing to voluntary manage those risks were understood.\n\n【46】However, there were treatment specification differences between cases because case 2 initially presented with impairments so profound that no ambulatory function was possible. Case 2 presented with proximal lower limb joint symmetrical weakness and more widespread proprioceptive loss. Therefore, therapy time was prioritised towards specifying a more widespread and explicit strengthening programme and more rudimentary static balance tasks compared with case 1.\n\n【47】What's more, when case 2 progressed to ambulating, knee recurvatum (KR) was observed during some, but not all, stance phases. KR is a relatively common impairment observed in other neurological pathologies (eg, 30%–50% of ambulatory hemiplegic stroke survivors 62 63 ). In normal continuous gait, coordination between pretibial muscle contraction (which restrains ankle plantarflexion and allows the tibia to move forward over the foot during weight acceptance) and triceps surae/quadriceps contraction (crucial to restraining tibial forward motion during mid-stance while the femoral segment progresses forward distal to it with extension at the knee) controls knee flexion and forward tibial movement over the stationary foot in stance phases. 64\n\n【48】While the main cause for gait KR is premature overactivity or spasticity of the plantarflexors which prevents the knee from flexing during loading response in early stance 63 65 or vasti hypertonia, 66 67 we reasoned that KR in case 2 was due to dorsiflexion/plantarflexion muscle weakness, poor proprioception and reliance on forward placed walking aids. This is because no muscle hyper-reflexia was observed on assessment at the ankle or knee. The variability of KR observed in case 2 was probably due to instances when knee hyperextension was simply deployed to stabilise the knee in stance by adopting a quadriceps-avoidance strategy sometimes seen in anterior cruciate ligament deficient gait 68 in combination with plantarflexion weakness during mid-stance. 69 Our theory therefore was that treatment ingredients targeting muscle weakness and sensory integration (including proprioception) in static balance would ameliorate the KR in case 2. Passive treatment ingredients designed to target KR more directly to support the approach would include issuing of rigid ankle/foot orthotics which were avoided here. Instead, gait re-education was deployed via instructions based on implicit motor learning to avoid KR with delayed knowledge-of-performance feedback. 70\n\n【49】Specified treatments were not then all identical between cases and support the argument that treatment was tailored for the two cases. This is one of the advantages of the RTSS. Its coherent framework is intended to administer the complexity of rehabilitation practice in the interactions of clinical impairments, dysfunctions and participation in society in order to specify individuals’ rehabilitation treatment. 43 Yet, the two cases’ rehabilitation treatment aims were similar and were focused on ambulation function. Acute adult inpatient physical rehabilitation often includes stressing motor systems toward safe, independent ambulation because ambulatory function is a key milestone for discharge planning. This is important within the goal of reducing acute hospital length of stay (LOS) which is itself dependent on coherent, equitable and resourced rehabilitation services downstream of an acute setting. But the problem with yoking rehabilitation with minimising LOS is that the rehabilitation aim is often achievement of minimal _adaptive_ ambulatory function necessary for a safe discharge. The aim instead should be the _restitution_ 71 of ambulatory function, especially since stroke 72 and spinal cord-injured 73 neurorehabilitation patients express it as their primary goal. Restitution of ambulatory performance therefore requires rehabilitative progression towards premorbid performance, not merely an assessment of current ambulatory performance.\n\n【50】The RTSS includes accurate specification of rehabilitation progression and was included throughout the two cases described. For ambulatory function, a separate treatment ingredient was included so the two cases were proficient in self-monitoring their exertional fatigue—a common symptom burden for patients with acute spinal cord injury. 74 That allowed the ambulatory treatment’s progression to be specified in both cases by attributing the therapeutic dose of ambulatory practise (distance or time walked) with the patient’s increase in self-rated exertional fatigue (using a dual Numerical and Face Rating Scale 75 ) during ambulatory treatment ingredients.\n\n【51】Similar separate treatment ingredients were included in our specification designed for the cases to attain skills and habits in managing the risk to their musculoskeletal integrity by applying ankle resting splints and foot-up devices when ambulating. We contend that without the RTSS’s coherent framework, there would be a risk that therapists might not have clinically reasoned tailored treatments as thoroughly, nor been as accurate in specifying it.\n\n【52】In conclusion, the combination of timely medical treatment and specific and clinically reasoned rehabilitation in a structured format using the RTSS provided excellent functional outcomes in both the acute and subacute phases post-injury in two individuals who sustained N <sub>2 </sub> O-induced spinal cord injury. Stronger conclusions can be drawn when future studies determine the impact of rehabilitation on clinical outcomes at the impairment, activity and participation levels in this patient cohort by virtue of using the RTSS.\n\n【53】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【54】Case 2 and his next of kin were able to provide their perspective of their assessment and treatment.\n\n【55】Before the hospital admission we had no idea about the possible side effects of the inhaled canisters. Lots of the young people where we live took them at parties and we believed that they were risk free, we had never heard of others experiencing medical complications from taking them.\n\n【56】The profound loss of ambulation was terrifying particularly because there were no initial explanation why these symptoms had occurred.\n\n【57】When we initially went to hospital the doctors weren’t sure what was the cause of the weak legs and the inability to walk. After the scans the doctors explained that there was a problem with the nerves in the back and they weren’t totally sure if my son’s walking would fully recover. They thought that the gas canisters were the cause because of some of the blood test results. We were all shocked that this had happened and it was scary to hear that someone so young might have long term effects that they would have to live with. It was hard for us not to know what the future may hold for him, we felt very worried.\n\n【58】However, the medical assessment and treatment and the inpatient physical therapy rehabilitation delivered enabled meaningful recovery – a recovery that was complete after receiving longer term community physiotherapy. We feel lucky that my son has made a full recovery, it was slow to begin with and he had to work hard in physio sessions in the hospital. Unfortunately it took quite a long time for him to get seen in the physio clinic after leaving hospital, but he’s now managing to do everything he could do before the injury. We are thankful for all of the care that my son received.\n\n【59】### Learning points\n\n【60】*   Rates of nitrous oxide recreational use are rising, meaning that incidents of abuse and associated subacute combined degeneration pathology may also rise leading to profound sensorimotor dysfunction.\n    \n*   Timely diagnosis and medical treatment to reverse vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency in combination with skilled physical rehabilitation led to favourable outcomes.\n    \n*   Specified treatment from rehabilitation clinicians in the acute phase after neurological pathology in these two cases shows that timely, tailored and theoretically reasoned treatments can be put into practice if the goal is to restitute normal movement function.\n    \n\n【61】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【62】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【63】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

This was accompanied by near-complete loss of hair from all over the body. A wide-based gait was present with bowing of legs. He had protuberant eyes, decreased facial fat and wrinkled, shiny skin over the dorsae of hands and feet ( figure 1 ). Prominent veins were evident on the scalp. Teeth, nails, palms and soles were normal. There was mild global developmental delay and failure to thrive (weight for age, height for age and weight for height <−3SD). There was no history of photosensitivity, recurrent infections, ocular or any other systemic complaints. The family history was unremarkable. Radiographs of hands revealed bilateral acro-osteolysis and scannogram showed bilateral coxa valga, but no evidence of rickets or osteopenia ( figure 2 ). Routine investigations were normal except for mild anaemia (Hb=111 g/L). Trichoscopy and trichogram showed unmedullated normal hair shaft with pigment dilution. With these clinical features, a diagnosis of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) was considered. Sanger sequencing revealed a heterozygous mutation in exon 11 of Laminin A gene, c.1824C>T (p.G608G), which is known to occur in >90% of patients with HGPS. 1 Further workup for serum insulin levels, fasting lipid profile and echocardiography was within normal limit.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】(A) Trunk showing mottled brown hyperpigmentation with mild diffuse induration.

HGPS/progeria is the most common and well-studied progeroid laminopathy, occurring sporadically as an autosomal dominant disorder. Skin abnormalities including alopecia (100%), transient sclerodermoid changes (78%), prominent skin vasculature (22%) and dyspigmentation (16%) are often the initial clinical signs in HGPS along with failure to thrive and the characteristic facies. 3 Unlike some other progeroid syndromes, the immune system remains unaffected in HGPS, with normal IgM, IgG, IgA levels as well as largely normal lymphocyte phenotyping. 4 The average lifespan is 14.6 (range 1.6–27.5) years, 5 with the most common cause of mortality being cardiovascular. The differential diagnosis include atypical progeria syndromes, mandibuloacral dysplasia, acrogeria, metageria, neonatal progeroid syndromes, Penttinen syndrome; Cockayne syndrome and Rothmund-Thompson syndrome. Knowledge of specific clinical features narrows the differential to test for specific mutations, thus bringing down the cost of genetic testing. A correct diagnosis holds prognostic value as well as the possibility of trial of farnesyl transferase inhibitors such as lonafarnib, which has shown improved mortality outcomes in these patients with an HR of 0.12. 6 However, this could not be tried in our case due to lack of availability. The child remains under regular follow-up.\n\n【14】### Learning points\n\n【15】*   Early clinical constellation of findings that point towards the genetic diagnosis of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria includes sclerodermoid skin change, alopecia, cutaneous dyspigmentation, prominent veins and failure to thrive.\n    \n*   Patients of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria should be screened for cardiac and metabolic comorbidities and kept under regular follow-up, as the most common cause of death is cardiovascular.\n    \n*   Farnesyl transferase inhibitors may have a mortality benefit, and there is currently an ongoing trial in combination with everolimus ( NCT02579044 ).\n    \n\n【16】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【17】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【18】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

She was disoriented and had bilateral abducens palsy and papilloedema. Hypotonia of the lower limbs, appendicular ataxia, choreoathetotic movements of the trunk and neck rigidity were also noted. The clinical picture was interpreted as a meningoencephalomyelitis of probable infectious nature, given the neurological examination and presentation with fever. The main differential diagnosis included immune-mediated encephalitis, which could be related to a primary autoimmune disorder (neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorders), a post-infectious (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)) or a paraneoplastic cause.\n\n【5】MRI showed T2 and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities in the periventricular white matter, basal ganglia and thalami, brainstem and dentate nuclei of cerebellum. There were also FLAIR hyperintense sulci on the posterior temporal and occipital lobes ( figure 1A–D ). Imaging of the spinal cord revealed a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis ( figure 1E,F ). No enhancement was present. Lumbar puncture revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis and hyperproteinorrachia (protein 253.5 mg/dL (range 15–45), 18 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> with lymphocyte predominance, glucose 36 mg/dL (range 40–70)). Multiplex PCR was negative for viruses. A presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune meningoencephalomyelitis was considered. The patient was started on induction therapy with methylprednisolone IV (1 g/day for 5 days) and immunoglobulin IV (0.4 g/kg/day in a total of 20 g/day for 5 days). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antibodies for IgG anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were positive, and AQP4-IgG were negative. A paraneoplastic cause was investigated, and transvaginal ultrasonography found a right ovarian teratoma with 20 mm. A laparoscopic oophorectomy was performed, and maintenance immunotherapy was started with oral prednisolone (5 mg/day), with subsequent tapering. During hospitalisation, there was a progressive neurological and dysautonomic improvement. The patient started a physical rehabilitation programme, regaining the ability to walk and at discharge maintaining only a slight left abducens palsy without visual impairment. At 6 months’ follow-up appointment, the patient had fully recovered and showed no neurological deficits.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Brain MRI showing bilateral axial FLAIR hyperintensities (arrows) in the periventricular white matter (A), basal ganglia and thalami (B), brainstem (C) and dentate nuclei of cerebellum (D) and hyperintense sulci on the posterior temporal and occipital lobes (arrowheads A–C).

GFAP-IgG detection is highly specific for inflammatory meningoencephalomyelitis when screened for in CSF. A paraneoplastic aetiology is found in some patients, with ovarian teratoma being the most common. 3 4 Tumour resection and immunotherapy are of paramount importance to improving clinical outcomes. 5\n\n【11】### Learning points\n\n【12】*   Autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy is a steroid-responsive central nervous system disorder presenting with symptoms and signs in the spectrum of meningoencephalomyelitis.\n    \n*   Approximately one in four patients have a paraneoplastic cause, most commonly ovarian teratoma and tumour resection can be important to stop neurological progression.\n    \n*   Despite the absence of post-gadolinium enhancement on imaging, a longitudinally extensive myelitis in a patient with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-IgG detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with additional paraclinical findings (inflammatory CSF) warrants clinical suspicion.\n    \n\n【13】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【14】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【15】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

On the first visit, he had no fever, abnormalities in vital signs or physical examination findings. Chest X-ray revealed opacity in the right fifth intercostal space in the right upper lung field, which suggested a mass lesion such as a bone primary tumour or metastasis ( figure 1A ). Chest CT showed fusion of the right fifth and sixth ribs, which led to a diagnosis of congenital costal fusion ( figure 1B ).

Rib malformations are frequently associated with a thoracic or thoracolumbar scoliosis. 4 On the other hand, costal fusion frequently occurs in the first and second ribs, which can cause a thoracic outlet syndrome. 5 If opacity is seen in the intercostal space on chest X-ray, physicians should first carefully check the differences between the left and right sides of the intercostal space and rib cage on physical examination and chest X-ray rather than quickly perform CT under suspicion of mass lesions. In addition, the presence of thoracic or thoracolumbar scoliosis and symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome could also be helpful for diagnosis. In this case, careful interpretation of the radiographs indicated that the right fifth intercostal space was narrower than that on the left. Not only radiologists but also physicians should be well familiarised with costal fusion, which is not uncommon, to make the correct diagnosis.\n\n【10】### Learning points\n\n【11】*   Congenital costal fusion can be misinterpreted as lesions on chest X-ray.\n    \n*   Physicians should first carefully check the differences between the left and right sides of the intercostal space and rib cage on physical examination and chest X-ray rather than quickly perform CT under suspicion of mass lesions.\n    \n\n【12】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【13】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【14】Obtained.\n\n【15】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【16】We thank Richard Lipkin, PhD, from Edanz Group ( https://en-author-services.edanz.com/ ) for editing a draft of this manuscript.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

This case highlights the need to relentlessly pursue a diagnosis and to consider atypical pathology in immune compromised patients. A tissue sample yielded highly beneficial and unexpected results.

Reported cases are limited, many of which have been fatal, so we wish to document both a rare illness and successful treatment outcome. 1 2\n\n【10】Microsporidia have been reclassified from protozoa to fungi and have emerged as an opportunistic infection first highlighted during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 3 4 While it can infect immune competent hosts, it is increasingly prevalent and potentially fatal in the malignancy, autoimmune and transplant populations. 5 Over 1400 species exist and at least 17 are known to be human pathogens; the implicated species from this case, _A. algerae_ , has been isolated in the gut of mosquitoes and larvae. 6 7 Human acquisition of microsporidia remains unclear, although animals are hosts and interspecies transmission via inhalation or ingestion of water contaminated with spores is likely. 8\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A man in his 50s was admitted to hospital with declining renal function and 4 months of generalised myalgia, weakness and bilateral hand and wrist swelling. He also reported mild dysphagia, early morning headaches, nausea and blurred vision in the left eye. He described chills, but no fevers, sweats or weight loss. Medical history included a bilateral sequential lung transplantation for cystic fiborosis-related bronchiectasis 5 years earlier, stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) from repeated prerenal injury, post-transplant diabetes mellitus, chronic migraines and osteoporosis. Regular medications included calcitriol 0.25 µg daily, calcium carbonate 1500 mg daily, cholecalciferol 25 µg daily, furosemide 40 mg daily, lercanidipine 20 mg daily, prazosin 5 mg two times per day, methyldopa 250 mg three times a day, metoprolol 50 mg two times per day, insulin aspartate subcut eight units three times a day, insulin protaphane eight units daily, sodium chloride 600 mg daily, tacrolimus 4 mg two times per day, mycophenolate sodium 720 mg two times per day, prednisolone 7.5 mg daily, Bactrim DS ½ tab two times weekly, azithromycin 250 mg three times weekly, Aranesp weekly, denosumab 60 mg 6 monthly, Creon pro re nata and 3 monthly botulinum toxin injections. The maintenance prednisolone dose had been increased to 17.5 mg daily for several weeks to treat myalgia.\n\n【13】The patient resided on a rural property performing plant revegetation, which involved soil exposure, as well as digging out a self-composting toilet. He drank rainwater, which was UV filtered prior to consumption. Pets included dogs and horses. There was no recent overseas travel and no family history of malignancy or autoimmune disease.\n\n【14】On examination, he was afebrile, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, SpO <sub>2 </sub> 100% on room air and hypertensive at 150/90 mm Hg. There was bilateral dorsal hand swelling, nil synovitis and muscle compartments were soft and non-tender. Muscle pain was elicited on passive stretching. There were no rashes, lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Signs of meningism were absent and neurological examination was unremarkable. Besides mild hypovolaemia, the remainder of the general examination was unremarkable.\n\n【15】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【16】Investigations revealed a creatinine of 426 µmol/L (60–110), estimated glomerular filtration rate 13 mL/min, lactate dehydrogenase 374 U/L (120–250), corrected calcium 2.95 mmol/L (2.1–2.6), parathormone (PTH) 1 pmol/L (2–9.3), haemoglobin 98 g/L (135–180), white cell count 7.7×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, 4–11 lymphocytes 0.19×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, 1–4 platelets 242×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (140–400) and creatine kinase (CK) 578 U/L (46–171). C reactive protein was 138 mg/L (normal<5 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 30 mm/hour (<12 mm/hour). One month prior, corrected calcium was 3.26 mmol/L and creatinine 290 µmol/L .\n\n【17】CT scan of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis was largely unremarkable besides chronic sinusitis.\n\n【18】Fevers to 38.3°C developed on day 8 (D+8) and persisted for over 2 weeks. No infective process was identified despite multiple sets of blood, urine and mycobacterial cultures. Lumbar puncture (LP) had an opening pressure of 25 mm Hg with normal cerebrospinal fluid biochemistry, cell count, microscopy and negative cryptococcal antigen. Repeat 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D off supplementation was 163 pmol/L (60–110) and parahormone 0.7 L (2–9.3) with a concurrent corrected calcium of 2.84 mmol/L.\n\n【19】MRI of the brain, upper and lower limbs showed non-specific scattered white matter lesions, widespread myositis in all intrinsic muscles of the left hand and extensive multifocal myositis in the lower limbs ( figure 1 ). The vastus lateralis was identified for a muscle biopsy, which was performed on D+12.\n\n【20】<img/>\n\n【21】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【22】Figure 1\n\n【23】(A) Coronal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) demonstrates heterogenous high signal throughout the imaged lower limb musculature and subcutaneous tissue, corresponding to diffuse oedema.

Microscopy and Ziehl-Neelsen stains were negative for infection.\n\n【30】Muscle biopsy results returned 1 week later. Microscopy identified patchy mononuclear cell inflammation associated with foci of muscle fibre necrosis. Intracellular aggregates as well as extracellular spore-like organisms with a diameter of up to 3 µm consistent with microsporidia were present in areas of muscle inflammation ( figures 3–5 ). Moderate red staining on Gomori trichrome staining was evident.

Lesions were debrided and microscopy of the corneal scrapings demonstrated intracellular organisms present as multiple spores within microcysts highlighted on Grocott and Giemsa stains confirming microsporidiosis and PCR testing positive.\n\n【44】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【45】This case remained a diagnostic dilemma with a seemingly poor prognosis despite good health and excellent quality of life several months prior. Key aspects to consider were the subacute but progressive nature of the illness and recognising the degree of immunodeficiency in the host.\n\n【46】Differential diagnoses for the myositis included a paraneoplastic, infective or an autoimmune process. Performing MRI and achieving a muscle biopsy with skilled histopathology review was crucial in achieving the correct diagnosis. PET/CT was performed to investigate for occult malignancy, vasculitis or granulomatous disease and was useful in clarifying the extent of infection and providing a baseline for response to treatment.\n\n【47】Refractory hypercalcaemia was unusual aspect of the case. Differentials for PTH-independent hypercalcaemia include malignancy, granulomatous disease, vitamin A or D intoxication and hyperthyroidism. The elevated 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D persisting after cessation of calcitriol was suggestive of a granulomatous process, as can occur with sarcoidosis or atypical infections such as disseminated mycobacterial or fungal infection.\n\n【48】Renal function continued to deteriorate despite euvolaemia, appropriate calcineurin levels and the exclusion of obstruction. Microsporidial infection and refractory hypercalcaemia likely contributed to acute tubular injury and the background changes of severe cortical atrophy provided prognostic value, prompting workup for dialysis.\n\n【49】Severe early morning headaches were suggestive of raised intracranial pressure, although there was no papilloedema on funduscopy and MRI and LP excluded a space occupying lesion or meningitis. The patient suffered from chronic migraines likely exacerbated by keratitis and subsequent albendazole. Infectious keratitis can be bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic in aetiology; however, the characteristic white punctate epithelial infiltrates seen on ocular examination are typical of microsporidia.\n\n【50】Treatment\n---------\n\n【51】Initial treatment included intravenous fluid and analgesia. No antibiotics were administered given clinical stability and zoledronic acid was administered two times for hypercalcaemia without effect. Once muscle biopsy results confirmed microsporidiosis, antifungal treatment with albendazole 400 mg medication taken by mouth two times per day was commenced. Worsening fevers, rigours, myalgia, headaches and vomiting ensued for 5 days with new diarrhoea and anaemia requiring red blood cell transfusion. While the headaches were severe and potentially exacerbated by albendazole, it was continued as was the optimal antifungal agent. The keratitis was debrided and topical ofloxacin and celluvisc applied with a plan for fumagillin if infection reoccured. Immunosuppression was reduced with prednisolone weaned to 7.5 mg daily, mycophenolate 540 mg two times per day and a reduced tacrolimus level target of five to six.\n\n【52】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【53】Clinical improvement was seen after 7 days with defervescence, reduced subcutaneous oedema, myalgia and headaches. CK and calcium normalised and the patient was discharged home.\n\n【54】Significant nausea and diarrhoea prompted an endoscopy 4 weeks later; results were unremarkable and albendazole was continued with a planned duration of 6–12 months. Unless a microsporidial source can be identified and eradicated, ongoing exposure to microsporidium is likely and long-term secondary prophylaxis will be required. A repeat PET/CT scan performed 3 months into treatment showed a near complete metabolic response ( figure 6 ). Multispecialty outpatient follow-up is arranged and planning for intermittent haemodialysis is underway given the Stage 5 CKD.\n\n【55】<img/>\n\n【56】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【57】Figure 6\n\n【58】Repeat fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT to assess treatment response following 90 days of albendazole therapy demonstrates a near complete metabolic response.

(B) Comparing post (left) and pre (right) treatment axial fused FDG PET/CT images, only several sparse foci of minimal FDG uptake remain. The most prominent residual lesions; right tibialis anterior (arrow 1) and medial gastrocnemius (arrow 2), are both less avid than mediastinal blood pool.\n\n【59】Discussion\n----------\n\n【60】While there are no published guidelines for the treatment of microsporidosis, albendazole is effective against most species except _Enterocytozoon bieneusi,_ for which fumagillin is an alternative. Treatment duration is not defined; however, in this case duration will be guided by clinical response, for example, resolving myalgia and keratitis, inflammatory markers and repeat PET imaging. Given severe infection generally occurs in patients infected with HIV with a CD4<100 cells/µL, the disseminated nature of infection reflects profound immunosuppression. In HIV with commencement of antiretroviral therapy, albendazole is recommended for a minimum of 6 months after a CD4>200 cells/µL is achieved.\n\n【61】Reduction in immune suppression is an important factor in the successful treatment of microsporidiosis _._ 8 9 This requires a careful assessment of the risk–benefit balance in patients who require ongoing immunosuppression, such as in transplant recipients _._ When immune reconstitution cannot be achieved, prolonged treatment for months with a consideration for secondary prophylaxis given the risk of a chronic carrier state or reinfection is prudent.\n\n【62】In cases of treatment failure or relapse despite albendazole therapy, fumagillin has been added to the regimen with clinical success. 9 Minimising soil exposure, eradicating mosquito breeding grounds and preventing house water contamination with mosquito larvae to avoid reinfection is advised; acknowledging the exact mechanism of acquisition is still uncertain. 10\n\n【63】To our knowledge, there are no documented case reports of hypercalcaemia associated with microsporidiosis. Granulomatous disorders associated with fungal infection can cause hypercalcaemia through excessive 1–25-hydroxyvitamin D production, which is the proposed mechanism in this case.\n\n【64】Given the disseminated nature of infection a multimodal approach with input from nephrology, endocrinology, lung transplant, rheumatology, infectious diseases, neurology, ear, nose and throat and ophthalmology was required. Various species of microsporidium have a predilection for particular infective phenotypes and _A. algerae_ is known to cause keratitis and myositis. 11 In this case, there was possible central nervous system, vocal cord, parapharyngeal and renal involvement despite the inability to identify the organism in these tissues. The pronounced systemic response with myalgia, headaches and fevers after commencement of albendazole was likely due to widespread microorganism death and lysis of infected myositis.\n\n【65】There are several case reports of fatal microsporidial myositis in immunocompromised hosts over the past two decades and rates are likely higher given the elusive diagnosis. Further research is required to clarify acquisition, identify high-risk patients, outline preventative measures and to raise awareness given the high mortality rates in the expanding immunocompromised population.\n\n【66】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【67】I was frustrated after 3 months of worsening muscle fatigue, pain and myalgia and several different arthritis blood tests and general practitioner visits. One of my regular transplant blood tests revealed I had an acute kidney injury and dangerously high calcium levels. I was off to hospital to further investigate the problems under the renal doctors. I was most concerned about my kidneys and calcium levels at that stage and so were the doctors. We ran through all the same blood tests for arthritis and autoimmune diseases with negative results, something was wrong, and the Doctors and I knew there was a problem but what? So, the barrage of tests began, to the credit of all those involved. My kidneys and calcium levels were stubborn and did not change for 3 weeks, which was making the diagnosis difficult. Then finally, the muscle biopsy returned the answer of microsporidium infection.\n\n【68】By this stage, I was very sick. I was sleeping, fatigued, nauseous and in constant muscle pain. At this stage, even holding a drink was a challenge, not much fun to be around. The debridement of my left eyeball was the last straw as the fungus had infiltrated my cornea, but we had an answer, and this was a positive in myself and my wife’s eyes. We made plans to get home after 1 month in hospital. Then my next challenge.\n\n【69】After being bedridden for a month with a parasitic whole body muscle infection, I had lost 10 kg and a lot of my strength and muscle. I was constantly nauseous and suffering continual bouts of diarrhoea. Just being able to eat has been a challenge but and I am getting better and progressing every day.\n\n【70】I have to thank the persistence and collaborative efforts of the mutidisciplinary team whom diagnosed my problem. This could have definitely been a different story if my symptoms were left unchecked or to a left lesser experienced health system.\n\n【71】### Learning points\n\n【72】*   Microsporidiosis is an emerging infectious disease in the malignancy, autoimmune and transplant population.\n    \n*   Infection can be fatal without prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n    \n*   Disseminated infection can present with a broad range of manifestations.\n    \n*   Hypercalcaemia can be a due to disseminated fungal infection.\n    \n*   Tissue samples can provide highly beneficial and unexpected results.\n    \n\n【73】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【74】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【75】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【76】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【77】The authors would like to acknowledge the following for their contribution to patient care: The Royal Brisbane & Women’s Hospital Nephrology, Rheumatology, Endocrinology, Infectious Diseases, Neurology, Ear, Nose and Throat and Ophthalmology Units, The Prince Charles Hospital Lung Transplant Unit and Dr Matthew R.

It is the most common prion disease and accounts for approximately 90% of all prion disease cases. 1 It mostly presents with rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia and myoclonus. The clinical course differs according to subtype of CJD, that is, sporadic, iatrogenic, familial and variant. 2 3 The sporadic form of CJD (sCJD) is the most common form of CJD and in most cases patients die within months. 4 Currently, routine diagnostic investigations include brain MRI, electroencephalography (EEG) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses. 5 6 Typical brain MRI findings for sCJD are high signal in specific regions: putamen or caudate, or high signal in at least two cortical regions (temporal, parietal, occipital). Characteristic EEG findings for sCJD are periodic biphasic and triphasic sharp wave complexes. In CSF analyses, typical abnormalities include positive 14-3-3 protein, high total tau protein (t-tau), high ratio between phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and t-tau, high S100 protein and high neuron-specific enolase (NSE). The real-time quaking-induced conversion test in CSF is a relatively new diagnostic test which is highly sensitive and specific for sCJD. 7 Yet, postmortem brain autopsy remains the standard for definite confirmation of CJD. Postmortem brain autopsy can provide further classification of the molecular subtype of sCJD. 8 9 sCJD can have an asymptomatic incubation period lasting for decades, 3 but little is known about this long disease-free period before symptom onset.\n\n【10】Here, we describe a participant from the population-based Rotterdam Study who developed sCJD. The study has a longitudinal design including multiple visits at the research centre with extensive investigations, which provides us a unique opportunity to detail the preclinical phase of sCJD. In this article, we describe the clinical history of this patient, retrieved from both the Rotterdam Study and the National Prion Disease Registry.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】Our case was a 76-year-old woman with a medical history of hyperthyroidism, varices, recurrent urinary tract infections, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, cholecystectomy and uterus extirpation. She was married and had worked as nurse. With regard to the patient’s participation in the population-based follow-up study, the Rotterdam Study, our case entered this study in 1991, and participated up to the fifth examination in November 2010.\n\n【13】From May 2010, she started to develop symptoms of forgetfulness, dizziness, steerlessness in the right leg, and a heavy feeling in the head and eyes. Over a period of a few months, there was fast progression and she had difficulties with her balance and walked unstable. She also had an increased fall tendency. Besides, she had a feeling of pressure in the left ear, visual problems and sometimes diplopia. The patient was seen by an ophthalmologist and an otorhinolaryngologist, both specialists found no abnormalities. Regarding the typical symptoms for sCJD, over a period of months, she had progressive cognitive decline, cerebellar signs, pyramidal signs and extrapyramidal signs. The patient was registered at the Dutch National Prion Disease Registry in March 2011, where according to protocol an in-depth study was conducted on the medical history. There was no iatrogenic history explaining the CJD. During the extensive interview of the family, no evidence for a positive family history emerged.\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】### Research visit examinations\n\n【16】During the fourth examination of Rotterdam Study in May 2004, at age 70 years, cognitive tests were performed and showed no abnormalities, with scores for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 30 out of 30 and good scores for the other cognitive tests, as described in table 1 . Furthermore, routine locomotor symptom screening showed no abnormalities. During the fifth examination round in November 2010, at age 77 years, the participant reported that she suffered from cognitive complaints and cognitive testing showed abnormalities. The MMSE score was 22 out of 30 and compared with the previous examinations she had lower scores on the Word fluency task, Purdue Pegboard Test, words learning test and Stroop test. Detailed information on the results of the cognitive tests is described in table 1 . Based on the presence of subjective cognitive complaints, the presence of objective cognitive impairment, and the absence of dementia, she was classified in the Rotterdam Study as having mild cognitive impairment. 10 During locomotor symptom screening we found no dysarthria, no tremor, no abnormalities during finger tapping, normotonic arms and legs, and no dysmetria. At the standing and gait examinations, she was able to stand stable on two legs, but not in tandem position. She was able to walk independently, though with a slight unstable gait pattern. A non-contrast brain MRI was performed (in November 2010) as part of the research protocol and was compared with the brain MRI from other Rotterdam Study participants aged 70–96 years (median age of 77 years). This revealed that she had a smaller volume of the right and left hippocampus, right thalamus, left amygdala and brainstem. She had a larger volume of CSF, right and left nucleus accumbens, and right putamen than expected for her age. There were no changes on the brain MRI at the basal ganglia, as verified a posteriori by the CJD expert centre at the University of Edinburgh.\n\n【17】View this table:\n\n【18】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【19】Table 1\n\n【20】Results of the cognitive tests before and at diagnosis of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease case\n\n【21】### Clinical investigations\n\n【22】Brain MRI which was performed in October 2010—around 4 weeks before the brain MRI in the Rotterdam Study research centre—showed intracerebral multiple white matter hyperintensities, which were confluent periventricular. These white matter hyperintensities were most likely of vascular origin. Also, slightly wider peripheral and central CSF spaces were seen on brain MRI. The MRI did not show high signal in putamen or caudate. MRI images are shown in figure 1 . Furthermore, an EEG, which was performed in March 2011, showed sufficient fast activity and showed occipital rhythm and diffuse rhythm. Diffuse slow activity was frequently seen as well. The EEG did not show sharp wave complexes. Analysis of the CSF, performed in March 2011, showed a weakly positive 14-3-3 protein, elevated t-tau (4800 ng/L, normal <350), with normal p-tau (72 ng/L, normal <85), elevated S100 protein (8.2 µg/L, normal <3.9) and elevated NSE (20.8 µg/L, normal <17.5). The MMSE score at that time was still 25 out of 30. The patient was heterozygous for codon 129 from the prion protein gene (PRNP; genotype MV) and for the apolipoprotein E gene (genotype epsilon 2/epsilon 3).\n\n【23】<img/>\n\n【24】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【25】Figure 1\n\n【26】Axial brain MRI images showing multiple white matter hyperintensities; left: fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain MRI sequence; right: diffusion-weighted imaging brain MRI sequence.\n\n【27】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【28】Several differential diagnoses were considered and evaluated. Table 2 gives an overview of the differential diagnoses and on how they were ruled out. Based on the diagnostic criteria for sCJD, 11 the patient was diagnosed with probable sCJD. The criteria which were met were the presence of progressive cognitive impairment, visual problems, cerebellar problems, pyramidal signs and extrapyramidal signs and positive 14-3-3 protein in CSF.\n\n【29】View this table:\n\n【30】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【31】Table 2\n\n【32】Overview of the differential diagnoses and performed investigations to rule them out\n\n【33】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【34】Our case was diagnosed as a probable sCJD case at the age of 77 years. The patient died in June 2011, 3 months after the diagnosis sCJD was clinically suspected. Postmortem brain autopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Pathological investigation showed widespread spongiosis and gliosis. Prion protein immunohistochemistry showed synaptic staining, mainly in the deeper layers with most spongiosis, plaque-like deposits and compact deposits. In the cerebellar cortex spongiosis and frequent periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive plaques (kuru-type plaques) and deposits were seen, as shown in figure 2 . The cerebellar grey matter also showed some PAS-positive plaques. Other parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, basal nuclei, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and brain stem, showed spongiosis and some PAS-positivity. PRNP gene analysis revealed no mutations. Based on the pathological alterations, the final histopathological diagnosis was sCJD type MV2K. 8 9 12\n\n【35】<img/>\n\n【36】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【37】Figure 2\n\n【38】Microscopic pathology demonstrating kuru-type plaques in the cerebellum.\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】sCJD is the most common form of CJD. 4 We report the first case diagnosed with sCJD who was enrolled in a population-based cohort study and was classified as having mild cognitive impairment during the diagnostic workup for sCJD.\n\n【41】sCJD is a fatal neurological disease with a large variety in symptom onset and progression. Rapid progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia is often the first clinical manifestation of sCJD. We describe the first case diagnosed with sCJD in the population-based Rotterdam Study and for whom prospective epidemiological data is available. During the patient’s last visit at our research centre, she had subjective cognitive complaints and, based on cognitive examinations, she also had objective cognitive impairment. Therefore, she was classified within the study as having mild cognitive impairment. At the same time, the patient was suffering from several other neurological symptoms and was referred to the neurology clinic for diagnostic workup. Given that sCJD is a progressive disease in which symptoms are known to progress rapidly, the cognitive decline observed during her final visit to our research centre was not unexpected. However, since she did not yet fulfil the criteria for dementia, she was classified as having mild cognitive impairment. This was beyond our expectations, as the visit at our research centre was during the early clinical stage of sCJD, that is, 4 months before diagnosis of sCJD. This shows that the symptom onset of cognitive impairment in our sCJD case was subtle. 13 Moreover, the MMSE score a few months before death showed subtle cognitive impairment. The recognition of sCJD is often a diagnostic challenge.\n\n【42】sCJD cases with the molecular subtype MV2K have a long clinical course and usually present with early-onset ataxia. This was seen in our case as well, as dominant symptoms were the difficulties with balance and unstable walking. Further, in cases with this molecular subtype, sharp wave complexes on EEG are infrequently seen, as was the case in our patient. It is of interest that the patient had a late symptom onset. The age of onset of the cognitive problems in our case was 76 years, which is higher than the mean age of onset for sCJD. 9 14 The mean age of onset in the Netherlands is 66 years. 15 In sCJD cases with the molecular subtype MV2K, the median age of onset is known to be 65 years (range 36–83 years). 9 16 Our case can be considered as a relatively late-onset case of sCJD. A possible explanation for the late onset of mild cognitive impairment symptoms is that our case was high-functioning before symptom onset, which could have provided cognitive protection.\n\n【43】In conclusion, we describe the first case diagnosed with sCJD who during diagnostic workup for sCJD was classified as having mild cognitive impairment in a population-based cohort study.\n\n【44】### Learning points\n\n【45】*   The sporadic form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is the most common prion disease, which is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease caused by accumulation of abnormally folded prion protein.\n    \n*   As the symptom onset of sCJD can be subtle, the diagnosis of sCJD can be a diagnostic challenge, especially in the early clinical stage of the disease.\n    \n*   In sCJD cases with the molecular subtype MV2K, the median age of onset is 65 years with a large range of age of onset.

Clinic-based nasendoscopy indicated a likely diagnosis of Reinkes oedema 1 but could not exclude carcinoma.\n\n【5】Pre-operative anaesthetic assessment noted the patient’s history of progressive shortness of breath on exertion; however, she was not short of breath at rest. There was marked dysphonia, but no stridor. The patient was edentulous, Mallampati: IV, incisor-incisor distance: >3 cm and thyromental distance >6 cm. The patient was notably tender on palpation of the neck but had normal neck movement. The patient’s medical history was also significant for T1DM, obesity (body mass index >40 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), and anxiety. Glycaemic control was poor with HbA1c: 68 mmol/mol and point of care capillary blood glucose on the morning of surgery: 16.9 mM.\n\n【6】Given the patient’s relatively mild symptoms, likely benign pathology, and poorly controlled diabetes, the anaesthetic and surgical teams discussed the possibility of postponing the operation for 6–8 weeks to allow optimisation of glycaemic control. On balance, however, it was decided to proceed with the operation as planned as the patient had airway pathology, was under regular follow-up with the endocrinology team without improvement in glycaemic control, and she was particularly anxious about surgery and was likely to be extremely distressed by postponement.\n\n【7】A difficult airway was anticipated, and the difficult airway trolley and C-MAC video laryngoscope were available in the anaesthetic room. After preoxygenation and induction of anaesthesia, the ability to mask ventilate was confirmed before administering suxamethonium as a short-acting muscle relaxant. The first attempt at intubation was with direct laryngoscopy and revealed a Cormack Lehane Grade I view with severely oedematous vocal cords. There was a minimal opening between the posterior portions of the cords. A size five micro-laryngoscopy tube was passed with resistance.\n\n【8】Microlaryngoscopy highlighted the degree of stenosis due to polypoid oedema ( figure 1A ). The surgery was undertaken via suspension microlaryngoscopy with standard cold steel instruments including forceps, suction and scissors. The size of the tumour mandated a piecemeal/stepwise excision. Removal of the oedematous tissue from the right vocal cord revealed further, previously hidden, polypoid oedema on the left vocal cord ( figure 1B ). After completion of removal of oedematous tissue, the opening between the vocal cords was markedly improved ( figure 1C ). Careful assessment was undertaken at the end to ensure no residual tissue at the lateral and inferior aspects of the lesion but with maximal preservation of the true vocal cord.\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】Figure 1\n\n【12】(A) Oedematous vocal cords after intubation.

(C) Vocal cords and microlaryngoscopy tube after completion of removal of oedematous tissue.\n\n【13】The patient had some laryngospasm after extubation, which was treated with positive end expiratory pressure. She was comfortable in recovery and reported immediate improvement in her breathing.\n\n【14】The Fourth National Audit Project of the Royal College of Anaesthetists and the Difficult Airway Society 2 investigated the incidence of major complications of airway management during anaesthesia in the UK. Over 25% of the cases identified were associated with an obstructive lesion in the airway. Careful consideration of the strategy for airway management is required for any laryngotracheal surgery. 3\n\n【15】In this case, a difficult airway was anticipated; however, the degree of stenosis encountered was still unexpected due to the absence of dyspnoea and stridor. The patient’s mild presenting symptoms were falsely reassuring. This case highlights the degree of narrowing of the airway that can be tolerated by patients with minimal distress, particularly with slowly evolving pathology, and the need for caution and careful preparation when approaching any airway pathology.\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】*   Significant airway obstruction can be relatively asymptomatic, caution is required when approaching any airway pathology.\n    \n*   Communication between members of the team is key.

In Japan, the number of super-old patients—age >90 years—with hip fractures has increased drastically over time. Available strategies for anaesthetic management for hip fracture surgery include general anaesthesia, neuraxial anaesthesia and peripheral nerve block. However, general and neuraxial anaesthesia are often avoided for various reasons, particularly in elderly patients. In recent years, peripheral nerve block has proven effective in various surgical procedures.

NA includes spinal anaesthesia (SA) and epidural anaesthesia. GA and NA are often avoided in the elderly population for various reasons. Herein, we report successful anaesthetic management using femoral nerve block (FNB) and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block (LFCNB) under dexmedetomidine (DEX) sedation for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a femoral neck fracture in a 97-year-old patient. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s family for the publication of this report.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 97-year-old woman (body mass index (BMI), 14.8 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ; weight, 31.6 kg (measured later); height, 146 cm) visited a local hospital with the chief complaint of right hip pain with an unknown history of present illness. After detailed physical and radiographic examinations, she was diagnosed with Garden type Ⅱ of an intracapsular fracture of the right femoral neck ( figure 1 ). She was referred to our hospital for further surgical treatment. She had a history of severe mitral regurgitation, mild dementia and chronic constipation. Her current pharmacotherapy includes three constipation medications and verapamil. Unfortunately, further internal medicine information was unavailable. ECG, performed at our emergency department, showed sinus rhythm.\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】Figure 1\n\n【15】Initial plain radiograph of fracture; Garden type Ⅱ of intracapsular fracture of the right femoral neck.\n\n【16】The orthopaedic surgeons decided on a less invasive ORIF using cannulated cancellous screws (CCS) because of the minimal displacement of the fracture and advanced age of the patient.\n\n【17】We selected FNB and LFCNB under DEX sedation as the anaesthesia method because the planned ORIF required only a small incision. Additionally, to prevent intraoperative or postoperative complications, including hypotension, postoperative delirium (PD) and respiratory failure, and due to suspicion of fused vertebrae for vertebral fracture, GA and NA were avoided.\n\n【18】During the operation, the patient’s blood pressure was monitored non-invasively, along with electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and continual skin temperature monitoring. To assess respiratory depression associated with sedation, nasal capnography—handmade with a suction catheter—was used to monitor end-tidal carbon dioxide and respiratory rate. Sedation level was assessed using the Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale. Her weight, which was not known, was estimated to be 40 kg based on her small frame, and we administered anaesthesia accordingly.\n\n【19】First, we performed a continuous infusion of DEX intravenously, at a high rate of 80 µg/h for 5 min, for sedation and administered 50 µg fentanyl to induce analgesia simultaneously. Thereafter, the DEX dosage was decreased to 28 µg/h at a lower rate. Because SpO <sub>2 </sub> was decreased to 90% for sedation, we initiated oxygen administration via a face mask at 3 L/min; however, the sedation level was maintained at 3. PNB was performed using a linear ultrasound probe (HFL50, SonoSite, Bothell, Washington, USA) and a 5-cm, 22-gauge needle (Stimuplex Ultra.360, B-Braun, Tochigi, Japan). The femoral nerve was located using a peripheral nerve stimulator plus an ultrasonic echo device. A 16-mL dose of ropivacaine (0.375%) was injected around the femoral nerve, and LFCNB was achieved with a 4-mL dose of ropivacaine (0.375%). After including adequate local anaesthesia, surgery was initiated. At the beginning of the surgery, the surgeons infiltrated 10 mL of 0.5% xylocaine with epinephrine into the skin incision for haemostasis. The patient showed signs of distress during the insertion of CCS into the femoral head ( figure 2 ), following which an additional 50 µg fentanyl was administered. For postoperative analgesia, we administered 600 mg acetaminophen at the end of the surgery. The duration of the surgery was 9 min and that of anaesthesia was 42 min. No vasopressor was required as our patient’s intraoperative haemodynamic state remained stable ( figure 3 ). No manual ventilatory assistance was required either because our patient’s sedation level was 3–4 at mild-to-moderate levels, and her respiratory condition remained stable during surgery.\n\n【20】<img/>\n\n【21】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【22】Figure 2\n\n【23】Plain radiograph after surgery showing internal fixation with three cannulated cancellous screws.\n\n【24】<img/>\n\n【25】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【26】Figure 3\n\n【27】Perioperative time course.

The next day, rehabilitation was initiated and training for standing was possible. Eventually, she was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital on postoperative day 15.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】Hip fracture incidence rates increase exponentially with age. In Japan, from 2009 to 2014, this trend was prominently seen in the 90–94 year age group in women and the 85–89 year age group in men. 3 Therefore, hip fractures in super-old patients are expected to increase in the future. However, whether anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in the elderly is best performed under GA or RA, including PNB or NA, remains debatable. The case of a 72-year-old patient who underwent ORIF with PNB has been reported 4 ; however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report of anaesthetic management in a 97-year-old patient. In this case, PNB under DEX sedation for ORIF was selected in a super-old patient.\n\n【32】The first reason to avoid GA and NA is hypotension. Intraoperative hypotension occurs commonly during hip fracture surgery, especially in elderly patients with a higher number of comorbidities. 5 Internationally, the 30-day mortality rate after hip fracture surgery is 6%–8%; intraoperative hypotension is associated with increased 30-day mortality. 1 Although GA or SA is usually selected for hip fracture ORIF, the incidence of intraoperative absolute hypotension (lowest systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) is high in both GA and SA (49.2% and 28.2%, respectively). 5 In recent years, PNB has proven to be effective in various orthopaedic procedures. Intraoperative blood pressure is higher during PNB than that during GA 6 or SA, 7 8 and PNB provides a more stable haemodynamic state. Owing to a history of severe mitral regurgitation and the potential for hypovolaemia, our patient’s intraoperative haemodynamics were closely monitored. In fact, we believe that the patient’s haemodynamics remained stable during the surgery because we selected PNB for anaesthetic management.\n\n【33】Additionally, intraoperative hypotension is associated with PD. 9 PD occurs in 12%–51% of elderly patients following orthopaedic surgical treatment. 10 PD is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, such as high mortality rates, extended hospitalisation or further cognitive decline. 9 10 Risk factors for PD include those that are patient-related and those that are adjusted in-hospital; thus, they are potentially prevented. 9 Examples of the former include advanced age, low BMI, preoperative cognitive decline, polypharmacy (over three medications) and a high American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score. In contrast, the risk factors for the latter include intraoperative blood pressure (mean arterial pressure) control, blood transfusion and postoperative pain management. Our patient had a BMI of 14.8 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> and an ASA score of 3. In short, avoiding intraoperative hypotension was important to ensure a good prognosis because our patient had an advanced age, low BMI, preoperative cognitive decline, polypharmacy and a high ASA score. Fortunately, our patient was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital without any problems.\n\n【34】We avoided GA and NA for several other reasons. We aimed to prevent the risk of postoperative respiratory failure, which occurs more significantly in the setting of GA. 11 As the patient was 97 years old, poor outcomes were likely in case of respiratory failure after surgery. Moreover, as compared with SA, patients who underwent hip fracture surgery with GA have a higher risk of 30-day complications, such as the need for blood transfusion and risk of deep vein thrombosis. 12 In contrast, we also wanted to avoid NA as it can be difficult to achieve because of the bent or fused spine of an elderly patient. Postoperatively, our patient was found to have a history of compression fracture of the third lumbar vertebra. Furthermore, as our patient had a history of mild dementia and experienced severe pain on movement, we judged that it would have been difficult for her to maintain the lateral position during NA. Lastly, had our elderly patient been on antithrombotic drugs for any indication, NA may also have been contraindicated. 13\n\n【35】Intraoperative sedation is an important component of RA techniques and surgical procedures. We selected DEX as a supplement of the PNB and surgery because DEX is a selective α2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a large number of advantages, including fast-onset sedation with minimal respiratory depression, mild analgesic properties and the ability to improve postoperative recognition. 14 In our patient, we assessed the level of sedation using the OAA/S score, a subjective assessment carried out intermittently depending on the patient’s response to either verbal or physical stimuli. 15 We believe that the combination of fentanyl bolus was a contributing factor for the decrease in oxygen saturation after the initiation of DEX. Since then, the patient had mild-to-moderate sedation levels and did not require manual ventilatory assistance. Despite the combination of PNB and a continuous infusion of DEX, the patient showed signs of distress while inserting CCS into the femoral head. This could be because the short time between the PNB and the initiation of surgery may have resulted in inadequate analgesia to the femoral head. However, PNB is considered to have been effective, as the patient did not require any analgesics for at least 12 hours after surgery. Moreover, DEX exhibits neuroprotective effects and decreases the incidence of PD, 16 leading to shorter hospital stays. 17 18 Furthermore, in elderly patients, intraoperative DEX use can remarkably improve the first night sleep quality after surgery, resulting in PD prevention. 19 DEX has been used safely not only in our patient but also in another super-old patient. 20 Briefly, DEX can be a useful anaesthetic adjuvant for a wide range of clinical applications due to its safety and effectiveness.\n\n【36】In summary, we achieved successful anaesthetic management with PNB and DEX in a 97-year-old patient for femoral neck fracture fixation. Because the incidence of hip fractures is expected to increase in the future, we believe that PNB is an effective method to anaesthetise super-old patients instead of GA or NA. Additionally, DEX has many advantages, including good sedation, analgesia and neuroprotective effects with minimal respiratory depression. In this case, our results suggest that anaesthesia using PNB under DEX sedation can contribute to the safety and effectiveness of hip fracture surgery in super-old patients.\n\n【37】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【38】This was by far the best possible result to finish the surgery avoiding general anaesthesia and neuraxial anaesthesia. Thank you very much.\n\n【39】### Learning points\n\n【40】*   Hip fracture is a common injury and a growing healthcare challenge in an ageing society.\n    \n*   Available methods for anaesthetic management for hip fracture surgery include general anaesthesia, neuraxial anaesthesia and peripheral nerve block.\n    \n*   Peripheral nerve block appears to be an effective method to anesthetise super-old patients and may be used to replace general and neuraxial anaesthesia.\n    \n*   As seen in our case, anaesthetic management using peripheral nerve block with dexmedetomidine sedation could contribute to the safety of hip fracture surgery in super-old patients.\n    \n\n【41】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【42】The authors would like to thank Dr Jun Nakanishi (Department of Orthopedics, Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital) for useful discussions.

The patient has no medical or surgical history, is a non-smoker, drinks a glass of wine weekly and does not take any regular medication. Initially, the hand became swollen and turned blue for a couple of days followed by intermittent cold sensation and tingling of the hands with the skin turning white during the following weeks. There was no loss of strength and the patient had no history of Raynaud disease. He had minor complaints of lower back pain, without morning stiffness and nocturn pain. On clinical examination the left hand was paler and colder than the right and he had decreased capillary refill in the fingers with absent arterial pulsation. Laboratory examinations did not reveal any suspicious findings. Family history was negative for rheumatic disease. Ultrasound examination showed an occlusion of the left radial and ulnar artery and subsequent MRI confirmed a thrombosed aneurysm of the distal ulnar artery ( figure 1A–D ). Conventional angiography showed a segmental occlusion in the distal part of the radial ( figure 2A ) and ulnar artery ( figure 2B ) with extensive secondary collateral formation to the superficial and deep palmar arch. A diagnosis of a combined thenar and hypothenar hammer syndrome was made and initial treatment with vasodilating drugs relieved the symptoms with ganglion stellatum blockage or bypass surgery as options if symptoms recur. Follow-up showed sustained symptom relief with vasodilation treatment.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Fat-suppressed T2-weighted images in the axial (A), sagittal (B) and coronal plane (C).

Several clinical tests such as the Doppler-Allen test and duplex sonography provide clues for diagnosis but the golden standard is digital subtraction angiography. Angiographic findings include an irregular vascular lumen, intra-arterial filling defects, segmental occlusions and distal embolisations, as well as pseudoaneurysms and collateral formation. The morphological detection of vascular lesions through imaging is essential since the thenar and hypothenar hammer syndrome can be associated with critical limb ischaemia, which may require bypass surgery.\n\n【14】### Learning points\n\n【15】*   Hypothenar and thenar hammer syndrome occurs following acute or chronic trauma to the upper extremities.\n    \n*   The morphological detection of vascular lesions through imaging is essential since the thenar and hypothenar hammer syndrome can be associated with critical limb ischaemia.\n    \n*   Angiographic findings include an irregular vascular lumen, intra-arterial filling defects, segmental occlusions and distal embolisations, as well as pseudoaneurysms and collateral formation.\n    \n\n【16】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【17】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【18】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The classic finding is retinal whitening or opacification that clinically resolves within 4– 7 days. 1 Disruption of the photoreceptor outer segments is the primary underlying pathology with sparing of the blood vessels. 2 When the macula is involved, it is known as Berlin’s oedema, with a ‘pseudo cherry red spot’. 3 Though a majority of patients recover in 1–4 weeks with no permanent deficits, those with severe commotio may have residual retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) changes, RPE atrophy or hyperpigmentation. 4 5 A healthy man around 40 years of age presented to us after sustaining an injury to the left eye with a tennis ball. Anterior segment showed diffuse conjunctival congestion, iris sphincter tears and open angles on gonioscopy. The visual acuity and intraocular pressure were normal. Fundus examination showed an interesting distribution of commotio retina in the mid-periphery concentric to the disc but sparing the posterior pole ( figure 1 ). The equatorial expansion after the severe blunt trauma with a uniformly shaped tennis ball could have resulted in this pattern. Commotio retinae usually presents with a localised or diffuse pattern and seen in the inferior and medial retinal periphery as these are the most vulnerable areas. The present case highlights an unusual pattern of commotion retinae concentric around the disc and should prompt a closer follow-up for other sequelae in view of the severity of the injury.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Fundus picture of the left eye showing concentric retinal whitening suggestive of commotio retinae.\n\n【9】### Learning points\n\n【10】*   Commotio retinae is a consequence of blunt ocular trauma and the presentation can indicate the severity of the impact.\n    \n*   While commotio retinae self resolves in a majority, a close follow-up is mandatory to monitor for other sequelae of trauma.\n    \n\n【11】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【12】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【13】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

On slit lamp examination, the anterior chamber was quiet ( figure 1A ) with total cupping in both eyes. The intraocular pressure (IOP) in L/E was 28 mm Hg and 26 mm Hg in the right eye (R/E), which were not controlled despite maximal medical treatment. Needling was performed in the L/E after the gonioscopy affirmed the patency of the ostium. This was done using a slit lamp and no antimetabolite was used. There was no intervention in R/E because there was no perception of light. After 2 weeks of needling, the patient’s IOP kept increasing, necessitating a repeat gonioscopy, which revealed vitreous in the ostium ( figure 1B ). 1 After pupillary dilation, zonular dialysis and a localised cataract were observed at the 11 o’clock position ( figure 1C ), confirming vitreous prolapse from the site of zonular dialysis and its eventual passage into the surgical iridectomy, thereby blocking the internal ostium. The vitreous behind the iris was captured using anterior segment optical coherence tomography in the L/E ( figure 1D ). 2 It was assumed that there was prior zonular dialysis with localised cataractous changes prior to the needling, which could have occurred during the initial surgery. During needling, however, the pressure difference between the anterior and posterior segment causes vitreous prolapse from the zonular dialysis area, eventually blocking the internal ostium. Intrableb scarring, fibrosis, encapsulation in the subconjunctival space, or blockage of the internal ostium with iris, are all common causes of postoperative trabeculectomy failure. 3 None of these events occurred in our case; rather, it was caused by a blockage of the internal ostium with vitreous. The source of this vitreous was a pre-existing zonular dialysis tract that prolapsed vitreous postneedling, blocking the internal ostium and resulting in high IOP. Bleb needling has been reported to be performed successfully up to 30 years after trabeculectomy. 4 A rare complication of bleb needling is vitreous prolapse through the iridectomy site. 5 The prolapsed vitreous may be the only cause of high IOP, resulting in trabeculectomy failure. To control the high IOP, an anterior vitrectomy was performed to remove the prolapsed vitreous strands from the ostium along with a nasal goniotomy. This resulted in a functional bleb with good IOP control.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】(A) Clinical photo of the anterior segment.

Previous studies have reported that metabolic disturbance such as hyperkalaemia, hypokalaemia and metabolic acidosis can uncover Brugada ECG patterns in patients with genetically confirmed BrS or with ventricular fibrillation. 4 5 Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (PHA1) with loss of function mutation in epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder leading to resistance to aldosterone and life-threatening salt-wasting and hyperkalaemia. 6 7 This case reports BrS uncovered by hyperkalaemia precipitated in a patient with pseudohypoaldosteronism.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A female in her 30s with a history of PHA1 (diagnosed in infancy, loss of function of ENaC), hypersensitivity pneumonitis and eczema presented with several days of nausea and vomiting. She had been regularly followed in the outpatient nephrology clinic and medical treatment of pseudohypoaldosteronism included sodium citrate-citric acid three times a day, which she was unable to take due to poor oral intake in the days leading up to admission. She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with mild sinus tachycardia. She had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result. Labs revealed severe hyperkalaemia with blood potassium level of 7.9 mmol/L and hyponatraemia with blood sodium of 121 mEq/L. She was given calcium gluconate, insulin, sodium zirconium, albuterol and intravenous fluids including sodium bicarbonate drip.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】12-lead ECG revealed pathognomonic features of type 1 Brugada pattern with >2 mm ‘coved type’ ST-segment elevations in the right precordial leads, which descended with upward convexity into inverted T waves ( figure 1A ). A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a structurally normal heart. Repeat ECG at 14 hours with a blood potassium level of 4.8 mmol/L and blood sodium level of 124 mEq/L revealed normalisation of ECG abnormalities ( figure 1B ).\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】Figure 1\n\n【17】(A) Initial 12-lead ECG on admission demonstrating type 1 Brugada pattern in leads V <sub>1 </sub> and V <sub>2 </sub> as demonstrated by the red arrows. (B) Repeat ECG following resolution of hyperkalaemia with disappearance of Brugada pattern.\n\n【18】Treatment\n---------\n\n【19】She did not develop any malignant ventricular arrythmias during hospitalisation. After resolution of her nausea and vomiting, she was discharged with sodium chloride 2 g three times a day, sodium citrate 45 mg three times a day and sodium zirconium 10 mg per day.\n\n【20】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【21】On further interviewing, she denied palpitations as well as a personal or family history of sudden cardiac arrest or unexpected death. She used cannabis socially but denied other recreational drugs. She described three episodes of possible syncope in her lifetime in her teens, mid-20s and 3 months prior to presentation in the setting of dehydration.\n\n【22】Given her syncope of unknown origin and resolution of ECG abnormalities with correction of electrolyte disturbance, the decision was made to proceed with the implantation of a cardiac loop recorder to further risk stratify the patient for need of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. Should ventricular arrhythmia with concerning features be detected on the loop recorder, ICD placement could be pursued to prevent the risk of SCD. She was also referred for BrS genetic testing. Prior to discharge, she was educated on prompt fever treatment, avoidance of drugs that may unmask Brugada and adherence to medical therapy for PHA1.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】PHA1 is a rare (type 1A—autosomal dominant, type 1B—autosomal recessive) disorder characterised by generalised resistance to the actions of aldosterone. It involves loss of function mutations of non-voltage gated ENaC in the late distal tubules, the connecting tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys. Other tissues, such as the colon and sweat glands, also express ENaC. It is clinically manifested in the newborn and leads to life-threatening salt-wasting and hyperkalaemia. Salt supplements of ≤45 g/day are required indefinitely, together with control of hyperkalaemia. Recurrent salt-wasting crises and severe hyperkalaemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. 6 7\n\n【25】BrS has an overall presence of 1:2000 and is most common in Asia followed by Europe and the USA. 1 The clinical manifestations of BrS are syncope and cardiac arrest or SCD from ventricular fibrillation. BrS is caused by a loss of function of the voltage-gated sodium channels found in the heart muscle. SCN5A was the first described mutation and results in alteration of the alpha-subunit of the Nav1.5 ion channel, however, a variety of potential pathogenic variants have been described. Although BrS and PHA are caused by mutations that encode sodium channels, a common genetic mutation linking the two has not been described. 8 9\n\n【26】Diagnostic recommendations for BrS have changed over the past three decades since its first description in 1992. The recently devised Shanghai scoring system recognises the limitation of induced (fever, drugs or electrolytes) type 1 ECG changes in isolation and uses additional information (such as clinical and family history and genetic results) to make a definitive diagnosis. 10\n\n【27】The association of metabolic disturbances in uncovering Brugada ECG change in patients at risk is well-reported. Precipitating factors can unmask BrS and should be avoided, including drugs such as psychotropic or anaesthetic agents, and fever. 11 In our patient, it is likely that untreated pseudohypoaldosteronism predisposed her to hyperkalaemia which contributed to type-1 BrS ECG pattern. Mechanistically, hyperkalaemia depolarises resting cardiac membrane potential which in turn leads to steady-state inactivation of sodium channels such that fewer sodium channels are available to be activated during the action potential upstroke. This will lead to an increase in voltage gradient between the epicardium and endocardium and dispersion of repolarisation within the right ventricular epicardium. ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads is proposed to be caused by this mechanism. 5 12 It is therefore important that hyperkalaemia is promptly treated in patients with BrS, as they are highly susceptible to the reduced cardiac excitability effects of hyperkalaemia that can lead to malignant arrythmias and cardiac arrest. 13 There are several case reports of BrS in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and thought to be secondary to fever induced by inflammatory response activation. 14 15 SARS-CoV-2 as an unmasking factor was not likely in this patient as she was afebrile throughout her stay without antipyretics, and case reports implicating SARS-CoV-2 and BrS consistently report fever as the unmasking event. 16 This case highlights the importance of recognising genetic disorders, like PHA, that predispose patients to electrolyte derangement and can unmask BrS.\n\n【28】### Learning points\n\n【29】*   Brugada syndrome (BrS) can be uncovered by hyperkalaemia.\n    \n*   Given its potential for lethal arrythmias, early detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment of BrS are critical.\n    \n*   This case highlights the importance of understanding how genetic disorders, like pseudohypoaldosteronism, precipitating hyperkalaemia can unmask BrS and potentially alter the risk for malignant arrythmias.\n    \n\n【30】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【31】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【32】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

It is a dysplastic lung tissue with a separate systemic blood supply and without a bronchial tree connection. The emergence of a superimposed infection can lead to its diagnosis, such as _Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Nocardia asteroids and Aspergillus sp_ . pneumonia. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) superimposed disease is exceedingly rare. We report a case of a man in his third decade without known medical disorders presenting with a persistent cough. After an extensive microbiological workup, an MAC infection was diagnosed. An elevated carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) was also noted. He was treated with antimycobacterial therapy and lobectomy resulting in clinical improvement and CA19-9 normalisation. This case illustrates the value of comprehensive microbiological investigations in patients with chronic respiratory symptoms and imaging findings that are not typical of bacterial pneumonia. Clinical studies remain needed to investigate the utility of CA 19-9 in a scoring system to guide MAC therapy.\n\n【2】*   Infections\n*   Pneumonia (infectious disease)\n*   TB and other respiratory infections\n*   Pneumonia (respiratory medicine)\n*   Congenital disorders\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

It is a dysplastic, non-functional lung tissue with a separate systemic blood supply. It may share pleura with the normal parenchyma or have its discrete pleural lining, classified into intralobar and extralobar, respectively. 1 The incidence is estimated to be between 0.15% and 1.8% in newborns. 2 PS can remain quiescent without a diagnosis, discovered on incidental imaging or complicated by a superimposed infection. The latter is often observed in cases of intralobar PS presenting in the third decade of life. 2 We present a case of intralobar PS complicated by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A man in his third decade of life without known medical illnesses developed a cough 3 weeks before his initial presentation. The cough was associated with right lower chest pain. There was no haemoptysis, fever, chills, weight loss or loss of appetite. He has no history of tobacco or alcohol consumption. He is incarcerated and has not travelled in the past 4 years. There was no family history of immunodeficiency in first-degree relatives. Clinical examination revealed an afebrile young man with right-sided rhonchi.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】Laboratory investigations revealed no leucocytosis, anaemia or thrombocytopaenia. D-dimer was elevated (516 ng/mL). No abnormalities in electrolyte levels or impaired kidney or liver function. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 resulted as negative. A chest radiograph showed a right lower lobe radiopacity ( figure 1 ). He was prescribed azithromycin and levofloxacin courses for the concern of community-acquired pneumonia. Although empiric bacterial pneumonia treatment improved the cough for the following 5 months, he relapsed and presented again for medical attention. Sputum analysis did not show micro-organisms on the gram-stain or Gomori methenamine silver stain but identified acid-fast positive bacilli. Empiric _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (MTB) treatment was started, but the regimen was stopped as MTB had not been identified. Further imaging with CT chest ( figure 2A ) showed right-sided mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, large and irregular consolidation in the right lower lobe with multiple cystic spaces and localised bronchiectasis. Nodules in the right lower and middle lobes were also noted. Notably, the CA 19-9 was elevated at 68 U/mL. The abdominal CT did not show any hepatobiliary or pancreatic masses.\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】Figure 1\n\n【17】An anteroposterior (AP) chest radiograph showing radiopacity in the right lower chest zone.\n\n【18】<img/>\n\n【19】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【20】Figure 2\n\n【21】(A) A CT chest showed consolidation in the right lower lobe (black arrowhead) with multiple cystic spaces and associated localised bronchiectasis.

Blue arrows indicate a systemic artery arising from the proximal abdominal aorta, passing through the diaphragm into the region of the right lower lobe. (C) Three-dimensional rendering shows a branch of the abdominal aorta (white arrowhead) ascending towards the pulmonary sequestration (white arrow) to provide blood supply.\n\n【22】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【23】Initially, during the patient’s first medical visit, the patient’s symptoms and signs suggested a community-acquired pneumonia which improved with antibiotics but then relapsed. The discovery of acid-fast positive bacilli in the sputum analysis led to an initial presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, this was subsequently ruled out, leaving the aetiology of the nodules and lymphadenopathy unclear. The elevated CA 19-9 level initially raised concerns about pancreatic or biliary tract cancer, but subsequent abdominal CT scans did not reveal any abnormalities. The nodules on chest imaging were concerning for rheumatological diseases, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, a subsequent negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and lack of other systemic features made GPA less likely. Similarly, negative rheumatoid factor, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies antibodies made RA less likely. Lung malignancy was also a consideration given the nodules and infiltrates on chest imaging. However, the patient’s young age, lack of smoking history or weight loss made this differential less likely.\n\n【24】After 3 weeks of incubation of the respiratory sample, microbiological investigations identified MAC growth in the sputum sample, which was confirmed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampling. This led to a diagnosis of MAC pulmonary disease, which was supported by the patient’s clinical history and imaging findings. The preliminary report of the CT chest only identified the bronchiectasis, cysts and nodules. However, 3 weeks later, radiology provided an official report. They noted a large artery, originating from the proximal abdominal aorta, supplying the large cystic consolidation in the right lower lobe ( figure 2B,C ). This confirmed the radiological diagnosis of PS, further complicated by an MAC infection. This was also corroborated by thoracic surgery review of the imaging.\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】Empiric treatment against non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) with azithromycin, ethambutol and rifabutin was started and maintained after MAC growth was redemonstrated on BAL sampling. He was referred for surgical resection of the right lower lobe.\n\n【27】A successful open right lower lobectomy was performed. Macroscopic examination revealed a 22.0×15.3×5.5 cm lobectomy specimen. There were copious amounts of mucus and dilated airways. The pathologist noted that the parenchyma had multinodular, diffuse consolidations. The pleura was tan-purple, edematous, with diffuse adhesions and focal areas of tan-white discolouration. Histopathological examination ( figure 3 ) revealed extensive confluent extra-airway noncaseating granulomata with chronic inflammation, numerous giant cells and crystalline inclusions. No organisms were identified on acid-fast or fungal stains of the specimen. After 3 weeks, an intraoperative lavage culture from the right lower lobe further grew MAC. The patient was discharged on the same MAC antimycobacterial regimen.\n\n【28】<img/>\n\n【29】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【30】Figure 3\n\n【31】Right lower lobe intralobar sequestration histopathology under H&E stain.

A follow-up CA 19-9 normalised to 12 U/mL. He remained on the anti-NTM therapy for 5 more months with a follow-up CT chest ( figure 4 ) showed the remainder of the right lung was free of infiltrates or pulmonary nodules. A follow-up microbiological sampling was without MAC growth.\n\n【34】<img/>\n\n【35】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【36】Figure 4\n\n【37】A postresection follow-up CT chest showed interval wedge resection of the posterior basal and medial basal segments of the right lower lobe. The visualised right lung is clear and free of infiltrates and pulmonary nodules. The left lung is clear.\n\n【38】Discussion\n----------\n\n【39】PS may get complicated by an infectious process. In a large retrospective study, micro-organisms most commonly implicated include _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Aspergillus species_ . 3 Other micro-organisms include _Nocardia asteroids_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_ . 4 5 Only eight cases in combined English and translated literature described MAC complicating a PS, the first of which was described in 1975 ( table 1 ).\n\n【40】View this table:\n\n【41】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【42】Table 1\n\n【43】All accessible reports of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infecting pulmonary sequestrations published to date\n\n【44】In our case, the diagnosis of MAC infection was established based on radiologic and microbiological criteria. 6 Although histopathological examination of the resected lung tissue did not reveal acid-fast positive organisms, the growth of MAC in two BAL cultures establishes the infection. The diagnosis is also supported by the presence of granulomas representing chronic inflammation. Mycobacterial infections are classically associated with caseating granulomas, but non-caseating granulomas have also been described. 7 8\n\n【45】The route through which the PS acquires infectious micro-organisms remains debated within the literature. Although intralobar sequestrations are completely isolated from the rest of the parenchyma, 20% of cases have an aberrant airway connection. 9 This may have served as the acquisition route and later spread of the MAC infection into the adjacent normal parenchyma. The presence of cysts containing air-fluid levels supports the existence of aberrant airway communication. 10 Other routes of spread described are through Kohn’s pores, along the pleural lining or by lymphatics. 11\n\n【46】Another notable finding is the elevation of CA 19-9, which normalised after surgical resection. CA 19-9 is hypersecreted by respiratory epithelium and hypertrophied lung glands with chronic inflammation. 12 Indeed, elevated CA 19-9 was described in previous cases of PS. 13–15 NTM lung disease is also associated with increased CA 19-9. Hong _et al_ described 59 cases of NTM, 11 of which exhibited elevated CA 19-9. 16 In this case, both PS and MAC infection may have equally contributed to the rise of CA 19-9, with subsequent fall after resection. Further studies remain needed to investigate the utility of this tumour marker as a component of a scoring system to guide MAC duration of therapy.\n\n【47】The patient underwent resection to treat infected PS, and the anti-NTM therapy was continued after resection since MAC had been also found outside the PS. Guidelines and literature remain unclear regarding the duration of MAC infection after resection of the infected tissue. 6 17\n\n【48】This case illustrates the value of comprehensive and often invasive microbiological testing in patients with pneumonia not responding to empiric treatment, particularly with underlying structural lung disease. Testing for MAC and other NTM is warranted, as cases remain on the rise in the United States, reaching an incidence rate of 47 per 100 000 in 2007. 18\n\n【49】### Learning points\n\n【50】*   Importance of considering a broad range of differential diagnoses when evaluating patients with chronic respiratory symptoms and imaging findings that are not typical of bacterial pneumonia.\n    \n*   While tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease were both plausible diagnoses based on the patient’s presentation, other possibilities, including malignancy and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, needed to be carefully considered and ruled out through a thorough workup.\n    \n*   CA 19-9 can be elevated in non-malignant conditions, such as infections and inflammatory conditions. Therefore, it is important to consider the patient’s clinical history and other laboratory and radiological findings before attributing elevated CA 19-9 levels solely to malignancy.\n    \n\n【51】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【52】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【53】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Various studies have even described an increased prevalence among athletes. 1–4\n\n【5】We recently presented the case of a well-experienced 60-year-old man endurance Ironman-triathlon athlete (187 cm, 92 kg, average training level: 10–15 hours/week) who had presented with intermittent shortness of breath and heart palpitations during his training sessions in his daily routine. 5 His medical history showed an isthmus ablation caused by typical atrial flutter and a clinically stable arterial hypertension. The echocardiographic data showed a normal size of the left ventricle (left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVedd) 42 mm), no hypertrophia of the left ventricular walls (interventricular septum thickness (IVSd) 11 mm, posterior wall thickness in systole (PWTs) 11 mm), a minimal enlargement of the left atrium (LA 21 qcm) and a normal ejection fraction (55%). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX, ergometer bike) revealed an episode of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT, maximum effort 250 W). We were able to graphically record the degree to which the athlete’s performance was reduced ( figures 1 and 2 ). The patient’s oxygen pulse decreased pathologically and his VO <sub>2 </sub> oxygen uptake during the SVT was limited ( figures 1 and 2 ).\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Impairment of the oxygen pulse during the cardiopulmonary exercise caused by atrial fibrillation (starting within minute 11) and showing the gap between the tachycardia (red colour) and oxygen pulse (blue colour).\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Graphical record of the athlete’s impairment referring his VO <sub>2 </sub> max uptake caused by atrial fibrillation, missing the typical levelling off phenomenon by endurance athletes at the end of the cardiopulmonary exercise testing.\n\n【14】In the course of a recently conducted further examination and therapy of the same patient, we performed an electrophysiological examination with an ablation of the pulmonary veins (pulmonary vein isolation with a three-dimensional mapping system) and re-evaluated the patient’s clinical performance with a further echocardiographic examination and a CPEX on an ergometer bike. The echocardiographic data showed a stable trend in the follow-up appointment (LVedd 43 mm, IVSd 11 mm, PWTs 11 mm, LA 20 qcm, normal ejection fraction 55%–60%). After the CPEX testing, the patient recovered fast and no episodes of SVT were detected. The haemodynamic influence of the established stable sinus rhythm was recorded graphically in the comparison of pre-interventional and postinterventional CPEX figures ( figures 1 and 2 vs figures 3 and 4 ).\n\n【15】<img/>\n\n【16】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【17】Figure 3\n\n【18】Process of the oxygen pulse during cardiopulmonary exercise with stable sinus rhythm in comparison to figure 1 without the gap between heart rate (red colour) and oxygen pulse (blue colour).\n\n【19】<img/>\n\n【20】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【21】Figure 4\n\n【22】Graphical record of the athlete’s VO <sub>2 </sub> max uptake without the impairment in figure 2 and the typical levelling off phenomenon by endurance athletes at the end of the cardiopulmonary exercise testing.\n\n【23】Our case graphically shows the haemodynamic influence of a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the consequent reduced performance of a patient during CPEX. According to the clinical appearance and the athlete’s reporting, it highlights the impact of a stable sinus rhythm on the performance of endurance athletes. 2 3\n\n【24】In this context, we recently presented our first findings before establishing a stable sinus rhythm. 5 By mapping the LA during the electrophysiological examination with an ablation of the pulmonary veins (pulmonary vein isolation with a three-dimensional mapping system), signs of atrial myocardial fibrosis could be detected in our athlete. This is one of the various aspects of this condition, which are widely discussed, presupposing the relation between high endurance training and the prevalence of atrial fibrillation. 1–4 Causes for the higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation include: (1) myocardial fibrosis, which is sometimes caused by the accumulation of lifelong training hours and increased atrial filling pressure, 4 (2) varying amplitude of the autonomic nervous system, (3) increased baroreflective responsiveness and (4) increased sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to cholinergic stimulation. 1 6\n\n【25】The development of atrial fibrillation in endurance athletes with prior ablation of atrial flutter is a commonly known occurrence. 6 The recently reported ‘paroxysmal AF in young and middle-aged athletesA’ (PAFIYAMA) syndrome is also an interesting fact in this context; our athlete might fulfil these criteria. 7 8\n\n【26】In summary, the presented case shows the importance of establishing a stable sinus rhythm in endurance athletes to improve their haemodynamical performance in CPEX. As mentioned above, these facts have been graphically proved and our findings emphasised the importance of an individualised patient’s treatment strategy in PAFIYAMA syndrome. Therefore, a sustained cardiac functional improvement after establishing a stable sinus rhythm suggests an improvement of quality of life and an objective improvement of cardiac function and exercise capacity in these athletes/patients. 9–11\n\n【27】### Learning points\n\n【28】*   The presented follow-up investigation of our previously published case graphically shows the haemodynamic effect of recovery of a stable sinus rhythm after prior paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia on the athlete’s performance during a cardiopulmonary exercise test.\n    \n*   Although different pathological mechanisms for underlying etiological reasons are discussed, maximum efforts should be focused on establishing a stable sinus rhythm in endurance athletes in order to improve their cardiac function and exercise capacity.\n    \n*   Therapeutic approaches should be individually tailored according to the athletes’ demands.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The rash was painless and non-itchy. It was more prominent on the left leg. She first noticed it during the winter, when she had been using an electric heater which was more close to the left leg. Clinical examination revealed a reddish-brown, non-tender dark coloured reticular pattern of hyperpigmentation prominently on the left lower leg ( figure 1 ). There was no palpable purpura, nodules or gangrene. Based on the history of heat exposure and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of erythema ab igne (EAI) was made. The patient was advised to avoid repeated heat exposure and the rashes disappeared within the next 2 months.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Reticular, reddish-brown, macular hyperpigmentation predominantly on the left lower leg.\n\n【9】EAI is a reticular, erythematous, hyperpigmented dermatosis that results from long-term heat or infrared radiation exposure. 1 It is mainly seen in cases of chronic exposure to heat sources such as heated reclining chairs, hot water bottles, car heaters, heating pads and among laptop users who hold computers on their thighs. 2 It is also commonly seen among people who sat near open fires or stoves. Thermal burns occur when the skin is exposed to infrared radiation (800–170 000 nm) from an external heat source with a temperature exceeding 44°C. Long-term exposure to heat below the threshold for thermal burns is the primary aetiological factor in EAI. 1 It can occur at any site, with predominantly asymmetrical distribution depending on the location of the external heat source. The clinical pattern in EAI corresponds with the dermal venous plexus. It initially begins as transient macular erythema in a broad reticulated pattern which blanches easily. With recurrent heat exposure, the erythema becomes non-blanchable and evolves into a dusky hyperpigmentation. 3 Overlying skin may show focal areas of epidermal atrophy (early stage) or bullae/keratotic plaques (late stage). EAI is characteristically asymptomatic, although some patients may have a slight burning sensation. The hallmark of acute thermal inflammation is the presence of necrosis (epidermal±dermal or subcutaneous tissue depending on the degree on involvement). Histopathological changes in EAI include epidermal atrophy, vasodilatation and dermal pigmentation (melanin and haemosiderin). Focal hyperkeratosis and dyskeratosis along with squamous atypia are noted in later stages. 1 3 EAI is a clinical diagnosis. Biopsy is warranted to rule out cutaneous malignancy. After the inciting cause is removed, EAI tends to disappear gradually, but sometimes the pigmentation is permanent. 4 Vasculitis is a close mimic of this condition. EAI usually carries a good prognosis. Presence of ulceration should raise the suspicion of secondary malignant transformation (squamous cell carcinoma or Merkel cell carcinoma), which remains a long-term risk. 5 Knowledge of this entity may lead the physician to take a proper history and avoid unnecessary investigations and treatment.\n\n【10】### Learning points\n\n【11】*   Erythema ab igne results from chronic low-grade thermal exposure insufficient to cause a burn.\n    \n*   Treatment involves removal of the heat source.

Physical examination revealed normal contour of the cranium and a normal hairline. The face exhibited a long and narrow profile, but individual features were unremarkable in size, shape or position. Neurological examination was notable for central hypotonia and developmental delay. MRI demonstrated a T2-hyperintense, T1-isointense cortical lesion along the left inferior mesial temporal lobe consisting of cystic and solid components, without reduced diffusivity, and multiple solid enhancing nodules on postgadolinium sequences ( figure 1 ). The neuroradiographic differential diagnosis included ganglioglioma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, with lesser consideration for pilocytic astrocytoma. A stereotactic biopsy of the lesion was performed, and neuropathological evaluation revealed biphasic neoplastic architecture comprising regions of densely compact eosinophilia and other, more microcystic, areas ( figure 2A ). Piloid cells and a fibrillar background with focal Rosenthal fibres were visible within the compact eosinophilic areas. Large dysmorphic ganglion cells with vesicular chromatin were interspersed throughout the tumour, in addition to intermixed lymphocytic infiltrates. No significant mitotic activity, necrosis or microvascular proliferation were observed. Immunostaining revealed a mixed population of neoplastic cells, with some neoplastic cells and the fibrillar background immunopositive for glial fibrillar acidic protein and other neoplastic cells immunopositive for synaptophysin and NeuN ( figure 2B ). Sparse (2%) Ki-67 immunopositivity and numerous leucocytes positive for leucocyte common antigen were detected; BRAF p.V600E was not observed (not shown). Microarray analysis and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumour tissue detected no clinically significant abnormalities. However, NGS revealed six variants of uncertain significance in _PBRM1_ (c.3505C>G), _FAT1_ (c.4434C>G), _TRRAP_ (c.3636G>C), _TSC1_ (c.3008C>T), _DDIT3_ (c.466C>T) and _SOX9_ (c.769C>T). The functional pathogenic likelihood of each variant, according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, 1 was predicted using the InterVar tool based on human reference genome hg38. 2 3 The mutations in _PBRM1, FAT1, TSC1_ and _DDIT3_ were classified as ‘pathogenic’, while those in _TRRAP_ and _SOX9_ were predicted to be ‘benign’.

A repeat abdominal ultrasound was performed in our hospital. The ultrasound examination, when performed using an 8.5 MHz high-frequency linear probe, revealed multiple hypoechoic lesions in the spleen ( figure 1 ); however, these were not evident when a standard 3 MHz convex probe was used ( figure 2 ). Further findings included a white cell count of 7.0×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (neutrophils, 40.5%), CRP level of 46.4 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 66 mm/hour.

Although CT scans or MRI may help detect hepatosplenic lesions in adult patients, 4 radiation exposure is a concern in paediatric patients, and children usually require sedation for MRI. Thus, ultrasound screening should be a priority in children, especially those with a history of exposure to a cat. Abnormal findings on abdominal ultrasound in paediatric CSD are common, and according to a previous study, abdominal ultrasound findings showed that 82.4% of these patients had splenic granulomas. 5 However, as demonstrated in this case, hypoechoic lesions may be missed if a standard convex probe is used for children because of their smaller body size. Thus, if available, a high-frequency linear probe should be used to screen for splenic lesions.\n\n【14】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【15】Patient’s father: It was great to have the cause of my daughter’s fever discovered using ultrasound imaging.\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】*   Cat-scratch disease (CSD) should be included in the differential diagnoses for fevers of unknown origin.

Neonates who present with this diagnosis generally do not undergo genetic testing. Therefore, the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta(OI) type VIII rests solely on the clinical features. Since it is prevalent, this is a wake-up call for more surveys to be undertaken for the same genetic variant and to identify potential couples who may transmit the gene to their offspring, especially among those who have relatives diagnosed with Osteogenesis Imperfecta.\n\n【11】Type VIII OI is autosomal-recessive, characterised by white sclerae, severe growth deficiency, extreme skeletal under-mineralisation and bulbous metaphysis. 1 Its prevalence is approximately 1 in 10 000–20 000 births. 2\n\n【12】We report a case that required genetic testing for confirmation, the results of which helped greatly in counselling the baby's parents. The case in question required a multidisciplinary approach to management.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】The term neonate was born to non-consanguineous parents. He was the second born- with an 18 month older female sibling. The mother’s pregnancy was uneventful, and she had attended all her antenatal clinic appointments. She was given routine haematinics and folic acid, and the tetanus vaccine as per standard of care. She progressed well, although she noted poor weight gain in the third trimester.\n\n【15】Antenatal ultrasound was not done. The baby was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery and admitted to the neonatal unit with severe respiratory distress and malformed limbs, both upper ( figure 1A ) and lower ( figure 1B ). The head circumference was 35 cm at birth. Clinically, the features appeared similar to OI, but a possible metaphysical dysplasia was considered because the sclerae were not blue ( figure 2 ).\n\n【16】<img/>\n\n【17】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【18】Figure 1\n\n【19】(A) Right upper limb with shortened humerus and curved ulna (arrows).

There were signs of severe pneumonia with severe chest drawing and nasal flaring.\n\n【25】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【26】A plain X-ray of the chest and a whole-body scout X-ray were done ( figure 3 ). These revealed multiple fractures of the long bones, horizontal ribs and small rib cage size.

A homozygous, likely pathogenic variant was identified in the _P3H1_ gene. The result is consistent with the genetic diagnosis of autosomal-recessive OI type VIII. The variant coordinate was NM\\_001243246.1: c.1095C>G p with amino acid change: (Tyr365\\*), recessive homozygous, nonsense, likely pathogenic (class 2).\n\n【37】Echocardiography revealed a structurally normal heart.\n\n【38】Ultrasound of the abdomen showed normal renal and hepatic morphology.\n\n【39】Serum alkaline phosphatase was 652 mmol/dL (normal level up to 125 mmol/dL).\n\n【40】Lactate dehydrogenase was also raised to 585 mmol/dL.\n\n【41】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【42】The differential diagnosis was metaphysial dysplasia on account of the symmetrical short bones, macrocephaly and absence of blue sclerae.\n\n【43】Treatment\n---------\n\n【44】The baby was treated with appropriate antibiotics for pneumonia and paracetamol for pain. Supportive care was given, including feeding by tube and providing oxygen during the pneumonia episode.\n\n【45】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【46】The baby was discharged after 3 weeks when his condition was stable. He was readmitted at 8 weeks with severe pneumonia. At this time the highest saturations (sPaO2) were in the mid-70s, and he was acidotic with a blood pH of 7.27 and carbon dioxide retention. The baby succumbed to severe pneumonia aged 10 weeks.\n\n【47】The results of genetic analysis were available prior to the baby's death. The mother was counselled, and both parents returned after 6 weeks (the customary period of bereavement) to discuss the test results in more detail.\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】OI, an inherited connective tissue disorder, is recognised by excessive brittleness of the bones. It is the most common genetic disorder of bones with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 10 000–20 000 births. 1 2 It has several classification types, and infants with the worst form of the disease die in the perinatal period.\n\n【50】Type VIII OI, a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterised by white sclerae, severe growth deficiency and bone fragility, was added to the classification in 2007 as a severe and lethal type. 1 Type VIII OI accounts for fewer than 10% of patients with OI. DNA analysis is considered a definitive test for confirming the diagnosis. 3\n\n【51】A similar case of type VIII OI due to a homozygous mutation of c.1914+1G>C (NM\\_001243246.1) in _P3H1_ exhibited retinal detachment, emphasising the need for fundoscopic examination as part of a multidisciplinary approach. 4\n\n【52】The variant P3H1, and variant coordinate _1095C>G p.(Tyr365\\*)_ , create a premature stop codon. 5 6 Pathogenic P3H1 variants are causative for autosomal-recessive OI type VIII. In 2007, Cabral _et al_ described a form of autosomal-recessive OI that they designated OI type VIII, characterised by white sclerae, severe growth deficiency, extreme skeletal under-mineralisation and bulbous metaphysis. 1\n\n【53】However, this variant coordinate is rare, as compared with the _c.1080+1G>T_ described in West Africa and the descendants of West Africans in the USA. 5 In Cabral _et al’_ s study, the screening of contemporary cohorts in West Africa revealed that nearly 1.5% of West Africans are carriers for this mutation and 0.4% of African Americans of Western African descent are carriers. 7\n\n【54】The carrier rate in our setting is not known and the variant coordinates are different from what was found in our case. As this is a homozygous-recessive variant, there is a need for genetic counselling and further survey of the families. Although the parents in our case were non-consanguineous, the recessive nature of this condition indicates the need for further screening of the families after genetic counselling in the familial context if possible, similar to the scenario in individauls of Karen descent. Due to resource constraints, however, this is not possible. 1 8\n\n【55】Type VIII OI patients present with severe to lethal OI, recessive inheritance, white sclerae, rhizomelia, and poor trabeculation of long bones, with most of the affected individuals dying early from respiratory causes, as in our case. Those who survive into childhood have extremely low bone mineral density, severe growth deficiency and bulbous metaphysis.\n\n【56】A multidisciplinary team approach is essential for management, with the aim of providing the maximum long-term function and autonomy that the disease allows. 3 9 Clinical management encompasses physical rehabilitation and surgical procedures, and management of hearing, dental and pulmonary abnormalities.\n\n【57】Fratzl-Zelman _et al_ studied five individuals with type VIII OI. 9 All the patients had white sclerae, normal dentition, relative macrocephaly, triangular facies, and skeletal findings that included rhizomelia, radiographic “popcorn” calcifications at epiphyses, and extremely low bone density. Bisphosphonate treatment was initiated, but progressive skeletal deterioration with age was observed.\n\n【58】Our case demonstrates the importance of genetic testing, which revealed typical _P3HI_ gene mutations. _P3H1_ , cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and cyclophilin B (CyPB) assemble into a 1:1:1 complex within the endoplasmic reticulum that post-translationally modifies specific proline residues in unfolded collagen alpha chains. 10 Recessive OI (types VII and VIII) is caused by deficiency of any of the three collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex components, increasing modification of the collagen helix, supporting delayed collagen folding. In type VIII OI there is the absence of alpha1 (I)Pro986 3-hydroxylation and over-mediation of the collagen helical region, supporting delayed folding. 11\n\n【59】A multidisciplinary approach to management was used in our case, which included neonatologists, medical officers, endocrinologists and geneticists. This case demonstrates the challenge in confirming the diagnosis in our setting due to limited resources, and the possibility that most cases of type VIII OI are missed.\n\n【60】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【61】Although my baby died, I am very grateful to the doctors that took care of him. I am glad that it was possible to do a genetic test, despite this being expensive and not available in our country. The test was done for free. The doctors told me that my baby had a rare condition for which there is no cure, and I thank God for the few weeks I spent with my baby before his death.\n\n【62】### Learning points\n\n【63】*   Pathogenic P3H1variants are causative for autosomal-recessive OI type VIII.\n    \n*   Genetic testing is important for the diagnosis of Type VIII OI.\n    \n*   A multidisciplinary approach in management is important to maximise the long-term survival of the patient.\n    \n\n【64】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【65】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【66】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s)\n\n【67】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【68】We would like to thank the parents and also the doctors and nurses in the Neonatal Unit and General Pediatrics.

Upper digestive endoscopy showed an extrinsic compression in the upper 1/3 of the oesophagus. A CT scan of the cervical, thoracic, abdominal and pelvic regions was normal. Hyperostosis with osteophytic formation was especially apparent at C2 level ( figure 1 ) in the cervical spine CT scan and in a 3D reconstruction ( figure 2 ).

The patient claimed no symptoms, and the fact that she lived with cats was the only epidemiological data of interest. A physical examination revealed painless and superficial adenopathies approximately 1 cm large on both the left supraclavicular fossa and bilateral axillary cavity. Three tattoos were found on the patient ( figure 1 ).\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Positron emission tomography (A) Hypermetabolic adenopathies with low uptake at both the supradiaphragmatic and infradiaphragmatic levels. Several bilateral laterocervical adenopathies, with those at the supraclavicular level being larger (SUVmax: 0.98), and all in both axillary cavities with low uptake (A1–A2). Enhanced uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (SUVmax: 1.63) was observed in retroperitoneal regions (A3). The patient (B) with large decorative tattoos on her right forearm, right hemiabdomen and left hypochondrium.\n\n【9】Several laboratory tests were performed with the following results: CRP 11.8 mg/L and ESR 25 mm/h, with autoimmunity, serologies (HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV, EBV, toxoplasma, syphilis and Bartonella henselae) and IGRA tests all negative. A thoracoabdominal CT confirmed the subcentimetric adenopathies (left supraclavicular and bilateral axillary), which suggested lymphocyte proliferation disorder as the most likely diagnosis. Positron emission tomography revealed multiple hypermetabolic adenopathies with low uptake, so low‐grade lymphoproliferative syndrome could not be ruled out ( figure 1 ).\n\n【10】Given the lack of a definitive diagnosis, the fact that low levels of FDG uptake cannot completely dismiss malignancy, the use of immunosuppressive therapies, and the emotional distress showed by the patient, we asked the surgery department to perform an exeresis of the most accessible one (the left supraclavicular). Its dark colour caught their attention. Once the sample was processed, the department of pathology asked whether the patient had any tattoos.\n\n【11】A diagnosis of pigment-related lymphadenopathy was made ( figure 2 ).\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】Figure 2\n\n【15】Ganglionic biopsy. Lymph node with sinusoidal distension and epithelioid histiocytes, containing exogenous dark material compatible with the pigments in the tattoos.\n\n【16】Our aim with this case is to draw attention to the potential adverse effects of having tattoos. This aesthetic procedure is more and more common in our society (about 60 million people in Europe and 16% of the population in the USA have at least one tattoo). 1 However, there is widespread lack of knowledge regarding how ink degrades under the skin as well as the effects of such degradation. The biggest problem may arise over the long term, as some patients have had reactions months or years following the procedure (it was 6 years in the case of our patient).\n\n【17】Pigment accumulates in the dermis and spreads across the intracellular space, causing haemorrhage, necrosis and inflammation that results in phagocytosis by skin macrophages. Macrophages reach the lymph nodes, where inflammatory reactions can take place and, in many cases, last long after the tattoo has been removed. Sometimes this can be revealed subclinically (autopsies of tattooed patients sometimes reveal the existence of regional adenopathies with pigments). 1\n\n【18】In some cases, malignant skin tumours may develop within the tattoos. The pigments used can degrade with exposure to light, releasing potentially carcinogenic substances via haematogenous spread. 2 It can be difficult to differentiate a neoplastic process from pigment-related lymphadenopathy (in tattooed oncological patients can be mistaken as neoplastic progression). PET/CT can help to avoid unnecessary biopsies. The results were doubtful in the case of our patient, although false positives have been described. 3 Histological confirmation can be necessary under such circumstances. Our differential diagnosis was established with a lymphocyte proliferation, and the final diagnosis was anatomopathological.\n\n【19】### Learning points\n\n【20】*   Pigment lymphadenopathy must be part of the differential diagnosis for tattooed patients with adenopathies of unknown aetiology in draining lymph nodes.\n    \n*   Even though positron emission tomography/CT can produce false-positives, its proper interpretation must be carefully considered to avoid unnecessary exploration.\n    \n*   A histological diagnosis is not necessary in every patient, but in the event of doubt a differential diagnosis of malignant entities must always be histological.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The episodes of chest pain occurred only at night and during sleep, lasting between 5 and 10 min, waking her up. The patient had been experiencing these episodes for the past 2 months. For this reason, she initiated a 24-hour Holter recording the day before being admitted to our ED, which she was still wearing during her first medical contact in our ED. However, what worried the patient and prompted the visit to the ED was the episode of syncope that occurred shortly after the onset of chest pain during the night, which had never occurred before. Her only cardiovascular risk factor was arterial hypertension, for which she was medicated with losartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities, and she had a normal 12-lead ECG, a normal transthoracic echocardiogram and negative high-sensitivity troponin levels.\n\n【5】Since the patient experienced a chest pain episode during Holter monitoring, tracings were obtained, revealing increasing ST-segment elevation in lead II, followed shortly after by Mobitz I atrioventricular (AV) block and Mobitz II AV block ( figure 1 ). ST-segment elevation lasted for about 5 min, and syncope occurred during this period. ST changes gradually normalised after the episode, as well as the conduction abnormalities, ending in T-wave inversion.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】24-hour Holter recording with ST-segment elevation in lead II, Mobitz I atrioventricular (AV) block, and Mobitz type II AV block during an episode of chest pain and syncope.\n\n【10】The patient was referred for coronary angiography, which showed an ectatic right coronary artery (RCA) with mild distal stenosis ( figure 2 ). As the bradyarrhythmias were short-lived, and the patient was not taking specific medication for Prinzmetal angina (PA), we chose not to implant a pacemaker at this time. There were no further events during the hospital stay, and she was discharged with isosorbide dinitrate 40 mg two times a day, amlodipine 5 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily. As we did not implant a pacemaker, we chose not to administer non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. The patient remained asymptomatic at the 3-month, 6-month and 1-year follow-up consultations, and serial Holter monitoring did not show further repolarisation or conduction abnormalities.\n\n【11】<img/>\n\n【12】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【13】Figure 2\n\n【14】Coronary angiography revealing ecstatic right coronary artery with mild distal stenosis.\n\n【15】PA is a clinical condition characterised by chest pain at rest accompanied by ST-segment elevation. In some cases, PA can result in serious complications such as ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, high-degree AV block or sudden cardiac death. 1 The majority of patients with coronary artery spasm (CAS) predominantly experience symptoms at rest, primarily between 18:00 and 06:00. They also occur in a cyclical manner. CAS episodes tend to be prolonged and relatively resistant to nitrates. They also occur in a cyclical manner. Two-thirds of cases are women, and the condition is unrelated to cardiovascular risk factors. It has recently been demonstrated that CAS reflects the impairment of the vasodilator/anti-aggregatory synergy between nitric oxide and hydrogen sulphide. 2 Crises of CAS are associated with inflammatory damage to the endothelial glycocalyx layer, resulting in platelet activation and aggregation: this is reversed by infusion of N-acetylcysteine, a hydrogen sulphide donor. Given that the ORBITA trial 3 revealed that stenting of large coronary stenoses was ineffective for the prevention of (exercise-induced) angina, it is conceivable that overt CAS plays a role.\n\n【16】The diagnosis of PA can be made based on symptoms, ST-segment changes during an anginal episode or invasive provocative testing. Holter monitoring is a useful tool for diagnosing PA, as chest pain is only present in 20%–30% of cases of ischaemic ST-segment elevation. 4 The mainstay of treatment for PA is medical and non-medical therapy, with calcium-channel blockers and nitrates being the primary therapies. 5 Less is known about the best management of patients with PA who develop bradyarrhythmias, as there are only a handful of case reports. 6 7 In both cases, pacemaker implantation was decided due to more severe presentation. In our case, ECG changes were inferior and were associated with mild stenosis in the RCA, which increases the probability of AV block (the AV nodal artery usually arises from the RCA). Nonetheless, the presence of AV block could have been complicated by development of torsade de pointes, reason of temporary pacemaker implantation prior to acetylcholine coronary reactivity testing.\n\n【17】However, in our case, medical therapy successfully managed coronary spasm and AV block, leading to symptom-free follow-up. Therefore, pacemaker implantation should be considered only for refractory or severe cases.\n\n【18】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【19】*   These episodes of pain were very bothersome and they made me quite worried. When I fainted, I was really scared and went straight to the Emergency Room. Thankfully, everyone treated me well and since I started taking the medication, I haven't had any more chest pain or fainting spells. Thank you very much!\n    \n\n【20】### Learning points\n\n【21】*   Consider Prinzmetal angina in patients experiencing recurrent episodes of nocturnal chest pain, particularly if it awakens the patient from sleep.\n    \n*   Prinzmetal angina may manifest as high-degree atrioventricular block. Patients with high-risk factors for cardiogenic syncope should be admitted for extended electrocardiographic monitoring.\n    \n*   Individualised treatment decisions regarding pacemaker implantation are crucial and should consider the patient’s clinical presentation, underlying conditions and risk factors.\n    \n\n【22】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【23】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【24】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The patient denied any recent trauma or neck manipulation. Neurological and ophthalmological examinations were unremarkable. Notably, the patient had no family history, medical history or clinical signs of connective tissue disease, such as joint hypermobility, easy bruising or poor wound healing that might suggest underlying vulnerability to vascular dissection. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (104 mm/hour) and C reactive protein (19.6 mg/L) were markedly elevated. CT angiogram showed tortuosity and ectasia of the cervical internal carotid arteries with septa suggestive of past dissections ( figure 1 ). Brain MRI was unremarkable. A few months earlier the patient had suffered acute renal failure and was found to have obstructive uropathy due to retroperitoneal fibrosis. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed hypermetabolic soft tissue thickening along the aorta and iliac arteries ( figure 2 ). MRI showed slight bilateral lacrimal gland enlargement ( figure 3 ). Serum IgG4 concentration was twice the upper limit of normal. There was no cryoglobulinemia, leucopenia or eosinophilia, and tests for autoantibodies were negative. Biopsy of the retroperitoneal tissue was not pursued as it was considered unsafe. Even in the absence of histopathology, the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) based on the recently revised criteria. 1 The patient was treated with prednisone for IgG4-RD and aspirin for the carotid dissection with normalisation of the IgG4 levels and no further episodes of vision loss. IgG4-RD is a systemic inflammatory disorder characterised by matted infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and fibrosis in multiple tissues. 2 The most frequent neurological manifestation is hypertrophic pachymeningitis, and the most common carotid-associated pathology is atherosclerosis, but arteritis is described in up to 30% of patients. We cannot be certain that there had not been prior dissections, but in the absence of a history of trauma, clinical signs of connective tissue disease, evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia in other vessels or other identifiable risk factors for carotid dissection, we suggest that the patient’s arterial dissections are likely a manifestation of IgG4-RD with vasculitis presenting as amaurosis fugax. 3 4 IgG4-RD is an increasingly recognised disorder with cerebrovascular consequences and thus should be considered among the causes of vasculitis.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Multiplanar reconstruction image of the CT angiogram with coronal (A, B) and axial views at the corresponding dashed lines (C, D, respectively).

He had a posterior vitreous detachment in his right eye with a treated retinal break and multiple bilateral myopia-related features (axial length (AL) 25.5 mm). These included white without pressure, tilted optic nerve head (ONH) and peripapillary atrophy without myopic maculopathy. The most striking feature was unilateral (left) inferior peripapillary orange chorioretinal discolouration ( figure 1 ). Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated the absence of normal choroidal vasculature within this area, consistent with peripapillary choroidal cavitation (PCC, figure 2 ). Overlying outer retinal lamination was generally uninterrupted other than a focal vitreo-choroidal ‘sink-hole’ connection.

(D) Direct communication between the choroidal and vitreous cavities through a ‘sinkhole’.\n\n【13】PCC (formerly peripapillary detachment in pathological myopia or intrachoroidal cavitation) is an anatomical choroidal modification (53% unilateral) typically associated with axial myopia (−9 to −12.5 D, AL ~27 mm), although emmetropia/hyperopia accounts for ~7%. 2–4 High myopia (≤−6 D) is associated with younger PCC presentation. 3\n\n【14】The classic _en face_ appearance is a non-elevated yellow-orange peripapillary area most often inferior to a tilted ONH. 2 3 PCC may affect up to 50% of high myopia and 10% of low myopia. 3 5 6 OCT has been instrumental in delineating the anatomical layer responsible for the _en face_ appearance. 3 A hyporeflective appearance is seen at the level of the choroid, with posterior scleral deformation and/or a full-thickness neurosensory retina/retinal pigment epithelium defect contiguous between the choroidal and vitreous cavities (16%–25%). 2 3 Multiple choroidal schises can be noticed alongside cavitations potentially representing a precursor lesion. 5 Early hypofluorescence on fluorescein angiography confirms absence of choroidal tissue/circulation unless choroidal neovascularisation is present where OCT angiography may help delineate the neovascular complex. 5 7 Other pathological myopia features may be present, including tilted ONH (69%), peripapillary atrophy (98%), posterior staphylomata (40%), myopic maculopathy (14%–37%), peripheral retinal degenerations/breaks, PVD and glaucoma (38%–70%). 3 5\n\n【15】Clinically, these cases may be referred for concern of amelanotic choroidal nevus/melanoma; however, multimodal imaging helps to clarify their ‘cystic’ rather than solid nature. Although thought to be acquired rather than congenital lesions, PCC development is gradual (no change over 6-year follow-up). 8\n\n【16】The pathogenesis may be related to myopia (ie, increased AL influences angle of optic nerve entry) and ageing (few PCC cases described <30 years of age). 3 Loss of choroidal adhesion (ie, tissues of Jacoby/Elschnig) to underlying sclera/ONH may be exacerbated by tractional/liquefactive effects of vitreous humour and increased susceptibility to physiological IOP leading to PCC. 2 3 Other factors include dural traction causing peripapillary suprachoroidal detachment in areas of staphyloma with tilted ONH which is promoted by adduction (ie, reading). 9\n\n【17】Similarities to coloboma-adjacent choroidal changes have been suggested with potential genetic links (eg, _ABCB6_ , _PAX2_ , cadherin family), although myopia-associated genes are equally implicated (eg, _ABCC6_ , _PLOD1_ , collagen family). 10\n\n【18】Although PCC may cause concern to the referring clinician, it is a benign lesion requiring no treatment; however, associated features of myopia warrant careful assessment±treatment.\n\n【19】### Learning points\n\n【20】*   Peripapillary choroidal cavitation (PCC) is prevalent in those with high myopia (up to 50% in some series).\n    \n*   Novel studies show PCC development is influenced by tractional (optic nerve sheath, dura mater, vitreous) forces on predisposed areas (eg, thinned choroid/sclera at borders of peripapillary staphylomata, tilted optic nerve head, gamma-peripapillary atrophy).\n    \n*   It is a benign lesion, but may be associated with choroidal neovascularisation or treatable features of pathological myopia.\n    \n\n【21】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【22】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【23】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Pulpal pathology, traumatic injuries of immature teeth, iatrogenic or endodontic mishaps can give rise to flared canals which eventually lead to restorative problems. 1 Damaged teeth with extensive loss of dentinal tissues can recently be salvaged by reconstitution and rehabilitation using materials with the ability to bond to the dentinal structures. Rebuilding a weakened root with an appropriate adhesive material can provide dimensional and structural reinforcement for supporting and retaining a post and core for sustained function of the tooth. 2 The presence of a blunderbuss canal can complicate the maintenance of an apical barrier with a three-dimensional seal. 3 Light-cured or dual-cured composite resins, glass ionomers, fibre strips, accessory fibre posts and unpolymerised glass fibre posts can be used for successful management of weakened roots by reinforcement of the remaining root structure. 4 A modified apexification procedure is a recent treatment strategy which can be used in similar cases of immature permanent teeth with pulp necrosis or apical periodontitis requiring a post for a final restoration. This approach has been shown to improve the potential for continued apical root development. 5 This case demonstrates the intraradicular rehabilitation of an immature necrotic tooth with insufficient coronal tooth structure and subsequent restoration.\n\n【5】A 22-year-old female patient reported with a chief complaint of a broken upper front tooth. The patient gave a history of trauma to the upper front tooth region 13 years ago. Clinical examination revealed a deep proximal caries in relation to tooth #21 ( figure 1A ). There were no soft tissue abnormalities detected intraorally. Extraoral examination revealed no abnormalities. Radiographical examination revealed a proximal radiolucency involving the pulp with thin dentinal walls and an open apex ( figure 1B ). The tooth elicited negative response to thermal and electric pulp testing. Based on the clinical and radiographical findings, a diagnosis of pulp necrosis with asymptomatic apical periodontitis was made. The treatment plan included apexification with mineral trioxide aggregate and reinforcement of the dentinal walls with flowable composite followed by postendodontic restoration using a post and core.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】(A) Preoperative photograph. (B) Preoperative radiograph. (C) Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) apexification. (D) Canal reinforcement with composite. (E) Postcementation.\n\n【10】In the first visit, the tooth was anaesthetised using 2% lignocaine and 1:100 000 epinephrine (Dentsply Sirona, York, Pennsylvania, USA) by the infiltration technique. Rubber dam isolation was carried out, and access cavity preparation was done under magnification loupes (3.5×, Zumax). Following pulp extirpation, the tooth was negotiated with a #15 K file (Dentsply Maillefer, Oklahoma, USA). Working length was determined using an apex locator (Root ZX Mini; J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan) and was confirmed with an intraoral periapical radiograph. The biomechanical preparation was carried out using #80 K file with frequent irrigation using 2.5% sodium hypochlorite with a side vented needle. This was followed by irrigation with 17% EDTA and a final rinse with saline. A Ca(OH) <sub>2 </sub> intracanal medicament was placed after drying the canal with paper points followed by temporisation of the tooth using Cavit (3M ESPE, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA). In the second visit after 2 weeks, under rubber dam isolation, the canal was thoroughly irrigated using 2.5% sodium hypochlorite followed by saline to wash out any remnants of the calcium hydroxide dressing. After drying the canal with suitable paper points, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) (MTA Plus, Dentsply Tulsa) apexification was carried out using MTA carrier to create the apical plug. An apical barrier of 4 mm was established ( figure 1C ). A finger plugger was used to evaluate the setting of MTA followed by the reinforcement of the canal walls on the same day since the remaining dentin thickness of the walls was less. Etching of the canal was carried out using 37% phosphoric acid for 15 s; saline irrigation was carried out and dried with paper points. A micro applicator tip was used to apply a thin coating of dentin bonding agent and it was then light cured. A flowable composite resin, G-aenial Universal Flo (GC, India), was injected into the canal and a light transmitting post, Luminex (Dentatus, Weissman Technology), was inserted centrally.\n\n【11】Excess material was removed from the access cavity and a light-curing tip was placed at the end of the post for curing the flowable composite. The post was then removed with a rotating and pulling motion ( figure 1D ). In the space left after post removal, the post was luted with an adhesive resin cement (Maxcem Elite Kerr Self-cure; Kerr, Orange, California, USA) ( figure 1E ). The core build-up was done with a core buildup material (LuxaCore Z; DMG, Hamburg, Germany) followed by tooth preparation and recording of the impression. An all-ceramic crown was then cemented in the next visit ( figure 2 ). A 6-month follow-up showed no significant changes and good patient satisfaction.\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】Figure 2\n\n【15】Postoperative photograph.\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】*   Necrotic immature teeth with less than 2 mm of remaining root dentin thickness can be rehabilitated before restoration with a post and core.\n    \n*   The intraradicular reinforcement method involves placing an intermediate layer of adhesive material of suitable thickness, sandwiched between the root dentine and the post, to enhance the fracture resistance of such roots.\n    \n\n【18】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【19】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【20】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

A systematic review of data extracted from 2006 to 2015 concluded that pesticides were responsible for almost 20% of global suicides leading to approximately 150 000 fatalities per year over the afore-mentioned period. 1 Unfortunately, this is a less commonly researched topic. Although organophosphate accounts for the majority of the hospital admissions, poisoning by paraquat compounds is a major medical problem as it is associated with a very high mortality (case fatality rate of 50%–70%) and morbidity. 2 Paraquat is a toxic bipiridyl compound, and it is lethal even in very small amounts (15–20 mL of 20% w/v). The mode of poisoning is usually suicidal or accidental; and it should always be suspected in cases of corrosive oral and oesophageal ulcerations along with features of hepatic, renal or pulmonary involvement. 3 Paraquat is incompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and mainly exerts its toxicity through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which causes cell damage by several mechanisms, such as mitochondrial toxicity, lipid peroxidation, oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), activation of nuclear factor kappa B and apoptosis. 4 It targets both type I and II pneumocytes in the lung, leading to acute alveolitis. The initial ‘destructive alveolitis’ is followed by a ‘proliferative’ or ‘cellular’ phase, which ultimately leads to lung fibrosis. 5 6 Hepatorenal involvement in the form of acute tubular injury and hepatocelluar damage is also common. Mucosal ulceration in the oral cavity and tongue, also known as ‘paraquat tongue’ is seen within the first few days of poisoning. No specific antidote is available for this poisoning, and there is also dearth of evidence-based recommendation for the treatment. 7 Management is mainly supportive. Gastric decontamination with activated charcoal is recommended in those presenting within 1–2 hours of ingestion; however, gastric lavage should not be done due to the corrosive nature of paraquat. Routine use of supplemental oxygen is not recommended in patients with mild-to-moderate hypoxia, as the hypoxemic strategy will reduce the production of ROS. Immunosupressive agents such as cyclophosphamide, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone, along with antioxidants such as N-acetyl-cysteine and ascorbic acid, have been investigated in its management without significant success.\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】*   Paraquat is a toxic bipyridylium herbicide and its ingestion in very small amount can be fatal with toxic effects on kidney, liver, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and other organs.\n    \n*   There is no specific antidote.

Coinfection with mucormycosis and aspergillosis is rare, but cases have been reported in literature, most commonly presenting as disseminated invasive fungal infection with cerebrorhino-orbital involvement in an immunocompromised patient. Infections are most commonly caused by direct implantation of spores with localised angioinvasion. Haematogenous spread is rare, with most cases secondary to haematological malignancies or intravenous drug use. Coinfection with mucormycosis and aspergillosis portends a poor prognosis, with a high mortality rate. Thus, prompt recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent poor outcomes. In this unique case report, we describe a case of isolated cerebral mucormycosis and aspergillosis coinfection, not previously reported in literature.\n\n【2】*   Infection (neurology)\n*   Neuroimaging\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Few, if any, isolated cases have been reported in medical literature. This case with a complicated atypical presentation serves to highlight the importance of having a high suspicion for cerebral fungal infections and coinfections in immunocompromised patients as well as prompt intervention that is crucial to mitigate poor prognosis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A patient in their 20s with a medical history of active intravenous polysubstance use was brought to the emergency department with altered mental status. On admission, vitals were within normal limits. The patient was somnolent and non-verbal but withdrawing all four extremities to noxious stimuli. The initial metabolic workup revealed normal blood glucose, thyroid-stimulating hormone and free T4, elevated creatine kinase (2860 IU/L), and newly found to be HIV positive with CD4 count 224 cells/MCL, 18%. Urine drug screen was positive for amphetamines and fentanyl. CT scan of the head did not show an acute intracranial abnormality. The patient soon developed seizure and left facial droop, with a temperature of 101.9°F (38.8°C), and became less responsive; as a result, the patient was transferred to intensive care unit.\n\n【12】MRI of the brain without contrast showed greater right than left basal ganglia diffusion restriction with surrounding oedema. Stroke workup, including CT angiography of head and neck, transthoracic echocardiogram and transoesophageal echocardiogram, was unremarkable. Continuous electroencephalogram showed diffuse background slowing but no seizures or epileptiform discharges.\n\n【13】Lumbar puncture was suggestive of inflammatory or infectious central nervous system disease (Red blood cell (RBC): 1400 x 1012/L, White blood cell (WBC): 240 x 109/L, glucose 39 mg/dL, protein 128 mg/dL, herpes simplex virus 1/2 PCR negative). The patient was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone and ampicillin for possible meningoencephalitis, in addition to clindamycin, leucovorin and pyrimethamine due to concern for toxoplasmosis.\n\n【14】MRI of the brain with and without contrast then showed areas of restricted diffusion in the bilateral basal ganglia and anterior left midbrain, a new lesion compared with previous MRI, which demonstrated non-specific peripheral enhancement, concerning for infection, neoplasm or less likely infarction ( figure 1 ).\n\n【15】<img/>\n\n【16】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【17】Figure 1\n\n【18】(A) Axial T2 Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), presence of a T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion centred in the left basal ganglia measuring 3.4×2.3 cm transaxially extending into the adjacent white matter including the external and internal capsules, corona radiata and left cerebral peduncle/midbrain. (B, C) Axial T1 post contrast, presence of haemorrhagic peripherally enhancing, non-pyogenic lesions in both gangliocapsular regions extending into the left cerebral peduncle/midbrain with surrounding oedema.\n\n【19】Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies eventually returned negative for venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test, acid-fast bacillus (AFB) gram stain and culture, cryptococcal antigen, fungal culture, John Cunningham (JC) virus quant PCR, and toxoplasma IgG. Cytology showed numerous lymphocytes and cytometry showed no phenotypically abnormal cell population. IgG synthesis was elevated at 73.8 mg/dL and IgG index was elevated at 0.82. The patient also had negative serum IgG for toxoplasmosis. Given imaging, serum and CSF studies were not consistent with toxoplasmosis, all prior treatment regimen was discontinued, and empiric Bactrim was started, which led to slight improvement in mental status.\n\n【20】However, due to the patient’s lack of progressive improvement after several days on Bactrim, the patient underwent stereotactic needle biopsy of the left basal ganglia. Frozen sections from biopsy showed aseptate, ribbon-like fungus with some right-angle and acute angle branching. The fungus was thinner than mucor but thicker than aspergillus fungus, but there was a greater concern for mucor over aspergillus ( figure 2 ). Brain tissue fungal culture was negative. Pathology was sent to the University of Washington for panfungal PCR assay. CT Chest Abdomen Pelvis did not show evidence of disseminated systemic infection. The patient was then started on liposomal amphotericin. The infectious disease (ID) team suggested lesion debridement with neurosurgery, but it was determined to be morbid, difficult and high risk. The PCR returned positive for both aspergillus and mucor species, isolated to the brain, so amphotericin was continued for 28 days and followed by isavuconazole. Additionally, dolutegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir were started for highly active antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【21】<img/>\n\n【22】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【23】Figure 2\n\n【24】Pathology lab microscopic description: the fungal organisms are present in necrotic brain tissue and focally in brain tissue containing marked inflammatory infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes and multinucleated giant cell macrophages.

He was eventually alert and oriented to the person, and was evaluated by speech therapy and cleared to take tablets and capsules per oral prior to discharge to a skilled nursing facility. ID team recommended to continue isavuconazole (for 6–24 months, based on repeat imaging) and antiretroviral therapy. His mental status gradually improved, and he is now alert and oriented to person and place, and is able to communicate with family members, however, has limited ability to perform daily activities. He is scheduled to have outpatient neurology and ID follow-up and physical therapy/occupational therapy at home.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】Mucormycosis and aspergillosis are two invasive, opportunistic fungal infections that are clinically similar but rarely associated. Risk factors for invasive fungal infections include primary immunodeficiency, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, intravenous drug use, HIV/AIDS and malnutrition. 1 , 2 Isolated cerebral mucormycosis is well described in people who inject drugs. 1 These infections are independently severe and often fatal. 3 Coinfection is associated with even poorer outcomes, and often correct diagnosis is not made until postmortem. 4\n\n【29】This coinfection is commonly reported in patients with haematological malignancies or diabetes mellitus. 5–7 Both species are filamentous fungi that invade rapidly through tissue and disseminate early. They are ubiquitous in the environment, posing a threat to immunocompromised individuals. Contamination can occur through spore inhalation or percutaneous injection. Mucor infection can cause damage via angioinvasion and tissue necrosis. 8 Damage from aspergillus infection results from direct tissue invasion or from recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of infection. 9\n\n【30】This case report emphasises the importance of retaining a high index of suspicion for coinfection with mucor and aspergillus. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and European Confederation of Medical Mycology Joint Clinical Guidelines strongly recommend direct visualisation, culture and histopathology as the gold standard for diagnosis of both mucormycosis and aspergillosis, with histology showing rightangle, non-septate hyphae and 45°, septate hyphae, respectively. 10 11\n\n【31】In our case, given the dual presentation of right-angle and acute angle branching, a comprehensive 18S rRNA gene sequence primer was used to confirm the diagnosis. As individual prognosis is driven by early treatment, guidelines stress the importance of early diagnosis in the implementation of intervention. 10–12 One study found that delay in medical treatment with amphotericin B resulted in a twofold increase in mortality rate at 12 weeks after diagnosis, compared with early treatment (82.9% vs 48.6%). 12\n\n【32】Additionally, the importance of early imaging cannot be overstated. CT scan can provide an early screening tool, while MRI provides detection of the extent of infection, often deciding whether surgical debridement is an option. In our case, initial differential included stroke, but involvement of the basal ganglia on imaging and a lesion inconsistent with typical ischaemic stroke raised suspicion for infectious invasion. Additionally, earlier imaging may offer a window for surgical intervention before the spread of infection makes the intervention unfeasible.\n\n【33】A delay in diagnosis can be fatal, stressing the importance of early recognition and intervention. In patients with multiple risk factors, mucormycosis and aspergillosis infections should be on the list of differential diagnoses, even without the classic rhino-orbital invasion. This case contributes to greater awareness of presentation of disseminated fungal infections to help expedite identification and treatment of these pathologies.\n\n【34】### Learning points\n\n【35】*   Mucormycosis and aspergillosis are two invasive, opportunistic fungal infections that are clinically similar but rarely associated.

Such adapters are commonly used during the airway procedures where the adapter allows access of a bronchoscope to the airway while maintaining ventilation and oxygenation without disconnection from the ventilator circuit. We report a rare case where a fragment from an airway swivel adapter dislodged into the patient’s airway during an endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS).\n\n【5】A woman in her 50s presented for an urgent EBUS to investigate the cause of a large left hilar mass causing extrinsic compression of the left main bronchus. To facilitate the procedure, a double swivel elbow adapter with port, manufactured by Southern Cross Medical, New South Wales, Australia, was attached distally to the patient’s ETT and proximally to the ventilation circuit. The connector port has a fenestrated plastic membrane (inner diameter 12.8 mm) that allows the passage of the bronchoscope, without compromising the air seal for ventilation ( figure 1 ). As the Fujifilm EB530 ultrasound bronchoscope (outer diameter 6.7 mm) was passed through the swivel adapter, a fragment of the plastic membrane dislodged into the patient’s trachea. Fortunately, the AFB was visualised in the distal trachea, approximately 22 mm proximal to the carina ( figure 2 ) and the bronchoscopist was able to retrieve the fragment without incident ( video 1 ).\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Defect in the airway swivel adapter after removal of the endobronchial ultrasound.\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Airway foreign body in the distal trachea.\n\n【14】Video 1 Bronchoscopic removal of the airway foreign body.\n\n【15】Fragmentation of the plastic membrane may be explained by the factors related to the swivel connector itself, the bronchoscope or the proceduralist. A defect in the dual-axis swivel adapter may be due to an isolated manufacturing defect in the plastic membrane, or that the integrity of the membrane was compromised by incorrect storage or handling. In the present case, we postulate that the reason for the defect in the dual-axis swivel adapter was because the EBUS had a larger outer diameter compared with a standard bronchoscope, so it is likely that the rotational and linear forces of the EBUS damaged the membrane. The proceduralist’s level of experience may also have played a role in the amount of stress placed on the plastic membrane during the EBUS insertion.\n\n【16】Although early recognition of the AFB and an appropriate response by the bronchoscopist ensured a good outcome for this patient, the potential consequences of the fragmented swivel connector were serious. In retrieving the AFB, the procedure duration was extended and further instrumentation within the airway was required, both of which increased the risk of airway trauma, hypoxia and respiratory compromise. Furthermore, the incomplete plastic membrane caused leakage from the circuit, thus reducing the ventilation volumes and ventilation pressures being delivered to the patient, placing them at risk of hypoventilation. Had the AFB lodged more distally in the airway and remained unnoticed, it could have precipitated the development of a pneumonia, lung abscess or systemic inflammatory response. It also had the potential to obstruct the distal airways during the bronchoscopy. This case serves as a reminder to thoroughly check airway equipment for defects before and after use. Appropriate airway instrumentation checks may mitigate the risk of unnoticed AFBs.\n\n【17】This adverse event did not result in patient harm, however, open disclosure was made to the patient following the national open disclosure framework, 6 which included (1) an apology and expression of regret, (2) a factual explanation of what happened, (3) an opportunity for the patient to relate their experience, (4) a discussion of the potential consequences of the adverse event and (5) an explanation of the steps taken to manage the adverse event and prevent recurrence.\n\n【18】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【19】The patient respectfully declined to comment.\n\n【20】### Learning points\n\n【21】*   Formal airway equipment checks before and after bronchoscopy is paramount.\n    \n*   Instrumentation checks before and after bronchoscopy may reduce the risk of unnoticed airway foreign bodies (AFBs).\n    \n*   AFBs should be considered in patients who have undergone bronchoscopy and who display new-onset respiratory symptoms.\n    \n\n【22】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【23】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【24】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosing an obturator hernia clinically is a challenging one and nearly impossible. These hernias usually present as an intestinal obstruction as more than 50% of obturator hernias goes in for strangulation. Here, we report an unusual presentation of an obturator hernia in a 70-year-old woman who presented to emergency room with acute abdomen and uncomplicated reducible inguinal hernia. Radiological imaging showed obstructed inguinal hernia while on diagnostic laparoscopy, a strangulated and perforated obturator hernia of Richter’s type was seen in addition to an uncomplicated inguinal hernia. Obturator hernia, although very rare, is associated with high morbidity and mortality as it is often underdiagnosed as in our case.

The obturator hernia is most often the Richter's type, which can be a diagnostic challenge as focal strangulation of the bowel can progress to gangrene with or without overt signs of intestinal obstruction. 4 Richter’s hernia is a type of abdominal hernia in which only part of the circumference of the bowel is entrapped and strangulated in the hernial orifice. The segment of the engaged bowel is nearly always the lower portion of the ileum. 5\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 70-year-old woman was brought to the emergency room with uncomplicated reducible swelling in the right inguinal region for the past 3 years with sudden onset of pain over the swelling for 3 days. Pain was severe, gripping in character and constant which was relieved partly on flexion of the thigh. No history of any medical illness nor any previous surgeries. On physical examination, the patient was moderately nourished and built. Her heart rate was 102 beats/min and blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg. Abdomen was soft, not distended with diffuse tenderness present over lower abdominal quadrants with no guarding or rigidity. On local examination, a swelling of size 4×3 cm was seen in the right inguinal region which was reducible with expansile impulse on coughing.\n\n【12】INVESTIGATIONS\n--------------\n\n【13】Ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed a possible right inguinal/femoral hernia with features of obstruction, and advised CT correlation. CT scan of the abdomen was done subsequently which showed a 3×3 cm defect in the right inguinal region with herniating bowel loops and overcrowding of ileal loops over the defect with free fluid noted around the ileal loops suggestive of obstructed inguinal hernia as seen in figure 1 .\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】Figure 1\n\n【17】CT image depicting groin defect with overcrowding of bowel loops.\n\n【18】Treatment\n---------\n\n【19】On a diagnosis of obstructed inguinal hernia, patient was posted for diagnostic laparoscopy and proceeded. After insufflation and creating pneumoperitoneum figure 2 , overcrowding of small bowel loops was seen in right inguinal region and pelvis with localised bilious collection of 50 mL in favour of early perforative peritonitis. On releasing the adhesions and bowel loops, a 3×3 cm defect was noted in the right inguinal region with viable bowel loops. On further release, 1.5×1.0 cm defect was noted in the obturator canal with perforation of entrapped bowel loop of Richter’s type seen. Laparotomy was done and a 1 cm perforation in terminal ileum with unhealthy edges was noted 20 cm from ileocaecal junction as seen in figure 3 . Thorough lavage was given. Perforation site resection and anastomoses were done in two layers. Anatomical repair of both the defects was done. Obturator defect was closed at first primarily with 1-polypropylene followed by closure of inguinal defect with interrupted 1-polypropylene sutures as depicted in figure 4 .\n\n【20】<img/>\n\n【21】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【22】Figure 2\n\n【23】Hernial orifice filling with CO <sub>2 </sub> after insufflation with veress needle.\n\n【24】<img/>\n\n【25】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【26】Figure 3\n\n【27】Obturator and inguinal defects with perforated ileum on laparotomy after adhesiolysis.\n\n【28】<img/>\n\n【29】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【30】Figure 4\n\n【31】Picture taken after obturator defect closure, while closure of inguinal defect is in process as labelled in figure.\n\n【32】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【33】The patient tolerated the procedure well with nil postoperative complications. Orals were started on postoperative day 4 after good bowel sounds, escalated to soft solids and discharged on postoperative day 7. The patient was periodically followed up for a period of 1 year who remained asymptomatic.\n\n【34】Discussion\n----------\n\n【35】Obturator hernia is the protrusion of abdominal viscera through obturator canal in which the obturator nerve and vessels pass. This hernia is about six to nine times more common in women than men due to their broader triangular pelvis and greater transverse diameter. It affects women of around 70–90 years of age, the reason being attributed to atrophy of the preperitoneal fat around the obturator vessels in the canal thereby predisposing hernia formation and hence the name ‘little old woman’s hernia’. 3 The major risk factors for obturator hernia are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic constipation and ascites. Diagnosing an obturator hernia at the earliest is very difficult as it usually presents with non-specific signs and symptoms. Although it is a rare abdominal hernia, the mortality rate is as high as 70%. Major clinical symptoms are due to intestinal obstruction like abdominal pain, distension, nausea, vomiting and constipation. They may also have recurrent attacks of intestinal obstruction in the past with or without a palpable mass in the groin. 6\n\n【36】Emergency CT scanning could lead to rapid diagnosis and early surgical intervention and thus optimising the outcome. The use of CT scan in detecting obturator hernia was first reported by Meziane _et al_ in 1983. 7 The common CT scan finding is herniated loop of distal small bowel extending through the obturator foramen between the pectineus and obturator externus muscles. In incarcerated hernia, CT scan shows associated bowel loop dilatation in the abdomen. Since the use of CT scan, preoperative diagnosis rate was improved from 43% to 90% in some reports. 8 However, it is not always possible to diagnose all obturator hernias using CT of the abdomen as seen in our case. Diagnostic laparoscopy serves as a tool in diagnosing and treating occult, suspected and missed obturator hernias on imaging. In our institution, we routinely practice and advocate laparoscopic method for uncomplicated groin hernias including suspected obturator hernias without bowel complications due to advantages like diagnostic accuracy of occult hernias, lesser postoperative pain and other complications. But in this case scenario, due to perforated ileum with peritonitis on laparoscopy and the need for resection and anastomosis, we converted to open surgical approach. Open approach with lower midline is considered the most preferred by many authors as it gives good exposure to the obturator ring and also aids in performing bowel resections when required. 9 In view of peritonitis in this case, mesh (non-absorbable or absorbable) was not employed for further reinforcement as non-absorbable meshes have higher chances of mesh rejection and absorbable meshes can get dissolved in the presence of bacterial infection.\n\n【37】### Learning points\n\n【38】*   Obturator hernia, although very rare, is associated with high morbidity and mortality.\n    \n*   It is often underdiagnosed as in our case; the preoperative finding of hernia was because of the inguinal hernia with no bowel obstruction and it was an obturator hernia which did not show up clinically was strangulated with a perforated bowel of Richter’s type within it. The same could have been easily missed if an inguinal approach had been followed. Laparoscopy bailed us out from missing out a perforation from an occult obturator hernia.\n    \n*   Laparoscopy should be considered as a tool of choice in cases of an occult obturator hernia and unclear hernias arising from the myopectineal orifice of Fruchaud.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

We describe the case of a young man in his 40s who was referred to our clinic for management of a large orbital mass probably arising out of the ocular surface covering the whole globe ( figure 1A ). The fungating mass measured 5×5 cm, multilobular with overlying necrotic areas and haemorrhagic points. Reviewing his medical records, it was evident that 3 years ago, he underwent an enucleation procedure, which had to be halted due to intraoperative heart block. His condition at the time was critical, necessitating intensive care and significant resuscitation efforts. Due to the complexity of his case and the challenges associated with administering general anaesthesia, orbital exenteration was deemed unfeasible. Instead, an incision biopsy was performed to confirm the histopathology as invasive SCC ( figure 1B ). Subsequently, he was referred to a radiation oncologist to initiate definitive radiation therapy. The patient underwent conformal beam radiotherapy, specifically external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), targeting the left orbit. The treatment involved the use of 6 mV photon beams, with a total dose of 30 Gy administered over a span of 2 weeks, consisting of 10 fractions ( figure 1C ). EBRT was divided into 3 Gy/fraction as phase 1 and boost dose of 10 Gy in five fractions. The patient responded well to radiotherapy with adequate reduction in tumour mass, globe salvage as well as vision salvage ( figure 1D ). During the course of radiotherapy, the patient developed few side effects in the skin and conjunctiva (grade 1 reaction); however, there were no episodes of bleeding from the tumour mass. There were no clinical manifestations of tumour lysis syndrome. 1 Currently, the patient’s left eye has a visual acuity of 20/200 and is accompanied by an immature cataract for which surgery has been scheduled. The patient has been consistently attending follow-up appointments and there has been no recurrence of the condition for the past year.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】(A) Clinical photo showing right-sided fungating mass (size 5×5 cm) over ocular surface consisting of multiple lobules, overlying necrotic areas and haemorrhagic points with indistinguishable ocular features.

Although CCB-induced gingival enlargement is a known adverse effect, it is rarely or never caused by some CCBs. In this paper, we report the case of a late 80’s female patient with hypertension who experienced amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement. The patient’s antihypertensive medication was changed from amlodipine to another CCB of the same class, benidipine, which has not been reported to cause gingival enlargement. The patient also received periodontal therapy. A significant improvement in gingival enlargement was noted, and blood pressure control was maintained. This case indicates that it might be beneficial for patients with hypertension presenting CCB-induced gingival enlargement to switch from the CCB that caused gingival enlargement to another CCB with little to no risk.\n\n【2】*   Hypertension\n*   Dentistry and oral medicine\n*   Cardiovascular system\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Drug-induced gingival enlargement, which deteriorates oral cleaning, aesthetics and oral function, is a well-known adverse drug reaction associated with some antiepileptics, immunosuppressants, high-dose oral contraceptives and CCBs. 4\n\n【11】CCBs that have been reported to induce gingival enlargement include nifedipine, nitrendipine, felodipine, amlodipine, nicardipine, manidipine, nisoldipine, cilnidipine, diltiazem and verapamil. 5–11 The reported incidence of gingival enlargement varies depending on the pharmacological agent used ( table 1 ). Although this adverse effect of CCBs has been widely reported, some CCBs have rarely or never been reported to cause gingival enlargement.\n\n【12】View this table:\n\n【13】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【14】Table 1\n\n【15】List of CCBs with reported association with gingival enlargement\n\n【16】In this paper, we report a case of an elderly female with hypertension who was treated for periodontal disease after switching her medication from amlodipine to benidipine, a CCB of the same type, and whose amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement was improved and maintained.\n\n【17】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【18】A late 80’s woman visited our clinic in February 2017 with chief complaints of gum bleeding and denture incompatibility. The patient had been diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 77 and had begun antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine (5 mg/day). Two clinical blood pressure measurements were taken at the first visit, which were 154/83 and 137/74 mm Hg. The patient did not have a history of smoking.\n\n【19】Gingival enlargement, which the patient was unaware of, was observed in the mandibular anterior teeth gingiva and maxillary edentulous areas at the first visit ( figure 1 ). Periodontal examination (54-site measurements of nine teeth) was performed, including probing pocket depth (PPD), which involves measuring the depth of the spaces between the teeth and gingiva as indicative of periodontitis progression; bleeding on probing (BOP), which detects inflammation in the periodontal pocket; sites of suppuration and O’Leary’s plaque control record (PCR) to examine oral hygiene.\n\n【20】<img/>\n\n【21】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【22】Figure 1\n\n【23】Intraoral photograph at first diagnosis (A, B). (A) Gingival enlargement was observed at the mandibular anterior teeth gingiva and maxillary edentulous areas at the first diagnosis. Abundant plaque accumulation, inflammation of the periodontal tissues, and pathological tooth migration due to periodontitis progression were observed at the time. (B) The vertical dimension of the lower face was reduced due to incompatible dentures.\n\n【24】At baseline, the results of the periodontal examination showed an average PPD of 7.3 mm. The PPD of 98.1% of the sites was 4 mm or more, and BOP was observed in 100% of the sites. The patient routinely performed oral hygiene using only a toothbrush for 1 min after breakfast and before sleeping. Abundant plaque accumulation (PCR, 100%), inflammation of the periodontal tissues and calculus were observed at the first visit. The vertical dimension of the lower face was reduced due to incompatible dentures and pathological tooth migration caused by the periodontitis progression ( figure 1 ). Radiographic examination revealed moderate horizontal alveolar bone resorption, widening of the periodontal ligament of the upper teeth and localised severe vertical alveolar bone resorption on the mandibular right premolar and molar. Based on these clinical findings, severe generalised chronic periodontitis (stage IV grade B, classification in 2018) 12 and drug-induced gingival enlargement 4 were diagnosed.\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】At the beginning of the initial treatment, we presented a list of CCBs that were previously reported to cause gingival enlargement and their incidence ( table 1 ) to her physician to determine the possibility of replacing amlodipine. After the consultation, amlodipine was replaced with another dihydropyridine CCB (benidipine 8 mg/day), which has not been previously reported to be associated with gingival enlargement. Subsequently, the clinical blood pressure was well controlled at 127/73 mm Hg.\n\n【27】Initial periodontal therapy included oral hygiene instruction using a toothbrush and an interdental brush, scaling of supragingival calculus and extraction of seven teeth (13, 27, 42, 44, 45, 46 and 47, using the Two-Digit World Dental Federation Notation tooth numbering system) because of the loss of supporting bone and disturbed masticatory function. Then, complete and partial denture fabrication for the upper and lower arches, respectively, and scaling root planing under local anaesthesia were performed. As a result, gingival enlargement improved, and 6 months after replacing amlodipine, an open flap debridement was performed as a preprosthetic procedure at the lower left canine and premolar where PPD of 4 mm or more persisted. Then, prosthodontic treatment with maxillary full dentures and mandibular partial dentures and crowns was performed after re-evaluation at 4 months after the flap operation, and supportive periodontal therapy (regular maintenance) was initiated.\n\n【28】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【29】During the initial periodontal treatment, gingival proliferative findings showed a tendency to improve 3 months after amlodipine replacement. Moreover, in the edentulous area of the maxilla, the proliferative findings were reversed 4 months after amlodipine replacement. The clinical parameters at the regular maintenance visit, 14 months after the start of benidipine treatment, remained improvement and were as follows: the average PPD was 2.8 mm, sites with 4 mm or more were 8.3%, and the rate of sites with BOP was 25.0% ( figure 2 ). Furthermore, no recurrence of gingival enlargement was observed for 2 years up to the point that the patient stopped coming to our clinic due to ambulatory issues.\n\n【30】<img/>\n\n【31】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【32】Figure 2\n\n【33】Intraoral photograph after periodontal therapy following the switch from amlodipine to benidipine (A, B). (A) Amlodipine was replaced with benidipine, another dihydropyridine-based calcium channel blocker, which has no reported association with gingival enlargement. A significant improvement was observed in gingival enlargement. (B) Prosthodontic treatment performed with maxillary full dentures and mandibular partial dentures.\n\n【34】Discussion\n----------\n\n【35】CCB-induced gingival enlargement was first reported for nifedipine in 1984, 13 and the first case of amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement was reported in 1993. 14 Other case reports have also associated other CCBs with gingival enlargement. 5–11 According to previously reported cases of CCB-induced gingival enlargement, the prevalence rates associated with amlodipine, nifedipine, felodipine, nicardipine, manidipine, nisoldipine, diltiazem and verapamil were 1.1%–5.1%, 2.9%–7.6%, 3.2%, 0.5%, 1.8%, 1.1%, 2.2%–4.1% and 2.0%, respectively. 6–10 Nitrendipine and cilnidipine have also been reported to cause gingival enlargement, 5 11 but to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on their incidence. In 2021, a study on the Turkish population reported that 1 of 14 subjects taking benidipine had early mild overgrowth, and 2 of 15 subjects taking lercanidipine presented moderate overgrowth. 15\n\n【36】Gingival proliferation caused by phenytoin is clearly the most fibrotic, while lesions caused by cyclosporine are highly inflammatory and show little fibrosis. 16 In contrast, lesions caused by nifedipine are of mixed type 16 and might be relatively difficult to diagnose. However, as the Turkish study showed high incidence rates for several drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers that had not been previously reported, to be associated with gingival overgrowth, grades 1 and 2 of the classification of gingival overgrowth 17 used in this study might include gingival swelling due to gingivitis. In addition, gingival enlargement has not been reported in any CCB other than the above, suggesting that the incidence is rare.\n\n【37】Discontinuation of CCBs or switching to another drug often results in the improvement of gingival enlargement, and thus, drug dosage reduction or discontinuation is the initial treatment approach. However, it may be difficult to replace CCBs that cause gingival enlargement with other antihypertensive drugs in patients with severe hypertension or polypharmacy. Westbrook _et al_ evaluated the effect of switching to dihydropyridine derivatives, which are associated with a lower incidence of gingival enlargement, on nifedipine-induced gingival enlargement. Patients with nifedipine-induced gingival enlargement were divided into the following two groups: those receiving continuous nifedipine (six patients) and those receiving nifedipine-equivalent isradipine (five patients), and clinical findings were evaluated after 8 and 12 weeks. Three out of five patients in the isradipine group had clinically reduced gingival enlargement, whereas four out of six patients in the nifedipine group reported increased gingival enlargement. 18\n\n【38】The mechanisms of pathogenesis of CCB-induced gingival enlargements remain unclear. Calcium (Ca) channels are classified into the following types: the neural type (N-type), which exists in the nerve terminal, the long-lasting type (L-type) characterised by a slow rate of inactivation and the transient type (T-type) characterised by a rapid rate of inactivation. 3 These Ca channel subtypes exhibit various physiological functions due to differences in the electro-physiological properties and mode of in vivo distribution. It is noteworthy that CCBs that act only on L-type Ca channels, such as nifedipine and amlodipine, 3 tend to induce gingival enlargements ( table 1 ). On the contrary, benidipine, which acts on L-/T-/N-type Ca channels, cilnidipine, which acts on L-/N-type Ca channels and azelnidipine, which acts on L-/T-type Ca channels, 3 have rarely or never been reported to cause gingival enlargements. These findings suggest that the subtype and α <sub>1 </sub> subunits (Cav1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, Cav2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and Cav3.1, 3.2, 3.3) of Ca channels 19 on which the CCB acts may be related to the onset and incidence of gingival enlargements. Therefore, we focused on CCBs other than L-type CCBs, which have not yet been reported, and on those with a low incidence of gingival enlargement.\n\n【39】Previously, we reported a case of gingival enlargement in a patient with severe hypertension whose gingival enlargement improved after initial periodontal therapy following a change from L-type CCB (nifedipine, 40 mg/day), which caused gingival enlargement, to L-/T-type CCB (azelnidipine, 16 mg/day), which has not been reported to be associated with gingival enlargement. 20 In the present case, change from a dihydropyridine class L-type CCB (amlodipine), which caused gingival enlargement, to another CCB of the same class L-/R-/T-type CCB (benidipine), for which no association with severe enlargement was reported, along with initial periodontal therapy, significantly improved gingival enlargement. Periodontal variables, particularly dental plaque and gingival inflammation, are also important risk factors for CCB-induced gingival enlargement. 21 Therefore, removal of bacterial factors by initial periodontal therapy, such as oral cleaning, scaling and scaling root planing is effective. Interestingly, even in the edentulous area of the maxilla, which is less susceptible to dental plaque, the gingival enlargement findings disappeared after this drug change. The involvement of lymphocytes expressing delayed rectifier K <sup>+ </sup> channels (Kv1.3) has also been demonstrated in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. It has been reported that benidipine effectively suppresses lymphocytes Kv1.3. 22 Thus, benidipine may contribute to the improvement of inflammation. Therefore, benidipine itself may have contributed to the improvement of inflammation and to the improvement of gingival enlargement in edentulous areas. Future studies are expected in this regard.\n\n【40】Based on these findings, for gingival enlargement caused by CCBs, a change from CCBs to other antihypertensive agents should be considered prior to periodontal treatment. In particular, for those with reduced hand dexterity in oral cleaning and reduced awareness of plaque control (eg, the elderly), changing medications may be a useful option for treating gingival enlargement. In addition, for patients who have difficulty changing from one CCB to another antihypertensive drug, for example, those who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure or those who take multiple drugs, changing to another CCB that is less likely to cause gingival enlargement is recommended. Benidipine could also be a candidate as the CCB after a drug change. Furthermore, oral examination of gingival enlargement and regular dental examinations are recommended for patients taking CCBs. Although improvement was observed in this patient, it is unclear and controversial whether switching CCBs will improve other cases of CCB-induced gingival enlargement. Therefore, further investigation and case reports about CCB-induced gingival enlargements are needed.\n\n【41】### Learning points\n\n【42】*   Oral examination of gingival enlargement and regular dental examinations are recommended for patients taking calcium channel blockers (CCBs).\n    \n*   Most CCBs that have been reported to be associated with gingival enlargement are long lasting-type CCBs.\n    \n*   It is recommended for patients with CCB-induced gingival enlargement to switch from CCBs to other types of antihypertensive drugs or to a different CCB that has little to low incidence of gingival enlargement prior to periodontal therapy.\n    \n*   For those with reduced hand dexterity in oral cleaning and reduced awareness of plaque control (eg, the elderly), changing medications may be a useful option for treating gingival enlargement.\n    \n*   In particular, if it is difficult to change to another CCB, such as for patients who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure or who are taking multiple medications, it may be advisable to change to another CCB of the same class that has not been reported to cause gingival enlargement.\n    \n\n【43】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【44】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【45】Consent obtained from next of kin.\n\n【46】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【47】The authors would like to express their sincere thanks to Dr Koide M, who is with the Division of Hard Tissue Research, Institute for Oral Science, Matsumoto Dental University, Japan, for critical reading of the manuscript and fruitful discussion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

She had been referred with a diagnosis of cystoid macular oedema OD and had received posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone from another eye centre but with no visual improvement. The well-defined circumscribed morphology of the macular lesion raised a strong clinical suspicion of it being a sequela of optic disc pit maculopathy. However, repeated and careful examination of the fundus images, including a 30° image of the optic disc (obtained using the Zeiss 450 plus fundus camera) did not reveal an optic disc pit ( figure 1C ). Initial spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) through the optic nerve head (ONH) using 48 radii scan (Spectralis by Heidelberg) also failed to reveal the optic pit and depicted only a few cavitations along temporal slope of ONH ( figure 2A,B ). Owing to the strong suspicion, a repeat OCT scan, this time in the raster mode with 0.5 mm separation between the scanning lines, was undertaken. It was only after this that a breach in the membrane over ONH was revealed, confirming the presence of occult disc pit ( figure 2C,D ).\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Ultra-wide field image of right eye depicting a circumscribed hypopigmented macular lesion extending beyond the inferotemporal arcade with a foveal hyperpigmented scar (A) better appreciated on fundus autofluorescence (B).

Raster scan OCT through the ONH depicting not only the cavitations along the slope of ONH (C; red arrow) but a breach in the membrane of the ONH (D; blue arrowhead) (thus confirming the presence of occult disc pit).\n\n【13】The minimal separation that can be obtained using the radial scan with the Spectralis OCT is 7.5° (with 48 radial lines) and as seen in our patient, it is possible to overlook small lesions with this degree of separation. Hence, we herein highlight that a dense raster scan through the optic disc has a higher potential of identifying the lesion and must be employed in all cases with high suspicion of occult disc pit. Circular OCT scan centred on the optic disc is also a sensitive method of detecting occult disc pit. It can detect marked reduction in the retinal nerve fibre layer thickness consistent with the location of the optic pit. 1\n\n【14】### Learning points\n\n【15】*   A suspicion of occult disc pit should be raised with the presence of circumscribed macular lesion with a peripapillary extension.\n    \n*   A dense raster optical coherence tomography scan is a better investigative parameter than a radial scan to detect occult disc pit.\n    \n*   Optic disc pit is a rare entity, and occult disc pit is rarer, making it difficult to diagnose.\n    \n\n【16】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【17】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【18】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

He had received tablet paracetamol prescribed by a general practitioner. But his symptoms did not subside, and he had increased fatigue, so he came to the hospital. On general examination, heart rate was 94/min, blood pressure was 134/78 mm Hg and temperature was 39°C. Cardiac, pulmonary and abdominal examinations revealed no abnormality. Laboratory tests were remarkable for a leucocytosis (15 080 cells/mm 3 ), total bilirubin 2.6 mg/dL, alanine transferase 180 U/L, aspartate transferase 72 U/L. Chest X-ray showed an elevated right hemidiaphragm. The patient was admitted and treated with fluids, and empiric antibiotic therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam was started. Baseline investigations and blood cultures were taken.\n\n【6】An abdominal ultrasound (US) revealed two hypodense collections (3.5 cm and 4 cm diameter) in the right lobe of the liver. Subsequently, contrast-enhanced CT ( figure 1 ) showed few hypodense collections in both lobes of the liver for which percutaneous drainage was placed, yielding 80 cc of purulent fluid. _Entamoeba histolytica_ serology was negative. On analysis of the fluid,cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test for tuberculosis and malignant cells were negative. Pus culture from the aspirate subsequently grew multidrug-resistant burkholderia cepacia.

Labs revealed a haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 9.1% and a random blood glucose of 200 mg/dL, consistent with new-onset diabetes mellitus. Nasopharyngeal COVID-19 PCR test returned positive. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral attenuation of the kidneys and air in the bladder, which was confirmed by pelvic ultrasound. Gas subsequently resolved 2 days later after treatment with antibiotics, and a diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made. Emphysematous cystitis in the paediatric population is an extremely rare condition with four cases reported in the literature. Furthermore, there has been a reported association between COVID-19, cystitis and non-typical course of urinary symptoms. Local inflammation obstructing transportation of formed gas is one of the proposed mechanisms underlying emphysematous cystitis, and so COVID-19 may be yet another predisposing factor.\n\n【2】*   urinary tract infections\n*   gas/free gas\n*   COVID-19\n\n【3】http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-245779\n\n【4】Statistics from Altmetric.com\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】*   urinary tract infections\n*   gas/free gas\n*   COVID-19\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】Emphysematous cystitis is an infection of the bladder associated with gas formation, with common infectious agents being _Escherichia coli_ or _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ . 1 Diabetes mellitus and urinary tract obstruction are two of the biggest risk factors for emphysematous urinary tract infections, and cases are often complicated by serious underlying pathologies. The most commonly affected patients are elderly, immunocompromised women. Diagnosis is usually confirmed through imaging. 2\n\n【8】The exact pathogenesis is poorly understood. A glucose-rich environment may contribute to gas-producing microbe proliferation. 3 In addition, there is typically impaired transportation of the formed gas due to either anatomical obstructions or to local inflammation. 4 Furthermore, the literature suggests a relationship between COVID-19 and cystitis, but the mechanism remains unclear, ranging from COVID-19-induced cytokine production to ACE2 receptor interactions in the bladder and kidneys. 5 6 This reported COVID-19-associated cystitis may be complicated by urinary tract infections and other comorbidities that exacerbate inflammation and infection. 6\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A 15-year-old female adolescent with a medical history of urinary tract infections, left ureteral reflux and a family history of type 1 diabetes initially presented to urgent care for right flank pain. She reported diffuse abdominal pain for about 1 month with worsening pain, radiation to the right flank, nausea and vomiting. She denied pneumaturia. Patient denied other symptoms and was afebrile. Physical exam revealed significant right costovertebral angle tenderness.\n\n【11】Her left ureteral reflux was diagnosed at 5 years of age and was grade 1. The patient also has a history of smoke exposure and a lack of toilet paper at her step-parent’s home, for which she has had to drip-dry. She had multiple prior urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the past according to her mom. Following some lifestyle changes, the patient’s UTIs had resolved until this event.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】The patient was afebrile at the time of presentation and remained afebrile during the entire hospitalisation despite other evidence of significant systemic inflammation including a C-reactive protein of 22.4 mg/dL and a white blood cell count of 17 400/mcL with 74% neutrophils. Blood culture and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) were not obtained. Urinalysis showed pyuria, haematuria, bacteriuria, leucocyte esterase, nitrites, 3+ketones and 3+glucose. A routine COVID-19 test through nasopharyngeal swab came back positive. Point of care glucose and an HbA1c were also 200 mg/dL and 9.1%, respectively. A venous blood gas revealed pH 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in venous blood (PVCO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 36 mm Hg, partial pressure of oxygen in venous blood (PVO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 72 mm Hg, bicarbonate 18.5 mmol/L, CO <sub>2 </sub> 20 mmol/L and a base deficit of −6.9. Serum ketones were negative. CT scans showed gas-forming cystitis ( figures 1 and 2 ) along with bilateral attenuation suggestive of pyelonephritis.

In addition, blood glucose findings, the HbA1c of 9.1%, and positive urine glucose and ketones indicated new-onset diabetes mellitus with a state of diabetic ketoacidosis. The CT scan revealed mottled areas of increased radiolucency and a small area of complete radiolucency with an air–fluid level enclosed by the bladder wall, confirming free air within the bladder. No intraluminal air was identified (commonly described as a cobblestone or ‘beaded necklace’ appearance). 7 8\n\n【28】The differential for emphysematous cystitis includes reflux air from a renal abscess, enterorenal fistula formation, retroperitoneal perforation, psoas abscess, or urological or radiological interventions such as catheter insertion. 9 However, this patient lacked any history of trauma, medical interventions such as nephrostomy or foley insertion, and imaging did not reveal abscesses elsewhere. Characteristic imaging findings of emphysematous cystitis are air within the bladder lumen and/or wall. 2 10 While most cases involve gas within the bladder wall, not all cases include said imaging findings. Some studies suggest radiographic findings present 50%–85% of the time. 10–12 Given the patient’s signature risk factors such as smoke exposure and prior history of grade 1 vesicoureteral reflux, new-onset diabetes mellitus, history and imaging findings, a diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made. Urine culture was as expected with _E. coli_ . 1 In addition, the concurrent COVID-19 positivity provides another point of interest.\n\n【29】Treatment\n---------\n\n【30】Whereas uncomplicated cystitis can be managed with a short course of oral antibiotic in the outpatient setting, current guidelines recommend parenteral antibiotics for emphysematous cystitis, usually an empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic such as ceftriaxone. 2 Emphysematous urinary tract infections are often associated with more complex and serious urinary tract disease (such as pyelonephritis), and urological consult for possible nephrectomy and addressing anatomic anomalies is advised. 4 Urology consult discussed further evaluation for possible neurogenic bladder once the acute infection had resolved. This patient was treated initially with ceftriaxone; antibiotic coverage was narrowed with cefazolin on day 2 as the urine culture grew _E. coli_ susceptible to first-generation cephalosporins. Parenteral antibiotics were continued for a 7-day course following the recommendations of the urology consult, then transitioned to oral cephalexin on the day of discharge with a 7-day course planned in the outpatient setting (14 days of total antibiotic therapy). The patient’s diabetes was managed with insulin and intravenous fluids, and she was otherwise asymptomatic despite COVID-19 positivity.\n\n【31】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【32】After initiating antibiotic treatment and managing the patient’s new-onset diabetes, the patient’s right flank pain gradually resolved. Repeat pelvic ultrasound on hospital day 3 did not show findings suggestive of emphysematous cystitis. After a 7-day hospital stay, she returned home with a full recovery.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】Emphysematous cystitis is a relatively rare and complicated urinary tract infection. Almost all documented emphysematous cystitis have been in adults. 13 Most cases typically include complex underlying comorbidities. 9 Of the four paediatric cases reported thus far, one had bilateral pelviureteric junction obstruction, one had spastic quadriplegia and pancreatitis, one with concomitant urosepsis and another presenting following a bone marrow transplant complicated by gut-associated graft-versus-host disease. 14–17 The key identifying features are characteristic imaging findings of gas in the bladder and/or bladder wall on CT scan and strong focal echoes on ultrasonography. Many sources indicate that radiographic detection does not necessarily need to be present in all cases, with 50%–85% of cases of gas-forming UTIs containing such findings. Thus, diagnosis should be made with the entire clinical picture in mind. 2 10–12\n\n【35】The pathogenesis for emphysematous cystitis is not well understood. Some hypothesise that high glucose levels provide an environment favourable for gas-forming organisms such as _E. coli_ . Subsequently, urinary tract infections play a central role in the disease process, providing a mechanism by which organisms can reach the bladder. 2 Shokeir _et al_ described urinary tract obstruction being present in all their patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis without diabetes mellitus and in half of their patients with diabetes mellitus. 4 Furthermore, Grupper _et al_ discussed how inflammation may increase local pressures, impair circulation, leading to gas accumulation, additional infarction, and provide a good culture medium for gas-forming bacteria, creating a vicious cycle. 2 Clinical guidelines currently recommend parenteral antibiotics followed by urology consult for possible cystectomy. 1 This patient’s symptoms resolved on antibiotic treatment and diabetes management, and she did not develop any characteristic COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n【36】All the previously reported cases have had significant concurrent obstructive and inflammatory processes. While this patient has the signature risk factors such as type 1 diabetes and ureteral reflux, COVID-19 also has a documented history of urinary tract shedding and frequency. 18 The patient’s elevated HbA1c and random glucose are common findings in acutely ill patients with diabetes; however, prior studies have suggested that COVID-19 may directly infect human pancreatic beta cells, inhibiting their functioning and predisposing this patient to urinary tract infections secondary to hyperglycaemic-induced bacterial overgrowth. 19 Prior research has also suggested that COVID-19 can increase urinary frequency and may be a cause of viral cystitis. 6 20 The exact mechanism by which the virus interacts with the urinary system is not well understood but is thought to involve an increase in inflammatory cytokines released into the urine and/or directly expressed by the bladder. 6 COVID-19 has a well-documented history of inducing inflammation and targeting ACE2 receptors to enter target cells. The kidneys and bladder have high and medium expressions, respectively. 5 Finally, there remains the possibility that this patient’s COVID-19 positivity is purely incidental, playing no role in the pathogenesis of her disease process. A general state of poor health, such as diabetes, is a known predisposing factor. 21 While that is a consideration, it is important for medical professionals to stay vigilant about not only the possible complex interplay between COVID-19 and diseases of the urinary system but also about the possible underlying factors contributing to atypical presentations of urinary tract infections.\n\n【37】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【38】Initially I was just so overwhelmed with everything. I was used to urinary tract infections, but they always went away with antibiotics. This time the worsening back and abdominal pain had me worried. I feel much better now, but I am worried about something like this happening again in the future. (Patient)\n\n【39】When the doctor told me that (the patient) had diabetes and that her COVID-19 test came back positive, it was a lot to take in. I knew we had a family history of autoimmune disease, but I didn’t expect to deal with so much at one time. I am glad, however, that we were able to catch her diabetes early on, and I hope that this case can help others out there. (Mother of the patient)\n\n【40】### Learning points\n\n【41】*   Complex presentations of urinary tract infections, such as this patient’s concurrent diabetic ketoacidosis, infectious status, medical history, family history and social/environmental history warrant further diagnostic workup.\n    \n*   Emphysematous cystitis is an extremely rare condition in the paediatric population even among those with characteristic predisposing factors. 14 In a child with emphysematous urinary tract infections, there is almost certainly underlying anatomical abnormalities, diabetes mellitus or both.\n    \n*   COVID-19 may have complex interactions with the urinary system, especially in patients with a medical history of conditions that affect or involve the urinary tract.\n    \n\n【42】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【43】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【44】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

In addition to cognitive symptoms, the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, also known as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, occur in >90% of people with dementia. 3–6 These neuropsychiatric symptoms include agitation, aggression, apathy, depression, elation, disinhibition, anxiety, irritability, sleep disturbances, wandering, repetitive questioning, delusions, hallucinations and psychosis. 3 4 7–10 Neuropsychiatric symptoms are often distressing and can result in early institutionalisation, diminished quality of life, increased frequency of emergency department visits along with stress and ill-health in caregivers. 3 4 7–10\n\n【9】Non-pharmacological interventions are recommended as first-line treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms, instead of medications such as atypical antipsychotics which have significant associated side effects including stroke and death. 11 While there have been several systematic reviews of the use of non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, 3 6 8–10 12 most of the studies assessed focus on patients in long-term care facilities. There are a limited number of studies assessing the use of non-pharmacological treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric symptoms for patients living at home which focus on potential triggers of patient behaviours and behaviour modification strategies, 13 interventions around environment and patient capabilities 14 and tailored activities delivered by occupational therapists and nurses. 15 There is, however, a current and projected global shortage of healthcare professionals, 16 and this is acutely felt in China where there is a shortage of doctors, nurses and occupational therapists. 17–19 In China, there is also a lack of adequate medical school training in dementia care and as a consequence, a lack of doctors confident in the diagnosis and management of dementia. 20 21 With an insufficient number of memory clinics in China to meet the growing prevalence of people with dementia, 21 there are continued barriers to proper dementia diagnosis and management. The dementia service programmes discussed in this report are provided by trained staff members including a social worker and a care manager. The care is paid for privately by the individual or their family. There is no government funding provided for home-based or community-based dementia care programmes in China and currently dementia care is paid for out of pocket or by health insurance for those who are insured. 20 22\n\n【10】In this case report, we describe how a programme of individualised, non-pharmacological interventions implemented for a man with mixed dementia living in his own home, was associated with improvement of his significant neuropsychiatric symptoms within 3 months.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A man in his late 70s was living with his wife in a four bedroom apartment in urban Beijing, China. The patient presented with memory deficits including loss of short-term memory based around handling of his finances, not knowing who his children were and what they were doing for him, and not recognising his wife whom at times he would mistake for his mother. He was becoming disorientated daily to place and directions and had been getting lost in his own neighbourhood. These memory symptoms were accompanied by episodes of significant suspicion focused mainly on his finances and as a result of his concerns, he would become very agitated and at times verbally and physically aggressive. He was experiencing auditory hallucinations in which he thought he heard his family talking about his finances. He was having persecutory delusions and accusing his son-in-law of stealing his pension, as well as trying to murder him. He would often physically and verbally attack his eldest daughter for not protecting him and would become agitated towards his wife for not supporting him. He also stopped engaging with his friends and neighbours and had stopped musical and gardening activities which he previously enjoyed.\n\n【13】The patient had no previously diagnosed chronic conditions, medical or psychiatric history and no known cardiovascular risk factors. He was not taking any regular medications prior to his diagnosis of dementia. In 2014, he was diagnosed with a mixed form of dementia (Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia), by his local physician who then prescribed donepezil, as well as Ginkgo Biloba and multivitamins. The patient was a non-smoker and drank no alcohol. He was formerly a teacher of chemistry and mathematics as well as a primary school principal. According to his family, he was of a very high intellect during his years of active teaching. He previously had hobbies such a listening to and playing music, and gardening.\n\n【14】The patient’s eldest daughter visited his apartment three times a week to provide some care support and was the main spokesperson for the family. His younger daughter worked overseas. The family had employed a male care worker to stay and care for the patient full time. After 10 days, the male care assistant resigned because of the stress of caring for the patient. The patient would consistently wake up during the night causing carer fatigue. The care assistant’s departure resulted in the need to employ a new care assistant. The patient’s wife had to be moved into a separate one bedroom flat in the same building due to her own significant and increasing medical care needs and to minimise disruption of her care.\n\n【15】In early April 2018, the family contacted our dementia service team requesting help in dealing with the patient’s worsening suspicion, agitation, aggression, disorientation and increased isolation. The family described that they felt a significant burden in caring for the patient and the related stress was having a negative impact on the patient’s relationship with family members.\n\n【16】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【17】At the time of diagnosis of mixed dementia in June 2014, there was no further formal cognitive screening, diagnostic imaging or pathology done to further confirm the diagnosis or stage of illness due to financial constraints and barriers to definitive dementia diagnosis in China. 16–21 It should be noted that our dementia service organisation does not conduct the dementia diagnosis process. The local physician provided the presumptive diagnosis of mixed dementia to the patient and family. This diagnostic information was then provided to the care manager when the family applied to arrange the patient’s in-home dementia programme.\n\n【18】From initiation of the programme in April 2018, the frequency of neuropsychiatric symptom episodes of suspicion, delusions, agitation and aggression were recorded as shown in table 2 in the Outcome and follow-up section.\n\n【19】The patient was also assessed and scored at the end of each month by the care manager using the following assessment tools with scores presented in table 3 in the Outcome and follow-up section.\n\n【20】*   Mini-Mental State Examination. 23\n    \n*   Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. 24\n    \n*   Global Deterioration Scale/Functional Assessment Staging. 25–27\n    \n*   Geriatric Depression Scale. 28\n    \n*   Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living. 29\n    \n*   Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease Scale (QoL-AD). 30\n    \n\n【21】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【22】The presumptive diagnosis of mixed dementia was made by a local physician. The presenting features of disorientation, confusion, poor judgement and behavioural changes are typical for Alzheimer’s disease, while the presentation of impaired ability to make decisions and organise his finances earlier on in the course of his condition, could be suggestive of vascular dementia. 31 However, it is notable that the patient had no previous history of cardiovascular risk factors or stroke. Personality and behavioural changes, including suspiciousness and agitation, may start to develop in the moderate stage of Alzheimer’s disease, along with the cognitive symptoms of difficulty in doing usual daily tasks, confusion about where they are and wandering. 31 In vascular dementia impaired judgement or impaired ability to make decisions, plan or organise are more common initial symptoms in the earlier stages. 31 This patient’s neuropsychiatric symptoms developed after his onset of memory deficits and he had no prior history of psychiatric conditions.\n\n【23】There are many differential diagnoses to consider in a patient presenting with features of dementia; however, the social worker and care manager in our dementia service team are provided with the dementia diagnosis based on the information from the local physician and the deliver a dementia in-home programme designed to address and monitor the patient’s individual symptoms. The in-home dementia programme service is provided as an adjunct to the patient’s ongoing clinical care provided by the physician.\n\n【24】Treatment\n---------\n\n【25】In April 2018, the dementia service team which included a social worker and a social care manager initiated a systematic, non-pharmacological approach to treatment, involving the family members and community at the onset of treatment. A plan was devised to identify strategies and therapeutic interventions to meet the patient’s needs and reduce the family’s stress and burden of care.\n\n【26】Following initial assessment, key treatment goals were established as follows:\n\n【27】1.  Build a trustful relationship between the male patient and his care providers and family members.\n    \n2.  Develop coping mechanisms and strategies for the suspicion, persecutory delusions and to reduce the aggressive behaviour towards his family members and carers.\n    \n3.  Improve the patient’s orientation to familiar surroundings and people.\n    \n4.  Improve his socialisation and support system within the community.\n    \n5.  Relieve carer stress and burden.\n    \n\n【28】A care plan was implemented from Monday to Friday for an hour a day which included:\n\n【29】1.  Assessment of triggers behind the patient’s delusions and suspicion, verbal and physical aggression.\n    \n2.  Relevant non-pharmacological interventions, including daily reality orientation.\n    \n3.  Provision of family education.\n    \n4.  Rebuilding connections with ex-colleagues and neighbours.\n    \n\n【30】Within the first few visits, the social worker was able to build a trusting relationship with the patient. She discovered that the patient’s loss of short-term memory, lack of recognition of family members and impaired ability to manage his finances resulted in him becoming suspicious of what was happening to his money as he did not see any of the cash from his pension at home. He also became accusatory of his wife and daughter over ownership of his property. The intersection of memory loss and impaired ability resulted in perceived stress for the patient which triggered delusions, agitation and aggression. The social worker initiated a reality orientation approach by explaining to the patient that his pension was deposited monthly into the bank where there were safety measures in place to protect his money and that only he, with his identity card, could withdraw the money from the bank tellers. The social worker immediately involved the family in this approach to show him his automatic teller machine card and property ownership certificate regularly as a daily reminder of his financial security, and they would take him to the bank to be reassured by the bank officials if his concerns relapsed significantly. Further training was provided for the caregiver and the family on ways to manage the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia and the associated manifestations.\n\n【31】The patient also had episodes when he could not recognise himself in the mirror as soon as he stepped out of the bathroom and would then become verbally aggressive towards his wife. These episodes were reduced after the social worker and the family covered the mirror up with specific dated newspapers during the time he would be in the bathroom, thereby helping the patient to keep orientated to date. A reality orientation board was implemented with the patient to help him recognise his family members, especially his wife, as well as his home address and directions. The social worker showed the patient photos of different people and his wife from past to present and helped him to recognise his wife. The social worker periodically conducted group activities with the patient as well as his wife to help with their relationship and interactions. With the aim of helping reduce the patient’s frequent disorientation, the patient was brought into the community with his family, as this helped show him the way back home to reinforce the patient’s memory of the home address and directions.\n\n【32】The social worker and caregivers also explored better ways to communicate and care for the patient. Talking therapy was applied to help rebuild family relationships with the patient. Reminiscence therapy, a reality orientation board and cognitive training were implemented with the aim of helping to strengthen the patient’s memory and cognition. Music therapy and gardening therapy were intended to help reduce changes in mood, encourage positive engagement and help restore his former hobbies. A list of all the non-pharmacological interventions applied is presented in table 1 .\n\n【33】View this table:\n\n【34】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【35】Table 1\n\n【36】Non-pharmacological interventions delivered to the patient between April and end November 2018\n\n【37】Aspects of the patient’s socialisation were addressed in the following practical ways. The social worker and eldest daughter persuaded the patient to communicate with his ex-colleagues on a social media (WeChat) group chat on his phone. They also arranged for the patient to attend a party held by the patient’s ex-colleagues. In addition, the care manager approached the local neighbourhood residential committee spokesperson and provided education on dementia to better understand patient’s condition and requested them to visit the patient once a month.\n\n【38】Throughout the programme, the team members provided caregiver support and training during the sessions in the patient’s home, such as sharing with care assistant how to deal with client’s behaviour, improve communication between the family members and the patient and further educate the caregivers on the dementia.\n\n【39】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【40】By July 2018, 3 months after initiation of the programme, a significant reduction was noted in verbally and physically aggressive incidents as well as fewer episodes of suspicion and delusions as demonstrated in table 2 . Since the end of August 2018, there have been no further episodes of verbal or physical aggression. The patient has a better understanding of his finances and how his daughter is helping him manage them. While his financial understanding and memory of his financial affairs is not always perfect, the recurring reality orientation strategies are able to be implemented by his family and carers as frequent reminders of how his financial affairs are managed and protected. Along with the observed improvements in neuropsychiatric symptoms, there was no deterioration in the patient’s levels of dementia, depression, functionality and quality of life as displayed in the scores in table 3 . It was noted that the while the Global Deterioration Scale/Functional Assessment Staging system scores of 5 showed moderately severe cognitive decline for cognition due to the significance of his memory loss and moderate functional impairment in that the patient occasionally needed help selecting clothing; however, in terms of physical ability to complete activities of daily living, the patient was able to physically dress and groom himself independently and had no other impairments on the Barthel parameters resulting in the Barthel index score of 100.\n\n【41】View this table:\n\n【42】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【43】Table 2\n\n【44】Frequency of episodes of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia experienced by the patient\n\n【45】View this table:\n\n【46】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【47】Table 3\n\n【48】Results of relevant dementia, depression and quality of life scales in the patient over 8 months\n\n【49】The QoL-AD was based on patient input with some caregiver input when required and we were surprised not to see the score improve despite the reduced frequency of the neuropsychiatric symptoms. A speculative reason for this could be based on the fact the quality of life assessment is primarily based on the person’s subjective opinion on their own intrinsic sense of well-being within physical health, mood, relationships, cognition, domestic life and tasks like financial management. It is possible that the patient’s perception of his life situation had not changed as he continued to receive support in managing daily life and he may not have recognised improvement in his neuropsychiatric symptoms in relation to his quality of life. In considering this aspect, we have recognised that for future cases, use of both the self-rated QoL-AD and proxy-rated QoL-AD questionnaire versions may be more able to demonstrate improvement in quality of life when taking into account both patient and family perspectives equally; however, it is has been noted that self-rated and proxy-rated questionnaires may not be inter-reliable for score levels. 32\n\n【50】An increase in socialisation with neighbours and the community was also noted. The patient’s relationships with family members have improved. His wife now comes down to have a meal with the patient every day and joins in with therapy sessions from time to time. The patient likes to chat with the neighbours and enjoyed attending a party held by ex-colleagues. So far, the second care assistant has been managing well for the last 3 months since his employment in August 2018. The family decided to stop the dementia service at the end of November 2018 because of the significant improvements in the patient’s neuropsychiatric symptoms and level of overall improvement. The family’s plan was to see what would happen thereafter under the family and care assistant’s care. As part of our usual approach to care in this situation, our team advised the patient’s family they would be available if the patient was to require the services in the programme again in the future.\n\n【51】Discussion\n----------\n\n【52】There are international efforts to promote the use of non-pharmacological interventions as first-line treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, 3 9 33 supported by a growing body of evidence for benefit. 3 6 8–10 12 However, most of the studies assessed focus on patients in long-term care facilities rather than community-based or home-based strategies. There have been some home-based intervention studies focused on potential triggers of patient behaviours and behaviour modification strategies, 13 interventions around environment and patient abilities, 14 and tailored activities, 15 which were delivered in person and telephonically by occupational therapists and nurse practitioners. 13–15 The studies were carried out over 16 weeks or 4 months of the applied intervention period during which there was a demonstrated reduction in the frequency of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and associated caregiver distress. 13–15 Models of care that focus on individualised approaches to promote self-determination have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. 3 With regards to the patient in this case report, we observed the reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms within 3 months of starting the programme, which would be in line with the expected time frame based on the noted studies. 13–15 The dementia service programme and interventions provided to the patient in this case report differ in that they are all delivered in person and can be delivered in resource-poor settings by other allied healthcare professionals such as social workers and healthcare assistants who receive relevant training. The programme has a multicomponent, structured approach which includes initial person-centred assessment on needs, environment and potential behaviour triggers; education of the family, caregivers and community on dementia care and management; and a personalised, one-on-one programme of selected non-pharmacological intervention sessions. We acknowledge that the observation of associated improved neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia in one patient without a control case does warrant speculation; however, these observations have prompted the initiation of further methodological research into this approach.\n\n【53】While clinically, there is a lack of available definitive testing and confirmation of dementia subtype in China, the programme of dementia services discussed in this case can be implemented for symptom-based management in resource-poor settings. This case demonstrates that using an individualised approach to implementing non-pharmacological interventions in the patient’s own home can have a noticeable associated improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. In turn, there was a related perceived improvement in family dynamics and caregiver stress based on verbal reports from the family and care assistant. At the time of this programme was provided to this patient, the team did not have any instruments in place to specifically measure caregiver burden. However, there was a daily behaviour record maintained and the social worker included in the service notes feedback from the family members and care assistant on how the changes were affecting them. The environment and stressors in the patient’s home had improved to such an extent that the wife who had previously had to move upstairs to a different flat due to the challenges posed by his neuropsychiatric symptoms, was able to move back downstairs to be with her husband again. However, it was a valuable lesson to learn at the time that we should monitor the caregiver burden both qualitatively and quantitatively. Subsequent to this case, our programmes now include instruments to measure caregiver stress and burden and additional tools to monitor behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.\n\n【54】With the anticipated increased burden of dementia on healthcare facilities and long-term care, 34 35 there is a crucial need for further trials and guidance on the effective implementation of non-pharmacological interventions, particularly in the patient’s own home. We recognise the need for further such research and future trials to document the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for dementia such as the programme presented in the context of this case. As the work worldwide in the context of this structured approach to non-pharmacological dementia care is in developmental stages, and no trials are yet available, the observation and monitoring of outcomes on a case by case basis could provide a useful stepping stone to further development and rigorous trials in non-pharmacological dementia interventions.\n\n【55】### Learning points\n\n【56】*   A non-pharmacological intervention programme for symptoms of dementia implemented in the patient’s own home can help improve neuropsychiatric symptoms.\n    \n*   Education of family members and caregivers on dementia and practical, simple ways to implement daily reality orientation can help manage neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia.\n    \n*   Monitoring dementia programme outcomes should include parameters for both the patient and the caregivers in order to qualitatively and quantitatively measure behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, quality of life and caregiver burden and stress.\n    \n\n【57】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【58】The authors would like to thank Charles Young and Zara Quail for their editorial oversight and input.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Common trigger factors include paediatric mandibular trauma, middle ear infection or traumatic childbirth. Although diminishing in incidence among urban population, it is still prevalent in the underprivileged world. Substandard child safety norms, delayed presentation, lack of access to specialties like maxillofacial surgery in rural areas and absence of follow-up contribute to ankylosis. Afflictions in ankylosis are multipronged, involving aesthetic, functional, psychological and nutritional implications to name a few. The damage this pathology causes to the young mind and their morale is humongous. Although well documented, a complete presentation of cases with follow-up till oral and myofascial rehabilitation is seldom reported. This paper describes multidisciplinary management of a young female patient with temporomandibular joint ankylosis. Staged management commencing from interpositional arthroplasty until dental restoration with a 2-year follow-up is presented in this paper.\n\n【2】*   dentistry and oral medicine\n*   plastic and reconstructive surgery\n*   healthcare improvement and patient safety\n*   oral and maxillofacial surgery\n\n【3】http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-245120\n\n【4】Statistics from Altmetric.com\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】*   dentistry and oral medicine\n*   plastic and reconstructive surgery\n*   healthcare improvement and patient safety\n*   oral and maxillofacial surgery\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis is a punitive disorder predominantly affecting children from the rural or suburban background. The condition involves fusion of the mandibular condyle to the glenoid fossa causing restricted mouth opening and facial disharmony. It is often a delayed complication of mandibular trauma or middle ear infection in early life, which is neglected without adequate follow-up after managing the acute phase. 1–3 Compromised child safety norms leading to paediatric injuries and uncertain pattern of long-term review that exist in the underdeveloped areas largely contribute to this situation. 4 Goals of management include achieving mouth opening, restoring facial form and facilitating oral hygiene. 5–7 But often, patients are either not reporting during the early stages or lost for follow-up once mouth opening is achieved, sidelining the other aspects. The authors in this study have encountered delayed presentation as late as 3–4 decades of living with ankylosis. Treatment protocols for managing TMJ ankylosis are well established in literature depending on the age of presentation, but seldom do they include oral and myofascial rehabilitation. 2 3 5 6 8–10 It is of the authors’ contention that a protocol be formulated keeping in mind long-term implications and quality of life following treatment of TMJ ankylosis.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A 35-year-old woman from a rural background reported to us with inability to open mouth and an unpleasant facial profile that had developed over the last 25 years ( figures 1–3 ). She was accompanied by her mother who gave a history of apparent ear infection when she was 6 which had been managed using oral medications at the rural peripheral health centre. The current appearance and mouth opening issues has been progressively developing a few years after this incident. The patient’s family was undergoing psychological trauma due to alienation by the society considering her condition as a curse. They were unaware that the condition could be treated till recently when a medical camp was conducted in their area.\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 1\n\n【13】Preoperative frontal view.\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】Figure 2\n\n【17】Preoperative side profile view.\n\n【18】<img/>\n\n【19】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【20】Figure 3\n\n【21】Preoperative dental status, occlusion and mouth opening.\n\n【22】In spite of nil mouth opening, the patient appeared healthy and fairly nourished. Local examination revealed a typical ‘bird facies’ appearance with severe mandibular retrusion (convex facial profile, obtuse chin-throat angle. A thorough oral examination was obviously not possible at that moment, although severe crowding and gross carious lesions were evident.\n\n【23】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【24】Orthopantomogram was obtained at the preliminary visit. Distorted morphology of the TMJ due to ankylosis was evident bilaterally, including shortened mandibular ramus, prominent antigonial notching and elongated coronoid process. Multiple root stumps and teeth with carious lesions were also meticulously documented for treatment prioritisation once comfortable mouth opening is achieved.\n\n【25】CT scans of 0.3 mm slices were obtained for analysis and fabrication of skull models. This helped us plan for distraction osteogenesis. Monofocal external pin fixated distractor devices were rehearsed over the skull model ( figure 4 ) and the trial osteotomy was performed.\n\n【26】<img/>\n\n【27】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【28】Figure 4\n\n【29】Model for surgical planning.\n\n【30】Airway assessment included volumetric analysis from CT scans and a polysomnography, both of which confirmed diminished upper airway space and obstructive sleep apnoea.\n\n【31】Finally, the standard laboratory workup as for any other elective surgery in an otherwise healthy young adult was ordered.\n\n【32】Treatment\n---------\n\n【33】The surgical problem list included bilaterally ankylosed TMJ, anteroposteriorly deficient mandible and a resultant diminution of upper airway space. Poor oral hygiene due to long-term trismus was evident following limited direct visualisation and orthopantomogram.\n\n【34】The treatment was executed in stages involving interpositional arthroplasty, mandibular distraction osteogenesis, genioplasty and dental and oral myofascial rehabilitation using a combination of implants and fixed partial crowns, bridges and guiding elastics.\n\n【35】Endotracheal intubation was achieved using blind nasal technique with regional anaesthesia. TMJs were exposed using a preauricular approach with temporal extension as described by Al-Kayat and Bramley. 11 The ankylotic mass was resected along with the coronoid process bilaterally and a mouth opening of 45 mm was achieved on table ( figure 5 ). A partial thickness temporalis myofascial flap was used as an interpositional material to prevent recurrence ( figure 6 ). Subsequently, mandibular body and angle regions were exposed using submandibular incisions. Osteotomies were performed as planned in the preoperative sessions and monofocal pin-fixated external mandibular distractors were secured ( figure 6 ). Care was taken to prevent any damage to the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle during osteotomy. The patient was extubated comfortably and recovery was uneventful. After a latency period of 5 days, distractor devices were activated bilaterally in 12 hourly intervals achieving about 1 mm of distraction per day. 12 Mandibular advancement of 25 mm was achieved by distraction following which a 3-month period was allowed for consolidation of the callus ( figure 7 ). Second stage involved distractor device removal, advancement genioplasty, extraction of teeth with poor prognosis and placement of dental implants ( figures 8–10 ). This was performed together under general anaesthesia. Endotracheal intubation was much easier during this stage due to adequate mouth opening and an advanced mandible as against the initial stage. Prosthodontic phase of the implants and final finishing were completed as outpatient procedures during subsequent visits ( figures 11 and 12 ).\n\n【36】<img/>\n\n【37】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【38】Figure 5\n\n【39】Achievement of 45 mm mouth opening after release of ankylosis.\n\n【40】<img/>\n\n【41】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【42】Figure 6\n\n【43】Interposition of temporalis myofascial flap and fixation of mandibular distractor.\n\n【44】<img/>\n\n【45】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【46】Figure 7\n\n【47】Completion of distraction phase.\n\n【48】<img/>\n\n【49】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【50】Figure 8\n\n【51】Completed extraction of infection root stumps.\n\n【52】<img/>\n\n【53】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【54】Figure 9\n\n【55】Placement of implants and completion of endodontic therapy for salvageable teeth.\n\n【56】<img/>\n\n【57】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【58】Figure 10\n\n【59】Full arch mandibular implants.\n\n【60】<img/>\n\n【61】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【62】Figure 11\n\n【63】Mandibular dental rehabilitation completed.\n\n【64】<img/>\n\n【65】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【66】Figure 12\n\n【67】Maxillary dental rehabilitation completed.\n\n【68】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【69】The patient has been on follow-up for 2 years now with optimal mouth opening of 35 mm ( figure 13 ) and diminished snoring.

Incidence of ankylosis has reduced in the developed countries but not proportionate to that of the underprivileged world. 2 13 Although treatment goals include achieving mouth opening, restoring facial symmetry and offering oral rehabilitation, studies on ankylosis seldom report the final phase of management. Diverse child safety norms, paediatric mandibular trauma, middle ear infection, awareness of maxillofacial surgery as a specialty, multidisciplinary approach, psychosocial impact of facial asymmetry and long term follow-up are the key aspects of ankylosis for detailed discussion in this paper.\n\n【84】It is not uncommon for children to present with acute middle ear infections and the condition is manageable at general practitioners’ level with supportive therapy and antibiotic cover. 1–3 But, worsening mouth opening and diminishing oral intake in a child who has had an episode of middle ear infection in the past is a cause for concern that can be identified predominantly by a dental or maxillofacial surgeon. Although a considerable number of graduates specialise to become maxillofacial surgeons annually, these specialists are a luxurious commodity in rural and suburban areas. This is due to uneven settlement across geographical boundaries and more concentration of surgeons at the urban areas for obvious reasons. Although treated for middle ear infection at the age of 6 and suffering from progressive diminution of mouth opening in the subsequent period, our patient had spent two decades of her life with nil mouth opening before even considering the option of specialist consultation.\n\n【85】Mandibular trauma in early life is another common cause for TMJ ankylosis. Chin trauma results in transmission of kinetic energy towards the richly vascular mandibular condyle causing haemarthrosis. 1 This unlocks a cascade of osteogenic events leading to uncontrolled bone deposition in the joints resulting in progressive restriction of mouth opening. A child travelling in a two wheeler, especially seated in front of the rider is a common sight in many rural areas. Additionally, it is not universal norm for all passengers to wear helmet and these children take the brunt of impact in case of a road traffic accident. Although such trauma would be received at the regional health centres, it is often the more severe or life-threatening injuries which are attended to and injuries with long-term implications like condylar concussion and haemarthrosis are often neglected.\n\n【86】Preliminary challenge in surgical management of TMJ ankylosis is anaesthesia, due to factors like retrusion of mandible, restriction of pharyngeal space, apparent macroglossia and trismus to name a few. 9 14 There are still undocumented instances of ankylosis release under sedation and local anaesthesia to rapidly achieve mouth opening following which the patient gets intubated for completion of the planned procedure. Although primitive, these methods have been justified in setups which are far from being equipped both in terms of distance and time period. Fiberoptic laryngoscope is a luxury for endotracheal intubation in such cases, which our team did not enjoy. Hence, ‘awake blind nasal intubation’ was performed and patient was positioned for surgery.\n\n【87】Surgical protocol for management of ankylosis is described in detail by Kaban. 2 Simultaneous release of ankylosis and distraction of the micrognathic mandible is an option proposed to alleviate the need for multiple operative interventions and achieve aesthetic and functional goals in single stage. 15 16 But as with any other algorithm, the technique has its own disadvantages, which our team was prepared to sideline, considering the socioeconomic situation of our patient. Hence a single stage ankylosis release and mandibular lengthening was performed bilaterally in this case. Distraction osteogenesis involves osteotomy of the mandible and fixation of the distractor device which can be activated after 3–5 days of latency period in the postoperative phase. 12 Activation is performed on a fixed rate and rhythm to achieve lengthening. Once the desired length is achieved, activation is stalled and the elongated bone is allowed to consolidate for a period of 12–16 weeks. Device removal can be planned at the end of this consolidation period. The final position of the mandible after complete distraction will dictate the amount of chin advancement. Hence, genioplasty was performed as a second procedure combined with distractor removal, dental extractions and implants.\n\n【88】Psychosocial aspects must be one of the main considerations when dealing with facial asymmetry, which in the authors’ opinion is trilateral for patients suffering with ankylosis. Inability to open the mouth and chew food are as demoralising as having a disfigured face. Masticatory dynamics is only as good as the condition of teeth, periodontium and the alveolar process. With prolonged periods of nil mouth opening as in our patient, it becomes almost impossible to ensure oral health, leading to a deterioration of masticatory efficacy. A comprehensive dental status evaluation was done and a separate plan was charted out for rehabilitation. Accordingly, extraction of multiple root stumps, restoration of the salvageable ones and replacement of missed teeth were completed over the subsequent visits. Restoration of oral environment does not instantly increase full functionality, since it was dormant for two decades. A diet plan was charted out, starting with soft semisolid diet progressing to solid and fibrous food over the next few weeks for periodontal stimulation. 17 18 Additionally, the myofascial imbalance causes by sudden mouth opening and use of temporalis muscle as a flap needs to be restored in a similar phased manner. This was completed using masticatory muscle training and intermaxillary guiding elastics.\n\n【89】Successful treatment for ankylosis involves surgical release of ankylosis, restoration of facial form, function and oral health, helping in reinstatement of a confident individual back into the society. The patient reported in this paper landed in a secretarial job and is an ambassador for child safety in her region.\n\n【90】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【91】‘Happy to have regained the ability to consume food of my choice and feel confident to face others at work and off work’.\n\n【92】### Learning points\n\n【93】*   Standard child safety norms must become universal policy across geographical boundaries.\n    \n*   Paediatric maxillofacial surgery should evolve as a superspecialty and become more available in areas of need.\n    \n*   Treatment for temporomandibular joint ankylosis does not end with mouth opening or facial symmetry. It has to culminate in oral rehabilitation and follow-up.\n    \n*   Myofascial training of the face is essential for regaining tone of masticatory muscles after surgical treatment for ankylosis.\n    \n\n【94】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【95】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【96】Obtained.\n\n【97】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【98】The authors would like to acknowledge Prof.Subramonian Sivaraj for surgical collaboration", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

He gave a 6-month history of weight loss and loss of appetite but no specific systemic symptoms. He had not needed to attend his general practitioner in the previous 23 years of living in the UK. He was noted to be markedly cachectic on admission and a chest radiograph demonstrated prominent cannonball metastases ( figure 1 ). He went on to have a CT of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis which confirmed the pulmonary metastases seen on the chest radiograph, and additionally showed splenic deposits, left axillary and hilar lymphadenopathy, but no primary was identified. He was subsequently referred to the multidisciplinary team meeting of unknown primary for further investigation.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Chest radiography demonstrating multiple rounded airspace opacities consistent with ‘cannonball metastases’.\n\n【9】As a redeployed dermatologist due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I walked past his bed and noticed that he was deeply tanned. A full skin examination seemed warranted. Examination of the back revealed three large plasters, under which three suspicious lesions were identified. The largest was a 6×4 cm diameter fungating, skin-coloured, ulcerated plaque on the left upper back, just medial to the scapula ( figure 2 ). Of note, there were ill-defined mid-dark brown areas (see arrows) suggestive of a pigment network. In addition, there were two 2×1.5 cm ulcers with a raised edge on the left lower back and right shoulder. On specific questioning, he described the largest lesion starting as a small brown mark that grew rapidly to its present size over approximately 1 year. It was extremely uncomfortable and he was keen to have it removed, despite declining all other medical therapy. He admitted he was an avid sun worshipper and had never used any sun protection all his life.\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Fungating erythematous 6×4 cm plaque with irregular foci of mid-dark brown pigmentation, medial to the left scapula.\n\n【14】The lesions were excised and a biopsy taken from the most accessible lymph node in the left axilla. Histology confirmed that the largest lesion (left upper back, figure 2 ) was a nodular malignant melanoma, Breslow thickness 10 mm, with microsatellites. Metastatic melanoma was identified in the left axillary lymph node. Therefore, we can assume that the patient’s widespread metastases arose from the cutaneous malignant melanoma excised from the left upper back, which was the likely primary focus. The two smaller ulcerated skin lesions were confirmed histologically to be infiltrative basal cell carcinomas and were unrelated to his current presentation but also reflect his degree of sun exposure. The patient may have been a candidate for immunotherapy for his metastatic melanoma, but sadly he died a few days after biopsies were taken.\n\n【15】The lung and pleura are the most common sites of visceral metastases from melanoma 1 and autopsy series of patients with late-stage melanoma show lung metastases in >85% of patients. 2 Cannonball metastases are commonly associated with beta-human chorionic gonadotropin-secreting tumours, 3 but rarely seen in the context of malignant melanoma. There are only three previous reports of melanoma presenting with cannonball metastases, all of which describe a challenge in identifying the primary source. 4–6 One report describes a history of melanoma removal 4 and another only non-pigmented nodules as clues to the malignant origin. 5\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】*   The skin is the largest and most visible organ, easily lending itself to examination and must not be forgotten in patients presenting with metastatic cancer of unknown primary.\n    \n*   Malignant melanoma can uncommonly present with cannonball metastases.\n    \n*   Late-stage melanomas can unusually present as fungating tumours, with only minimal pigment network that can provide a clue to the diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Association of fundal coloboma with FEVR has only been reported once in the literature. 7 FEVR is a hereditary disorder linked to genes affecting Wingless/Int1 (Wnt) signalling pathway. 8 Wnt signalling pathway plays a pivotal role in vascular morphogenesis in the eye. 9 Genetic deletion of LRP6 (LDL receptor related protein 6) has shown to attenuate Bmp and retinoic acid signalling gene activation in the dorsal optic cup, resulting in the alteration of the expression of dorsal and ventral neuroretinal markers. This can lead to ocular axis defects and ocular coloboma formation. 10 On the other hand, Lrp6 has been implicated to play a critical role in Wnt signalling pathway. 11 Thus, disruption of the Wnt pathway can explain the coexistence of FEVR and fundal colobomain our patient. 12 The presence of vasculopathy in association with the fundal coloboma can also explain the tractional component noted in our patient.\n\n【16】To the best of our knowledge, bilateral symmetrical atypical fundal coloboma with temporal dragging of disc and macula with peripapillary neurosensory detachment with peripheral angiogenesis have not been reported in the literature till date.\n\n【17】### Learning points\n\n【18】*   Bilateral atypical fundal coloboma with temporal iris coloboma is a rare finding.\n    \n*   Coexistence of abnormal peripheral vasculogenesis with coloboma is in itself a rare finding with Wnt pathway disruption as a probable link between the two entities.\n    \n*   We would like to emphasise the importance of ultrawide field angiography in such patients with poor central fixation to evaluate peripheral anatomical changes.\n    \n\n【19】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【20】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【21】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

On inspection, the area of discomfort was localised in the region of teeth #36 and #37. There was mild erythema and swelling in the region. There was no facial swelling, cervical lymphadenopathy or trismus on physical examination. Intra-oral examination did not reveal tenderness, pus discharge, bleeding or any other secondary symptoms. A composite restoration was noticed on tooth #37. The patient had a history of surgical removal of tooth #38 6 months prior. Panoramic radiograph did not show any significant findings. The patient was advised to maintain good oral hygiene and gargle with saltwater three times per day for 2 weeks. A review was scheduled after 2 weeks during which the patient did not report any change in the symptoms. A Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) was advised, which revealed a small radio-opaque area in the gingival soft tissue overlying in the alveolus lateral to teeth #36 and #37 ( figure 1 ).\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】(A) Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) of the patient, green arrow pointing to the foreign body between teeth #36 and #37.

An inferior alveolar nerve block was administered using 2% lidocaine with 1:100 000 epinephrine. A modified wards incision was placed, and the flap was carefully reflected, not to displace the foreign body. A white coloured material was observed after careful exploration in between teeth #36 and #37 ( figure 2 ). The material was seen to be embedded between the periosteal layer and the bone. The foreign body was then removed cautiously, and the site was irrigated well with saline. The flap was secured with simple interrupted sutures using (3-0) silk.

Ischial bursitis is an inflammation of the ischial bursa and fluid collection and associated changes in the hamstring muscle complex (HMC). The ischial bursa lies near the ischial tuberosity, protected by the gluteus maximus muscle during extension; however, this protective covering is lost during sitting position and is sandwiched between the ischial tuberosity and external surface. The ischial tuberosity is an important landmark that provides attachment to the HMC. The HMC comprises of biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus. 1 The HMC is the active extensor of the pelvis and flexor of the knee, making it highly prone to sprain and injuries as it involves various complex movements across the hip and knee joints. Diagnosis in early stage and prompt treatment can prevent further damage and tears of HMC. The diagnosis of ischial bursitis is often missed due to its rarity and non-specific symptoms. The symptoms include pain in the buttock, posterior thigh, perineum, difficulty getting up and local swelling. The diagnosis is usually made clinically; however, ultrasound or MRI is advisable for confirmation. 2 The MRI is the ideal imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude the differentials. The MRI scan typically shows fluid-filled distended bursa with additional abnormalities in the HMC. The treatment for this entity includes analgesics, cold therapy, rest, fractional massage and therapeutic stretch exercises.\n\n【5】A 55-year-old woman presented with pain in bilateral gluteal regions for the last 6 months. Pain aggravated over the previous 2 months. She complained of difficulty in changing position from sitting to standing and vice versa. Vital parameters were normal at the time of presentation. On local examination, there was tenderness over bilateral gluteal regions. The active flexion movements at the knee were restricted. She was advised for radiographs of bilateral hip and sacroiliac joints, which were unremarkable. For further evaluation, she underwent MRI of bilateral hip joints, including the pelvis. The MRI revealed abnormal increased fluid intensity signals in ischial bursae on both sides and loss of normal hypointense signals in the tendons of hamstring muscles ( figure 1A,B ). The tendons had wavy contours with increased fluid signal intensities representing chronic microtears ( figures 2A, B and 3 ). The final diagnosis of ischial bursitis with chronic HMC tendinopathy was made and she was prescribed physiotherapy and analgesics for her ailments.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Unenhanced MRI images of the pelvis in the axial plane.

Although staging bone marrow showed a low population (0.2%) of cells with a possible ALK+LBCL immunophenotype, overall there was a lack of distinctive morphological features to confirm involvement. He was treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisolone (CHOP) chemotherapy, without rituximab. 4 Positron emission tomography scan after completion of six cycles of CHOP chemotherapy showed no residual disease activity, implying complete metabolic remission. At the time of writing, almost 10 months after his initial presentation, our patient has had no episodes of relapse and remains on regular follow-up with the haematology team.\n\n【21】### Learning points\n\n【22】*   Anaplastic lymphoma kinase+large B-cell lymphoma is a very rare and aggressive lymphoma with characteristic morphology and immunophenotype.\n    \n*   These tumours are usually negative for CD20 antigen and are thus unlikely to be responsive to rituximab.\n    \n\n【23】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【24】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【25】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【26】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【27】The authors would like to thank Mr Samuel J.

Her parents noticed that these behaviours would often be triggered when she was introduced to a new place or left alone in her room. She also had insomnia. During examination, the child appeared distracted and could not form meaningful eye contact. She was crying as she was entering the consultation room. She repeatedly placed her palms over her mouth, sometimes licking her palms (see video 1 ). There was also an increasing frequency of hitting one hand with another palm of her hand. She was not able to verbalise any comprehensible words. Antenatally, her conception was unexpected, as her mother had earlier performed bilateral tubal ligation after her fifth delivery. There was evidence of intrauterine growth retardation, but she was born at term via elective caesarean section, weighing only 2 kg. She then developed severe neonatal jaundice and received phototherapy. She developed epilepsy when she was three year-old, which was controlled with syrup epilim 200 mg twice a day. Her last seizure was one year before the psychiatric contact. She had hypothyroidism when she was four year-old, controlled with oral L-thyroxine 25 mcg once a day. There were gross motor, fine motor, and social communication development delays. There is no family history of neurodevelopmental problems. Following psychiatric assessment, the child was diagnosed with intellectual disability (ID) with autistic features. This diagnosis was based on the marked social communication deficits and stereotypical patterns of behaviours that were similar to stimming in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) developed recently. She was prescribed oral risperidone 0.5 mg at night, with which her sleep and disruptive behaviours improved.\n\n【5】Video 1 Repetitive behaviours of the child in the clinic.\n\n【6】A child with GDD may also be diagnosed with ASD. The child in this report had multiple congenital and neonatal issues, which predisposed her to GDD. 1 Furthermore, children with GDD who have lower developmental levels are more likely to have autistic features. 2 Children with ASD and GDD have lower than expected abilities in ‘learning, language and communication, eye and hand coordination, socio-emotional and gross motor’. 3 The lack of early development of socialisation and communication skills and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviours helps to discriminate children with ASD from children with GDD without autistic features. 4 On the contrary, a typical GDD child is less likely to engage in repetitive behaviours and will respond more appropriately during social interactions, unlike the illustrated child. The prevalence of comorbidity rate of ASD in children with GDD is as high as 62.3%. 2 As children with GDD or ID frequently have comorbid medical diagnoses such as epilepsy and muscle spasticity, genetic testing has been advocated. 5 However, choosing such an investigation might not be cost-effective in developing countries.\n\n【7】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【8】“We have resorted to applying medicated oil on her hand to prevent her from using it to hit hear head, and also putting on gloves, but these were unsuccessful” – from the child’s mother.\n\n【9】### Learning points\n\n【10】*   Clinicians may find diagnosing autism spectrum disorder(ASD) in a child with globally developmentally delay (GDD) an arduous task.\n    \n*   A child having both features of GDD and ASD may present with more challenging disruptive behaviours requiring aggressive pharmacotherapeutic interventions.\n    \n*   Managing disruptive behaviours in children on the spectrum requires a collaborative approach with parents and families.\n    \n\n【11】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【12】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【13】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The lesion was 7×4 mm in size. The mass was slightly tender on palpation, firm and not bleeding on manipulation. The remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Under general anaesthesia, the patient underwent the removal of the lesion. The histopathological examination showed, at the H&E staining, a parakeratinised stratified squamous epithelium with enlarged blood vessels ( figure 1B ). Connective tissue revealed numerous large dilated blood-filled spaces lined by endothelial cells encircled by a chronic inflammatory infiltrate ( figure 1C ). Lymphatic vessels dilatation was also present ( figure 1D ). The final diagnosis of solitary angiokeratoma of the tongue was obtained.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】(A) Clinical picture showing the isolated swelling of the tongue.

It has been reported congenital origin due to an overlying arteriovenous fistula, or traumatic pathogenesis with the onset of lymphangioma localised after local injuries. 3 Usually, the lesion appears as well-demarcated swelling due to a large dilated blood vessel located in the subcutaneous tissue. The male/female ratio is 2:1. In the great part of cases, angiokeratoma appears as dark-red or blue-black, macular/papular lesions, which do not blanch on pressure. Oral involvement is frequently seen in syndromes such as Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, Cobb syndrome and other mixed vascular malformations. 3 Only eight cases of isolated angiokeratoma of the tongue in adult patients have been reported in the literature. 2 To date, only four cases of angiokeratoma circumscriptum of the oral cavity in children have been described in the literature. 4–6\n\n【10】Usually, the lesions are present since birth, but in some cases, may occur during childhood as in other cases and even in adulthood, especially in the case of traumatic aetiology. The natural course is usually benign, the only clinical features may be bleeding, discomfort or cosmetic alterations. Angiokeratoma appears in the oral cavity, often associated with systemic diseases and represents multiple papules in buccal mucosa and tongue causing dysphagia or drooling; but in our case, the patient has cystic fibrosis, which, upon reviewing the literature, seems not to have any relationship with the angiokeratoma. 5 In our case, the lesion was solitary and there were no other lesions on the skin or in the oral cavity. The main differential diagnoses are haemangioma, lymphangioma and malignant melanoma.\n\n【11】Angiokeratoma may be treated with complete surgical excision, cryotherapy or laser ablation and no surgical complications have been reported in the literature or in our patient. 6 7 Usually, no recurrences have been described but, recent reports suggest the possibility of a recurrence. 7 In our case, after surgical excision, no recurrence is found after a 2-year follow-up. Isolated angiokeratoma of the tongue is a rare disease in children and, in most cases, this lesion may have a syndromic aetiology. Surgery is the treatment of choice to resolve both symptoms and histopathological diagnosis.\n\n【12】### Patient's perspective\n\n【13】I am very happy about the care received by my son.

Physical examination revealed a fluid wave and anasarca. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated large volume ascites, varices, splenomegaly and a large substernal fluid collection ( figure 1A ). The patient did not have a pleural effusion. A paracentesis removed 7.0 L of sterile hepatic ascites (serum albumin 3.0 g/dL, ascitic albumin 1.2 g/dL, ascitic protein 1.7 g/dL). A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained to further characterise the fluid collection and showed a 70% left ventricular ejection fraction and a 2.8 cm loculated pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology ( figure 2 ). During emergent pericardiocentesis, a bubble study conducted to confirm needle placement revealed translocation of bubbles from the pericardial to the peritoneal space suggesting the presence of a fistula. The pericardial fluid had identical levels of albumin and protein compared with the ascites suggesting hepatic hydropericardium. The pericardial effusion and ascites recurred with further suggestion of a connecting fistula on CT scan ( figure 3A,B ).\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Initial sagittal CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast demonstrated a 11.3×3.8×3.0 cm pericardial effusion (bracket) and moderate volume ascites (arrow) prior to pericardiocentesis and paracentesis.\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Initial transthoracic echocardiogram subxiphoid view showed ascites (arrowhead) and the loculated anterior pericardial effusion (asterisk) with tamponade physiology (arrow) (A).

An additional sagittal plane demonstrated a suspected right anterior diaphragmatic defect (arrow) adjacent to a surgical clip (dashed arrow), suggestive of a fistulous tract between the peritoneum and pericardium (B).\n\n【18】Due to refractory ascites and pericardial effusion, the patient underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement (TIPS). The portosystemic gradient was reduced from 19 to 10 mm Hg. His volume status significantly improved. He was discharged on oral furosemide and spironolactone. Repeat imaging showed resolution of ascites and a smaller, 1.7 cm loculated pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology.\n\n【19】Two years prior, the patient experienced viral pneumonia complicated by pericarditis, cardiac tamponade and inflammatory pleural effusions, which resolved after pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement and thoracentesis. After discharge, the patient experienced persistent dyspnoea due to suspected constrictive pericarditis. Cardiac catheterisation diagnosed constrictive cardiomyopathy. Pericardiectomy was performed 4 months prior to the current admission. Pathology demonstrated chronic inflammation and fibrosis.\n\n【20】Hepatic hydropericardium represents a rare complication of end-stage liver disease. Fistulous tracts between the peritoneal cavity and the pericardium allow the development of pericardial effusions catalysed by portal hypertension and hypervolemia. 1 Typically, patients with cirrhosis have preceding hepatic hydrothorax associated with fistula formation; however, trauma, cardiothoracic surgery and inflammatory pericarditis have also been implicated. 1–4 The patient’s presentation is unique since a fistula formed without evidence of hepatic hydrothorax. Rather, his prior cardiothoracic surgeries and inflammatory pericardial disease likely contributed to fistula development. The progression of his liver disease then likely caused the pericardial effusion via portal hypertension.\n\n【21】Traditionally, radionucleotide scan demonstrating a connection between the peritoneal cavity and pericardium diagnoses hepatic hydropericardium. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case where pericardiocentesis with bubble study provided visual diagnosis via bubble transit. The identical fluid studies confirmed the connection. Temporising procedures for hepatic hydropericardium include pericardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement; however, definitive management requires either TIPS or liver transplant. 3 4 Loculation of the pericardial effusion, due to chronicity or inflammation, likely prevented complete resolution.\n\n【22】### Learning points\n\n【23】*   Hepatic hydropericardium is a rare decompensation of cirrhosis caused by portal hypertension and peritoneal–pericardial fistula formation potentiated by inflammatory pericardial and pleural diseases, cardiothoracic surgery and trauma.\n    \n*   When conducted with bubble study, pericardiocentesis can identify peritoneal–pericardial fistula formation.\n    \n*   Transhepatic portosystemic shunt placement can alleviate hepatic hydropericardium via reduction in portal pressure.\n    \n\n【24】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【25】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【26】Consent obtained from next of kin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Surgery was complicated with a pharyngocutaneous fistula repaired with a deltopectoral flap. Four months later, adjuvant chemotherapy (docetaxel/carboplatin-based regimen) was started. Three days after receiving the first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy, he complained of an itchy rash that started on his neck and expanded to his face, chest and back that did not respond to topical emollients or topical steroids. On examination, there were 4–6 mm erythematous, exophytic papules and pustules on his face, neck, shoulders, upper chest and back ( figure 1 ). Laboratory work-up was unremarkable including a negative HIV screen. The dermatology department was consulted, and chemotherapy-induced drug reaction versus Sweet’s syndrome versus less likely disseminated skin infection was the main differential diagnosis. A skin biopsy showed diffuse neutrophilic infiltrates consistent with Sweet’s syndrome ( figure 2 ). He was started on high-dose steroids with gradual improvement of his skin lesions. He was discharged with plans to taper his steroid dose as an outpatient.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Erythematous, exophytic papules and pustules on his face, neck, upper chest, back and shoulders.\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Skin biopsy sections display focal Parakeratosis overlying a moderately spongiotic epidermis. Within the dermis, there is a dense interstitial infiltrate comprised predominantly of neutrophils and lymphocytes. In the centre portion of the specimen, a disrupted follicular structure is present.\n\n【13】Drug-induced Sweet’s syndrome is a hypertensive reaction characterised by abrupt onset of painful erythematous nodules, papules and plaques or pustular dermatosis usually affecting the face, neck and upper extremities, histopathological evidence of dense neutrophilic dermal infiltrates without evident leucocytoclastic vasculitis, a temporal relation between drug ingestion and clinical presentation and resolution of symptoms after drug withdrawal or treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Fever is the most frequent clinical sign of Sweet’s syndrome and may precede skin lesions by a day or weeks but fever in 10%–20% of cases may be absent. Corticosteroids are the standard treatment, and clinical improvement can be seen within days. Rarely, in cases of corticosteroids failure, other alternative therapies such as dapsone, potassium iodide, colchicine, indomethacin, clofazimine, α-interferon, naproxen and ciclosporin can be used. 1 We present a case of drug-induced Sweet’s syndrome in a man with a known solid tumour diagnosis. There was a temporal relationship between chemotherapy exposure and the abrupt asymmetrical onset of erythematous nodules. He had no prior history of exposure to the inciting chemotherapy regimen or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment. On review of his medications, he had not been exposed to other medications associated with Sweet’s syndrome. 2 Local bacterial infection of the lesions was also ruled out by negative tissue culture. Sweet’s syndrome could also present as a manifestation of disease recurrence or as a paraneoplastic finding of established cancer. 1 Sweet’s syndrome is mostly associated with haematological malignancies or if present in solid cancer, it is mostly associated with adenocarcinoma. 3 This patient had a history of recurrent laryngeal cancer recurrence, yet the onset of the rash coincided with drug initiation.

The details of this case can revolutionise our understanding of this degenerative disorder.\n\n【6】A previously healthy toddler presented with respiratory distress associated with gallop heart rhythm. An echocardiogram showed a dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction and an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%, which was consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy. Genetic testing was positive for autosomal recessive nebulin-related anchoring protein (NRAP) gene-related cardiomyopathy. Her course was complicated by respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock and acute kidney injury. Subsequently, she stabilised and had mild improvement of her EF to 40% and was discharged on oral heart failure medications. Within 1 week of her discharge, she was readmitted with cardiogenic shock. At this stage, her echocardiogram showed increasing evidence for an echogenic basal and mid-septum that mimicked the picture of an ischaemic myocardium. Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) was performed to determine if the function of this specific area was impaired compared with the rest of the myocardium. STE showed near-normal strain in four segments of the left ventricle in the four-chamber view and demonstrated that the driving force of myocardial hypokinesia in this patient was basal and mid-septal, with preserved function in the remainder of the segments ( videos 1 and 2 ).\n\n【7】Video 1 Two-dimensional echocardiography showing echogenic basal and mid-septal areas.\n\n【8】Video 2 Severe hypokinesia of the basal and mid-septal areas demonstrated by STE. AAL:, apical anterolateral, AIS:, apical interventricular septum, BAL:, basal anterolateral, BIS:, basal interventricular septum, MAL:, mid- anterolateral, MIS:, mid- interventricular septum, STE:, speckle tracking echocardiography.\n\n【9】NRAP is a protein mainly expressed in skeletal muscles and cardiac intercalated discs. 4 5 Given the specific distribution of NRAP in cardiac tissue and the specific histology of the interventricular septum (IVS), the observed pattern of septal hypokinesia cannot be explained solely by the role of NRAP in the myocardium. Intercalated discs, which harbour NRAP, are very scarce in the IVS, accounting for 8% of its whole myocardial content. 6 This distribution should have given priority to lateral wall involvement over the septum. We propose that nebulin and NRAP might have other roles and different cellular distributions. In our case, two-dimensional echocardiography showed an abnormally echogenic basal septum, which is commonly encountered in ischaemic heart disease. STE showed significantly reduced strain in the echogenic segment, consistent with a patchy process. This patchy process might have been triggered by a macrovascular or microvascular event, leading to progressive fibrosis of the basal and mid-septal segments. Notably, cardiac MRI evaluation may offer additional insight due to its ability to better diagnose perfusion abnormalities. However, it could not be performed on our patient due to clinical instability. The role of NRAP in the induction of endothelial dysfunction has not yet been studied; however, similar exclusive myocardial proteins, such as MYH 6, 7 8 accelerate ischaemic cardiomyopathy.\n\n【10】Further investigations are needed to determine if the affected segment is truly ischaemic and whether NRAP has a role in this potential ischaemia.\n\n【11】### Learning points\n\n【12】*   Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDCM) can start as a patchy process, hence the importance of segmental assessment of the myocardial kinetics. The process is especially important in family members with a known genetic cause of dilated cardiomyopathy.\n    \n*   Ischaemia/reperfusion injury could be implicated in the pathogenies of FDCM. Therefore, anticoagulants and antiplatelets are vital therapeutic agents prior to the deterioration of the global myocardial function.\n    \n*   Further research is needed in FDCM to elucidate the exact pathogenic mechanism and role of vascular myocardial damage.\n    \n\n【13】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【14】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【15】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Food intake problems like severe or frequently vomiting may not only affect growth and development, but may also influence the process of learning how to eat and can have a great impact on the whole family. In addition to food intake problems, there is growing evidence that patients with a Noonan syndrome spectrum disorder may have a lower body mass index (BMI) due to a high energy expenditure, although little is known about the actual energy intake patients with a Noonan syndrome spectrum disorder need to maintain a healthy BMI. This article illustrates the challenge to recognise a high energy expenditure especially when a patient frequently vomits. Multidisciplinary attention is needed to manage food intake, vomiting and energy expenditure problems in patients with a Noonan syndrome spectrum disorder.\n\n【2】*   Paediatrics (drugs and medicines)\n*   Gastro-oesophageal reflux\n*   Stomach and duodenum\n*   Genetics\n*   Healthcare improvement and patient safety\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

The most prevalent syndrome is Noonan syndrome (OMIM 163950). The clinical presentation is extremely variable. Other Noonan syndrome spectrum disorders are Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (OMIM 151100), Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair (OMIM 607721), cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (OMIM 115150) and Costello syndrome (OMIM 218040). 1 Key features of these disorders are heart problems and short stature. Several aspects of energy homeostasis problems, like food intake problems, energy expenditure and subsequent effects on growth and development have received less attention. This article aims to illustrate the complexity of food intake difficulties, energy requirement and growth problems. It is important to increase insight into the frequency and origin of these problems among patients with a Noonan syndrome spectrum disorder to develop evidence based guidelines for both food intake and energy expenditure problems.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】### General\n\n【12】The girl was born after 35 <sup>+5 </sup> weeks gestation complicated by polyhydramnios, for which amnion fluid drainage was performed. Birth weight was 3.39 kg (SDS +1.96). In her first year the clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair was confirmed genetically due to a pathogenic _SHOC2_ variant.\n\n【13】After birth it took 14 days for the patient to be able to be bottle-fed. At the age of 8 weeks, the ability of bottle-feeding declined and she was admitted to the hospital. No apparent cause of the bottle refusal could be been found. She was discharged a week later completely dependent on tube-feeding, administered with a syringe (bolus). Initially a bottle was offered before administering the infant formula by tube without any noticeable improvement in feeding behaviour.\n\n【14】At the age of 3 months, she developed vomiting problems with a frequency of 15 to 20 times a day.\n\n【15】A feeding pump was required. Lowering the pump speed to 200 mL/hour had no positive effects.\n\n【16】No anatomical abnormalities were observed by an upper gastrointestinal barium contrast study. pH-metry showed no definite acid gastro-oesophageal reflux. No additional examinations were performed, as bowel movements and defecation patterns were normal. Treatment was started with daily dosages of domperidone without improvement. Ultimately, although the frequency of vomiting continued, the total amount of food intake improved by lowering the pump speed to 50 mL/hour, thereby reducing the volume of the vomit. To ensure an adequate intake, she was fed continuously from 07.00 to 23:00 hour. At the age of 1 year, she received a gastrostomy. After a period of 3 months, the treatment of domperidone was replaced by erythromycin without improvement. The frequency of vomiting did not change until the age of 2 years. Although weight issues remained a concern, testing the calorie intake requirement was not indicated because weight for length remained within the normal ranges ( table 1 ). After the age of 2 years the vomiting frequency lowered to once or twice daily, altered with periods with higher frequencies, mostly coinciding with nose, throat or ear infections. At the age of 3 years and 9 months however her length SDS decreased to −4.08 with a weight for height SDS of −1.0, which stayed more or less the same until the age of 5 years ( table 1 ). At the age of 5 years and 2 weeks, growth hormone therapy started and her length increased significantly. The frequency of the vomiting increased again during a persisting middle ear infection. At the age of 5 years and 3 months the vomiting was successfully treated with ondansetron. To the family, this cure was an important medical milestone, because of the extended effects in terms of attention for the other children, mobility, socially and on providing the possibility for both parents to be able to work.\n\n【17】View this table:\n\n【18】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【19】Table 1\n\n【20】Characteristics of growth and energy intake during the first 13 consecutive years\n\n【21】Several speech therapists have examined her feeding technique over the years. No relevant oral motor problems were found. The cause of the food refusal was established at the age of 6 years and 7 months using clinical psychological interview techniques, questionnaires and behavioural observations. The combination of various negative experiences in the mouth and throat area (the frequent vomiting, recurring ear and throat infections and the nasogastric tube) from a young age most likely have led to negative and physical associations with food. This prevented her from getting motivated to learn how to eat, did increase the fear for food and the consequences it might have, which led to a pattern of avoidance and food refusal behaviour. The patient was diagnosed with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). 2\n\n【22】### Additional problems\n\n【23】Other physical problems of this patient besides haemodynamically not-important heart problems (atrial septal defect of the secundum type and stenosis of the left pulmonary artery) included chronic middle and outer ear, nose and skin infections (buttocks) and eczema. These problems continued from the age of 3 months, with quieter periods in the summer and more issues in the winter periods. The itching causes scratching and an ongoing contamination from one site of infection to the next. The ear infections often coincided with a higher frequency of the vomiting.\n\n【24】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【25】### Detecting a high resting energy expenditure\n\n【26】During the food refusal therapy that started at the age of 6 years and 7 months calorie and fluid intake, amount and type of food were noted daily. Weight (weekly) and length (monthly) were measured. The patient started the treatment with high-calorie tube feeding, which was and remained over 120% of the recommended daily energy allowance ( table 1 ) .\n\n【27】During the eating therapy the transition from tube feeding to oral feeding was performed. Oral feeding diet was held initially at a daily intake of 96 kcal/kg instead of more than 120 kcal/kg/day in the 2 years before. By the time the patient turned 7 years old it was established that her weight did not increase enough with this amount of energy intake. So, at discharge, aged 7 years and 3 months the diet was increased to an intake of 100 kcal/kg per day.\n\n【28】After the eating therapy, following the high calorie diet, she used seven meals a day. Each meal took a considerable amount of time and instructions of the behavioural therapist of the treating specialised feeding clinic were given to all persons involved the care of the patient (nonprofessionals and professionals,for example, teachers, class and day care assistants). The body mass index (BMI) of the patient dropped considerably. From the age of 6.5 to 9 years her average BMI was less than – 1.0 SDS, following the oral diet of approximately 90 kcal/kg/day ( table 1 ).\n\n【29】As can be seen in table 1 , she received an average intake of (far) more than 120% of the recommended daily allowance of energy in her life until now, without gaining sufficient weight in some periods. Additional investigation showed that the high energy requirement was not due to malabsorption. In February 2021 (age 12 y, 8 months) the resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured using an indirect calorimetry (Cosmed Quark RMR with canopy), after an overnight fast according to the Dutch national standard operating procedure. The measured REE was 1915 kcal/day with an respiratory quotient of 0.80, which is within normal ranges. The predictive equations of WHO and Schofield estimated an REE of respectively 1217 kcal/day and 1216 kcal/day. The actual REE was 1.57 higher than the estimated REE, thus confirming the high energy expenditure. Additional blood tests (iron status, vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> and folic acid) were normal. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (Inbody S10 device, Seoul, Korea) showed a decreased value for muscle tissue and an increased value for adipose tissue.\n\n【30】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【31】To unravel the complexity of intake problems, energy requirement and growth problems in this girl the following differential diagnosis was made:\n\n【32】*   Intrinsic feature of Noonan syndrome spectrum disorder: Growth in children with Noonan syndrome is impaired right after birth and only partially associated with feeding problems. In addition, several specific Noonan syndrome spectrum disorder related factors, including the type of gene, seem to influence growth in the first year. 3 This continues thereafter, especially in individuals with certain pathologic gene mutations (including _SHOC2_ ), and BMI scores are lowest in individuals with pathologic _SHOC2_ variants. 4 The cause of short stature in NS is still not clear. Although growth hormone secretion is usually normal, growth hormone deficiency have been described. Partial growth hormone insensitivity is the current hypothesis for short stature in NS, for which many children have been treated with growth hormone. 5\n    \n*   Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: The diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is based primarily on clinical suspicion, which can be strengthened by additional diagnostic investigations. However, there is no single gold standard. 6 An upper gastrointestinal barium contrast study can be used to evaluate anatomic conditions that might mimic or predispose to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease such as oesophageal narrowing, pyloric stenosis, malrotation and duodenal stenosis. Today, there is no sufficient evidence to use pH-metry for the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. This may explain the normal findings in the presented patient.\n    \n\n【33】Feeding problems in patients with a Noonan syndrome spectrum disorder is described in more than 50% of young children. 7 The documented presumed or proven cause was most often gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (68%). Also Shah _et al_ documented gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in more than 40% of children with feeding problems, as well as delayed gastric emptying. 8 Delayed gastric emptying may exacerbate any tendency to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Shah _et al_ postulated that the cause of the feeding problems is a delayed gastrointestinal motor development which may improve with age. 8\n\n【34】Zhong _et al_ postulated a model in which the process of vomiting and nausea is described with various neuroanatomical sites, neurochemicals, receptors and their potential intracellular signalling cascades. 9 The vomiting of the patient in this case study was exclusively treatable with ondansetron, a 5-Hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist. Enterochromaffin (EC) cells of the gastrointestinal tract synthesise 95% of the body 5-HT and release 5-HT in response to mechanical or chemical stimulation. EC cell 5-HT has physiological effects on gut motility, secretion and visceral sensation. It signals through afferent vagal nerves that (together with splanchnic nerves) lead to the dorsal vagal complex and interacts with higher autonomic, cognitive and emotional centres along with brainstem vestibular nuclei and the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear before motor output is generated via efferent vagal nerves leading to vomiting/emesis.\n\n【35】Although the underlying mechanism of the vomiting in these patients still remains unelucidated, animal model studies on nausea and vomiting postulate that emesis is induced through a 5-HT3 receptor calcium dependent pathway in which the Ras/MAPK signalling may play a regulating role. 10 As a Noonan syndrome spectrum disorder is caused by Ras/MAPK hyperactivation, this may, additional to delayed gastric emptying and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, in part, help to explain the vomiting in this patient.\n\n【36】*   ARFID: food refusal problems may be caused by as well somatic as non-somatic factors. The definite cause of food refusal is often difficult to establish, and most often multifactorial. 1 11\n    \n*   (High) REE: the REE can be measured by indirect calorimetry and is dependent on age, gender, fat-free mass, underlying disease and medication. 10\n    \n*   Additional problems: also recurrent (upper airway) infections and cardiac disease can contribute to impaired growth and weight. 3\n    \n\n【37】The working diagnosis of ARFID and high energy expenditure will be substantiated more in detail in the treatment section and discussion.\n\n【38】Treatment, outcome and follow-up\n--------------------------------\n\n【39】### Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder\n\n【40】The food refusal problems were treated initially with two behavioural therapy sessions per half-day, twice a week at the age of 2 to 4 years without noticeable effect. At the age of 4, while attending healthcare specialised primary school, it was decided eating therapy was no longer indicated by the lack of success. In later years a subsequent treatment of her food refusal problems by a speech therapist continued with a frequency of two times a week with no significant results.\n\n【41】At the age of 6 years and 7 months the patient was included in a treatment programme at a clinic specialised in the treatment of severe feeding problems (ARFID). A multidisciplinary validated approach was used, based on (cognitive) behaviour therapy and the principles of applied behaviour analysis. Important features of this treatment are the rewarding of all behaviour appropriate to oral (food)acceptance and extinguishing long existed avoidance behaviour.\n\n【42】Therapy sessions were performed four times a day, 5 days a week. Sessions lasted for 20 min and started at a point in the eating process where the behavioural effects of the psychological trauma were not noticeable anymore. This meant accepting a drip of water applied by the index finger of the therapist at her mouth. In protocolled subsequent steps the patient learnt to accept a variety of liquid foods with spoon feeding. Oral intake increased and tube feeding could be reduced where the caloric intake had to remain the same. After 5 months of therapy, tube feeding at home in the evening after therapy sessions was no longer indicated. It was decided to extend the therapy to aim at eating a normal solid food diet.\n\n【43】After 7 months of eating therapy, the patient was capable to have an oral intake of a high calorie solid based diet. Tempo and technique of eating remained a concern. Chewy food like bread crusts remained time consuming. Also she was not able to transport food from outside the mouth onto the tongue, but instead she put the tongue against the palatinum and transported the food from under the tongue into her right cheek, chewing only at the right side of her mouth.\n\n【44】### Growth problems\n\n【45】There was shown a decreased secretion of growth hormone. Growth hormone treatment had striking results. Growth hormone, started at the age of 5 years by a length of SDS −4.36, resulted in a recent length of SDS −1.47, a difference of 2.89 SDS.\n\n【46】### Additional problems\n\n【47】Although persisting middle ear infections coincided with an incline of the reflux problems, these could successfully be treated with an appropriate dosage of ondansetron. Ear surgery lowered the frequency of ear infections significantly.\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】### Food intake problems in relation to a high energy expenditure\n\n【50】Although assessment of feeding problems are included in the international Clinical Management Guidelines of NS, feeding problems are not mentioned in the diagnostic criteria of NS. 12 There is growing evidence for the importance of several aspects of gaining and maintaining a healthy BMI in patients with a Noonan syndrome spectrum disorder. Over 50% percent of children with a Noonan syndrome spectrum disorder suffer from feeding problems. 7 There is a need for a structural multidisciplinary intervention strategy, which is not yet incorporated in existing guidelines. Additionally, it is possible that a need for more energy intake is being masked by the feeding problems. Both energy supply and energy demand (metabolism, energy expenditure and storing energy in muscle, adipose and bone tissue) participate in the regulation of energy homeostasis. 13–16 It is important to evaluate all aspects involved in not only length growth but also in maintaining a healthy weight (BMI) and body composition. Recently, it was shown that patients with an NS spectrum disorder in general show a decrease in BMI, with the greatest decrease seen in patients with a pathologic _SHOC2_ or _KRAS_ variants. 17 The patients in this study revealed more noticeable effects on declined muscle tissue than adipose tissue, as was the case in our patient. Malaquias _et al_ 18 showed a lower BMI in patients from 7 to 17 years with NS spectrum disorders. 18 They wondered if pathologic gene variants associated with NS spectrum disorders could influence metabolism and control of energy storage, as two important hormones involved in insatiety signals (insulin and leptin) act also through the RAS/MAPK pathway. A study in patients with CS displayed an increased REE and a high calorie intake compared with the general dietary energy recommendations. 19 So, food intake problems may be the more important because of growing evidence that a pathogen mutation in a component of the Ras/MAPK signalling pathway could play a role in an increased energy expenditure, an altered energy storage, altered constitution of muscle and adipose tissue and a reduced BMI.\n\n【51】Although all these studies show an impact of an NS spectrum disorder on the BMI and body composition, still little is known on the exact amount of food or energy intake these patients require to maintain a healthy BMI.\n\n【52】The BMI drop of the Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair patient in this case report, despite the already high energy intake, is in line with all these findings and shows that at least this patient indeed needs a significantly higher energy intake than currently is thought to be sufficient to maintain a healthy BMI.\n\n【53】Therefore it is important to establish exactly if and to what extent other patients with a Noonan syndrome spectrum disorder, especially infants, require a higher calorie-intake to remain a healthy BMI, compared with the general population. This may lead to evaluate the food and calorie intake standards for patients with a Noonan syndrome spectrum disorder for example, in the international Clinical Management Guidelines and might justify lowering the threshold for subscribing supplementing medical food.\n\n【54】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【55】**In general**\n\n【56】To our family, initially the impact of the diagnose of NS LAH was not a real big concern. The heart problems of our daughter were mild and the clinical diagnose of the clinical genetic Noonan Syndrome specialist indicated that our daughter would develop the mild variant of the syndrome.\n\n【57】Over the years, however, we would realise the extent of the disorder.\n\n【58】Her cognitive development stayed behind, in time she needed a specialist teaching programme for children with learning disabilities. To us, that came as a surprise, because she was supposed to have the mild variant of the syndrome.\n\n【59】**Vomiting problems**\n\n【60】The impact of the vomiting on our life turned out to be enormous. The vomiting first of all was a health concern. Did our daughter get enough food? What harm did the frequent vomiting do? Why did she refuse to eat? Especially the need of continuous pump feeding from 7.00 AM – 11.00 PM was a challenge. We had to carry both her and the pump everywhere we went. She needed changing a lot, both her clothes (because of the vomiting) and her diapers (7–8 times per day). Which meant that for a short period of time the pump needed to be disconnected. This delayed the hour that we could stop the pump in the evening and go to bed.\n\n【61】It also restricted us in our mobility: bringing the other children to school, going for groceries, visiting friends and family. It had impact on the attention we could give to our other children, the amount of laundry, cleaning in the house hold, on our social life’s and on our professional life’s.\n\n【62】On some occasions the care was so intense that a short period of hospitalisation was necessary.\n\n【63】Although after 2 years the frequency of vomiting declined significantly, the vomiting problem was not solved until our daughter received the proper medication at the age of 5.\n\n【64】**Food refusal problems**\n\n【65】Unfortunately, despite all positive effects of the ondansetron, it did not help our daughter with her food refusal behaviour. She stayed dependent on tube feeding with a feeding pump completely. We were told that the frequency of her eating therapy (two mornings a week, 2 sessions per time) would be sufficient for her to learn how to eat. We followed this advice for almost 5 years, while there was no apparent progress in her ability of eating. The problem was, there was hardly any alternative. Having her follow the intense daily therapy at a specialised clinic for the treatment of severe eating problems at that time, would mean having her hospitalised during the week at the other part of the country. Unfortunately that was no option.\n\n【66】By the time our daughter was 6 years old, we moved to the middle of the country. One of the consequences was, that eating therapy at a dependence of this clinic would be close by. So she could sleep at home. At the age of 6,5 eating therapy started.\n\n【67】The clinic established that the ongoing negative physical sensation in the area of the mouth, throat and ears, both as a result of the continuous vomiting and the recurring ear infections, had let to a psychological trauma. This stimulated long lasting avoidance behaviour and prevented her from getting motivated to learn how to eat. Additionally we want to pinpoint out that the food refusal was not initiated by the vomiting, as the vomiting developed a couple of weeks after our daughter refused to drink her bottle. We were told that after 2 months the initial reflexes of suckling extinguish and the somatic nerve system normally would take over, but for some reason, our daughter was not capable of doing so.\n\n【68】The clinic not only discovered the cause of her continuing food refusal behaviour, but taught her how to eat liquid food in half a year and solid food in the following 3 months. We were very happy with these results.\n\n【69】**Detecting a high energy expenditure**\n\n【70】In the years before the transition to eat independently, the amount of tube feeding she got was a lot more than was being subscribed. With all good intentions in helping us and comforting us, 5–6 separate diet specialists, general practitioners and paediatrics reassured us that our daughter really got more than enough food to grow and we did not have to worry about her development. But we continued having concerns about her need for food. We were the ones realising every day how much food she got, while staying very skinny. The moment she got a cold or got sick, she could lose 1 to 2 kg of her body weight in just a few days. There were no energy reserves in her body.\n\n【71】The clinic not only taught our daughter very successfully to eat, but also discovered that her body needed a lot more food than what is standard considered to be sufficient.\n\n【72】Later, these findings were confirmed by an indirect calorie metric measurement at the Radboudumc.\n\n【73】To us, it was a relief to finally got the objective proof of our suspicion of her high rate of metabolism. With the current mindset on healthy food (“go easy on macronutrients”) both in formal and informal care, it sometimes is a challenge to have others involved in her care known, that in the case of our daughter an apparent excess of macronutrients, is necessary to maintain her health with her specific body.\n\n【74】Because we no longer could see the exact amount of food intake she got like we did preparing the food for the feeding pump, and because we were so happy that our daughter was finally able to eat her meals all by herself, unfortunately, it took 2 years to realise that the high calorie diet that the clinic subscribed was still not enough to meet the high energy demands of her body.\n\n【75】As a positive consequence of the hospitalisation for her appendicitis in 2017, it became obvious to what extent she could lose weight while being sick. It was then decided to prescribe daily medical dietary supplements. To us, this decision was very important. Initially, to a little extent, we felt the medical food as a step backwards. But very soon we noticed that those extra daily calories really relieved the pressure induced by the seven high calorie and time consuming eating sessions per day and how well it helped her regaining and maintaining a more healthy weight up on to this date.\n\n【76】**Future**\n\n【77】We hope that this article in some way may contribute to the awareness of professionals what impact both vomiting and a high energy expenditure can have on a child with a Noonan Syndrome Spectrum Disorder (NSSD). Hopefully this may lead to an extent of possible treatments of vomiting problems. Especially in children with an NSSD, finding a proper treatment for vomiting may be the more important as these children additionally may have a higher demand for energy to maintain a healthy BMI and body composition. Also we hope that more research can be developed to learn about the causes of a high energy expenditure among NSSD children. Finally we hope to contribute to an evaluation of the current clinical management guidelines on feeding problems. E.g. by adding ondansetron to this list of vomiting treatment and lowering the threshold for supplementary medical food. This may help improve the care of NSSD children.\n\n【78】### Learning points\n\n【79】*   It is important to consider if a high caloric diet is indicated in patients with NS spectrum disorder. Indirect calorie measurements can be considered to establish the resting energy expenditure.\n    \n*   Vomiting problems can cause psychological traumatising effects on the ability of a child to learn how to eat, leading to persistent food refusal behaviour. Also, continuous vomiting contributes to risks of malnutrition on development and growth especially if the patient has a high energy expenditure. Additionally, the impact on the family of both the vomiting and the food refusal should be taken into consideration. For these reasons it is important to treat the vomiting problems and the food refusal problems at an early age the most efficient way. In this case ondansetron specifically provided for a very successful treatment.\n    \n*   It is important to treat additional problems, especially those who seem to enhance the vomiting problems. In this case an ear surgery decreased the amount of ear infections significantly.\n    \n*   Vomiting in a patient with NS spectrum disorder may be treatable by ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.\n    \n*   The combination of various negative experiences in the mouth and throat area from a young age most likely has led to negative and physical associations with food. This has led to a pattern of avoidance and food refusal behaviour, which was diagnosed as avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). This is the first case with an NS spectrum disorder with ARFID in the biomedical literature.\n    \n\n【80】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【81】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【82】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s)\n\n【83】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【84】Jos Draaisma is member of the European Reference Network for Developmental Anomalies and Intellectual Disability (ERN-ITHACA).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Since there are no reports of proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) dislocation caused by EDS, little is known about the long-term course of this disease. A woman in her 40s presented with a posterolaterally depressed tibial condyle and severe valgus deformity caused by a long-standing PTFJ dislocation due to EDS. Considering the pathology, posterolateral open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (PLOWHTO) and medial closed-wedge distal femoral osteotomy were performed according to the deformity analysis. A favourable short-term clinical outcome was obtained and the PTFJ dislocation was reduced over time. Although PLOWHTO has several pitfalls, it is a logical and useful surgical technique that can help treat posterolateral dysplasia of the tibial plateau concomitant with severe valgus deformity, regardless of joint laxity, if performed with attention to pitfalls.\n\n【2】*   Orthopaedics\n*   Knee laxity\n*   Knee injuries\n*   Orthopaedic and trauma surgery\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Although various types of joint dislocations have been reported, 1–3 there are no previous reports on proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) dislocations caused by EDS. Here, we report a case of EDS with PTFJ dislocation that led to a severe valgus-aligned knee with posterolateral dysplasia of the lateral tibial condyle.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A woman in her early 40’s, who suffered a severe valgus deformity with PTFJ dislocation in her left knee, was referred to our hospital. Her left knee pain gradually worsened with time after undergoing a lateral meniscectomy 10 years ago. She had no symptoms of swelling, clicking, catching or limitation in her range of motion, but her quality of life was severely limited by the impairment of weight-bearing caused by the excessive valgus of the knee with hyperextension ( table 1 ).\n\n【12】View this table:\n\n【13】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【14】Table 1\n\n【15】Patient-reported outcome measurement at 2 years after surgery\n\n【16】All conservative treatments, such as insole therapy and steroid injection, offered at several hospitals had failed.\n\n【17】Hyperextension of both knees, elbows, wrists and fingers was observed ( figure 1 ), and the Beighton criteria showed a score of 8 out of 9. 4 In addition to PTFJ dislocation, she had severe scoliosis, a history of patellar dislocation and a family history of joint hypermobility, which may suggest a genetic predisposition. Based on these findings, we clinically diagnosed her condition as EDS, despite the lack of biochemical and/or molecular analysis due to her refusal.\n\n【18】<img/>\n\n【19】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【20】Figure 1\n\n【21】Physical examination demonstrates polyarticular joint hypermobility.

The lateral view of CT showed a steep lateral tibial posterior slope at an angle of 17° (Figure 5E). MRI demonstrated that the middle part of the lateral meniscus was almost completely resected ( figure 2C,D ). A radiograph of the anteroposterior view of the whole leg in the standing position showed that the mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA, reference values: 85°–90°) 5 and mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA, reference values: 85°–90°) 5 were 85° and 100°, respectively. The weight-bearing line (WBL) ratio 6 was 130%, demonstrating severe valgus alignment. The major cause was a deformity of the proximal tibia with a mild deformity of the distal femur ( figure 2F ).\n\n【24】<img/>\n\n【25】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【26】Figure 2\n\n【27】Preoperative plain radiographs, MRI, three-dimensional (3D) CT and a 3D-printed model from the 3D-CT.

(D) A postoperative radiograph obtained after 2 years shows favorable alignment. (E) Preoperative posterior tibial slope angle. (F) Three-dimensional CT demonstrates that the posterior tibial slope angle decreased after surgery.\n\n【32】Based on the deformity analysis, we performed preoperative planning. The target mechanical axis was planned as the postoperative WBL ratio passed through 50% from the medial edge of the tibial plateau. Accordingly, the correction angle was planned to be 6° by medial closed-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (MCWDFO) and 8° by posterolateral open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (PLOWHTO). The posterior opening distance was calculated to be 8 mm based on a 3-dimensional printed model (ZimmerBiomet G.K., Tokyo, Japan) ( figure 2I,J ). Although the standard value of the tibial posterior slope is 6° when the posterior cortex is used as a reference line, 7 the target slope was planned to be around 10° to prevent further hyperextension of the knee.\n\n【33】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【34】### Treatment\n\n【35】The patient was placed in a supine position under general anaesthesia. No tourniquet was used throughout the whole arthroscopy and femoral, fibular and tibial osteotomy procedures. After arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for a flap tear of the posterior segment of the lateral meniscus, a biplanar MCWDFO was performed using a subvastus approach according to the procedure described by Nakamura _et al_ . 8 The osteotomized site was fixed with an MCWDFO-specific locking plate (TriS Medial DFO Plate, Olympus Terumo Biomaterials, Tokyo, Japan). The peroneal nerve was then released through a posterolateral longitudinal skin incision, separate from the incision for the tibial osteotomy, to prevent peroneal nerve palsy by posterolateral opening. The posterolateral incision provided working space for subsequent fibular osteotomy with safe and sufficient retraction of the released nerve. Segmental fibular osteotomy was performed through the same incision immediately below the fibular head ( figure 3A,B ).\n\n【36】<img/>\n\n【37】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【38】Figure 3\n\n【39】The peroneal nerve neurolysis and fibula osteotomy of the left knee. (A) The peroneal nerve (white arrowhead) was released in the proximal and distal directions. (B) Segmental osteotomy (white arrow) of the fibula was performed.\n\n【40】Subsequently, a 10 cm curved longitudinal skin incision was made on the anterolateral aspect of the knee through Gerdy’s tubercle. The tibialis anterior and posterior soft tissues were subperiosteally released. Two Kirschner wires (2.0 mm diameter) were inserted 40 mm distal to the lateral proximal tibial plateau to 15 mm distal to the medial proximal tibial joint surface. A hinge point was set at approximately 5 mm before the medial tibial cortex. Since PLOWHTO is likely to be unstable following a hinge fracture, the medial plate (TomoFix small version, DePuy Synthes, Bettlach, Switzerland) was temporarily fixed with two Kirschner wires before tibial osteotomy ( figure 4A,B ). For the medial plating, the anteromedial arthroscopic portal was extended distally by 3 cm and the plate was subcutaneously installed.\n\n【41】<img/>\n\n【42】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【43】Figure 4\n\n【44】Medial plating before posterolateral opening.

(B) The proximal screw is inserted through the medial another skin incision, and the distal part of the plate is fixed through the lateral skin incision. (C) A posterolateral osteotomy line is shown. The beta-tricalcium phosphate is inserted in the direction of the posterolateral opening.\n\n【45】A biplanar osteotomy was performed similarly to that of medial open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO), 9–11 and the osteotomized site was opened to the planned distance using a spreader. The removed fibula was crushed and used as a gap filler, and two bone-substitute wedges made of beta-tricalcium phosphate (OSferion60 Marvelous; Olympus Terumo Biomaterials, Tokyo, Japan) were inserted between the lateral cortices ( figure 4C ). Lateral fixation was then performed using an locking compression plate (LCP) proximal lateral tibial plate (DePuy Synthes, Bettlach, Switzerland), and medial plate fixation was completed using locking screws ( figure 5A,B ). Range of motion exercises were initiated on the first day after surgery, and full weight-bearing was allowed at 6 weeks.\n\n【46】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【47】Postoperative radiography of the entire leg revealed an anatomically corrected WBL (51%). mLDFA and mMPTA were corrected to 91° from 85° and 92° from 100°, respectively. The 3-dimensional CT demonstrated that the lateral tibial posterior slope angle decreased from 17° to 11° after surgery ( figure 5E,F ). Both coronal and sagittal alignments were maintained for 2 years after surgery ( figure 5C,D ), and the PTFJ dislocation was reduced over time ( figure 5C,D ).\n\n【48】At 2 years of follow-up, the patient reported no complaints and showed significant improvement in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. The score exceeded the minimal clinically important difference 12 except for the symptom subscale ( table 1 ).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】Although there have been reports of dislocation of the hip, patella, shoulder, elbow joints, etc, in patients with EDS, 1–3 a case of dislocation of the PTFJ associated with EDS has never been reported. Traumatic PTFJ dislocation in adulthood, although rare, 13 provides little useful information about the effects of PTFJ dislocation in skeletally immature knees on bony growth and/or bony deformities. From the present case, we found that the dislocation of the fibula, which acts as a supporting strut for the posterolateral part of the tibial condyle, 14 15 caused dysplasia of the posterolateral tibia, resulting in valgus knee alignment. It is possible that excessive lateral compartment loading exerted a compression force on the distal lateral femur, which also induced a valgus deformity of the distal femur.\n\n【51】In comparison with other syndromic dysplasias of the knee joint such as Blount disease, Turner syndrome or Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, the skin and blood vessels of EDS patients should be treated with special care because of the fragility of the systemic connective tissue. Gentle retraction and careful haemostasis during surgery could be crucial to a successful osteotomy. The use of separate incisions—an anterolateral incision for the tibial osteotomy and a posterolateral incision for the fibular osteotomy/peroneal nerve release—may enhance security. To control bleeding, we used a non-tourniquet procedure under strict blood pressure control (< 100 mm Hg) to ensure that any vascular injury could be detected during surgery, thus mitigating the risk of postoperative haemorrhagic swelling.\n\n【52】For patients with Blount disease or Turner syndrome, with severe varus of the knees with a single deformity centre around the medial tibial condyle, surgical correction with a large opening at one time should be avoided. An inverted V-shaped high tibial osteotomy, 16 which can reduce the opening distance, or gradual correction using the hemicallotasis method, 17 are possible options. For severe and complicated valgus deformity due to Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, two-step correction 18 may be the most reliable procedure. In the current case with EDS, the posterolateral opening distance was decreased by performing an MCWDFO according to the deformity analysis, reducing the risk of complications such as skin laceration, peroneal nerve palsy and/or delayed union.\n\n【53】The efficacy of TKA as a treatment for knee OA and joint instability associated with EDS has been reported previously. 19 However, it has also been reported that postoperative instability can necessitate revision surgery in some cases. 20 21 Since the valgus deformity was localised to the proximal tibia in this case, extra-articular osteotomy was a more logical and solution-oriented approach to the problems of joint laxity and deformity correction.\n\n【54】Considering the pathology, the correction osteotomy should be targeted for anatomical alignment. Therefore, we planned (1) the posterolateral opening osteotomy of the tibia and (2) the medial closing osteotomy of the distal femur. Although MCWDFO can be performed in the usual manner, PLOWHTO has several pitfalls.\n\n【55】The important points to be considered when using this technique are as follows: (1) peroneal nerve neurolysis is necessary; (2) fibula osteotomy is performed just below the fibular head and (3) the posterolateral gap is opened after temporary plate fixation of the anteromedial site. Mechanical stretching of the nerve is likely to contribute to nerve injury or ischaemia, 22 23 resulting in peroneal nerve palsy. Prior to fibula osteotomy, peroneal nerve neurolysis creates a working space for the osteotomy by retracting the peroneal nerve. Fibular osteotomy before PLOWTHO must be performed just below the fibular head because the crural interosseous membrane stabilises the positional relationship between the tibia and fibula ( figure 6C ). The crural interosseous membrane makes it challenging to open the gap if fibular osteotomy is performed at the midportion of the fibula ( figure 6A,B ). In medial OWHTO, the PTFJ stabilises the osteotomy site, even if a type I hinge fracture occurs ( figure 6D ). 24 In addition, in hybrid closed-wedge HTO, the medial collateral ligament acts as a tension band, leading to medial stability ( figure 6E ). 25 However, in PLOWHTO, there is no stabilising effect on the anteromedial aspect of the osteotomy site, which leads to instability following a hinge fracture ( figure 6F,G ). Therefore, temporary anteromedial plate fixation was necessary before opening the posterolateral gap ( figure 6H ). Attention to these critical factors can help reduce the risks of intraoperative and postoperative complications.\n\n【56】<img/>\n\n【57】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【58】Figure 6\n\n【59】The role of the crural interosseous membrane and the stabilizing effect of each osteotomy. (A) Fibula osteotomy at the midportion and segmental resection (black arrow). (B) In opening the proximal tibia (red lines), the proximal part of the osteotomized fibula requires a proximal migration (white arrow) in synchrony with the tibia. The counterforce by the crural interosseous membrane inhibits the proximal migration of the fibula (black dotted arrow), which makes it difficult to open the gap. (C) The proximal fibular osteotomy immediately below the fibular head enables fibular proximal migration without any interference (green arrow). (D) In medial open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO), the fibula supports the lateral stability when a hinge fracture (dotted circle) occurs. (E) In hybrid closed-wedge HTO, which is combinational HTO of medial open (blue arrows) and lateral close (red arrows), medial collateral ligament acts as tension band (black arrowheads), leading to medial stability. (F) In posterolateral open-wedge HTO, when a hinge fracture (dotted circle) occurs, (G) lateral osteotomized site opening (double-headed arrow) results in medial instability since medial collateral ligament does not act as a medial stabiliser. (H) Temporary fixation on the anteromedial side of the osteotomy provides medial stabilisation and facilitates the posterolateral opening maneuver (double-headed arrow). The figures were drawn by the first author (anonymised for the blinded review).\n\n【60】Although this is a report of a single rare case and its short-term outcome, PLOWHTO can be applied to cases of tibial plateau fractures with lateral tibial dysplasia. However, it remains unknown whether patients need to undergo additional surgery in the long term. Segmental osteotomy of the fibula might cause deformity of the tibia in the long term owing to the lack of support of the fibula. As segmental osteotomy of the fibula can shorten the course of the peroneal nerve, we performed segmental osteotomy in this case. Although the short-term clinical outcomes were favourable, further follow-up is required.\n\n【61】In conclusion, we performed a novel osteotomy adapted to the patient’s pathology and deformity in a young patient with genu valgum due to EDS, which led to good short-term outcomes. PLOWHTO is considered a valuable surgical technique when performed with attention to pitfalls.\n\n【62】### Learning points\n\n【63】*   Proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome causes dysplasia of the posterolateral tibia, resulting in a severe valgus-aligned knee.\n    \n*   Depending on the patient’s condition and deformity, extra-articular osteotomy may be helpful in certain cases.\n    \n*   In posterolateral open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (PLOWHTO), peroneal nerve neurolysis is necessary to avoid peroneal nerve palsy.\n    \n*   PLOWHTO requires fibula osteotomy just below the fibula head to eliminate the effect of crural interosseous membrane stability.\n    \n*   In PLOWHTO, anteromedial temporary fixation provides a medial stabilising effect.\n    \n\n【64】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【65】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【66】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【67】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【68】We thank Hiroyuki Tsuchiya, MD, PhD, Atsushi Okawa, MD, PhD, Hideyuki Koga, MD, PhD for continuous support, Kaori Matsumoto for shooting photos and Editage.

She was transferred to the nearest Major Trauma Centre, where her observations remained stable and initial primary survey was unremarkable. She had a full trauma CT that revealed extensive bilateral rib fractures with flail of 8+9 on the left, a C4-5 body fracture and, most significantly an acute traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the thoracic aorta and associated pneumomediastinum.\n\n【5】The CT images show transverse and coronal views of this pseudoaneurysm. On the coronal views( figure 1 ), you can see a bulging of the anterior wall of the thoracic aorta, just below the level of the isthmus. On the transverse view( figure 2 ), you can see the lumen of the aorta (indicated by an arrow), with a false lumen demonstrating dissection of this vessel.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】This sagittal view shows an outpouching of the thoracic aorta along the underside of the aortic isthmus, in keeping with an anterior traumatic pseudoaneurysm.\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Axial view.

The anaesthetic team however deemed her very high risk given her trauma burden coupled with her advanced age and significant pre-existing comorbidities. They advised us that she was unlikely to survive a general anaesthetic. This was discussed fully with the patient who did not want to risk a general anaesthetic, due to the low probability of survival, before she has had the chance to see her family. She was therefore admitted to the ward with an Aspen collar for her C4-5 fracture and epidural for pain relief from her ribs. Over the next day, she began to deteriorate with her breathing, and unfortunately passed away rapidly the following night, with high suspicion of rupture of her pseudoaneurysm.\n\n【15】In blunt trauma, this injury more commonly occurs from a deceleration injury and located around the aortic isthmus as this is the point where the thoracic aorta, which is relatively mobile, joins with the arch of aorta which is fixed. 1 2 The majority of patients with traumatic injury to the thoracic aorta tend to die on scene or before arrival to hospital. 3 In this case, the patient arrived in an apparently stable condition, not showing any signs of obvious injury.

He (a high-level athlete) had reported progressively worsening bilateral midfoot pain, likely as a result of repetitive navicular load. Although he was struggling, he continued to play for approximately six more months. At that point, he was in significant pain and rested both of his feet, mobilising in a wheelchair for four weeks. He tried to play again, however could not continue on.\n\n【5】CT scans of both feet showed bilateral fractures of the lateral aspects of the navicular bones with no evidence of collapse. On examination, he was found to have bilateral cavus feet with no swelling or tenderness along the navicular bones. He exhibited significant tightness of the gastrocnemius muscles with a positive Silfverskold test bilaterally. He underwent open reduction internal fixation of the right navicular through a sinus tarsi approach with a single 3-mm cannulated compression screw, and there were no significant perioperative complications ( figure 1 ). He was initially non-weightbearing for six weeks and his postoperative course was uncomplicated. He underwent the same procedure for the contralateral side four months later ( figure 2 ).\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Computed tomography A) axial, B) coronal, and C) sagittal images demonstrating isolated fracture of the right navicular bone and D) intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging of fixation.\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Computed tomography A) axial, B) coronal, and C) sagittal images demonstrating isolated fracture of the left navicular bone and D) intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging of fixation.\n\n【14】Tarsal navicular fractures make up approximately 5% of all foot fractures, and 35% of midfoot fractures. 1 Acute navicular fractures are commonly a result of either high-energy trauma or repetitive stress. Due to strong surrounding anatomical and ligamentous support structures, this type of injury is generally associated with fractures of the adjacent bones of the foot and rarely happens in isolation. It follows on that simultaneous acute bilateral isolated navicular body fractures are extremely rare, with only one previous case reported in the literature to our knowledge. 2\n\n【15】Acute navicular body fractures occur most commonly as a result of axial loading. 3 They can occur as a progression of a stress fracture. Vertical stress is transmitted through the medial longitudinal arch of the foot, of which the navicular bone is a main component ( figure 3 ). Restoring congruity of the arch with prompt anatomical reduction of the navicular bone is essential to avoid poor outcomes, such as midfoot arthrosis, as the navicular bone is vulnerable to osteonecrosis because of its complex blood supply. 4 Navicular fractures are associated with significant morbidity and can be easily overlooked on both clinical exam and on plain film X-rays. The bilaterality seen in the case discussed impacts the decision-making process in terms of approach to treatment and timing of fixation for each side.\n\n【16】<img/>\n\n【17】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【18】Figure 3\n\n【19】Force diagram outlining axial stresses on the A) calcaneus, B) navicular, and C) metatarsophalangeal joint.

His visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Slit lamp examination of left eye revealed an elevated lesion with oval-shape, brown colour, well-defined margins and corrugated surface in inferior cornea. It was relatively translucent, and rigid shell-like, with a convex outer surface that had a waxy coating resembling the exoskeleton of insects ( figure 1 ). It was associated with surrounding stromal infiltration and vascularisation. On fluorescence staining, dye gathered around the edges of the lesion with no epithelial defect. There was no associated conjunctival discharge, forniceal foreign body (FB) or anterior chamber reaction. A diagnosis of insect wing case (IWC) corneal FB (CFB) was made. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT, Cirrus, Carl Zeiss, Meditec, Germany) revealed a crescent-shaped concavo-convex surfaced hyper-reflective FB with sharp well-defined margins in the anterior cornea with shadowing of underlying structures. Central shadowing was noted beyond 451 µm of stromal thickness and marginal shadowing was noted underneath one edge of CFB ( figure 2 ). It was removed with McPherson forceps on slit-lamp under topical anaesthesia and topical moxifloxacin (0.5%) was administered 6hourly for 5 days following which the site healed with minimal scarring. CFB revealed no microbiological growth.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Slit-lamp photograph of insect wing case corneal foreign body (A, B).\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】ASOCT findings of insect wing case corneal foreign body (A, B), yellow arrows indicate marginal shadowing. ASOCT, anterior segment optical coherence tomography.\n\n【13】IWCs are rarely described CFBs, last reported by Fogla _et al_ in the month of November and December due to seasonal variation in the insect population. 1 The authors suggested that the firm adhesion of this convexoconcave FB on convex ocular surface could be due to vacuum created by the pressure of eyelid on the FB. As IWCs may cause corneal infiltration, neovascularisation and infective keratitis, they should be removed immediately and subjected to microbiological evaluation.\n\n【14】ASOCT, a valuable non-invasive tool that provides high resolution details of anterior segment structures, is known to aid in diagnosis of CFB and in guiding an appropriate method of its removal. 2 3 Metallic CFBs may be deposited either superficially or deeply into the corneal stroma (due to their high velocity), are hyper-reflective on ASOCT and cause mirroring and shadowing effect on underlying structures, while organic FBs remain lodged superficially (due to their low velocity) and few organic CFBs such as hairy chestnut spines may not be detectable on ASOCT. 3 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time, ASOCT is being used for imaging IWC. We noted localised shadowing of corneal details underlying the IWC. We also noted marginal shadowing under one edge of CFB. These findings are very similar to the those reported by Wang _et al_ in their case 3, where a translucent brown shell CFB was identified clinically, and on ASOCT, a crescent-shaped low reflective signal with bilateral marginal zone shadowing 21 µm below the epithelium surface was noted. Although the beginning of shadowing usually indicates the inferior margin of CFB, thus determining its depth, it may sometimes conceal underlying corneal thinning or perforation and, tissue adhesives may be needed in reserve, based on clinical discretion of the ophthalmologist. ASOCT may also aid in differentiating IWCs from other brown-coloured lesions such as uveal tissue prolapse or ocular surface neoplasia.\n\n【15】To conclude, specific details such as crescent-shaped concavo-convex surfaced sharply defined hyper-reflective FB in the anterior cornea with localised central shadowing and marginal shadowing of underlying structures as visualised on ASOCT may aid in diagnosis and management of IWC CFB.\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】*   Insect wing case can rarely present as superficial corneal foreign body and cause mild ocular irritation.\n    \n*   Anterior segment optical coherence tomography demonstrates crescent shaped hyper-reflective foreign body with central shadowing and one-sided marginal shadowing of structures underlying foreign body.\n    \n\n【18】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【19】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【20】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

On arrival, his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 7 (E1V2M4). On examination, there was no eye tracking, reflexes were diminished globally and patient was unable to cooperate with motor examination. At that point of time, differential diagnoses include bilateral thalamus lesion, basilar syndrome, deep cerebral venous thrombosis, metabolic and toxic processes, infection as well as neoplasm. Initial CT of the brain showed interval development of acute non-haemorrhagic infarcts in the medial aspect of the right occipital lobe, adjoining aspects of both thalami and possible right cerebral peduncle (posterior circulation artery (PCA) territory). MRI of the brain ( figure 1 ) revealed acute non-haemorrhagic infarct in the right PCA and artery of Percheron (AOP) territories with involvement of posteromedial right temporo-occipital lobes, para-median thalami and anteromedial cerebral peduncles. The AOP is a rare variant of arterial supply to the thalamus that arises from segment one of the PCAs. Four major variants were previously described 1 ( figure 2 ), and our patient likely has a type II variant. Infarct of AOP can affect bilateral structures with varying clinical presentations. 2 Diagnosis of AOP infarct is often missed due to the unusual presentation, and it may not be visualised on primary imaging.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Symmetrical areas of restricted diffusion (A) with corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (B) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (C) changes noted compatible with acute infarcts in the territory of artery of Percheron.

Current treatment strategies are based on agents without tumour cell specificity, such as proteasome inhibitors (eg, bortezomib, carfilzomib), immunomodulatory drugs (eg, thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide) monoclonal antibodies (eg, daratumumab, elotuzumab) and conventional chemotherapy.\n\n【10】Genome sequencing of myeloma cells revealed a wide spectrum of potentially actionable mutations, including BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, FAM46C, DIS3 and others. 2\n\n【11】The mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK pathway is the major signal transduction cascade that regulates cell growth. In myeloma the most frequently observed recurrent mutations involve this pathway. 3 An emerging therapeutic target is the BRAF V600E mutation that leads to constitutional activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling pathway and results in tumour cell growth, differentiation and survival. 4\n\n【12】Oral inhibitors of BRAF-mutant kinase are approved and widely used for the treatment of BRAF-mutant melanoma. 5 In MM, BRAF V600E mutations are detected in 3%–10% of patients, and have been associated with rapidly progressing, relapsed or refractory disease, extramedullary disease and IgA MM, with short PFS and overall survival. 6\n\n【13】The activating BRAF V600E mutation was reported to be of therapeutic relevance in MM: The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib as a single agent was evaluated in a small study of patients with BRAF-mutant MM. Although the overall response rate was 33%, median PFS of 4.3 months was short and suggested early resistance. 7 In experimental tumour models and in patients with malignant melanoma, MEK activation was shown to compensate for pharmacological BRAF inhibition, and combined MEK and BRAF inhibition was highly synergistic and therefore able to delay resistance. 8 Our hypothesis was that MM harbouring an activating mutation of BRAF could be highly vulnerable to dual BRAF and downstream MEK inhibition. Here, we describe successful treatment with a combination of dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib in a patient with refractory BRAF-mutant MM.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A man in his 70s presented with an osteolytic skull lesion, headache, bone pain, and pancytopenia without fever. Biopsy of the skull lesion revealed IgA-kappa MM with an extraordinarily high proliferation index (Ki67=70%). Cytogenetic studies indicated high-risk disease with gain of 1q and IGH-FGFR3 fusion t(4;14); serum free light chain concentrations were kappa 195 mg/L and lambda 8 mg/L, with elevated kappa/lambda ratio (24.4). At diagnosis, serum paraprotein was 13.2 g/L.\n\n【16】Standard systemic therapy with bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) was initiated, along with palliative radiotherapy to the skull (15×2.5 Gy) and to an osteolytic vertebral body (12×3 Gy). After five cycles, the patient met the criteria for very good partial response (VGPR). After two further cycles of treatment, rapid clinical and serological relapse was evident, with regrowth of the skull lesion and increased kappa light chains (936 mg/L). Carfilzomib was initiated as a salvage treatment but was unsuccessful, and kappa light chains rose to 1307 mg/L. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-CT indicated a metabolically active MM with osteolytic bone lesions, extramedullary soft tissue lesions and pleural effusion ( figure 1 ). Severe fatigue, bone pain requiring opioid analgesics, anaemia and fever were present, with deterioration of performance status to ECOG 3 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status).\n\n【17】<img/>\n\n【18】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【19】Figure 1\n\n【20】PET scan before (A) and after 4 weeks of treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib (B), (A) Initial PET scan, (B) PET scan after 4 weeks.

Evaluation of the primary biopsy specimen, using PCR and sequencing of exon 15, revealed BRAF V600E mutation (c.1799T>A). In the liquid biopsy, we identified dominant newly emerging mutation clusters in RAS genes and altered MAP kinase (MAP2K1) ( table 1 ). None of these activating mutations was identified in the primary biopsy.\n\n【23】View this table:\n\n【24】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【25】Table 1\n\n【26】Mutation status at progression (NGS)\n\n【27】Treatment\n---------\n\n【28】Given the lack of standard therapy for relapsing myeloma and the newly detected mutation, we obtained the informed consent of the patient for initiating off-label treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib as approved for melanoma treatment (dabrafenib 150 mg two times daily and trametinib 2 mg two times daily).\n\n【29】The patient’s general health status improved rapidly (to ECOG 0) within a few days, and kappa free light chains normalised (13.2 mg/L) within 12 days ( figure 2 ). <sup>18 </sup> FDG-PET (F18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography) scan after 4 weeks showed a metabolic response, with small residual lesions in the right clavicle and humerus ( figure 1 ) and complete resolution of the extramedullary, frontal tumour bulk ( figure 3 ).\n\n【30】<img/>\n\n【31】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【32】Figure 2\n\n【33】Time course of free light chain kappa during successive treatments.

Based on serum free light chain concentrations without bone marrow evaluation, the patient achieved VGPR according to standard criteria. 9 Four months after starting dabrafenib and trametinib disease progression was noted, with a sharp rise in kappa free light chains to 417 mg/L.\n\n【39】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【40】Based on serum free light chain concentrations without bone marrow evaluation, the patient achieved VGPR according to standard criteria after only 4 weeks of therapy. 9 Four months after starting dabrafenib and trametinib disease progression was noted, with a sharp rise in kappa free light chains to 417 mg/L. The patient died 11 months after the beginning of treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibition.\n\n【41】Discussion\n----------\n\n【42】Our patient had highly aggressive disease responding poorly to prior standard therapy. Combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib was well tolerated, and led to rapid clinical, radiographic and laboratory response. This observation is consistent with other preliminary reports on dual inhibition of BRAF/MEK in MM. 10 11\n\n【43】Raab _et al_ presented results of 12 patients with BRAFV600 mutant relapsed MM treated with encorafenib (BRAF-inhibitor) and binimetinib (MEK-inhibitor). Overall response was achieved in ten of the twelve patients (83%), six of whom had a VGPR and three had complete remission. No new safety signals could be identified. 12 Interestingly, two patients under dual BRAF/MEK inhibition had new KRAS mutations at time of progression—one with the same KRAS p.G12V mutation we found in our patient.\n\n【44】In another study of 180 paired tissue biopsies of newly diagnosed and relapsed MM Xu _et al_ showed enrichment of RAS and BRAF mutations in relapsed MM compared with newly diagnosed MM. As expected, BRAF mutations were significantly associated with activated downstream signalling while only KRAS and not NRAS mutations were associated with pathway activation. 3 These findings correspond well with our observations.\n\n【45】MM follows multiple evolutionary pathways over a patient’s course of disease. Keats _et al_ used serial genomic analysis of samples collected at different points of progression in 28 patients. They found in a high-risk patient with t(4;14)—similar to our patient—a higher mutation rate than patients without high-risk genetic abnormalities. Different clones appeared to compete with each other depending on the selection pressure caused by therapy. 13\n\n【46】These observations suggest that resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibition can be mediated by selection of genetically distinct resistant clones characterised by activating mutations of RAS genes. A better understanding of resistance mechanisms could lead to the development of new therapies acting on the RAS/RAF pathway (eg, highly selective KRAS or pan-KRAS inhibitors).\n\n【47】Sequencing of BRAF provides a rapid method for detecting BRAF V600E mutations. 14 The presence of this mutation should be considered particularly in patients with limited treatment options such as rapidly progressive disease, IgA MM and extramedullary disease. 15 While the primary biopsy can be re-examined, a new bone marrow/extramedullary biopsy should be preferred at relapse, as mutations are more common in the recurrent setting.

Clinical evaluation revealed the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) lower limb exercise score of 0 points and the Functional Assessment for Control of Trunk (FACT) score of 0 points. Conventional physical therapy for 60 days did not significantly improve the paraplegia or FACT score; therefore, belt electrode skeletal muscle electrical stimulation (B-SES) and virtual reality (VR)-guided sitting balance training were introduced for 30 days. She developed independence for all basic movements and her gait was restored using short leg braces and Lofstrand crutches. At discharge, her ASIA lower limb exercise score was 24 and FACT score was 7, with a functional impedance measure motor item of 57, and she could continuously walk for a distance of 150 m. The combination of B-SES and VR-guided balance training may be a feasible therapeutic option after spinal cord infarction.\n\n【2】*   rehabilitation medicine\n*   disability\n*   virtual rehabilitation\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Therefore, additional evidence is required on the outcomes of patients with severe paraplegia and poor physical prognosis.\n\n【10】A recent systematic review of virtual reality (VR)-guided training suggested its usefulness in improving balance and functional mobility in patients with spinal cord injury. 8 A longitudinal case study revealed that neuromuscular electrical stimulation increased dynamic postural stability in a patient with spinal cord injury. 9 Improved trunk function and balance are essential for regaining walking ability after stroke. 10 Studies with patients recovering from spinal cord infarction using a combination of electrical stimulation and VR-guided training may improve future outcomes in this patient group. 10\n\n【11】This case report presents a patient with spinal cord infarction that failed to achieve desired improvement with conventional physical therapy but did improve using supplementary lower limb transcutaneous electrical stimulation and VR-guided balance training for paraplegia and trunk function, respectively.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 41-year-old woman was diagnosed with an acute thoracoabdominal aortic dissection (Stanford Type B, DeBakey III b) based on contrast-enhanced CT findings ( figure 1A ). The patient presented without any signs of vital organ blood supply loss caused by branch arterial obstruction secondary to the dissection and, thus, received conservative treatment. The following day, the patient presented with the paralysis of both lower limbs and the trunk, sensory impairment below the ninth thoracic vertebra, increased tendon reflexes in bilateral lower extremities and bowel and bladder dysfunction. She was diagnosed with spinal cord infarction due to insufficient blood flow in the spinal arteries. Spinal cord MRI was not performed, at the attending surgeon’s discretion, and the diagnosis was made according to the criteria proposed by Zalewski _et al_ . 11 The criteria for probable periprocedural spinal cord infarction include acute non-traumatic myelopathy and severe acute antigravity muscle deficits, occurring within 12 hours after the onset of thoracoabdominal aortic dissection, in the absence of any plausible alternative diagnoses. 11 Bilateral neurological deficits, increased tendon reflex and bowel and bladder dysfunction further supported the diagnosis of spinal cord infarction. The patient underwent emergent endovascular aortic stent grafting to prevent aortic dissection progression ( figure 1B ). After about 2 months of acute treatment, the patient was transferred to our hospital for rehabilitation.\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】Figure 1\n\n【17】Three-dimensional reconstructed CT angiography of thoracoabdominal aorta at the onset (A).

(B) Endovascular aortic stent-grafting was performed in the descending aorta distal to the aortic arch.\n\n【18】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【19】At the time of her transfer, no limited range of motion or spasticity was observed in the limbs or trunk; however, the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) lower extremity motor score was 0, indicating severe flaccid paralysis ( table 1 ). Functional indices are presented in tables 1 and 2 . Light touch and pin prick responses were severely impaired below the ninth thoracic vertebra level and absent below the second lumbar vertebra level, without signs of sacral sparing ( table 2 ). Additionally, the trunk function was 0 points on the functional assessment for control of trunk (FACT), while the manual muscle test score of the rectus abdominis was 2. The patient required assistance for all movements, such as getting up and maintaining a sitting position without support, and an indwelling urinary catheter was used for bladder management. From the beginning, the patient strongly desired to walk home without using a wheelchair at discharge.\n\n【20】View this table:\n\n【21】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【22】Table 1\n\n【23】Progress in total score (points) of various functional indices\n\n【24】View this table:\n\n【25】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【26】Table 2\n\n【27】Changes to ASIA and FACT score items\n\n【28】Treatment\n---------\n\n【29】Details of the conventional physical therapy protocol used in this case are presented in table 3 . Changes to the ASIA lower limb total motor score and FACT scores over time are presented in figure 2 . To regain independence in basic movements, training for transferring and sitting up movements was provided. In addition, since the patient had a desire to reacquire the ability to walk, walking training was conducted using bilateral knee–ankle–foot orthoses and a load relief type rehabilitation lift SP-1000 (Moritoh, Aichi, Japan). The rehabilitation lift used in this case enabled weight unloading by lifting the body with the arm placed on top of the lift. Meanwhile, the presence of wheels supported walking practice by maintaining weight unloading. The patient was instructed to push the lift forward using their arms, and the physical therapist assisted from behind, helping the patient swing forward the leg that was fixed with the long leg orthosis. Walking training was performed at approximately 100 m/day, depending on the patient’s vital signs and fatigue level. The conventional physical therapy described in table 3 was provided 180 min on weekdays, as supported by medical insurance coverage. Several physical therapists provided patient care. After the patient completed the aforementioned physical therapy programme for approximately 60 days, grooming and dressing both improved to 7 points on the functional independence measure (FIM). Although no obvious change was noted in trunk function FACT score, the patient was able to maintain a seated position in clinical situations without the use of a brace, and only light assistance was required for transfer tasks to prevent slips and falls. However, the transfer operation in the ward was 1 point on the FIM, as it sometimes required two caregivers depending on the skill of the caregiver. Additionally, only a few changes were observed in the lower limb function, and muscle contraction was not observed in either of the lower limbs.\n\n【30】View this table:\n\n【31】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【32】Table 3\n\n【33】Conventional physical therapy protocol\n\n【34】<img/>\n\n【35】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【36】Figure 2\n\n【37】Rehabilitation schedule and changes in ASIA total motor score of the lower limbs and FACT scores. ASIA, American Spinal Injury Association motor score; B-SES, belt electrode skeletal muscle electrical stimulation; FACT, Functional Assessment for Control of Trunk; PT, physical therapy; VR, virtual reality.\n\n【38】Based on these results, in addition to conventional physical therapy, B-SES therapy using a general therapy electrical stimulator (Homerion Laboratory Tokyo, Japan) was initiated on hospital day 60. The entire belt of the B-SES device acts as an electrode that can induce contraction in the quadriceps, hamstrings, triceps surae and tibialis anterior muscles when wrapped around the waist, thigh and distal lower limbs ( figure 3 ). B-SES was performed as self-training separately from physical therapy for 20 min a day, five times a week, at a frequency of 20 Hz, with the maximum intensity at which the muscle contraction appeared and the pain could be tolerated. Several weeks after the initiation of B-SES, slight muscle contraction of the lower limbs was observed ( table 1 ). From the state where only reflective movements of the lower limbs were observed, intentional autonomous movements became gradually feasible, and the ASIA lower limb mobility score improved to 17 points, 30 days after the initiation of B-SES ( figure 2 ). The patient began walking with light assistance using a walker without fixing the knee joints using a knee–ankle–foot orthosis. Although the patient showed resistance to self-catheterisation for urination at the beginning of her hospitalisation, the indwelling catheterisation was switched to intermittent self-catheterisation on hospital day 70 under nurse guidance. In contrast, during this period, although we approached trunk function through basic movements and balance training in the sitting position, no changes were observed in the FACT score, trunk function index or instability in the sitting position, indicating that independence in transfer movements was not achieved.\n\n【39】<img/>\n\n【40】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【41】Figure 3\n\n【42】Image of self-training using belt electrode skeletal muscle electrical stimulation. Muscle electrical stimulation was performed in a wheelchair sitting position. For electrostimulation, the belt electrode was attached bilaterally to the proximal thighs (below the pants), distal thighs and ankles. At a frequency of 20 Hz, the intervals of the on and off stimuli were set to 5 and 2 s, respectively. The intensity of the stimulus was gradually increased from 0.1 mA or decreased by 0.1 mA on the display. The intensity was set at the level at which the muscle contraction appeared and set at the maximum tolerable pain. The output strength was often set to about 0.7–1.3 mA in this case. B-SES, belt electrode skeletal muscle electrical stimulation.\n\n【43】To improve trunk function, we tried sitting-position balance training by VR using mediVR KAGURA (mediVR, Toyonaka, Japan) ( figure 4 ). This device is used to encourage a reaching movement with the patient in a sitting position by having them attempting to touch a falling object that appears in a three-dimensional virtual space with a hand-held controller. 12–14 It promotes repeating various reaching movements by adjusting the distance and angle to the falling object and speed of falling. We introduced it several times as part of the physiotherapy, using customised distance and speed for the acquisition of the falling objects to account for approximately 70% of the total movements. Later, since the patient could perform the VR training safely by herself, she performed it for 20 min a day, five times a week, as a self-training replacement for B-SES. When VR training was introduced, the number of reaches per session of self-training was about 300; this figure became 600 by the end of the training programme. Therefore, the FACT score improved from 2 points before the initiation of VR training to 5 points ( figure 2 ); the previous problematic trunk instability during transfer movements resolved, and the transfer movements in the ward were corrected independently. For walking, the knee–ankle–foot orthoses were changed to ankle–foot orthoses, and the patient started walking under supervision using a walker.\n\n【44】<img/>\n\n【45】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【46】Figure 4\n\n【47】Image of self-training of sitting balance using mediVR KAGURA. The patient wears a head-mounted display and is encouraged to reach to catch a falling object appearing in the three-dimensional virtual space. The difficulty levels can be set by adjusting the size of the falling object and falling speed.\n\n【48】Following this, for approximately 60 days until discharge, movement training was conducted under the expected in-home setting after discharge, while changing the self-training from VR to walking training, the distance increased from 120 m to 600 m. The patient used an ankle–foot orthosis for both lower limbs and a Lofstrand crutch at the time of discharge and was moving a short distance in the house. She was able to put on the orthoses. The light touch examination revealed reduced response at discharge, likely due to myalgia in the lower extremities ( tables 1 and 2 ). Although no improvement was seen in urinary function, the patient could manage bladder emptying using intermittent self-catheterisation. As defecation required a nurse’s intervention, home-visit nursing care was planned.\n\n【49】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【50】After discharge, the patient continued to undergo physical therapy through home-visit rehabilitation for 6 months, henceforth with no significant change in physical function. The patient is using a Lofstrand crutch while walking and a wheelchair while sitting.\n\n【51】Discussion\n----------\n\n【52】Higher ASIA impairment scale scores at onset are reportedly associated with poor long-term prognosis of physical function in patients with spinal cord infarction. 6 7 In the current case, where the prognosis was poor, we hypothesise that B-SES and VR-guided body trunk training may have contributed to the improvement of the ASIA scores of the lower limb movement and trunk function index, respectively ( table 1 and figure 2 ). Both modalities were feasible, and no adverse events or safety concerns were observed. The present findings are based on a single case and should be interpreted with caution; nevertheless, they suggest that B-SES and VR-guided training may be used in clinical practice, where the relevant equipment is available.\n\n【53】Electrical stimuli reportedly do not contribute towards improving the walking ability in a patient with spinal cord injury; rather they only prevent skeletal muscle atrophy, impact postural stability or positively affect lower extremity skeletal muscle metabolic activity shown by positron emission tomography. 9 15–18 A recent systematic review of five controlled trials evaluating the impact of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy showed no strong evidence supporting its superiority over other treatment strategies used to gain strength in partially paralysed muscles after spinal cord injury. 16 However, in the present case, electrical stimulation seemed to improve lower limb function, further improving walking ability, as the walkable distance tripled from 20 m to 60 m. This discrepancy in findings might be, at least in part, owing to the partially reversible neurological damage present, caused by ischaemia of the spinal artery rather than complete spinal injury. 6 7 Several reports have stated that physical function of patients with spinal cord infarction improves over time. 7 15 In the present case, we speculated that repetitive stimuli input may have activated the spinal nerves that escaped damage (hibernating neurons) and reorganised the remaining neural circuit.\n\n【54】A study of the effect of sitting-position balance training using VR in patients with paraplegia demonstrated that the improvement in balance function index was proportional to the duration of intervention compared with task training, such as the activity of daily living training. 19 This report is consistent with our results, and VR has elements that promote motor learning for balance acquisition. 19–21 The existence of sensory feedback is critical in the motor learning process, and the mediVR KAGURA used in this study can give three types of sensory feedback, including visual, auditory and tactile. 12–14 Such feedback enabled capturing of the reach distance errors from multiple angles, which promoted relearning of sitting balance. 13 14 19–21 Furthermore, using immersive VR with a game-like feature assisted with internal motivation to conduct many reach movements by the patient, which may have been effective for learning. 20 21\n\n【55】This report only described a single case, and distinguishing its outcomes from the natural disease course is challenging due to the timing of the intervention. 6 That is, it is difficult to confidently say that B-SES and VR mainly contributed to the patient’s gains. 6 In addition, the 20 min/day of additional self-training performed in this case might have boosted the improvements of our patient’s symptoms because her functional improvement coincides with the length of time the patient was seen for treatment. In addition, the FACT score is a tool for the assessment of patients with stroke rather than for the assessment of those with spinal cord injury or infarction. Consequently, it is plausible that some improvements in trunk function were not detected by this scale. 22 However, we reported this case of spinal cord infarction since it suggested the possibility that electrical stimulation therapy and sitting-position balance training using VR improved the paraplegic function and the trunk function index, respectively. The benefits of neuromuscular electrical stimulation or VR-guided training have been previously reported, 23–28 and further studies on the clinical effects in patients with spinal cord infarction are expected in the future.\n\n【56】### Learning points\n\n【57】*   Owing to its low frequency of occurrence, reports on the rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord infarction are scarce.\n    \n*   The combination of conventional physical therapy with belt electrode skeletal muscle electrical stimulation and virtual reality-guided balance training may have contributed to improving the lower-limb movement and trunk function index, respectively.\n    \n*   Improved limb and trunk function of patients with spinal cord infarction improved activities of daily living such as walking and transferring.\n    \n\n【58】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【59】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【60】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Following discussion with otorhinolaryngology, a diagnostic laryngotracheobronscopy was performed. This demonstrated a large subglottic haemangioma (SGH) occluding 80% of the airway ( figure 2 ). She was subsequently intubated and sedated, admitted to paediatric intensive care unit for careful monitoring and given propranolol therapy. Dexamethasone was prescribed concurrently while the propranolol was titrated upwards over 3 days to 3 mg/kg/day. Blood glucose and electrolyte levels were monitored closely without any significant derangement seen. Following 1 week of treatment, her cutaneous haemangioma and SGH reduced in size ( figures 3 and 4 ). She was extubated and stepped down to a paediatric ward for further monitoring and investigation for a possible atrial haemangioma.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Cutaneous haemangioma located on the patient’s upper back.\n\n【9】<img/>\n\n【10】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【11】Figure 2\n\n【12】Annotated image of subglottic haemangioma (\\*) occluding over 80% of airway identified on emergency laryngotracehobronscopy.

She had developed a biphasic wheeze by 6 weeks of age and was given multiple diagnoses by different clinicians, including new-born wheeze and chest infection. There was no familial history of atopy or asthma. It was not until her second attendance at the emergency department that a thorough examination was conducted by a paediatrician who associated the haemangioma on her upper back with her respiratory symptoms.\n\n【22】Infantile haemangiomas (IHs) are one of the most common benign vascular tumours of infancy affecting up to 10% of children. 1 They usually develop in the head and neck region as cutaneous haemangiomas but can manifest as a paediatric upper airway infantile haemangioma (UAIH), typically in the subglottic region. 2 Our case is particularly noteworthy as the cutaneous involvement was found on the patient’s upper back. IH occurring outside of the face is rare (<19%) in the context of UAIH, and the back specifically is yet more uncommon. 3 For example, only one case in a 15-patient series by Marianowski _et al_ was found to involve the patient’s back 4 and similarly 2 patients in the 38-patient series by Uthurriagua _et al_ . 3\n\n【23】Due to the rarity of the UAIH, it has been difficult to draw conclusions between cutaneous haemangiomas and synchronous lesions in the upper airway. However, when there is an association between cutaneous haemangioma and UAIH, the suspicion is almost always raised with cutaneous lesions in the classical ‘beard’ distribution or with PHACES syndrome. The most high-risk skin patterns for UAIH are large segmental mandibular IH, as well as segmental IH of the lower lip and neck. 3 This case is a clear demonstration that UAIH can occur alongside non-segmental cutaneous involvement in an atypical distribution, in this case, the patient’s upper back.\n\n【24】Despite the rarity of the disease, it is important for clinicians to recognise the association between cutaneous haemangiomas and UAIH as untreated mortality rates approach 50%. 2 There are multiple treatment options for IH; propranolol (beta blocker) is now widely accepted as first-line treatment with research supporting its overall efficacy and safety. 5\n\n【25】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【26】We noticed our daughter developed a slight wheeze, at first we thought she had just caught a common cold; however, it turns out this was the first symptom of our daughter’s condition. Over the course of the 2 weeks leading up to our daughter’s diagnosis the wheeze gradually got worse and began to sound like a honking noise. Our daughter’s behaviour also changed drastically during that 2 week period, she went from being a content happy baby to screaming most of the day unless she was asleep. She was visibly working hard to breathe and became increasingly lethargic as a result. 5 days prior to her admission into PICU she also halved her daily milk intake, she went from taking 6 oz bottles to only taking 1 oz at a time. During this period, our daughter’s visible haemangioma on her back also grew significantly as I began to notice I could now feel it through her clothes as it became increasingly raised. As a mother I knew something wasn’t right and thankfully I persisted with seeking medical help until our daughter was finally diagnosed a full 2 weeks after her wheeze first appeared. We are so grateful that our daughter is recovering so well.\n\n【27】### Learning points\n\n【28】*   While clinicians must be able to recognise the high-risk ‘beard’ distribution of cutaneous haemangioma with upper airway infantile haemangioma (UAIH), our case demonstrates this can occur when the cutaneous distribution is not classical.\n    \n*   The presence of stridor and/or respiratory distress in infants with any form of cutaneous haemangioma should prompt clinicians to consider UAIH.\n    \n*   In these cases, swift referral to an otolaryngologist and initiation of propranolol under close observation is crucial and can be life-saving.\n    \n\n【29】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【30】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【31】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The most commonly affected sites are the ulnar or radial bursae of the hand. 1 2 In 80% of the population, these bursae are interconnected, giving rise to horseshoe-shaped tenosynovitis. 3 These are difficult to diagnose and excise at very late presentation. 4 Here we present a similar case report which was diagnosed and treated successfully at our centre.\n\n【5】Case: A 50-year-old man presented to us with swelling over his left wrist and palm.

But in due course of time over the last 4 years, it increased in size involving the wrist, hypothenar eminence and little finger base. The patient had intermittent mild pain and discomfort with restriction in the little finger’s terminal flexion (distal interphalangeal joint). He had tingling sensation and paraesthesia over the distribution region of the median nerve. It was more in the night. On examination of the swelling, it was an hourglass swelling, soft and doughy, cross-fluctuant and strong; gritty crepitus was palpable on the movement of fingers ( figure 1A ). The X-rays of the wrist, hand and chest were normal with only local soft tissue shadow and no bony abnormality. The patient had a scar over the ulnar aspect of palm because before presenting to us, he had undergone a needle aspiration somewhere else. The culture report was sterile. We did an MRI scan of the hand, which showed thickened synovium with internal T2 hypointense foci surrounding the flexor tendon ( figure 1B,C ). Haematological work-up revealed normal counts. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 20. The total leucocyte count was 8200. Mantoux test was negative.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】(A) Clinical images showing ganglion on either side of wrist (arrow marked). The same can also be seen in the coronal (B) and sagittal (C) cut MRI as T2 hypointense foci surrounding the flexor tendon sheath in the palmar region and distal forearm (arrow marked).\n\n【10】After all the necessary investigations, an excisional biopsy was planned for the tenosynovium. Under a tourniquet, through a volar approach, the ulnar aspect’s flexor tenosynovium was explored after incising the subcutaneous tissue and aponeurosis ( figure 2A,B ). Gross swollen tenosynovium was found ulnarly at the wrist, hypothenar area, and the swelling was continuing until the fifth finger’s base. Carpal tunnel was cut and released in view of median nerve decompression. After careful dissection and taking care of the neurovascular structures, radical excision of the synovial sheath of tendons was done. Caseating fibrinous materials, amber-coloured fluids with melon seed bodies and rice bodies were found in abundance. The flexor superficialis tendon of the little finger was found adherent to the inflamed synovium, so it was sacrificed. The tissue was sent for biopsy ( figure 2C ). Intraoperative findings were corroborative of compound palmar ganglion. The wound was closed in layers after thorough washing. A volar cock-up splint was applied for 2 weeks. Finger movements were encouraged from day 2. Histopathology examination confirmed tuberculosis, and anti-tubercular therapy was started. At 6 months of follow-up, the patient did not have a recurrence in swelling, and the wrist and finger movements were normal.\n\n【11】<img/>\n\n【12】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【13】Figure 2\n\n【14】(A) Intraoperative findings showing the two ends of dumbbell ganglion (arrow marked); the rice bodies are seen in situ (B) and after excision (C) with cyst wall.\n\n【15】Extrapulmonary tuberculosis involves mainly lymph nodes, bones, joints, gastrointestinal tracts, tendon sheaths, etc. 5 Tuberculosis of the synovial sheath of flexor tendons of hands involving the radial or ulnar bursa is rare but not uncommon. 4 6 Dominant upper limb is most commonly involved. 7 Men are affected more and those who are generally farmers, labourers or involved in animal husbandry. 1 8 Tuberculous tenosynovitis is caused due to haematogenous spread from a primary focus of infection or by direct inoculation from adjacent infected tissue. 9 The progression of disease is slow and insidious. Initially, the symptoms are minimal. There is mild swelling around the wrist initially, which involves the adjacent areas over few months to years. Most of the patients present with a dumbbell-shaped swelling across both sides of the flexor retinaculum with a positive cross fluctuation test. 1 They come very late for medical advice after the development of pain, discomfort, median nerve compression symptoms, 10 and restrictions of movement of fingers or wrists. Local signs of inflammations are very minor, 8 and have three stages. 7\n\n【16】Stage 1 (hygromatous): increased synovial exudates inside the sheath is found.\n\n【17】Stage 2 (serofibrinous): caseous debris and fibrous tissue replace the exudates (rice and melon seed bodies).\n\n【18】Stage 3 (fungoid): extensive caseation and sinus formation with bone and joint involvement.\n\n【19】These types of swelling have a large category of differential diagnoses like pyogenic tenosynovitis, fungal infection, rheumatoid arthritis, gouty arthritis, infected ganglion, foreign body reaction granuloma, pigmented villonodular synovitis, sarcoidosis, brucellosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc. 11 12 Radiograph of local region is usually normal, unless in a later stage when the chronic mass effect causes bone erosion. Ultrasonography is a cost-effective, easy and early non-invasive diagnostic modality. It shows an increased volume of synovial tendon sheath with a fluid collection. MRI is the gold standard of investigation because of its excellent soft tissue delineation. 13 T2-weighted images give a nice depiction of fluid content inside synovium with a mixed solid cystic constituency. Gadolinium-enhanced imaging can also be done. MRI shows the extended abscess formation and spread of inflammation. 13 Histopathology of synovial tissue reveals granulomatous lesions with central caseation surrounded by multiple giant cells and epithelioid cells. Characteristic ‘rice bodies’ or ‘melon seed bodies’ are found inside the synovial sheaths of tendons. 12 They are soft, elastic and spongy in a constituency that floats in synovium after the inflammatory stage. These are believed to be synovial fringes or villous subendothelial vascular connective tissue processes covered by endothelium, which detaches from the sheath by gradual movements of tendons and remains inside tenosynovium. There is the precipitation of fibrin over these bodies. Four chemotherapy drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) are recommended for 12 months following diagnosis and radical tenosynovectomy. 4 Still, recurrence is common. 6\n\n【20】### Learning points\n\n【21】*   Tubercular tenosynovitis (compound palmar ganglion) is rare in present times.\n    \n*   Rice bodies or melon seeds are commonly formed and abundantly found.\n    \n*   It is easy to diagnose but often neglected leading to carpal tunnel syndrome.\n    \n\n【22】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【23】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【24】Obtained.\n\n【25】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【26】The radiology department of our institute for giving us the MRI pictures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

On examination, he had severe trismus and left-sided mandibular swelling with tenderness. Flexible nasendoscopy revealed significant postradiotherapy changes at the tongue base and larynx, and a left vocal cord palsy; however, there were no signs of tumour recurrence.\n\n【5】The patient has a history of a surgically excised T1 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the soft palate and carcinoma in situ of the left tonsillar pillar in 2015. This was followed by T2N2b SCC of the left pyriform fossa treated with chemoradiotherapy in 2016, which included cisplatin and radiotherapy 65 Gy in 30 fractions. He had been asymptomatic since treatment.\n\n【6】Initial contrast CT neck and thorax found no definite cause for his symptoms, recommending MRI neck with contrast for further investigation. This revealed inflammatory changes including joint space narrowing with bone and soft tissue oedema ( figure 1 ), with a differential diagnosis of septic arthritis/osteomyelitis in the atlantoaxial joint or osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Initially, due to the involvement of both sides of the joint, the diagnosis of septic arthritis was favoured prompting admission for intravenous antibiotics. Discussion with radiology suggested that repeat imaging after initial treatment would be beneficial. Repeat MRI neck 1 week later showed more extensive changes in this region centred around the left atlantoaxial joint which was now eroded ( figure 2 ), despite patient remaining well. After multidisciplinary discussion with radiology and neurosurgery, the patient was diagnosed with ORN of the C1 and C2 vertebra and discharged with 6 weeks of oral antibiotics, Miami J collar, and close clinical and radiological surveillance.\n\n【7】<img/>\n\n【8】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【9】Figure 1\n\n【10】Axial CT image showing soft tissue component between internal carotid artery and jugular vein.\n\n【11】<img/>\n\n【12】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【13】Figure 2\n\n【14】Coronal postcontrast MRI showing eroded left atlanto-axial joint.\n\n【15】The patient remained stable over the following months with repeat MRI neck imaging 1.5 months later showing no progression of the joint and soft tissue changes. He remains under close review to prevent recognised complications such as secondary osteomyelitis, spinal deformity and spinal cord compression. 1\n\n【16】ORN of the cervical spine is a rare but serious consequence of radiation therapy for head and neck cancers with documented cases limited to a small number of published reports, with the most common documented side effect being dysphagia. 2 3 The difficulty in diagnosis for this particular patient lies in the lack of clearly identifiable ORN features on his imaging. Studies have compared various MR imaging characteristics of cervical ORN with recurrence of malignant disease, but little is documented in terms of differentiating features of cervical ORN from septic arthritis. 4 Clinically, septic arthritis and ORN of the cervical spine share presenting local symptoms of neck pain and stiffness, however septic arthritis would also present systemically with fever, raised inflammatory markers and possible neurological deficits. Such deficits may also be seen in advanced stages of ORN. Radiologically, however, these diagnoses have overlapping features, with similar appearances of contrast enhancement locations within cervical vertebrae, surrounding soft tissue appearance and joints space narrowing. 5 This case highlights several important points: the long-term morbidity of radiotherapy, the importance of multidisciplinary team working and the differential diagnosis, corroboration of clinical findings with imaging.\n\n【17】### Learning points\n\n【18】*   Osteoradionecrosis in the cervical spine is a rare complication of radiation therapy treatment for head and neck cancers.\n    \n*   Features of cervical osteoradionecrosis can be difficult to distinguish from other pathologies such as malignancy recurrence and septic arthritis.\n    \n*   Patients with suspected or confirmed cervical osteonecrosis require close review and imaging surveillance to promptly identify any deterioration in the stability of the bone.\n    \n\n【19】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【20】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【21】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【22】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【23】A non-author contributor is Ms Catriona Douglas, responsible for highlighting the case and gaining consent from the patient, as well as reviewing final draft of text.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The patient had a supracondylar knee fracture 4 months ago, and underwent open reduction, internal fixation with condylar screw and plate. Over the past weeks, the patient presented with signs of knee arthroplasty infection, including knee pain, oedema, effusion and increased local temperature. In spite of catecholaminergic therapy, antibiotic therapy (vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam), fluid resuscitation and intubation, the patient deteriorated and developed multiorgan failure requiring renal replacement therapy. _Staphylococcus aureus_ was isolated from his blood cultures and synovial fluid from an arthrocentesis of the knee joint. The patient underwent surgical removal of the knee prosthesis. However, over the following days, chest Computed Tomography (CT) revealed new multifocal bilateral infiltrates; the patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia from multidrug-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , which was treated with intravenous administration of colistin for 10 days. Repeat chest CT showed development of new extensive bilateral pulmonary nodular infiltrates.\n\n【5】Galactomannan test was positive and PCR in bronchoalveolar lavage detected aspergillosis, so the patient was treated with voriconazole. After 3 weeks, the patient was weaned off of ventilator support to tracheostomy. The patient suddenly developed respiratory distress with severe hypoxaemia and consequent respiratory and cardiac arrest. A video bronchoscopy with disposable bronchoscope (Ambu) revealed large blood clots at the end of the tracheal cannula in the tracheobronchial tree, which could not be removed with flexible instruments. We, therefore, introduced a rigid bronchoscope (Efer Dumon) through the tracheal stoma, because the patient had a marked trisma, and we could not insert it through the mouth. After the removal with forceps of some parts of the clot that occluded the distal portion of the tracheal cannula, we were able to remove a large clot with rigid alligator forceps ( figure 1 ). In the meantime, the patient underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and after 20 min he returned to spontaneous circulation. The bleeding source was identifiable from the lateral segment of the right lower bronchus, and a Fogarty balloon was inserted for the control of endobronchial bleeding. A part of clot was sent to our laboratory department and was confirmed as an _Aspergillus_ infection. Pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis represents an extensive involvement of the whole tracheobronchial tree, with membranous sloughs containing _Aspergillus_ overlying the mucosa. It generally presents as intraluminal, circumferential pseudomembrane and exudate with only superficial mucosal invasion or as mucus plugs, which may result in airway occlusion, or tracheal bronchooesophageal fatal haemorrhage from bronchoarterial fistula. 1–3 The patient died after 8 weeks from admission to ICU due to complications related to sepsis.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Blood clot removed using rigid bronchoscopy, showing a ‘coral shape’ representing the tracheobronchial tree.\n\n【10】### Learning points\n\n【11】*   In patients receiving prolonged antibacterial treatment, aspergillosis and its complications should be always ruled out.\n    \n*   In case of obstruction of the airway, pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis with extensive involvement of the whole tracheobronchial tree should always be taken into consideration.\n    \n*   Pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis is a very serious condition, with high mortality and mobility.\n    \n\n【12】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【13】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【14】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Physical examination revealed multiple non-palpable retiform purpura over the involved limbs and abdomen ( figures 1–3 ). The patient appeared toxic and febrile and gradually went into shock. Laboratory investigations revealed total serum bilirubin of 7.4 mg/dL with direct fraction of 4 mg/dL, alanine transaminase of 540 IU, aspartate transaminase fo 352 IU, serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, haemoglobin of 6.5 g/dL, platelet count of 100×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, total leucocyte count of 17 000×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and International Normalised Ratio (INR) of 1.87. On further evaluation, scrub typhus IgM came positive along with HEV IgM. HEV PCR could not be tested due to unavailability. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM were negative. Malaria rapid test and leptospira IgM were also negative. However, potein C and potein S were found to be low. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 20 white cells with 60% polymorphonuclear cells. Ultrasound (USG) of the whole abdomen was normal. Skin biopsy from the calf area showed vasculopathic changes. CSF cultures revealed no growth of any organism. The patient was initially started on meropenem, doxycycline and linezolid for 7 days and other supportive measures like intravenous fluids and inotropes. Thereafter, doxycycline was continued for total of 14 days. Diagnosis of purpura fulminans complicating scrub typhus and acute hepatitis E coinfection was made.

The cap and the safety tab of the applicator were removed and loaded with the implant. Applicator was injected in vitreous cavity 3.5 mm from the limbus in the inferonasal quadrant at an angle of 45° with respect to the scleral surface. The actuator button was pressed and an audible click was heard. During the withdrawal of the applicator, it was realised that the implant was partly inside the scleral tunnel and partly in the subconjunctival space (broken into three pieces). A limited conjunctival peritomy was done to remove the implant segments from the subconjunctival space ( figure 1A ). Part of the implant stuck within the scleral tunnel was held with fine-toothed forceps and gently removed ( figure 1B ). The entry site and vitreous were inspected for any other implant residues, but none were found. Since we had completely removed all the broken pieces of the implant, a new applicator was used to deliver another dexamethasone implant at a different site. On a follow-up of 6 months, no adverse effect was noted and the intraocular pressure was within the normal limit at every visit.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】(A) External photograph of the left eye (taken intraoperatively) showing retained pieces of Ozurdex implant (blue arrow) in the subconjunctival space after localised conjunctival peritomy. (B) Removal of retained intrascleral piece of Ozurdex implant (blue arrow) with fine-toothed forceps.\n\n【9】We hypothesise following reasons for the inadvertent delivery of the implant at an unexpected location:\n\n【10】*   Lack of coordination between pressing the actuator button and withdrawal of the applicator or incomplete pressing of the actuator button.\n    \n*   Default in machinery delivering the implant despite adequate pressure on the applicator.\n    \n\n【11】There are some reports in the literature where the Ozurdex implant was delivered at an unusual site. Fenolland _et al_ reported a case of inadvertent delivery of the Ozurdex implant into subconjunctival space, which was left as such. 1 They decided not to remove the broken implants. We chose to explore as we were not sure of the location of the implant and felt that the intrascleral fragments might not elicit a desired therapeutic response. Accidental intralenticular injection of implant has been reported previously by Chhabra _et al_ requiring cataract surgery after 3 months. 2 In another study, the dexamethasone implant was stuck intrasclerally which was mechanically pushed into the vitreous cavity. 3 In our patient, we did not push the intrascleral fragment because of the fear of crushing it within the scleral tunnel. The safety profile of intravitreal dexamethasone has been reported to be reasonably good, so we decided to inject one more dexamethasone implant in the same sitting and the lack of adverse effects on follow-up further justifies our management approach. 4 The patient responded well to the new implant, with a reduction in macular thickness and improvement in best-corrected visual acuity to 20/30 at 6 weeks postinjection. The present case acknowledges a rare possibility of Ozurdex implant being delivered at an unexpected location, the probable reasons and steps to avoid it. Finally, the authors suggest their technique to tackle it, in case such an event happens.\n\n【12】### Patients’s perspective\n\n【13】I am thankful to the treating physician for explaining the potential complications of a dexamethasone implant. I was relieved when they explained to me that they had removed the broken implant pieces and injected another implant safely. My eye was red for around 1 week postoperatively, which gradually recovered. My vision is gradually recovering, and I am aware of future complications of this implant but currently not facing any trouble.\n\n【14】### Learning points\n\n【15】We suggest the following measures to avoid the Ozurdex implant being delivered at an unexpected site:\n\n【16】*   Smaller intrascleral tunnel and visualisation of the tip of the applicator in the vitreous cavity before delivering the implant.\n    \n*   Ensure that the actuator button is completely pressed and is locked flush with the applicator before withdrawal.\n    \n*   Hear the audible click clearly after pressing the actuator button, wait a while and visualise the implant going into the vitreous if feasible (might not be possible always depending on the direction of the injector/applicator).\n    \n*   Document and inform the manufacturer for quality control and random check whether the implant gets delivered completely after pressing the applicator key.\n    \n\n【17】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【18】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【19】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Examination findings were consistent with fracture of the left neck of femur. Laboratory investigations, including ECG, were normal. He was discharged after total left hip arthroplasty. During outpatient evaluation for syncope and dizziness, his 24-hour Holter examination showed predominantly sinus rhythm with episodes of first-degree atrioventricular block, ventricular ectopy <1%. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large, elongated, mobile left atrial mass with no clear attachment, measuring 4.8 cm × 1.6 cm and a dilated left atrium. ( figure 1 ). Transoesophageal echocardiogram revealed a 4.7 cm × 3.5 cm × 2.6 cm multilobulated, gelatinous, mobile left atrial mass attached to the area around the fossa ovalis of the interatrial septum not prolapsing through or obstructing the mitral valve ( figure 2 , video 1 ). CT of thorax, abdomen and the pelvis confirmed intracardiac left atrial mass. There were no signs of extracardiac primary malignancy, metastatic disease or lymphadenopathy. Preoperative workup for surgery was carried out. Coronary angiogram revealed severe proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis and diffuse mild disease in the left circumflex and right coronary artery. He was started on secondary prevention for coronary artery disease. He underwent surgery for myxoma resection and coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery. Electrical cardioversion was done for postoperative atrial fibrillation. The patient was discharged home following restoration of sinus rhythm.

Most often located in the left atrium, they can also be seen in the right atrium and ventricles. 1 They are usually seen in middle-aged patients with a reported mean age of 56 years. 2 The prevalence of coronary artery disease in patients with myxoma has not been clearly defined. Previous studies have reported a wide range, from 0% tp 11%. 3–6 Erdil _et al_ found a 36% prevalence rate of CAD 2 whereas Fueredi _et al_ 7 and Velasco _et al_ 8 reporting a higher prevalence (66.7% and 82%, respectively). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 109 patients with cardiac myxoma by Silva _et al_ showed a CAD prevalence ranging from 5.3% to 36.3% with an average of 20.7%. 9 Patients with myxoma can present with constitutional symptoms, dyspnoea, angina, syncope or embolic manifestations. In addition, myxomas can present as myocardial infarction secondary to arterial embolisation. 10 Transthoracic echocardiography is the initial modality, but transoesophageal echo is more sensitive. In cases of uncertainty, after transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram, CT or myocardial resonance imaging can be useful for diagnosis. 11–13 A definite diagnosis is made on biopsy. In isolated myxomas, surgical excision is the definitive treatment and should be performed early to reduce embolic complications, particularly stroke. 14 Management in patients with myxoma and concomitant CAD differs. Coronary angiography aids in identifying underlying obstructive coronary artery disease and provides information about tumour vascularity before surgery in patients with myxoma. 8 There are no definite guidelines, but patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction with myxoma undergo emergent percutaneous intervention with resection later 15 whereas those with stable coronary artery disease can undergo coronary artery bypass grafting and tumour resection simultaneously.\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】*   Cardiac mass should be considered in the differential diagnosis of syncope in all age groups.\n    \n*   Myxomas can present in old age.\n    \n*   Patients with myxomas can have underlying silent coronary artery disease.\n    \n\n【17】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【18】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【19】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【20】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【21】Dr Craig Barr, Consultant cardiologist, Dudley Group Foundation Trust.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Pharmacological therapy (beta blockers and calcium channel blockers) is first line as they improve obstructive symptoms by decreasing the heart rate and prolonging diastolic fill time, elevating their quality of life. 4 Septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation are available for severe cases with the goal of decreasing the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction gradient and restoring proper flow. 4–6 There have also been a small number of cases using covered stents to occlude septal perforators—due to collateralisation, there has been mixed long-term results. 7–10\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A woman in her 60s was evaluated following an abnormal echocardiogram, indicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Symptoms were progressively worsening for 6–18 months and included severe exertional dyspnoea, exertional chest pressure, exertional dizziness and resting dizziness, which worsened while dehydrated. History of cerebrovascular accident, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. No family cardiac history including no sudden death. Brief smoking history 35 years ago. Medication included 100 mg/day metoprolol. Physical examination showed a body mass index (BMI) of 34.39 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> BMI and a 2/6 aortic area systolic murmur, which increased to 3/6 with Valsalva and standing.\n\n【13】The original echocardiogram ( figure 1 ) showed ejection fraction of 70%–75%, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with dynamic subaortic stenosis and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (156 mm Hg gradient with provocation) and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Cardiac MRI ( figure 2 ) displayed a severe ostial tract obstruction (130 mm Hg gradient with provocation) and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation with systolic anterior motion. Myectomy or alcohol septal ablation were offered. Investigatory coronary angiogram found mild-to-moderate non-obstructive coronary artery disease involving the right coronary artery and a significant subaortic outflow tract gradient of >100 mm Hg with spike and dome pattern—alcohol septal ablation was planned.\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】Figure 1\n\n【17】Echocardiograms prestent placement (top) and poststent placement (bottom).

A 0.14 coronary wire was placed into the second septal perforator. A 2.0 balloon occluded the second septal perforator’s origin and dye was injected distally. There was no extravasation or backflow in the left anterior descending; however, dye was seen within the right ventricle—confirmed echocardiographically with the presence of Definity contrast agent in the right ventricle ( figure 3 ). Wiring of the third and fourth septal perforators was then attempted. During which, a flow-limiting dissection of the mid-left anterior descending was identified. Due to these procedural findings, the alcohol septal ablation was not performed. Instead, a Papyrus 3.5 × 20 mm covered stent was placed at the origins of the third and fourth septal perforators overlapping distally with a Xience 2.75 × 12 mm drug-eluted stent ( figure 4 ). This resulted in thrombolysis in myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3 flow and improvement of the left ventricular outflow tract gradient from 90 to 30 mm Hg with provocation, measured intraoperatively. On follow-up evaluation, her symptoms had drastically decreased and an echocardiogram showed a significantly improved left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 35–49 mm Hg with provocation (original echocardiogram showed 156–158 mm Hg; figure 1 ). Her decreased symptoms are stable 2 months postprocedure.\n\n【23】<img/>\n\n【24】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【25】Figure 3\n\n【26】Cardiac Catheterization image and simultaneousechocardiogram showing Definity contrast agent in the right ventricle when injected into the second septal perforator.

Two months postoperation, their symptoms remained decreased.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】The present case used a covered stent since the original plan of alcohol septal ablation was abandoned due to mid-left anterior descending dissection and communication of the second septal perforator with the right ventricle. Stent placement over the origins of the third and fourth septal perforators resulted in a significantly decreased left ventricular outflow tract obstruction gradient as well as improved symptoms. While this is an atypical approach, it has been used previously. 7–10\n\n【35】The first successful case of treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with a covered stent was published in 1999. A covered stent was used to cover the origins of three septal perforators since balloon occlusion of each perforator individually only led to a partial gradient decrease. The intervention led to a ‘complete reduction’ in the gradient and after 4 months, the patient remained asymptomatic. 10 In 2003, an alcohol septal ablation was unable to be performed due to the branch angle of the first septal perforator so a stent was placed occluding the origin. This resulted in 6 asymptomatic months with a decreased gradient (21 mm Hg) before collateralisation from the right coronary artery resulted in recurrence of symptoms and gradient (97 mm Hg); myectomy was then performed. 7 In 2004, a covered stent was used due to the inability to cannulate the first septal artery; collateralisation from the right coronary artery led to symptom recurrence after an undisclosed period of time. 8 Finally, in 2006, a woman with coronary artery disease and an alcohol septal ablation 6 months prior had a covered stent placed after symptom recurrence due to 70% stenosis of the left anterior descending and D1. Twelve months after placement, her gradient remained low and she was asymptomatic. 9 These cases display the varying reasons for covered stent placement to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy along with their results over a relatively short follow-up period.\n\n【36】Our patient remains improved 2 months postprocedure, which is consistent with previous cases. However, two of the four previous cases ultimately resulted in symptom recurrence due to collateralisation and the two that did not either had a previous alcohol septal ablation performed or was only 4 months postprocedure. With that said, since alcohol septal ablation was contraindicated due to the risk of leaking through the dissection or ablating a portion of the right ventricle through the communication, the covered stent was a satisfactory backup for this unique patient. Additionally, with the limited data available, it seems that treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by occluding the origins of septal perforators with a covered stent provides short-term symptom relief and a reduced gradient. Nevertheless, long-term results are uncertain at this point and more data is needed to draw further conclusions.\n\n【37】### Learning points\n\n【38】*   To understand how using a covered stent to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction can be considered in cases where alcohol septal ablation is either difficult or contraindicated.\n    \n*   To recognise that while this case shows short-term efficacy, long-term conclusions should not be drawn due to varying results with previous case reports and no long-term follow-up.\n    \n*   To acknowledge that more scientific data must validate this approach before it is routinely considered concomitantly with alcohol septal ablation or myectomy.\n    \n\n【39】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【40】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【41】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

A skin biopsy specimen was taken, revealing hyperkeratosis and perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. Biological and immunological tests were normal.\n\n【18】On further questioning, the patient admitted he had several unprotected sex with female partners in the last few months. The patient could not remember having had any previous genital or extragenital chancre. Screening serum tests for the different sexually diseases were performed and found: a venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) of 1/8 controlled to 1/16, and _Treponema pallidum_ haemagglutination assay titer of 1280 UI. Antihuman immunodeficiency virus antibodies, hepatitis C and hepatitis B serology were negative. Blood and urine cultures were negative. He was treated with an intramuscular injection of benzathine benzylpenicillin 2.4 million units as a single dose. The patient was instructed to use condoms in the future and to contact all persons with whom he had sexual contact within the last year, so that they could be evaluated for sexually transmitted diseases. No Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurred and the lesions cleared within 2 months with resident hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation. The VDRL test reverted to negative.\n\n【19】Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete _T. pallidum_ . Although the syphilis is a controllable disease, it continues to be a major public health problem worldwide. 1 While primary syphilis, often presents with the classical painless chancre; secondary syphilis is a notorious ‘great imitator’ due to its variability of presentation and imitation of other diseases. Syphilis lesions are usually asymptomatic and may undergo spontaneous remission. In addition, these patients can be asymptomatic for various years before developing tertiary syphilis and therefore affecting severely other organs, leading in some cases to life-threatening complications. 2\n\n【20】The most common cutaneous presentation for secondary syphilis is a generalised, non-pruritic, papulosquamous eruption varying from pink to brown; but it can present with different atypical features, especially in the immunocompromised patient: macular, maculopapular, papulosquamous, 3 nodular, 1 psoriasiform, 4 pustular, impetigo-like, 5 vesicular, corymbose, 2 lenticular, annular, 6 7 follicular, ulceronecrotic, granulomatous and pigmentary lesions. 2 8 Mucous membrane lesions are infectious. 8\n\n【21】Moreover, other organs may be affected: lymphoreticular, ophthalmological, musculoskeletal, haematological, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular and gastric. 8\n\n【22】The positivity of serological tests and histology may be helpful in atypical cases, but histological features of secondary syphilis are polymorphic.\n\n【23】Syphilis has devastating complications if left untreated. It is avoidable if it is treated with effective antibiotics.\n\n【24】### Learning points\n\n【25】*   Our case was characterised by unusual manifestations and contribute to, raising the awareness of physicians about atypical clinical aspects of syphilis.\n    \n*   Failure to recognise and appropriately treat this infection may have threatening complications.\n    \n*   It is worth testing for syphilis in patients with unexplained cutaneous rash, especially those who failed the standard therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Her medical history included hypertension, asthma and remote postpartum pulmonary embolism. There was a strong family history of atherosclerosis.

Myocardial infarction was ruled out and the truncal pain subsided. However, 2 days postdischarge, she was diagnosed with aortic intraluminal thrombus (ILT) with embolisation into the lower extremities.

Associated clinical features range from chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea to life-threatening anaphylaxis. 1 2 In theory, volume losses and dehydration from iron-induced gastrointestinal (GI) losses can be harmful. Several studies have reported ischaemic events, including venous thromboembolism and stroke, that were attributable to volume contraction. 3–5 Dehydration increases blood viscosity and is also thought to affect coagulation factors such as von Willebrand factor. 6 In this report, we describe an unusual case of acute limb ischaemia secondary to acute aortic intraluminal thrombus (ILT) and embolisation which followed a severe GI reaction to IV iron sucrose.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A woman in her 50s presented with microcytic anaemia and iron deficiency (haemoglobin, 76 g/L (reference range (RR), 115–165); mean corpuscular volume 68.9 fL (RR, 82–99); serum ferritin, 2 µg/L (RR, <23 indicating iron deficiency)). She could not tolerate oral iron due to constipation. Upper and lower endoscopy and small bowel follow-through studies were negative. Screening tests for coeliac disease were negative. The iron deficiency anaemia was attributed to low nutritional iron intake and menstrual blood losses. Medical history included hypertension (treated with felodipine and cilazapril), asthma (treated with inhalers and montelukast) and postpartum pulmonary embolism 21 years earlier treated with heparin followed by 3 months of warfarin, without ongoing anticoagulation or thrombosis recurrence. She had smoked for 20 years but stopped a decade earlier. There was a strong family history of coronary artery disease.\n\n【12】She received her first dose of IV iron sucrose (Venofer), 500 mg, administered over 4 hours. She received premedication with IV dimenhydrinate (Gravol; 25 mg) and oral dexamethasone (Decadron; 10 mg). Towards the end of the infusion, she developed nausea and six episodes of bilious vomiting, as well as large volume diarrhoea with several episodes of faecal incontinence. She also complained of retrosternal chest pressure, diaphoresis and dramatic pain across her lower back. Physical examination revealed blood pressure 101/67 (reduced from 134/76 earlier in the treatment session), heart rate 110/min (increased from 73/min) and respiratory rate 14/min, without wheezes. She was transferred to the emergency room, where serial ECGs and cardiac enzymes ruled out acute myocardial ischaemia. Three hours later, her truncal pain had subsided, but she developed bilateral lower extremity pain, especially in the right-lower limb. She was monitored overnight, and her vital signs returned to normal. Although the lower-limb pain had not completely resolved by the next morning, she was discharged to home at noon.\n\n【13】Over the next 30 hours, she continued to have fluctuating lower extremity pain, especially in the right leg, with worsening difficulties with walking. She therefore attended a local emergency room, where she was found to have absent right foot pulses, lower extremity pallor and inability to dorsiflex or plantarflex her toes. She was urgently transferred to the nearest vascular surgery centre (the same institution as the clinic where she had received her iron sucrose infusion).\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】Immediately after the IV iron infusion, there was an increase in haemoglobin from 76 to 100 g/L, with a corresponding increase in haematocrit from 0.242 to 0.326, and leucocyte count increase from 5.5 to 10.0×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (RR, 4.0–11.0). The abrupt increase in haemoglobin was believed to be consistent with haemoconcentration, given the marked vomiting, diarrhoea and diaphoresis. Notably, there was a further rise in her leucocyte count to 22.3×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. In contrast, platelets decreased from 354 to 217×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (RR, 150–400) postinfusion.

Based on the observed change in haematocrit, the estimated platelet count fall was approximately 47% (ie, from 352×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L to approximately 186×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), adjusted for change in haematocrit, based on assumption of an initial intravascular blood volume of 3.5 L (per patient’s sex, height and weight), with initial estimated loss of intravascular blood volume of approximately 900 mL (consistent with initial increase in haematocrit from 0.242 to 0.326), with calculation of the adjusted platelet count measurement. Original figure prepared by TEW (coauthor). ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; h, hours; HIT, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; IV, intravenous; PF4, platelet factor 4; PO, per os; WBC, white blood count.\n\n【20】CT angiography demonstrated ILT within the distal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries. Thrombus was also noted in branches of the right profunda femoris artery, with thrombotic occlusion of the distal right popliteal artery and tibioperoneal trunk, and no contiguous runoff to the ankle. She was treated with embolectomies and fasciotomies for her acute limb ischaemia. During revascularisation surgery, an unusual mix of white clots with erythematous components was extracted. The pathologist identified platelet-rich thrombus with prominent acute inflammatory infiltrates.\n\n【21】Postoperatively, when the haematologist informed the vascular surgery service about the severe back pain that had accompanied the initial post-IV iron reaction, imaging was repeated to include the thoracic and abdominal aorta. The follow-up CT angiogram of chest and runoff showed atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, with non-occlusive thrombi in the descending thoracic aorta and near-occlusive thrombi in the distal abdominal aorta.\n\n【22】Creatine kinase peaked at 8912 U/L (RR, <168), consistent with ischaemic muscle injury. A consulting neurologist diagnosed right foot drop secondary to ischaemic injury to the common peroneal nerve, and opined that eventual good recovery was possible over the next months.\n\n【23】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【24】Given the acute postiron infusion nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis and truncal pain, and the strong family history of coronary-artery disease, concern for acute coronary syndrome was high. However, serial ECGs and troponins were unremarkable, and the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of acute GI reaction caused by IV iron sucrose infusion. Following readmission for lower-limb ischaemia and the ensuing diagnosis of acute aortic ILT, further laboratory investigations for a chronic hypercoagulability disorder all returned normal or negative (see figure 1 ).\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】Unfractionated heparin, administered intraoperatively, was continued postoperatively in therapeutic doses with monitoring by activated partial thromboplastin time, with subsequent transition to warfarin (continued postdischarge). Surgical revascularisation consisted of right popliteal embolectomy, right anterior tibial embolectomy, and right tibial peroneal trunk embolectomy with four-compartment fasciotomies. She completed combined warfarin and antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) for 1 year, followed by dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) for another year, followed by long-term aspirin monotherapy. She also received intermittent transfusion with red cell concentrates (seven units transfused over the subsequent 5 years), under the supervision of a haematologist, to manage her chronic iron deficiency anaemia.\n\n【27】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【28】Following surgery, lower-limb ultrasound demonstrated good flow and excellent ankle and toe pressures bilaterally. Her right limb motor function gradually improved over the next year. At 5 year follow-up with the vascular surgeon, she had improved neuropathic pain, and excellent perfusion, shown by repeat ultrasonography, to her lower extremities. At 7 year follow-up, she reported intermittent neuropathic pain but had healthy flow patterns by ultrasonography and normal ankle-brachial indices bilaterally.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】We describe a rare complication of bilateral lower-limb ischaemia secondary to acute aortic ILT that began after a severe GI reaction (vomiting and diarrhoea) to high-dose (500 mg) iron sucrose infusion in a patient with underlying subclinical aortic atherosclerosis. Our report is novel, as—to the best of our knowledge—occurrence of aortic ILT with resulting acute lower-limb ischaemia postiron infusion has not been reported previously. Parenteral iron sucrose is an effective and increasingly common treatment for iron deficiency, and has a favourable safety profile; for this reason, we feel it is important to highlight this rare and unusual clinical outcome.\n\n【31】Studies of IV iron infusion indicate that serious or severe adverse reactions are relatively uncommon. 7–12 The majority of such adverse reactions occur during or immediately after the first IV iron infusion. 13 GI complications of parenteral iron are associated with higher doses, and the high initial iron sucrose dose (500 mg) was likely contributory. 14 Consistent with the literature, our patient developed the adverse reaction towards the end of the 4 hour infusion, suggesting a dose-dependent GI reaction. In response to this serious adverse event, we (MP and TEW) have altered our haematology practice to start with lower initial doses of iron sucrose (generally, 200 mg), and if well tolerated, to increase the dose in 100 mg increments on subsequent administrations, to a maximum of 400 mg per dose. This practice is supported by literature, 14 indicating a high frequency of acute reactions with 500 mg iron sucrose dosing. Also, in the absence of a history of previous postiron infusion reactions, and in light of literature indicating a higher frequency of adverse reactions in patients given premedications, 15 we now omit routine administration of dimenhydrinate and corticosteroid preiron infusion.\n\n【32】Two randomised trials found that iron sucrose infusion was associated with a higher frequency of usually minor GI reactions compared with alternative formulations. 8 16 Iron sucrose formulations have higher proportions of labile iron content, which may carry more potential for toxicity from oxidative stress, especially with higher doses. 16 17\n\n【33】We note that iron deficiency anaemia per se is associated with increased risk of thrombosis, particularly in the setting of thrombocytosis. 18 19 Iron deficiency is a well-known explanation for reactive thrombocytosis due to diminished inhibition of thrombopoiesis. Our patient’s preinfusion platelet count was 352×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, an upper normal value, which was higher than subsequent platelet counts measured during long-term follow-up when her iron deficiency anaemia had resolved (the mean platelet count of eight serial measurements, obtained 3 to 8 years later, was approximately 250×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). However, many patients (like ours) who develop thrombosis in the setting of iron deficiency anaemia do not necessarily have overt thrombocytosis. 18 19 As pointed out by Al-Samkari and colleagues, 19 ‘intravenous iron replenishment may have additional advantages in mitigating the thrombogenic potential of iron deficiency’. Moreover, Nashashibi and coworkers 20 have provided laboratory evidence that IV iron therapy lowers coagulability. These investigators evaluated thrombin generation using calibrated automated thrombogram parameters, assessed before and approximately 3 weeks postiron repletion, underscoring the irony of our patient developing a dramatic thrombotic event shortly after receiving parenteral iron replacement.\n\n【34】Available literature on acute ILT and complete aortic thrombosis provides insights into potential mechanisms explaining our patient’s aortic thrombosis and associated embolisation to the distal lower-limb vasculature. A review of acute aortic thrombosis 21 listed two main underlying cardiovascular disorders, namely large-saddle embolus (eg, from a cardiac chamber) to the aortic bifurcation (not seen in our patient) or acute thrombosis within an atherosclerotic aorta (seen in our patient), with or without associated aortic aneurysmal changes (not seen in our patient). In the minority of patients with aortic thrombosis who do not evince cardiovascular disease, an acute or chronic hypercoagulability disorder (not seen in our patient) is typically found. 21–23\n\n【35】Regarding potential proximate triggers of aortic thrombosis in patients with atherosclerosis, a classic 1995 study 23 of 48 patients who presented with acute aortic thrombosis to a single vascular centre over a 19 year period identified in-situ thrombosis in 44 (92%) patients and underlying aortic atherosclerosis in 36 (75%) patients. Of particular significance, several patients with underlying aortic atherosclerosis had aortic thrombosis and acute limb ischaemia attributable to ‘low-flow state caused by … severe volume depletion’. 23 In our patient, we suggest that the severe vomiting and diarrheal illness precipitated by the iron sucrose infusion, with resulting intravascular volume contraction, helped to trigger acute platelet activation and thrombosis in the presence of endothelial disruption from pre-existing atherosclerotic disease. Our patient clearly developed marked volume depletion, corroborated by the significant haemoconcentration, as reflected by the abrupt increase in her haemoglobin (76 to 100 g/L) and haematocrit (0.242 to 0.326) values. Moreover, her platelet counts decreased abruptly following the iron infusion (352 to 217×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), a phenomenon that appears to have been even more marked (ie, from 352 to approximately 185×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) if one adjusts the platelet counts for the marked changes in haematocrit (as a lower plasma volume secondary to GI fluid losses would help mask true platelet count declines). Indeed, the estimated abrupt 47% drop in platelet count (see figure 1 legend for further discussion) is consistent with platelet consumption related to platelet deposition on the atherosclerotic aorta. Acute diaphoresis associated with volume contraction and an associated catecholamine response could have contributed to acute platelet activation. 24 Dexamethasone (premedication) administration and ensuing leucocytosis could also have contributed to the inflammatory thromboses extracted. Another potential contributing factor could have been endothelial injury, with associated adhesion of monocytes, resulting from iron sucrose infusion, as shown in an experimental model. 25\n\n【36】In summary, we report a patient with moderately severe iron deficiency anaemia who developed acute GI fluid losses (vomiting and diarrhoea) following a relatively high first-dose IV iron sucrose therapy (500 mg), with laboratory evidence of acute haemoconcentration, consumptive thrombocytopenia and leucocytosis. Progressive lower-limb ischaemia over the ensuing hours to a few days led to diagnosis of distal aortic ILT with peripheral embolisation in a patient with subclinical aortic atherosclerosis. Fortunately, emergency embolectomies and fasciotomies salvaged the lower limbs.\n\n【37】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【38】I entered the hospital for a routine iron infusion, my first. Just as the second and final bag was finishing up, I began to feel nauseated, and started to vomit. I also had a lot of diarrhoea. Not long after, I felt a pain in my back. The nurse acted quickly and called for a doctor. I was taken to the emergency department where I stayed overnight. It was in emergency that I kept telling the staff that I believed there could be blood clotting. The pain in my back was better, but I now had some pains in my legs, especially my right one, which at times was so severe that pain medication was not alleviating the pain entirely. The doctors ruled out a heart attack, and I was discharged the next day, even though the pain had not completely gone away. I even had some difficulty walking. Over the subsequent 24 hours, I was unable to sleep, eat or walk. So, that evening, I was brought to the local emergency department. It was frustrating that it took so much time to figure out that there was clotting happening in my legs. I am extremely grateful that the doctor at emergency determined that I had no pulses in my right leg and quickly called a vascular surgeon. I was provided with pain medication and was transported to the emergency room at the same hospital where I had received the iron infusion. I was admitted back into hospital and had surgery at 5 am. I learnt that I would likely lose a toe, a foot or even my leg. My family and I feel very blessed that we had a surgeon that made every effort to save my limbs, and he did. We appreciate how hard the hospital team worked to diagnose my illness and to take care of me. I spent 3 weeks in the hospital and during this time, had many tests and two surgeries. I was surprised to find out how unusual this complication is. It turns out that no one has been able to find a similar case in the medical literature of ‘aortic intraluminal thrombus’ following iron infusion, so this must be a rare side effect indeed.\n\n【39】### Learning points\n\n【40】*   Intravenous iron sucrose, especially in larger doses, can result in acute gastrointestinal toxicity, including large-volume emesis and diarrhoea, due to labile iron content.\n    \n*   Rarely, acute intravascular volume depletion can precipitate acute aortic intraluminal thrombus, perhaps as a consequence of acute haemoconcentration and catecholamine release, with acute platelet activation and consumption.\n    \n*   Acute limb pain requires careful and repeated clinical assessment, as progressive embolisation may not result in loss of pedal pulses until later in the clinical course.\n    \n\n【41】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【42】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【43】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosis may be challenging due to the unique anatomy and inherent properties of the genital and perianal skin. 1 Contact irritant dermatitis is a common cause of vulvar pruritus, followed by lichen sclerosus (LS), fungal infection and psoriasis. 2 3 We describe four cases of women who presented at our department due to persistent vulvar pruritus and burning.\n\n【5】Figure 1 shows a 32-year-old pregnant woman with a red scaling plaque and satellite lesions.

Although LS can occur in all age groups, its prevalence has two peaks (prepubertal and postmenopausal) with most cases diagnosed in postmenopausal women. Usually, the vulvar architecture remains intact early in the course of the disease. The lesions most frequently affect the labia minora although the whitening may extend over the perineum and around the anus in a keyhole fashion. As the disease progresses, the distinction between the labia majora and minora is lost and the clitoris becomes buried under the fused prepuce. Vaginal involvement has not been considered a feature of LS, but few cases have been reported in the literature.

Common sports include basketball, football and athletics. 2 3 The mechanism of injury is through either concentric contraction of the quadriceps during jumping, or with an eccentric contraction while the knee is in forced flexion. 4 These forces result in a pull of the patella tendon from its insertion at the tibial tuberosity.\n\n【10】In the proximal tibia, there are two ossification centres. The first is in the proximal tibia physeal plate itself, whereas the second is in the apophysis. During the early adolescent years, the physeal plate closes postero-anteriorly and proximo-distally with the second ossification centre closing later than the first. 3\n\n【11】In the 1950s, Reginald Watson-Jones classified tibial tuberosity fractures into types I, II and III, respectively, representing avulsion of the tibial tubercle alone, extension across the physis without entering the knee joint and finally proximal extension into the knee. 5 This classification was subsequently modified by Ogden _et al_ to more accurately define specific fracture patterns and to guide treatment for different fracture types by considering displacement and comminution. 6\n\n【12】We discuss an alternative presentation of a paediatric avulsion fracture, where the tibial tuberosity fracture extends into a triplanar fracture of the proximal tibia without intra-articular involvement.\n\n【13】Triplane fractures of the distal tibia have been well researched and considered in paediatric injuries over the last 50 years having been first described by Lynn _et al_ . 7 As the name suggests, triplane fractures occur in three planes (transverse, sagittal and coronal) and involve the metaphysis, physis and epiphysis of the bone. The distinctive fracture configuration is typically influenced by both the deforming forces applied during injury, but also as a result of the pattern of growth plate closure seen in the adolescent population. This has been described as beginning with central physeal closure followed by anteromedial, then posteromedial and finally lateral closure of the growth plate. 8\n\n【14】Although triplane fractures of other joints have been reported in the literature, 9 10 they are infrequent and rare. Physeal fractures of the proximal tibia in particular account for just 1%–3% of all physeal injuries. 6 11 12\n\n【15】We present this unusual case of a tibial apophyseal fracture concurrent with a proximal triplane fracture following a secondary injury due to lack of appropriate management and compliance. This might be an underreported variant of the proximal tibial injuries in the adolescent sportive population that will shed light to future possible mechanism and guide management.\n\n【16】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【17】A healthy, fit and well, early adolescent football player presented to his local emergency department after hearing a click in his left knee while kicking the ball with his right foot. This was immediately followed by pain and inability to fully weight bear on the left leg. Plain radiographs showed an abnormal elevation of the tibial tubercle suggestive of a mildly displaced avulsion fracture ( figure 1 ). He was treated conservatively in the first instance and advised to rest the leg for 2 weeks.\n\n【18】<img/>\n\n【19】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【20】Figure 1\n\n【21】Lateral view from initial plain radiograph showing tibial tuberosity avulsion.\n\n【22】The patient re-presented to the emergency department 2 weeks later. Due to an improvement of symptoms, the patient had restarted football prematurely and sustained a tackle where again he noted a loud click, followed by a sharp pain in his left knee. This time, the injury was associated with immediate swelling over the knee and complete inability to weight bear. Subsequent plain radiographs showed further widening of the anterior growth plate of the upper tibial apophysis, consistent with a worsening avulsion growth plate injury ( figure 2 ).\n\n【23】<img/>\n\n【24】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【25】Figure 2\n\n【26】Lateral view from plain radiograph following second presentation with worsening tibial tuberosity physeal widening.\n\n【27】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【28】A limited CT scan was performed confirming the widening of the apophyseal growth plate as well as a Salter-Harris type IV fracture of the posterior aspect of the tibia ( figure 3A,B ).\n\n【29】<img/>\n\n【30】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【31】Figure 3\n\n【32】CT showing complex Salter-Harris IV triplane fracture.

(B) Sagittal plane showing Salter-Harris II.\n\n【33】The patient’s management was subsequently escalated to our institution, a tertiary orthopaedic centre with a paediatric unit. Following multi-disciplinary team (MDT) discussion, an MRI of the knee was requested to assess any concurrent soft tissue injury given the history and mechanism of injury. It would also help to identify any early soft callus, visualise any periosteal interposition within the fracture site preventing reduction, as well as identifying associated intra-articular lesions, including cruciate ligamentous injury. Indeed, the MRI demonstrated periosteal entrapment at the tibial tuberosity alongside grade 1 sprains of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), superficial medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the myotendinous junction of popliteus.\n\n【34】Treatment\n---------\n\n【35】Initially, closed reduction with manipulation under anaesthesia was attempted without success. Therefore, a conversion to open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture was performed. A longitudinal incision was made over the tibial tuberosity with careful dissection down to the fracture site. A large periosteal sleeve was identified caught within the fracture site ( figure 4 ), as demonstrated on the MRI. This was removed and any torn parts excised. The fracture was subsequently reduced and, with the knee in hyperextension and the reduction held by hand, fixed with two, 4 mm partially threaded, cancellous cannulated screws with washers.\n\n【36】<img/>\n\n【37】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【38】Figure 4\n\n【39】Intraoperative findings: removal of periosteum (arrow) within fracture site.\n\n【40】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【41】Postoperatively, the patient was placed in an above leg cast with 15° of flexion, non-weight bearing (NWB), with gradual extension of a hinged knee brace on to 45° and 90° over the course of 6 weeks ( figure 5A,B ). At 6-week follow-up, scars were completely healed and the patient had an intact straight leg raise, but with minor lag due to pain along the patellar tendon. Weight bearing was commenced at this point. By 3 months, the patient had no leg length discrepancy or angular deformity seen and he returned to sport, participating in full sport by 4 months. Despite the concerns for growth plate deformity and potential for recurvatum, no obvious growth deformity was noted.\n\n【42】<img/>\n\n【43】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【44】Figure 5\n\n【45】Two-week follow-up plain radiographs.

(B) Anteroposterior view.\n\n【46】Discussion\n----------\n\n【47】Within the available literature, triplane fractures of the proximal tibia have only been reported in 11 cases and documented in 10 articles ( table 1 ).\n\n【48】View this table:\n\n【49】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【50】Table 1\n\n【51】Proximal tibial triplane fractures documented in the literature\n\n【52】The age of the patients discussed range from 11 to 17 years with mechanisms of injury including a fall from height, accidents during cycling, skiing and sledding; a road traffic accident; and a case of a brother landing on the patient while kneeling. Interestingly, multiple cases reported injury following a tackle when playing football. Two of the ten cases also report a concomitant apophyseal fracture of the tibial tuberosity. Generally, these triplane fractures were managed with pins and cannulated screws to reduce the fracture followed by a variable period of NWB. All cases report good to excellent outcomes in function and expected growth.\n\n【53】Triplane fractures of the proximal tibia are rare. A possible explanation for this rarity is that the proximal tibia has a more symmetrical closure pattern compared with the distal tibia, although there is significantly less literature available to confirm this. 13 Another contributor may be the insertion of the collateral knee ligaments into the tibial metaphysis, resulting in stresses bypassing the epiphysis unlike at the ankle. 14\n\n【54】Our case is not the first to discuss a tibial apophyseal avulsion injury as the main presenting imaging finding. 15 16 A sudden contraction of the quadriceps or passive flexion of the knee with contracted quadriceps is likely to be the primary mechanism for this type of injury, whereby the patella tendon pull exceeds the strength of the physis and periosteum causing avulsion at the insert. 15\n\n【55】Interestingly, both cases in the literature that involve a concurrent tibial tuberosity fracture with a triplane extension were sustained following a footballing injury. We therefore propose that forced knee flexion alongside a rotational component, common to football, may promote a mechanical reason for this specific fracture pattern.\n\n【56】In our case, we report an interesting mechanism of injury, which is likely to be a two-part process. The initial non-contact mechanism while kicking the ball is likely to have caused the initial avulsion injury of the tibial tuberosity. It is therefore possible that this has predisposed the bone to a completion of the triplane fracture 2 weeks later whereby a rotational deforming force to the proximal tibia is likely to have been generated following a tackle. This is a similar mechanism to that proposed by Neilly _et al_ . 15 This is likely contrary to ACL injuries where the main force is forced flexion followed by rotation rather than primarily rotation.\n\n【57】The fracture pattern for our case does not fit into a particular classification. Initially, the tibial tuberosity fracture appears to have been a 2A fracture configuration according to the modified Ogden Classification. After the second injury, this has worsened; however, the configuration appears to be a mix between a type IVB with the metaphyseal fracture component alongside physeal fracture and the IIA/IIIA tibial tuberosity fracture, which together completes the triplane configuration. Our case had the benefit of multiple modalities of three-dimensional (3D) imaging, which has picked this configuration up, whereas a tibial tuberosity fracture may not routinely have further imaging past a plain radiograph. Therefore, does this suggest that this fracture configuration may have a higher incidence than the literature would suggest? We propose that with further cases, there is an argument to broaden the Ogden Classification to include this fracture configuration.\n\n【58】The definitive operative management for this patient was ultimately unchanged from an isolated tibial tuberosity fracture, treated with cannulated screws for reduction. There is perhaps an argument that with X-rays showing a clear and obvious deformity, this may have been enough to proceed with appropriate operative management, mitigating the requirement for 3D imaging which both increase radiation risk and delays the time to operation.\n\n【59】A CT scan, however, does allow for precise visualisation of fracture configuration and increases confidence in surgical planning. Classification of the fracture is more accurate and in particular, any involvement of the intra-articular surface can be identified. With relation to the likely high impact and rotational forces involved, an MRI scan is useful in identifying concurrent soft tissue injury of the knee joint, such as associated intra-articular injury to the ACL, assessment of the physeal plate, as well as to identify any soft tissue trapping within the fracture site preventing adequate reduction. In our case and as documented by Nowicki _et al_ , 17 periosteal trapping is not uncommon. As such, we recommend MRI scans for all suspected triplane injuries of the proximal tibia with a low threshold for open reduction and internal fixation, to clear the likely presence of a periosteal sleeve caught within the fracture fragment.\n\n【60】### Learning points\n\n【61】*   Proximal tibial tuberosity triplane fractures are uncommon but carry with them the need for high clinical vigilance.\n    \n*   Good anatomical reduction and stabilisation is required to prevent future arthritis, pain and deformity.\n    \n*   Triplane extension of tibial tuberosity fractures should be considered where there is likely to have been a rotational component to the mechanism of injury.\n    \n*   Both CT and MRI should be considered to assess for fracture configuration as well as soft tissue involvement.\n    \n\n【62】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【63】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【64】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Medical history includes idiopathic pancreatitis and latent tuberculosis (TB) treated 13 years ago. He had travelled to Southeast Asia 4 months prior to presentation, but the onset of symptoms preceded this trip. The patient denied unsafe sexual practices, use of recreational drugs, over-the-counter medication and insect or tick bites. Physical examination revealed cervical lymphadenopathy with no axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Respiratory and abdominal examination was normal. Laboratory investigations revealed a mixed cholestatic and hepatitic liver function test profile (alanine aminotransferase 64 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 275 IU/L). Full blood count, blood film and lactate dehydrogenase were normal. Extended bacterial, viral screen, serology for auto-immune hepatitis and vasculitis was negative. Sputum microscopy for acid fast bacilli was negative. Serum immunoglobulin subclass-4 (IgG4) was elevated at 14.95 g/L (0.04–0.86 g/L) and the ACE was marginally elevated at 73 U/L (8–65 U/L). CT suggested diffuse infiltration of the liver with widespread lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and diffuse swelling of the pancreas. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed and demonstrated metabolically active lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm with multi-system inflammatory infiltrative involvement of pancreas, kidneys, spleen, prostate and intra-scrotal epididymis ( figure 1 ).\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】Positron emission tomography scan demonstrating metabolically active lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm with multi-system inflammatory infiltrative involvement of pancreas, kidneys, spleen, prostate and intra-scrotal epididymis.\n\n【9】The patient’s presentation, clinical assessment and initial investigations led to a differential diagnosis of lymphoma, TB, sarcoidosis and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Fine needle aspirate of the lymph node showed reactive changes with a lymphoplasmocytic infiltrate, but no granulomas or IgG4-positive cells. Liver biopsy revealed a single discrete granuloma, lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates and several IgG4-positive cells ( figure 2 ). However, the number of IgG4-positive cells was <10/high power field, which fails to fulfil the criteria for a definitive diagnosis of IgG4-RD.\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Liver biopsy with IgG4-positive cells (arrows indicate IgG4 cells).\n\n【14】As per 2019 American college of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR criteria), 1 this case fits the entry and inclusion criteria (score=31) for IgG4-RD, but there were two exclusion criteria (mild splenomegaly and single granulomata in liver biopsy). The case was discussed extensively in multi-disciplinary team meeting and based on significantly raised IgG4 levels, pancreatitis and multi-system involvement it was agreed to treat this as IgG4-RD, while maintaining a suspicion of sarcoidosis. Steroid therapy would be beneficial even if this was sarcoidosis. Excision lymph node biopsy was planned if there was no response to treatment. Six weeks after treatment with prednisolone 40 mg once a day, there was dramatic improvement in symptoms, normalisation of liver function tests and a fall in serum IgG4 level to 4.69 g/L. Repeat PET scan showed total resolution in multi-system inflammation ( figure 3 ). The patient is currently well after completing the steroid course and is currently not on any treatment. A repeat PET scan 1-year post diagnosis did not show any activity.\n\n【15】<img/>\n\n【16】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【17】Figure 3\n\n【18】Positron emission tomography scan showed total resolution in multi-system inflammation.\n\n【19】Our case demonstrates the complexities involved in the diagnosis and management of multi-system inflammation and the importance of multidisciplinary approach. This case was particularly challenging due to history of latent tuberculosis, lymphadenopathy with night sweats and weight loss. These findings raised possibility of lymphoma and TB and the diagnosis had to be carefully teased out for the correct management. IgG4-RD is a rare entity with varied manifestations, presenting a diagnostic challenge. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical, radiological and histological features. 2 IgG4 levels lack sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and monitoring this condition. Accurate diagnosis is important as IgG4-RD can mimic a malignant process. 3 Steroids are the mainstay of treatment. Long-term immunosuppression is not recommended at diagnosis and should be considered if there is insufficient response to steroids or relapse following withdrawal of steroid treatment. Azathioprine, mycophenalate, mercaptopurine and rituximab have been used as steroid sparing agents. 4\n\n【20】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【21】For 3 years prior to diagnosis—I was under immense pressure at work and was being bullied for a prolonged period. During this time, all lifestyle factors remained constant except work stress.\n\n【22】Three months into my travel, I started to notice a few symptoms. At first, this was mainly tiredness, light cold and flu symptoms, which later led to feelings of nausea, particularly when I drank alcohol. For context, I would drink the equivalent of five pints—either every week or bi-monthly. As my travels continued, existing symptoms grew in severity and new symptoms like lower back pain, stomach pain, and issues passing urine, which I suspect were kidney pain as well as muscle stiffness and night sweats appeared. The night sweats were intense. Each night, I was waking up in what I can only describe as a soaking bed and was hot to the touch. All symptoms shifted from a mild/moderate state back in spring, to severe during summer. It got so bad that I lost all my appetite. For a period of around 6–8 weeks, I dropped from 75 kg to around 50 kg where the only food groups I could stomach could be a couple of pieces of fruit and some light proteins.\n\n【23】I saw a doctor who ran blood and a series of tests and concluded that I had rheumatoid arthritis and recommended I fly home as soon as possible. When I got home after my travels—the symptoms continued, and I admitted myself to emergency department at my local hospital. At first, they thought I had pancreatitis and gave a slightly patronising spiel in the emergency department that I was drinking too much. I appreciate the basic tests that were run; the results would point the medical professionals in that direction.\n\n【24】I challenged this and was referred to gastroenterology team and ran them through everything, step by step and in detail. They agreed that I needed more tests such as blood cultures, MRIs, PET, ultrasound, X-rays and biopsies—the works. It was then concluded that I had IGG-4. Without the patience to listen, the robustness of other types of tests and removing medical bias, I wouldn’t be here without those doctors. They’re a shining example of best practice within the trust and I hope anyone reading this takes inspiration from these wonderful doctors. They treated me with respect during such a turbulent time of my life and I’m eternally grateful.\n\n【25】### Learning points\n\n【26】*   IgG4 related disease is a rare and complex disease that can mimic malignancy and presents significant diagnostic challenges.\n    \n*   Multidisciplinary approach is paramount to diagnosis and management.\n    \n*   Steroids are the mainstay of treatment.\n    \n\n【27】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【28】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【29】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

This predisposes the neonate or the infant to develop midgut volvulus, which could be associated with catastrophic outcomes unless emergency corrective surgery is promptly performed. 1 2 Some patients, however, progress to adulthood with no or minimal and often vague symptoms. The diagnosis of intestinal malrotation in adults can, therefore, be challenging. 3 4\n\n【5】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【6】A man in his 20s was referred to our general surgery clinic with a 2-year history of postprandial colicky and generalised abdominal pain. This was associated with a weight loss of 5 kg. The patient had no significant previous medical or family history. CT imaging in the portal venous phase showed the duodenum and proximal jejunum to be sited on the right of the midline and was pathognomonic of midgut malrotation ( figure 1 ).\n\n【7】<img/>\n\n【8】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【9】Figure 1\n\n【10】CT scan images showing the duodenum failed to cross to the left side of the midline with the duodeno-jejunal flexure right to the midline.\n\n【11】The patient underwent a laparotomy, which showed a mobile caecum located in the right upper quadrant with adhesions (Ladd’s band) crossing over the duodenum ( figure 2 ), with the duodeno-jejunal flexure towards the right of the midline ( figure 3 ). The proximal jejunum was rotated and laid in the right upper quadrant through an internal hernia.\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】Figure 2\n\n【15】Intraoperative image showing the right colon excessively mobile.\n\n【16】<img/>\n\n【17】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【18】Figure 3\n\n【19】Intraoperative image showing the duodeno-jejunal flexure position right to the midline immediately below the gallbladder.\n\n【20】The adhesions were released, and the right colon was fully mobilised. The duodenum was then Kocherised, allowing the proximal jejunum to be reduced back to its anatomically correct position to the left of the midline. The resulting mesenteric window was then closed with interrupted 3–0 coated VICRYL sutures ( figure 4 ). An appendicectomy was then performed as for a standard Ladd’s procedure as well as a caecopexy to reduce the chance of future caecal volvulus.\n\n【21】<img/>\n\n【22】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【23】Figure 4\n\n【24】Intraoperative image showing the duodeno-jejunal flexure reduced to its normal position to the left of the midline and the mesenteric window closed to avoid re-herniation.\n\n【25】The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 3 when he was eating and drinking normally, and his bowels had opened. At the 6-week follow-up, he remained well and was symptom free.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】Congenital midgut malrotation can be undiagnosed until adulthood. Some patients may present acutely with a mid-gut volvulus, whereas others might present with a vague chronic abdominal pain due to intermittent volvulus and internal herniation. In our case report, the most challenging area was the diagnosis.\n\n【28】CT scan (with oral and intravenous contrast) is the best non-invasive diagnostic modality to diagnose malrotation. It allows the visualisation of the position of the duodenojejunal flexure in relation to the midline. The normal anatomical location of the duodenojejunal flexure is left to the midline. If it is found to be positioned right to the midline, then this is a diagnostic sign of malrotation ( figure 1 ). The CT will also show the position of the ascending colon, which is usually very mobile in patients with malrotation and lies in the left side of the abdomen. This excessive mobility of the colon puts it at risk of volvulus. CT scan could also be used in acute presentations as it is good to diagnose complications, which could arise in patients with malrotation (eg, small bowel internal hernias and colonic volvulus).\n\n【29】In this case, intraoperative inspection confirmed the site of the duodenojejunal flexure right to the midline ( figure 3 ). It also showed the ascending colon being very mobile and positioned to the left of the midline ( figure 2 ). Once the duodenojejunal junction was reduced back to its position, we closed the mesenteric defects to prevent the small bowel herniating through these windows postoperatively ( figure 4 ).\n\n【30】It is important to note here that the position of the appendix in patients with malrotation could be in the left of the abdomen. Hence, the clinical picture of appendicitis could be misleading as the symptoms will present in the left abdomen rather than the usual right iliac fossa.\n\n【31】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【32】Before the surgery, I had abdominal pain and lots of noises coming from my belly.\n\n【33】I did not have any problems during my recovering, I just had back pain due to the amount of time I stayed in bed, but it has gone since I come back to my normal activities.\n\n【34】The experience at the hospital was good, the way the doctor and nurses took care of me during my stay at the hospital was great.\n\n【35】### Learning points\n\n【36】*   Adult presentation of intestinal malrotation should be considered in the differential diagnoses of patients presenting with vague and non-specific colicky abdominal pain.\n    \n*   Abdominal CT imaging is the gold standard for diagnosing intestinal malrotation.\n    \n*   Patients should be offered surgery especially if symptomatic to avoid acute complications such as bowel volvulus and ischaemia.\n    \n\n【37】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【38】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【39】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

He had a loss of appetite and a few episodes of non-bilious vomiting. There was no history of fever, haematemesis and melaena.\n\n【6】On examination, he had icterus and right hypochondrial tenderness in the abdomen. There were no signs of chronic liver failure. Laboratory investigations revealed haemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, leucocytosis (14 400 μL), hyperbilirubinaemia (total bilirubin 4.8 mg/dL) and serum amylase and lipase >1000 U/L.\n\n【7】The patient underwent MRCP which revealed features of acute calculus cholecystitis and a 2 cm sized rounded, well-defined T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense lesion in relation to the neck of gall bladder projecting within the lumen showing a thin T2 hypointense rim. The common bile duct was unremarkable ( figure 1 ). An ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed an anechoic thick-walled cystic lesion within the gall bladder wall with intraluminal yin–yang flow on colour doppler imaging ( figure 2 ).

Medications included luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue injections. Clinical examination was unremarkable with no focal neurological signs or visual fields abnormalities. Abnormal laboratory investigations included low haemoglobin 118 g/L (130–180 g/L), slightly elevated prothrombin time 14.6 s (9.5–14 s), elevated plasma viscosity 2.09 mPa.s. (1.5–1.72 mPa.s.) and slightly low sodium 130 mmol/L (133–146 mmol/L). Non-contrast CT head ( figure 1 ) showed a dilated hyperdense left superior ophthalmic vein and CT venogram confirmed left superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis (SOVT). No radiologically discernible cause was found and the rest of the venous sinuses were patent. Patient was referred to ophthalmology services which found no abnormality on further ophthalmological examination and were not able to ascribe a cause for the patient’s condition.

Previous reports have shown an association of this condition with cancer due to hypercoagulable state but it has not been reported in patients with prostate cancer. 3 Another potential explanation is an adverse effect of LHRH analogue injections which have been shown to be associated with venous thromboembolism. 4 Our case shows an isolated left SOVT in a patient with metastatic prostate cancer; differential included a thrombosed varix of the superior ophthalmic vein. However, review of previous imaging and return to normal pointed more towards SOVT rather than thrombosed varix.\n\n【14】Isolated involvement of superior ophthalmic vein can often be overlooked although it is important to detect it, as it would point towards an underlying hypercoagulable state that may have clinical manifestations elsewhere in the body, that may need specific treatment.

RCM, reflectance confocal microscopy.\n\n【13】_Solenopsis invicta_ , also known as ‘red imported fire ants’, is an invasive species that can be found in the southeastern USA. Although native to central South America, they have become pests in other parts of the world and are known to cause painful stings. 1 Their venom consists of a non-allergenic alkaloid component which causes an initial, painful skin reaction and a proteinaceous component that induces an allergic immune response. 2 3 The alkaloid component contains cis and trans isomers of 2-methyl, 6-n-alkyl piperidine compounds and makes up 95% of the venom. 4 The remaining 5% of venom consists of protein components that are responsible for acute immunosensitisation in addition to a delayed-hypersensitivity reaction. 5 Although not completely characterised, the proteinaceous portion seems to consist of various enzymes including phospholipases, metalloproteinases, hyaluronidases and neurotoxins. 4 6\n\n【14】Clinically, the initial reaction from a sting is a 25–50 mm dermal flare, with wheal development within minutes and pustule development within hours. 4 7 These pustules transform into clear fluid filled vesicles within 4 hours and then cloudy fluid filled vesicles within 8 hours, indicating infiltration of inflammatory cells. The development of pustules occurs after 24 hours. Pathophysiology of the allergic response involves venom allergens processed by antigen-presenting cells and subsequent T cell activation. 6 Neutrophils are recruited to the sting site via inflammatory cytokines. 7 Eosinophils are seen in later-phase reactions, most likely due to a Th2-mediated mechanism. 2 4 Although histopathological examination has demonstrated that neutrophils are involved in the physiological reaction to fire ant stings 4 7 this has not been demonstrated _in vivo_ , to our knowledge. Here, we use RCM to demonstrate this.\n\n【15】RCM is a relatively new, non-invasive approach being used in clinical dermatology. It can be used _in vivo_ to obtain cellular level information about a skin lesion and potentially eliminate the need for a traditional skin biopsy. It works by back-scattering light from the target tissue via a low-energy laser. 8 The varying refractive indices of different cellular components will produce varying brightness. This imaging method can penetrate up to 250 nm, meaning we can visualise the papillary dermis and upper reticular dermis. 7 The lens is placed directly on the skin with use of an immersion oil and can produce images comparable to using a 30× objective. 8 However, there are some limitations to RCM including depth of imaging, cost and quality of images on areas with thickened stratum corneum. 8 Overall, this imaging modality can be used by practitioners to evaluate and diagnose a variety of skin conditions with relative ease.\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】*   Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) can be a useful technology in imaging skin lesions that require further investigation without having the patient experience the discomfort of a biopsy procedure.\n    \n*   Using RCM in this case allowed us to visualise the pathological process of the sting site at the cellular level and monitor progress after treatment.\n    \n*   As useful as RCM is, there are some limitations including depth of imaging, cost and quality of images on areas with thickened skin.\n    \n\n【18】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【19】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【20】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

IHC, Immunohistochemistry.\n\n【17】Spindle cell carcinoma, also known as sarcomatoid carcinoma, is an exceedingly rare variant of SCC with a unique clinicopathological profile. It is an aggressive and poorly differentiated variant that predominantly occurs in the larynx. 1 The incidence of spindle cell carcinoma on the oral cavity is very rare and accounts for less than 1% of all oral cavity tumours. It presents in the sixth and seventh decades of life and is more common in men. It has a unique clinical appearance compared with other SCC. It presents as a polypoid, exophytic or pedunculated mass. It is also known as pseudo carcinoma, polypoid SCC and collusion tumour. 2 3 The spindle cell component arises as an atypical reactive proliferation of the stroma called ‘pseudosarcoma’. 4 The spindle cells and epithelial cells arise from different stem cells hence the name collision tumour. 5 The risk factors associated with spindle cell carcinoma formation are smoking, alcohol and previous radiotherapy. Oral and oropharyngeal tumours present as painful or painless masses with dysphagia or bleeding. 6 Regional metastases can occur in about 25% of cases.\n\n【18】Histologically, it can present as a monophasic spindled, pleomorphic or a biphasic tumour where epithelial changes from dysplasia to invasive carcinoma are admixed with spindle cells. It shows hypercellularity with streaming fascicles of spindle cells in a sarcomatous appearance. Immunohistochemistry is helpful to know the histiogenesis of the spindle cell in this tumour. Epithelial markers that show positivity are keratin and epithelial membrane antigen, while mesenchymal markers include vimentin, desmin and S-100. 7\n\n【19】Aggressive surgical resection is considered a mainstay of treatment for this tumour. Surgery followed by radiotherapy is considered for the best long-term outcome. Radiotherapy is considered in inoperable cases and positive surgical margins with extensive nodal metastasis. The factors which favour a good prognosis in spindle cell carcinoma are low-stage, small-size, absence of previous radiation, superficial location, polypoid and exophytic growth. A high recurrence rate of 70%–75% has been reported, and hence close follow-up is essential. 8 There is a noticeable difference in prognosis and overall survival of spindle cell carcinoma compared with SCC. The incidence of metastasis is 36%, and about 30% of all oral cases ended with mortality within 1 year. 7 8\n\n【20】The differential diagnosis for this tumour can be\n\n【21】*   Reactive epithelial proliferation\n    \n*   Fibromatosis\n    \n*   Fibrous histiocytoma\n    \n*   Rhabdomyosarcoma\n    \n*   Chondrosarcoma\n    \n\n【22】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【23】I noticed a mass on my tongue which was rapidly growing in size.

Invasive infections with _Parvimonas micra_ and _Campylobacter rectus_ are rare. Investigation of a dental origin is crucial to prevent recurrent infections.\n\n【2】*   Bone and joint infections\n*   Dentistry and oral medicine\n*   Emergency medicine\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

While secondary osteomyelitis of the sternum is most commonly seen as a complication after a surgical intervention or trauma, primary osteomyelitis of the sternum occurs secondary to bacteraemia. Intravenous drug abuse, diabetes mellitus or immune deficiency are known predisposing factors. 1 2 Most commonly, primary osteomyelitis is caused by a single pathogen, and _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ being the most common pathogens. 3 4 Only a limited number of case reports have reported about particular osteomyelitis due to _Parvimonas micra_ , for example, in the distal phalanx of the thumb 5 or hip joint, 6 but no article has been found about osteomyelitis of the sternum caused by _P. micra_ or _Campylobacter rectus_ .\n\n【10】_P. micra_ are anaerobic, gram-positive cocci, formerly described as _Peptostreptococcus micros_ and _Micromonas micros_ . 7 _P. micra_ has been associated with meningitis, 8 cervical and brain abscess, 9 10 spondylodiscitis 11 as well as endocarditis 12 and native joint infections. 13 In 2018, van Duijvenbode _et al_ performed a systematic review where four cases of spondylitis and nine cases of spondylodiscitis were identified. 14\n\n【11】_C. rectus_ is also a member of the oral flora. 15 An investigation of selected bacterial species in endoperiodontal lesions, performed in 2012 by Didilescou _et al_ , revealed extremely high bacterial loads in endodontic samples for _P. micra_ together with _C. rectus_ . 16 17 _C. rectus_ is a straight, non-spore forming and motile gram-negative rod, which has first been described in 1981 as _Wolinella recta_ . 15 In 1991, the organism was transferred to the genus _Campylobacter_ based on phylogenetic studies. 18 Invasive infections with _C. rectus_ have rarely been reported in the literature, and to our knowledge, only one case of clival osteomyelitis has been noted so far. 19 One fatal case of thoracic empyema involving _C. rectus_ is reported. 20 Although little is known in regard to pathogenic potential of _C. rectus_ , dental caries, periodontitis, poor oral hygiene or malignancies have been identified as predisposing factors of invasive _C. rectus_ infections. 18 21\n\n【12】To our knowledge, no similar case report of osteomyelitis of the sternum caused by _P. micra_ or _C. rectus_ has been described in literature before. Therefore, we hereby present a rare case of destructive osteomyelitis of the sternum caused by _P. micra_ and _C. rectus_ infection; both are members of the oral flora and associated with chronic periodontitis.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A female patient in her mid-40s presented to the emergency department (ED) of a regional hospital in Switzerland due to a spontaneous rupture of an abscess located on the mid-frontal chest wall. The patient was of Tanzanian origin and had lived in Switzerland for the past 30 years. Medical history was unremarkable. The patient did not take any medication. Due to good health, the patient rarely visited her general practitioner. No regular check-ups were performed in the last decade.\n\n【15】Detail history taking revealed that the patient had noticed a progressive swelling of the chest wall over the past 4 weeks. Furthermore, the patient experienced some general discomfort and loss of appetite. She did not notice any fever, and the pain was bearable without taking any painkillers or had the need to seek medical help. At the day of presentation, the abscess ruptured spontaneously with discharge of a remarkable amount of pus, which is why the patient visited the ED.\n\n【16】At the time of ED presentation, the patient had no fever (36.3°C). The blood pressure was within the normal range (137/92 mm Hg), but mild tachycardia was noted (113 beats per minute). Physical examination revealed a significant swelling of 20×10 cm on the chest wall reaching from the processus xyphoideus up to the upper border of the sternum. Under the left clavicle, the abscess had perforated the skin with discharge of bad-smelling purulent fluid and blood ( figure 1 ). The remaining examination was unremarkable. There were no signs of intravenous drug abuse. No entry point of infection could be determined on physical examination.\n\n【17】<img/>\n\n【18】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【19】Figure 1\n\n【20】Patient on emergency department presentation.\n\n【21】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【22】Laboratory testing showed elevated C reactive protein (CRP) levels (402 mg/L, normal range <10 mg/L), elevated white cell count (15.4 G/L; normal range 4.5–10.5 G/L), elevated thrombocyte count (429 G/L; normal range 150–350 G/L) and slightly elevated serum creatinine (102 µmol/L; normal range 46–92 µmol/L). Measured procalcitonin also was significantly elevated (44 µg/L; normal range <0.1 µg/L).\n\n【23】CT was performed to assess the extent of the abscess formation of the chest wall ( figures 2 and 3 ). Imaging revealed osteomyelitic erosion of the sternum with abscess formation reaching from the processus xyphoideus of the sternum up to the left side of the glandula thyreoidea, compromising the sternoicleidomastoid muscle. The abscess measured 20×13.5 cm. No abscess formation was seen in the intrathoracic or mediastinal space.\n\n【24】<img/>\n\n【25】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【26】Figure 2\n\n【27】CT scan of the abscess at the level of the neck.\n\n【28】<img/>\n\n【29】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【30】Figure 3\n\n【31】CT scan of the abscess at the level of the sternoclavicular joint.\n\n【32】Cultures of the blood were asserted, and the patient was referred to prompt surgical debridement where diagnostic investigation was completed by taking deep tissue and blood samples for microbiological assessment. In cultures taken from the sternal bone tissue and deep tissue, _P. micra_ and _C. rectus_ were isolated. There were no antimicrobial resistances reported neither to _P. micra_ nor to _C. rectus_ . Mycobacterial cultures were negative.\n\n【33】Since _P. micra_ and _C. rectus_ are both members of the oral flora, a dental origin of infection was considered. The patient reported to not have seen a dentist for more than 10 years, while dental hygiene seemed rather poor. Our patient therefore was referred to the dental department where a chronic periodontitis was diagnosed. Tooth 47 was not vital, and loss of previous cavity occlusion was reported in tooth 36. Remaining dental examination remained unremarkable.\n\n【34】In conclusion, the patient was diagnosed with primary osteomyelitis of the sternum with abscess formation most likely due to chronic periodontitis.\n\n【35】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【36】Primary osteomyelitis of the sternum is rare. In literature intravenous drug abuse, diabetes mellitus or immune deficiency is described as predisposing factors. However, our patient appeared to be previously healthy. Anamnesis and clinical examination did not reveal any indication of intravenous drug abuse. HbA1c was normal, underlying diabetes mellitus could be therefore excluded. An underlying immunodeficiency such as HIV-infection could be excluded by serological testing, and our patient did not take any immunosuppressive medication.\n\n【37】The patient was of Tanzanian origin and had lived in Switzerland for more than 30 years. Her last visit to Tanzania dated back to 7 years. On presentation, an extrapulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis could not be excluded. However, cultures on mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as PCR testing were repeatedly negative.\n\n【38】A malignant cause of bone manifestation with secondary infection was considered; however, a primary tumour could not be detected on CT scans, and a gynaecological examination including Papanicolaou-test remained normal. The patient refused a gastroscopic and colonoscopic examination. The collected samples from the sternum did not show any malignancies, and due to good response on antibiotic treatment and detection of pathogenic bacteria, a malignant cause of the sternal lesion was considered highly unlikely.\n\n【39】In our case, detection of microorganisms belonging to the oral flora was the crucial factor in finding a dental entrance point. However, a thorough oral examination took place only after receiving the indicative microbiological test results.\n\n【40】Treatment\n---------\n\n【41】Emergent treatment with extensive surgical debridement was performed, and empiric antibiotic treatment was initiated with piperacillin/tazobactam after surgery. Already after 24 hours of treatment, CRP levels were decreasing notably, so antibiotic treatment was de-escalated to clindamycine and doxycycline. After blood and deep tissue cultures revealed infection with _P. micra_ and _C. rectus,_ antibiotic treatment was adjusted to co-amoxicillin. The patient furthermore underwent sequential surgical debridement with vacuum-assisted closure therapy and finally with split-skin grafting ( figures 4 and 5 ).\n\n【42】<img/>\n\n【43】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【44】Figure 4\n\n【45】Intraoperative image following surgical resection.\n\n【46】<img/>\n\n【47】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【48】Figure 5\n\n【49】Four weeks postoperative following split-skin grafting.\n\n【50】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【51】The patient made a quick recovery with normalisation of blood parameters and well-healing wound of the chest wall. Four weeks after hospital admission, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation centre and returned home 2 weeks later. On discharge, the patient did not need any further pain medication.\n\n【52】The patient was followed up in the outpatient clinic for infectious diseases . She reported a full recovery with no remaining complaints. Antibiotic therapy was planed to be continued for an overall period of 6 weeks according to the guidelines of antibiotic treatment of osteomyelitis. 22 23 Due to a delay in follow-up visits, the antibiotic therapy was continued for an overall period of 8 weeks and thereafter could be stopped.\n\n【53】To prevent further infections, periodontitis treatment including plaque removal and surgical pocket removal was recommended by our in-house dentists. Furthermore, extraction of the non-vital tooth 47 was indicated just as restoration of the lost cavity occlusion restoration of tooth 36. The patient preferred to perform the dental procedures at her own dentist. Therefore, the patient finally was discharged to further follow-up appointments at her own general practitioner and dental treatment at her own dentist. During a consultation 6 months after discharge, patient reported good health with no remaining deficits.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】Invasive infections, especially osteomyelitis, with _P. micra_ as well as _C. rectus_ are rare. 5 15 19 In our patient, diagnosis could be confirmed by growth in standard cultures of the sternum as well as in standard cultures from the surrounding tissue. However, the detection of _P. micra_ as well as _C. rectus_ in the standard media is difficult, 24 but nevertheless, _P. micra_ was identified in standard cultures.\n\n【56】In August 2020, a systematic literature review of _P. micra_ in spondylodiscitis identified 16 cases. 12 In 50% of all cases, a dental cause or preceding dental was reported. 12 Another systematic review also published in August 2020 could show that _P. micra_ bacteraemia was associated with spondylodiscitis, oropharyngeal infection, abdominal abscess and septic pulmonary emboli. 25 However, sternal osteomyelitis was not reported. 25\n\n【57】A systematic literature review published in July 2021 on invasive infections with _C. rectus_ revealed 20 cases, and no case showed a sternal osteomyelitis. 26 In 55% of all patients, dental health issues were documented as the aetiology of infections. 26 Furthermore, in 2007, a large study performed in southern Finland detected _C. rectus_ in 31.3% of healthy adults, supporting the theory of dental origin of infection with _C. rectus_ . 16\n\n【58】In our patient, the poor oral status was not documented at admission. In clinical practice, an oral focus may be missed, especially in the acute setting of the ED, where the primary focus lies on haemodynamic and respiratory stabilisation of the patient. Only after identification of _P. micra_ or _C. rectus,_ an oral focus was considered, which highlights the importance of pathogen identification to guide adequate treatment. It also shows how important it is, despite overcrowded ED, to perform a complete physical examination, including oral examination. This is also the only way to be sure not to miss an infectious focus, leaving us here to emphasise above all the importance and necessity of a complete physical examination.\n\n【59】Concerning treatment, _P. micra_ is highly susceptible to antibiotics, and some studies showed only low rates of antimicrobial resistance. 27 28 Murdoch _et al_ found _P. micra_ to be most susceptible to penicillin, followed by metronidazole and clindamycin. 29 There is few literature on antibiotic treatment of _C. rectus,_ so far, no beta-lactamase activity has been described and other than oxifloxacin, _C. rectus_ appears to be sensitive to antibiotic treatment. 22 29 30 The culture results in this case report did not show any antimicrobial resistances too, so that antibiotic therapy with the usual drugs could be prescribed. In overall, the prognosis of _P. micra_ and _C. rectus_ infections are good following an appropriate treatment. 25\n\n【60】In conclusion, the high susceptibility to antibiotics and good prognosis would suggest that identification of the pathogen is not obligatory for accurate and resistance-oriented treatment. However, to prevent recurrence of infection, the surgical removal of infection focus is critical, as delay in treatment is associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality.\n\n【61】### Learning points\n\n【62】*   _Parvimonas micra_ and _Campylobacter rectus_ are both members of the oral microbiotic flora. Systemic infection is rare, however possible.\n    \n*   Since both bacterial strains are associated with chronic periodontitis, a dental focus should be considered in case of identification in systemic infections.\n    \n*   _Parvimonas micra_ and _Campylobacter rectus_ are highly susceptible to antibiotic treatment. To prevent recurrence of infection, identification and surgical removal of the source of infection is however critical.\n    \n\n【63】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【64】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【65】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【66】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【67】We are grateful to H Notter, MD, M Valletti, MD and F Porchet who took care of the patient in the regional hospital, prior to referral to the University Hospital Zurich.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

To our knowledge, there is no effective established treatment for patients experiencing shoulder pain after an open pancreaticoduodenectomy.

Then, on postoperative day 2, the acute pain service was consulted. Considering that the sphenopalatine ganglion block has been previously reported to be helpful in a number of painful conditions, including shoulder tip pain after thoracic surgery, we offered this treatment to the patient. After just one topical sphenopalatine ganglion block, using a cotton-tipped applicator, the patient’s shoulder pain entirely resolved and did not return.

Although significantly more common in patients who undergo laparoscopic surgeries, some patients who undergo open procedures may experience postoperative ipsilateral shoulder pain. This type of pain is caused by the irritation of tissues supplied by the phrenic nerve. To treat shoulder tip pain, which is precipitated by diaphragmatic irritation, the C3, C4 and C5 nerve roots must be blocked, but as this would inhibit phrenic nerve function and cause apnoea, it is not an option. Furthermore, this type of pain is often not responsive to systemic analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. 2\n\n【10】To our knowledge, there is no effective established treatment for patients experiencing shoulder pain after an open pancreaticoduodenectomy. Sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) was first reported as a treatment for unilateral facial pain symptom complex in 1908 and has since then been used to treat a number of painful conditions. 3 This is the first report of a successful treatment of intractable ipsilateral shoulder pain after an open pancreaticoduodenectomy with topical transnasal SPGB using a cotton-tipped applicator. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this report.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 59-year-old woman with a prior medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas underwent an open pancreaticoduodenectomy, portal lymphadenectomy, retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy and pancreatic ultrasound. The surgery was performed under general and thoracic epidural anaesthesia (catheter inserted at T7–T8 level). There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperative pain was managed using patient controlled-epidural anaesthesia (PCEA) with bupivacaine 0.1% with 2 µg/mL fentanyl with a basal infusion of 8 mL/hour and a 2 mL PCEA dose with a lockout of 12 min. The epidural PCEA provided excellent incisional pain relief; however, the patient experienced left shoulder pain (Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 10/10 for most of the day) that did not respond to acetaminophen 975 mg PO every 6 hours, ketorolac 15 mg IV every 8 hours, lidocaine 5% transdermal patch, hydromorphone 0.5 mg every 4 hours, oxycodone 5 mg PO every 4 hours and oxycodone 10 mg PO every 4 hours.\n\n【13】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【14】On postoperative day 2, the acute pain service was consulted to evaluate the patient’s shoulder pain. The patient reported that she had a remote history of left shoulder pain 10 years prior to admission that resolved with physical therapy and intra-articular steroid injections. She reported that the postsurgical pain she was currently experiencing in her left shoulder was ‘excruciating’ and that it was significantly different from the type of pain she had 10 years ago. She described her current pain as sharp and needle-like sensation inside her shoulder that would randomly get significantly worse throughout the day since the surgery. The pain, when it was at its worst, would last in severity for 30 min.\n\n【15】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【16】The differential diagnoses included pain from surgical positioning, immediate postoperative complications, such as anastomotic leak or subphrenic collections, cardiac complications, pulmonary complications and/or referred pain from manipulation of the pancreas. The patient was afebrile and had no leukocytosis. Chest X-ray findings included: heart and mediastinum of normal size and contour; linear opacity in the left lower lobe likely representing atelectasis; no developing chronic heart failure or pneumonia; osseous structures unremarkable, particularly involving the left shoulder; no acute fracture or dislocation; and unremarkable acromioclavicular joint. This suggested that the source of the pain was not from surgical malposition nor from a pulmonary complication. ECG showed sinus rhythm, heart rate of 79 beats per minute with normal axis, which made the shoulder pain from a cardiac complication less likely. Since there were no signs of systemic infection at that time, which could point towards immediate postoperative complications, the primary surgical team chose not to do a CT scan at this time. The remaining differential diagnosis was referred pain from manipulation of the pancreas.\n\n【17】Treatment\n---------\n\n【18】Based on a recent publication of the SPGB being an effective treatment for post-thoracic shoulder tip pain 4 and our observation of the block being an effective treatment for various headache and neck pain aetiologies in our pain clinic, we offered the SPGB to this patient. On discussion of potential risks and benefits of the procedure, including the option of not proceeding, the patient elected to go ahead and signed a written informed consent.\n\n【19】At the start of the procedure the patient’s left shoulder pain was 5/10 on the NRS. SPGB applicators were created from hollow cotton swabs, intravenous extension tubing with a stop cock, 3 mL syringes, 5% lidocaine ointment and 4% lidocaine topical solution ( figure 1 ). The patient was positioned in the supine position with her head off the bed, supported by a pillow, for cervical spine extension (chin-up position) ( figure 2 ). Haemodynamic monitors consisting of non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry and EKG were applied, and the patient remained haemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. The SPGB applicator dipped into lidocaine ointment was gently inserted into each nostril atraumatically and stopped at the point where gentle resistance gave way at the junction of the turbinates and aperture of the nasopharynx. Lidocaine 4% was dripped drop by drop through the applicators into each nostril until the patient felt the medication in the back of her throat (1 mL into the right nostril and 0.5 mL into the left nostril) ( figure 3 ). The SPGB applicators were left in place for a total of 15 min while the patient had a small towel covering her eyes for comfort.\n\n【20】<img/>\n\n【21】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【22】Figure 1\n\n【23】Creation of the sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) applicator: Supplies (lidocaine 4% topical solution, lidocaine 5% ointment, scissors, hollow cotton-tips, 3 cc syringes, Anaesthesia IV Set and towel to cover eyes (optional)); Disconnect the ‘Anaesthesia IV Set’ and cut the purple tip with scissors; Disconnect the tip of the ‘Anaesthesia IV Set’ and toss the tip; Connect all the remaining pieces together.\n\n【24】<img/>\n\n【25】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【26】Figure 2\n\n【27】The positioning of the sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) applicators in a mannequin model.\n\n【28】<img/>\n\n【29】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【30】Figure 3\n\n【31】The sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) applicator on a mannequin model demonstrating that once a patient feels the medication in the back of the throat, the medication has reached the SPGB (marked with the green circle).\n\n【32】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【33】At the end of the procedure, the patient was asked to sit up. She reported that her shoulder pain had entirely resolved, 0/10 on NRS.\n\n【34】During the procedure, the patient reported having some difficulty swallowing because it felt like the back of her throat was numb. This sensation resolves on its own after several minutes. On postoperative day 12, when the patient was being discharged from the hospital, she remained pain free in her shoulder. The patient was followed up 1 month later via a telephone call. At that time, the patient excitedly reported that she has been pain free in her shoulder since the SPGB treatment.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】Open pancreaticoduodenectomy is one of the most complicated surgeries and involves a significant amount of intra-abdominal manipulation. When the head of the pancreas is affected, patients typically perceive pain in the T5–T9 regions; however, when the tail of the pancreas is involved, patients experience referred pain to the left shoulder secondary to the innervation of the C3–C5 dermatomes. 5 6 As in our patient’s situation described above and in many other pancreaticoduodenectomy surgeries, when the epidural is inserted at the thoracic level, the epidural is unable to relieve a patient of the referred shoulder pain. Systemic medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids, are often trialled with limited effectiveness. 2 Furthermore, opioids are commonly associated with adverse reactions, such as respiratory depression, sedation, dizziness, gastrointestinal disturbances, tolerance and physical dependence. 7\n\n【37】When the administration of acetaminophen, ketorolac, lidocaine transdermal patch, oxycodone and hydromorphone did not provide sufficient left shoulder pain relief to our patient, the SPGB, a technique first described by Sluder over a century ago, 8 was used and found to be highly effective. The precise neurophysiological mechanism that explains the observed results in our patient is unknown; perhaps it will be elucidated with future work.\n\n【38】Since there is only one sphenopalatine ganglion, the commonly accepted SPGB technique is to place local anaesthetic topically by way of both the left and right nasal passages local anesthetic-soaked swabs, contributing to successful transmucosal reach and coverage of the SPG. 9 However, the sphenopalatine ganglion is a bilateral structure, so, in theory, a block just through the left nasal passage could have also potentially achieved the observed result. There are several commercially available devices available to perform SPGB, but the administration of this block via the assembly of cotton-tip applicators from supplies that are readily available in most medical centres is simple and inexpensive. 4 9–13 The fascinating aspect of this block is that not only does it treat numerous pain conditions, including headaches of various aetiologies, neck pain, back pain 6 10–13 and now postoperative shoulder pain, but it also, somehow, has a long-term effect. Even after the temporary effects of local anaesthetic wear off, certain pain conditions resolve and never return after this treatment. This interesting phenomenon would benefit from further investigation. In the meantime, we suggest that this technique be considered for patients with postsurgical shoulder tip pain.\n\n【39】### Learning points\n\n【40】*   This is the first report of a successful treatment of intractable ipsilateral shoulder pain after an open pancreaticoduodenectomy with topical transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion block using a cotton-tipped applicator.\n    \n*   Although there are several commercially available devices available to perform sphenopalatine ganglion blocks, the sphenopalatine ganglion block can also be effectively performed by quickly and inexpensively creating cotton-tip applicators from supplies that are readily available in most medical centres.\n    \n*   The cotton-tip applicators can be created from the combination of hollow cotton swabs, intravenous extension tubing with a stop cock, 3 mL syringes, 5% lidocaine ointment and 4% lidocaine topical solution.\n    \n\n【41】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【42】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【43】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The pain was mainly located in the groin radiating to the greater trochanteric region, had no nocturnal component and was associated with a slight functional hip discomfort such as difficulties to get up from the seat and to put on shoes. Conventional anteroposterior radiographs of the right and left hips showed bilateral subchondral cysts in the inferior half of the femoral heads ( figure 1A ). T1W axial MR image revealed isointense aspect of the cyst on the right side and inhomogeneous hyperintense aspect of the cyst on the left side ( figure 1B ). As subchondral cysts usually imply the presence of an underlying osteoarthritic disease process, the patient was recommended to consider treatment with total hip prosthesis. From a radiological standpoint, however, the subchondral cysts were not consistent with the typical presentation of osteoarthritis. Herein we discuss, in brief, the differential diagnosis of subchondral cysts, involving four distinct disorders: osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (CPPD) and osteonecrosis (ON), and we explain why these subchondral cysts should be rather considered in the context of ON.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】(A) Anteroposterior radiographs of the right (and left (hips.

Both 'lesions' are characterised by intralesional pencil-fine (osseous lamellar) septations and a sharp limited sclerotic peripheral contour delineation. note also the globally preserved sphericity of the femoral heads bilateral with no apparent collapse.\n\n【9】The presence of a subchondral cyst in a weight bearing area, unless otherwise proven, almost always suggests OA, particularly when other characteristics of OA such as narrowing of the joint space, subchondral sclerosis and osteophyte formation are also present. Nevertheless, its presence in patients with OA is only around 30% in comparison with the other three findings, which are observed in more than 90% of patients with OA. 1 In this specific case, these three features were not accentuated, and subchondral cysts were not located where we would expect them to be seen in a typical OA, that is, at the superolateral region of the coxofemoral joint. Less frequently, patients with RA may also present with subchondral cysts. These patients, however, usually develop synovial cysts and bursa which relieve the elevated intra-articular pressure eliminating one of the pathophysiologic risk factors for subchondral cyst formation. Given the fact that our patient had no other findings associated with an autoimmune and inflammatory process makes this diagnosis less likely. Finally, subchondral cysts may also be observed in patients with CPPD; but these patients feature usually numerous widespread subchondral cysts which are observed in the context of an advanced degenerative joint process even more accentuated than OA, which was not present in the current case. Consequently, the absence of degenerative, autoimmune and inflammatory findings argues against the diagnosis of OA, RA or CPPD. We therefore concluded a diagnosis by exclusion of the other possibilities and made a tentative diagnosis of ON and recommended follow-up. The difference in the signal intensity between the two cystic structures is due to the different onset of the subchondral cysts and hence different rate of progress. 2\n\n【10】The differentiation of a subchondral cyst is not always simple. Its size, location and especially the nature of the accompanying findings help make the differential diagnosis. Treatment of each of the entities discussed above varies, hence a meticulous work-up to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate management is important.\n\n【11】### Learning points\n\n【12】*   Subchondral cysts usually develop in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (CPPD) but may also be observed in patients with osteonecrosis.\n    \n*   The absence of degenerative, autoimmune and inflammatory findings argues against the diagnosis of OA, RA or CPPD.\n    \n*   Treatment of each of these entities varies, hence a meticulous work-up to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate management is important.\n    \n\n【13】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【14】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【15】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Although some mitotic activity is expected to be found in sebaceous glands’ cells, the transformation to sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is very rare. 1 SC accounts for 0.7% of skin malignancy, and it arises from the sebaceous glands’ adnexal epithelium. 2 3 SC was introduced as a separate entity for the first time in 1956 by Straatsma. 4 The pathogenesis of SC remains unexplained by previous studies; however, a few known associated risk factors, such as old age, have been reported; in fact, it has been referred to as a ‘malignancy of the elderly’. Other risk factors, such as exposure to radiation and immunosuppression, have also been described. 5 Additionally, any patient diagnosed with SC must be referred to exclude the possibility of a coexistent autosomal dominant skin condition, the Muir-Torre syndrome, which is characterised by sebaceous neoplasms and internal malignancies. 6 Patients with the Muir-Torre syndrome were reported to have a far less aggressive and earlier presentation of SCs when compared with the de novo SCs course. 7 In these cases, 75% of the SCs are usually found in the periocular area with only 25% diagnosed in an extraocular site at which they are mostly found in the skin of the head and neck or other areas with hair follicles. 8 Photodamage and associated DNA damage were hypothesised to be the reason behind such proclivity to the head and neck region in addition to the higher density of sebaceous glands in the head and neck. 9 The external auditory canal (EAC) extends from the concha laterally to the tympanic membrane medially, and this canal is divided into a cartilaginous outer one-third area and an inner bony two-thirds. Both are lined with stratified squamous epithelium, however, only the outer one-third contains dermal adnexa which can be the origin of sebaceous gland carcinoma. 10 The incidence of SC in the outer one-third of the EAC is considered extremely rare. A recent study reported that less than 15 cases of EAC sebaceous neoplasms are currently available in the literature. 11 However, a comprehensive review of the available literature revealed that only eight case reports of SC originating in the EAC are available, which emphasises the importance of having a high index of suspicion in such cases. This extremely rare carcinoma can lead to misdiagnosis of this condition as an inflammatory one, which can lead to delayed management and an increase in mortality.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A male patient in his late 70s who was a known case of hypertension and controlled with indapamide was seen at our facility. His medical history included a postspinal tumour that had been treated with surgery and radiation more than 40 years ago and had a residual left-sided hemiplegia. He presented to the otolaryngology clinic at Al-Hada Armed Forces Hospital having right ear pain and purulent discharge. His pain had started 6 months before presenting to the clinic and was constant and progressive since then. The pain was associated with a bilateral decrease in hearing for a long time. Local right ear examination revealed a right ear soft granular tissue mass occupying the right EAC mainly in the posterior wall of the canal with bleeding on touch. The right tympanic membrane could not be visualised. The first clinical impression was otitis externa after which a culture was taken from the discharge. The patient was managed with betamethasone and fucidin and given an appointment to assess the response to local medications. By the time of the follow-up appointment, the culture showed no growth; however, the patient did not improve, and right ear otalgia and the purulent discharge had increased in severity. An examination revealed an oedematous canal with pus and a non-visible tympanic membrane.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】A pure tone average test revealed right profound mixed hearing loss and left moderate to severe sensory neural hearing loss. The patient was admitted as a case of right ear mass for biopsy with middle ear exploration. A histological examination with routine H&E staining is demonstrated in figure 1 and shows lobules or sheets of cells separated by a fibrovascular stroma. Infiltrating edges in addition to sebaceous glands with variable degrees of differentiation and atypia were observed. A diagnoses of moderately differentiated SC was made. The patient underwent CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, but no evidence of distant metastases were found on these scans. Figure 2 shows a CT scan with bone window and MRI with intravenous contrast that revealed a large enhanced soft tissue mass occupying the cartilaginous and bony right EAC (epicentre in ECA). This mass produced destruction of the posterior wall of the EAC and invaded the mastoid air cells. Medially, the mass was inseparable from the tympanic membrane. Extension to the hypotympanum questionably involving the fascial recess, while the sinus tympani was spared. The ossicular chain was intact, and inner ear structures were unremarkable.\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】Figure 1\n\n【17】Resected mass tissue stained with H&E in different magnifications.

Lack of wide-spread infiltration and preserved subcutaneous fat planes negated the possibility of malignant otitis externa. The petrous apex was preserved. The features suggested an aggressive looking neoplastic mass (EAC malignancy resemble squamous cell carcinoma or other malignancy) rather than an infectious process.\n\n【24】Treatment\n---------\n\n【25】The patient underwent complete debulking of the right ear mass. Fragile eroded skin was observed. The mass originated mainly from the anterior meatal wall occupying all the EAC, it bleeds easily, and it caused widening of the EAC (‘funnelling’); however, intraoperatively the middle ear was spared, and the tympanic membrane and bones were intact. Frozen sections demonstrated clear margins, and histopathology confirmed the excision of moderately differentiated SC.

(F) Positive for low-molecular-weight CK. (G) Negative for S100 protein.\n\n【30】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【31】Postoperatively, the patient was scheduled for external beam radiation therapy for 4 weeks over the surgical bed. The patient had been free of recurrence after the radiation, but then he died of an unrelated pulmonary infection.\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】An SC is characterised by slow growth accompanied by a local aggressive and invasive nature. Patients are reported to present late with an advanced tumour and distant metastasis, and the time of presentation and diagnosis has been reported to be from 1–3 years. 12 Similar to our case, most patients who were diagnosed with an EAC SC reported that the onset of tolerable symptoms started years 13 or months before seeking medical attention. 11 Some patients mentioned a long history of chronic ear infection since childhood, 14 and one reported a previously excised sebaceous adenoma presenting 3 years later with malignancy. 15 The age of our elderly 78-year-old patient matched the established data concerning SC predilection in older ages. 16 The median age at diagnosis was 73, which was reported in more than a thousand patients. 17 In a smaller review of 29 Korean patients, the mean age of presentation was 69 years, and an additional interesting finding highlighted a peak in the occurrence of extraocular SC between 70 and 79 years. 7 Specific gender proclivity to developing SC has been previously suggested in which a 54% male predominance was reported 17 ; however, this finding contradicts many substantial published reports 2 16 18 among the systematic review of EAC SC cases ( table 1 ).\n\n【34】View this table:\n\n【35】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【36】Table 1\n\n【37】A systematic review of EAC SC cases published to date.\n\n【38】Female predominance was observed. Our patient had a history of cervical spinal radiation due to a cervical tumour that had occurred 45 years ago. According to the existing body of literature, exposure to radiation is a well-known risk factor. Over 1000 (1349) cases of SC in various sites over a period of 31 years were reviewed by Dasgupta _et al_ in which they revealed that 74 (5.4%) of all patients had a history of treatment with radiation treatment. 17 The first report of radiation-induced SC was suggested as a possible risk factor was in 1970 by Martin _et al_ . 19 Multiple reports of SC in areas in which radiation was used to treat other conditions was previously reported. 20 21 Interestingly, diuretic use was also reported as a possible risk factor . 22 A more recent meta-analysis suggested that diuretics, thiazides specifically, are associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. 23 Our patient was taking indapamide to control his blood pressure for a long unspecified period. Indapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic 24 and is considered a photosensitising diuretic that has been found to be associated with skin cancer. These photosensitising diuretics are known to increase the skin cancer risk, especially at chronically sun-exposed areas. 25 However, the EAC is not a sun-exposed site; hence, no clear association between the long history of indapamide use in our patient and his SC diagnosis was found. Additionally, no high-quality evidence linking specific thiazide diuretic use to an increase in the risk of SC is available, which could be attributed to its rarity. Figure 4 summarises all possible risk factors for the development of EAC SC in the current case. Other important risk factors include immunosuppression, genetic factors, such as Muir-Torre Syndrome and p53 and LEF 1 mutations, and pre-existing sebaceous lesions. 5 Without histopathological identification, a wide range of lesions and neoplasms could be suspected. These lesions include benign lesions, such as cholesteatoma (which were excluded by the radiological findings in our case), sebaceoma, adenoma and sebaceous hyperplasia. Malignant ones, such as basal cell carcinoma or ceruminous gland tumours. 26 Differential diagnosis include benign lesions, such as pyogenic granuloma or malignant ones, such as squamous and basal cell carcinomas. 9 Grossly, some of the patients with EAC SC presented with a mass that is fleshy or bleeds on touch 8 15 similar to our presented case. Others reported a painless mass protruding from the EAC. 11 22 Preocular SCs are usually yellow in colour due to their lipid content. 5 An interesting finding among patients with EAC SCs is the proclivity to affect the right ear in particular ( table 1 ). All reported cases occurred in the right ear except for one case. No explanation for this finding has been found yet. The diagnosis of SC is challenging, and a histopathological analysis is needed to achieve an accurate diagnosis and to differentiate mimicking conditions, including benign sebaceous neoplasms tumours and basal cell carcinomas. H&E staining of SC reveals a lobular architecture, foamy cytoplasmic vacuolisation if the tumour is well-differentiated, nuclear pleomorphism and high mitotic activity. 1 SC can resemble either basal or squamous cell carcinoma; hence, immunohistochemical staining can aid in distinguishing SCs from other skin malignancies, such as basal or squamous cell carcinoma or malignant melanoma. Our case’s tissue staining was positive for epithelial membrane antigen, a finding that is consistent with Ansai _et al_ 27 ; however, this type of staining is also positive in cases of squamous cell carcinoma. Cytokeratin 7 (CK-7) was also positive; however, it was reported to be positive in some basal and squamous cell carcinoma cases. 28 Similar to other reported cases of SC, 9 29 our patient also showed negative S100 protein staining differentiating it from other skin malignancies. Cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6) was reported to be positive in three out of five ocular SCs 30 indeed, it was also positive in our case. Cytokeratin 19 shows focal positivity with sebaceous tumours and strong positivity with basal cell carcinomas thus facilitating their distinction. 31 Other high and low-molecular-weight cytokeratins, respectively have also been used to distinguish SCs from squamous or basal cell carcinomas. 32 Surgical excision with wide local excision is the cornerstone of SC treatment regardless of its site. 7 9 Surprisingly, lymph node metastasis was reported to affect only 1.3% based on a large database study, and only 23 patients out of 1349 (1.7%) needed regional lymph node sampling or dissection. 17 To date, no consensuses on the use of postoperative radiotherapy can be found; however, based on tumour extension and metastasis, such radiotherapy might be indicated. 33 Available data suggest that combining both surgical and radiological methods can aid in lowering the reoccurrence rate. 34 Prognosis after SC excision has been linked to a high risk of recurrence. 2 Thus, long-term follow-up is warranted since distant metastasis have been reported 11 years after the initial diagnosis. 35\n\n【39】<img/>\n\n【40】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【41】Figure 4\n\n【42】All possible risk factors for external auditory canal (EAC) sebaceous carcinoma that our patient presented with (drawn by SAS).\n\n【43】### Learning points\n\n【44】*   Sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is a rare skin malignancy and is usually present in the periocular area.

Intravascular tumour thrombi were observed. On the basis of imaging and the pathology report, we diagnosed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (stage IV, cT4N2M1) of the pancreatic tail with direct invasion of the adjacent spleen and with left adrenal gland, right testis, liver and bone metastases.

(B) Positive immunohistochemical stains of CK7, CK20 and Smad4 (×400).\n\n【43】### Follow-up and outcome\n\n【44】The patient’s disease progressed following poor response to chemotherapy. Thus, the patient underwent palliative chemoradiation therapy approximately 4 months later.\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】Cancer metastasis to the testis has a prevalence of approximately 0.04%, with bilateral metastasis occurring in up to 15% of patients. 1 2 The average age range at the time of diagnosis of primary testicular cancer is 50–69 years. 9 The rarity of secondary cancer metastasis to the testis may be attributable to the low temperature of the scrotum or the blood–testis barrier. 8 10\n\n【47】The most common cancers to metastasise to the testes are leukaemia, lymphoma, renal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and prostate, lung and colorectal cancers. Rarely do thyroid cancer, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, gastric carcinoma, upper tract urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma or bladder cancer metastasise to the testis. In children, neuroblastoma, Wilms’ tumour and rhabdomyosarcoma are common origins of metastasis. 3–8\n\n【48】Zhang _et al_ analysed the literature on pancreatic and ampullary tumours with metastasis to the testis from the last 40 years. A total of 15 cases were reported, predominantly among Japanese men. Typical disease presentation was one slowly enlarging (painless or painful) palpable mass in the scrotum and no specific gastrointestinal symptoms. The incidence of metastasis to the right and left testes from pancreatic cancer was the same. Among the 15 cases, 8 and 7 patients’ carcinoma, respectively, originated from the pancreatic tail and from the pancreatic head or ampulla. 11\n\n【49】The underlying path of pancreatic tumour metastasis to the scrotum remains unknown, although several studies have proposed local invasion of adjacent organs by pancreatic cancer, implicating their vasculature in pseudoaneurysms and subsequent distant hematogenous metastasis. 12–14 Other studies have proposed lymph node metastasis or direct transperitoneal seeding from peritoneal carcinomatosis through the tunica vaginalis. 12\n\n【50】In our case, immunohistochemical staining was performed, and CK7, CK20 and SMAD4 were positive in the testicular tumour tissue, which is compatible with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Physical examination of the patient revealed hardness of the left spermatic cord but no mass lesion in the left testis. No specific abnormal finding, such as a testicular tumour, was observed in the scrotal sonography.\n\n【51】Chemotherapy is suggested for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, although the literature does not specify an exact regimen to follow. At our multidisciplinary team conference, the specialist, by referring to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines (version 2, 2021), 15 advised that modified FOLFIRINOX with (or without) subsequent chemoradiation therapy was the best approach for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, our patient had poor response to chemoradiation therapy.\n\n【52】Although atypical metastatic tumours in the male genital tract from pancreatic cancer are rare, thorough examination to elucidate tumour origin is warranted in men of an advanced age.\n\n【53】### Learning points\n\n【54】*   For older men with testicular tumours, retroperitoneal tumour metastasis and pancreatic tumour should be considered, and comprehensive study should be performed to support a diagnosis.\n    \n*   Atypical metastatic tumours in the male genital tract from pancreatic cancer are rare.\n    \n*   Both physical examination and imaging, including sonography, are needed to make a diagnosis for patients such as ours, especially when they present with a metastatic testicular mass.\n    \n\n【55】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【56】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【57】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

X-ray of her hands revealed chondrocalcinosis of bilateral metacarpo-phalangeal, proximal inter-phalangeal joints and triangular fibrocartilage complex ( figure 1B arrows). Subchondral scleroses of the bilateral radial ends were seen. Ultrasound evaluation revealed depositions within triangular fibrocartilage complex. Power Doppler signal over wrist joints demonstrated inflammatory in nature ( figure 2A and B ). Intra-articular aspiration to the left wrist was done; material obtained was examined under polarised microscope revealed rhomboidal-shaped crystal with positive birefringent, consistent with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease. Patient had complete recovery from acute pain episode after short course of colchicines.

The prevalence for CPPD was 4.5% in UK, with a higher prevalence in the elderly. 1 Despite the high prevalence, CPPD still remained under-diagnosed, likely due to diagnostic challenges and lead to ineffective treatment. 2 Conventionally, plain radiograph provides important information in diagnosing CPPD. Presence of chondrocalcinosis is a useful finding as shown in our case. 2 3 Ultrasound evaluation has been studied extensively and has been proposed as a diagnostic method by the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) task force. 3 4 These ultrasound studies described the shape, echogenicity and location of CPPD crystals, with sensitivity as high as 80% in hyaline cartilage and high specificity ranging 93%–100%. 4 In our case, hyperechoic depositions within triangular fibrocartilage complex based on ultrasound were characteristics of CPPD crystal. Coupled with synovial fluid and radiographic findings, this established the diagnosis of CPPD beyond a shadow of a doubt.\n\n【14】### Learning points\n\n【15】*   Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) is common among the elderly.\n    \n*   Diagnostic modalities include plain radiography, ultrasound examination and demonstration of CPPD crystal under polarised microscope.\n    \n*   Appropriate treatment may result in complete resolution of arthritis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The rash started 5 days after he self-administered a dose of insulin glargine that was 3 months beyond the expiration date. The rash started as pruriginous hives in the chest and spread to the extremities and head as a maculopapular rash with flaking. He denied any previous history of skin disease or malignancy. The patient’s home medications included apixaban, insulin glargine, chlorthalidone, ergocalciferol, fenofibrate, levothyroxine and valsartan. He had no allergies to medications, and he denied smoking, drinking alcohol or the use of recreational drugs.\n\n【5】On arrival to the emergency room, his vital signs were as follows: temperature 37°C, heart rate 108 beats per minute, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute and blood pressure 135/68 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were normal. Skin examination revealed diffuse scaly desquamating pink plaques covering the whole body and head including scalp but sparing the face ( figures 1 and 2 ). Left-sided supraclavicular and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy were palpable. There was no nail pitting, hair loss, joint pain or swelling. Oral mucosa was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations were significant for a glucose of 383 mg/dL, C reactive protein of 2.5 mg/dL and white cell count 177××10 <sup>9 </sup> /L with 1.6% eosinophils. Antinuclear antibody showed a fine granular and speckled pattern with a titter of 1:160. HIV, syphilis serology, and Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 and HTLV-2 were negative. CT scan with intravenous contrast of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no evidence of malignancy but mildly prominent bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, presumed to be reactive. Multiple skin biopsies revealed superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, dilated and tortuous capillaries in multiple dermal papillae, psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, thin suprapapillary plates and broad mounds of parakeratosis ( figure 3 ). Immunohistochemistry showed lymphocytes to be predominantly CD3 positive T cells with CD4>CD8, retention of CD7, and CD20 showed a normal distribution of B cells, consistent with psoriasis. No evidence of cutaneous lymphoma was identified. Thus, based on the pathology and the clinical presentation the patient was diagnosed with erythrodermic psoriasis (EP).\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Desquamating rash of the hand.\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Back of the patient at admission.

The patient required treatment with an intravenous insulin drip in the intensive care unit. The patient was then switched to topical triamcinolone acetonide 1% ointment two times per day and oral cyclosporine 150 mg two times per day with improvement of the rash over 10 days. The patient was discharged home on his usual insulin glargine dose and all the other home medications. One week after discharge, the patient was readmitted for intravenous antibiotic treatment of otitis externa. At that time, he did not manifest a new or worsening rash. A perusal review of the literature did not show an association between EP and any of the patient’s home medications. The Naranjo probability scale was used to evaluate the adverse drug reaction. In our patient, the score was at least 7 or higher because some of the evaluations were not able to be performed. Our patient had self-administered a single dose of expired insulin glargine, and we did not repeat the administration, use a placebo, or detect the concentration in blood because he was already on insulin in the hospital. Therefore, we further postulated that expired insulin glargine was responsible for the induction of EP.\n\n【19】EP is rare and severe, only accounting for 1%–2.24% of psoriatic patients. 1 The common presentation is typically erythema, oedema, pruritus, ill-defined psoriatic plaques, scaling, hair loss, and rarely exudative lesions and palmoplantar or diffuse desquamation. 1 There have been several potential causes of EP. These range from environmental due to trauma, sunburn, alcoholism or infection; chemical reactions from CT contrast, topical tar; and systemic illness with HIV, leukaemia, lymphoma and gout. Medications such as lithium, bupropion, antimalarials, infliximab; discontinuing steroids, methotrexate and efalizumab have been associated with EP. 1 There is no previous description of EP associated with expired insulin glargine administration. The use of systemic glucocorticoids for EP is discouraged due to their ability to trigger severe psoriasis flares; however, this did not occur in our patient. Our patient was successfully treated with topical steroids and cyclosporine.\n\n【20】The exact pathogenesis of EP is not well understood. The disease is associated with predominantly T helper (Th) 2 expression from studies demonstrating increased levels of IgE in patients with EP. There is a switch from Th1 to Th2 dominant. 2 Type 1 IgE mediated has been the most reported type of hypersensitivity reaction to insulin but type 3 and type 4 can also occur. The presentation for insulin hypersensitivity typically ranges from a local erythema and swelling at the injection site to generalised reactions like urticaria and angioedema which does not match this patient’s presenting symptoms. 3 We believe this is the first report documenting a relationship between expired insulin and EP. The patient was advised about the correct use of medications before he was discharged.\n\n【21】### Learning points\n\n【22】*   Erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) should be suspected in a patient with a generalised cutaneous finding of erythema, oedema and pruritus after administration of expired insulin.\n    \n*   EP treatment with topical triamcinolone acetonide and oral cyclosporine is considered a better treatment option in diabetics to prevent further hyperglycaemia produced by systemic steroids.\n    \n*   Patient education regarding complications of insulin use should be addressed at all appointments.\n    \n\n【23】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【24】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【25】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The APW in often of the distal type (either type 2 or 3), which results in the pulmonary branches being widely separated and the IAA is often distal to the emergence of the left subclavian artery (type A). 1\n\n【25】Newborns with Berry syndrome are usually critically ill. The aortic origin of the RPA results in early pulmonary overcirculation due to an obligatory left-to-right shunt. Simultaneously, the perfusion of the lower body organs is entirely dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus due to an IAA. 2 Early clinical management is pivotal and includes diuretics and positive pressure ventilation to address the pulmonary congestion, as well as, when necessary, maintaining the arterial ductus patent with prostaglandin E1 infusion.\n\n【26】Despite optimal medical stabilisation, most require urgent surgery. Staged repair, consisting of pulmonary banding followed by a later surgical correction, can be considered, particularly in premature or small-for-gestational-age infants. 3 However, the treatment of choice is single stage repair. Various surgical techniques are available, namely, APW closure and RPA connection with the main pulmonary artery can be done by either direct anastomosis or by several flap techniques. 4–7 Management of the IAA depends on its location and distance of both aortic ends. It can be carried out using various techniques such as end-to-end anastomosis or an extensive mobilisation and reconstruction of the aorta, requiring patch augmentation or conduit interposition. 8\n\n【27】Berry syndrome, despite being rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of critically ill neonates presenting with severe coarctation presentation phenotype and signs of asymmetric pulmonary congestion.\n\n【28】### Learning points\n\n【29】*   Berry syndrome is a potential cause of heart failure in neonates.\n    \n*   Asymmetrical pulmonary congestion and the ‘butterfly sign’ should raise clinical suspicion about this entity.\n    \n\n【30】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【31】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【32】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

However, gushers may be encountered even in cases where the preoperative scans appear normal (1.5%–2.5%), 3 6 7 as current imaging modalities are sometimes unable to pick up minor communications between the internal acoustic canal and the cochlea.\n\n【5】A 14-month-old prelingually deaf boy underwent cochlear implantation with an Advanced Bionics-slim J electrode. Preoperative CT showed normal cochlear anatomy with normal dimensions of the cochlear and vestibular aqueduct. No defects could be detected in the lamina cribrosa or the modiolus. MRI showed the presence of bilateral vestibulocochlear nerves of appropriate diameter ( figure 1 ).

Controlled hyperventilation was initiated and intravenous propofol and mannitol were administered. The electrode array was inserted into the cochleostomy to stop the leak, but the pressure of the gusher was such that the electrode kept getting extruded. Pieces of periosteum were initially inserted around the electrode, but the leak continued to persist. Thin strips of temporalis fascia were then harvested and packed into the cochleostomy and around the electrode. Periosteum was further packed around the electrode to achieve a water-tight seal. Fibrin glue was applied.\n\n【11】Video 1\n\n【12】Intraoperative neural response imaging showed normal evoked compound action potential in all 16 electrodes. A postoperative X-ray confirmed the accurate positioning of the electrode ( figure 2 ). A lumbar drain was not used.

Since these symptoms were not severe, she was not admitted to a hospital for care. She has a history of well-controlled hypertension and bronchial asthma. MRI revealed a subacute right cerebral infarction with multiple severe stenosis of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) ( figure 1A ), even though they were intact when the MRI was performed, which is, by chance, due to the detailed examination for the numbness of the extremities and dizziness 3 years before ( figure 1B ). Simultaneously, prolonged erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) elevation (131 mm/hour) also coexisted. Serum myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were both negative and no other vascular complication as well as malignant tumour or signs of infectious diseases was shown by whole body contrast enhanced CT, however, the biopsy of the superficial temporal artery revealed inflammatory cell infiltration into the tunica media and thickening of the tunica intima ( figure 2 ), which were consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA). According to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of GCA, 1 the diagnosis of GCA and intracranial GCA (IC-GCA) was made and the patient was administered 25 mg per day of oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) in addition to antiplatelet therapy. After the initiation of prednisolone, the ESR promptly improved to 20 mm/hour, and the follow-up MRI exhibited an improvement in the MCA stenosis ( figure 3 ) without any recurrence of infraction up to 3 months later.\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】MRI revealed multiple severe stenosis of the bilateral middle cerebral artery (A; arrow head).

IC-GCA is difficult to diagnose when the patient initially presents with a stroke, 3 however, it is reported to be associate with significant mortality and more prevalent than currently recognised. 4 In this case, of course traditional stroke such as atherothrombotic infarction could not be ruled out, however, we concluded that it was more reasonable to explain newly developed bilateral multiple stenosis of MCA if the GCA was involved. Here, we report the unique MRI finding of bilateral MCA stenosis and emphasise the risk of potential underlying GCA among stroke patients, especially when the condition is accompanied by unexplained inflammation or headache.\n\n【18】### Learning points\n\n【19】*   Intracranial giant cell arteritis (GCA) is difficult to diagnose when the patient initially presents with a stroke.\n    \n*   Underlying GCA should be considered among stroke patients, especially when the condition is accompanied by unexplained inflammation or headache.\n    \n\n【20】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【21】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【22】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

GI amyloidosis can present with a wide range of symptoms including diarrhoea, bleeding and obstruction. This case illustrates a patient with localised jejunal amyloid light chain disease that was diagnosed serendipitously during a workup for haematuria. Our patient was otherwise asymptomatic, but this case underscores the importance of considering amyloidosis as a possible cause of isolated masses of the small intestine.\n\n【2】*   endoscopy\n*   small intestine\n*   general practice / family medicine\n*   haematology (incl blood transfusion)\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Clinical symptoms depend on the type of precursor protein, pattern and extent of organ involvement, although the underlying pathophysiology is not entirely understood. Localised gastrointestinal (GI) tract involvement is seen in 3%–8% of cases. 1 3 4 Patients present with a wide array of symptoms, ranging from macroglossia and xerostomia due to deposition in the tongue and salivary glands, respectively, to diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal pain from involvement of the small intestines and colon. 5 6 While the small intestine is the the most common GI site affected insystemic amyloidosis, sites of localised GI disease remain difficult to characterise due to non-specific results from endoscopy and imaging modalities. 5 Further, localised GI amyloidosis remains difficult to diagnose as clinical manifestations are dependent on the location and extent of organ involvement.\n\n【11】Here, we describe a case of localised AL amyloidosis, involving the jejunum, identified after an incidental mass was noted in the absence of typical symptoms. This is important to illustrate for several reasons, first that amyloid deposition in the GI tract must be considered in the differential diagnosis of isolated small intestinal masses in the absence of clinical symptoms. Second, it is also important to understand and identify patients with subclinical GI tract involvement to further understand the natural history of the disease, timing of intervention and ongoing surveillance required to limit tissue damage and organ dysfunction.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 62-year-old male patient with medical history of chronic hepatitis C treated successfully with ledipasvir/sofasbuvir therapy, hypertension and type 2 diabetes who developed recurrent haematuria, urinary tract infections, urinary frequency and nausea. Social history was significant for past intravenous drug abuse and 25 pack-year history of smoking (quit 2 years prior). He was treated with several courses of antibiotics for presumed urinary tract infections. Workup included a CT abdomen and pelvis which revealed a 2.3 cm hyperdense mass in the lower pole of the left kidney, multiple subcentimetre renal cysts and wall thickening in the proximal to mid jejunum approximately 2.0×2.2 cm in diameter. Given the incidental jejunal lesion noted on imaging and concern for lymphoma in the context of prior hepatitis C, He was then referred to gastroenterology and subsequently underwent a push enteroscopy for further work-up.\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】Push enteroscopy identified multiple medium-sized submucosal masses in the proximal to mid jejunum ( figures 1 and 2 ). Biopsies revealed Congo red positive deposits consistent with amyloid protein ( figure 3 ). Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry demonstrated a peptide profile consistent with AL (lambda) type amyloid protein. Further investigations included a serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) that was negative for a monoclonal spike, and negative cryoglobulins along with a normal complement profile (C1q, C4 and C3). Bone marrow was normocellular with a <5% polyclonal plasma cell population and negative for amyloid. A 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis was positive for proteinuria (24 hours total protein=79 mg) and immunofixation revealed free lambda light chains. Echocardiogram was notable for an ejection fraction of 55%–60%, and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Additional workup included a complete blood cell count with differential, troponin, N-terminal pro b type natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP), hepatic panel and international normalized ratio/ activated partial thromboplastin time (INR/aPTT) which were normal.\n\n【16】<img/>\n\n【17】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【18】Figure 1\n\n【19】Mid-jejunal submucosal mass.\n\n【20】<img/>\n\n【21】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【22】Figure 2\n\n【23】Mid-jejunal submucosal mass.\n\n【24】<img/>\n\n【25】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【26】Figure 3\n\n【27】Mucosa with glands and underlying salmon coloured amyloid (Congo red stain).\n\n【28】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【29】At a 2-week follow-up, he was again treated for a urinary tract infection and had a normal cystoscopy. At a subsequent 3-month visit, he reported haematochezia that prompted a colonoscopy which revealed internal haemorrhoids, diverticulosis and three <4 mm hyperplastic polyps in the sigmoid colon. Haematochezia was attributed to haemorrhoids, and addressed with supportive care. Blood work revealed an elevated creatinine (1.21 mg/dL), calcium (10.6 mg/dL) and uric acid (9.8 mg/mL) levels. Minimally elevated Kappa free light chains (1.98 mg/L), normal lambda free light chains (1.76 mg/L) with a normal ratio (1.13) were noted. Elevated IgA (421 mg/d)L with normal IgG and IgM was noted. Repeat SPEP, fat aspirate and echocardiogram were unremarkable. A diagnosis of localised AL amyloidosis involving the jejunum was suspected, with annual follow-ups recommended and close monitoring of symptoms. He continues to be stable with no GI or systemic symptoms after 3 years.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】In summary, we describe a patient with localised AL amyloidosis, involving only the jejunum, identified fortuitously on a workup for haematuria. Our patient was evaluated and ruled out for lymphoma, given past medical history of hepatitis C. Further, a normal complement profile along with the absence of cryoglobulinaemia was also noted in our patient.\n\n【32】While systemic amyloidosis is a heterogeneous disease, with varying clinical manifestations, localised amyloidosis remains a challenging diagnosis to prove. 1 3 5 The presence of GI symptoms, along with direct biopsy evidence of involvement remains the gold standard for defining GI disease in amyloidosis. Pragmatically, that is much less common. Amyloidosis of the GI tract is usually systemic. All organs of the GI tract may be impacted in AL amyloidosis. Symptoms vary depending on organ and extent of involvement. Hepatic involvement may be present in up to 70% of patients with systemic amyloidosis, with either subtle manifestations like an isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase to fulminate hepatic failure. 5 7 Pancreatic involvement is much less common but can manifest as exocrine or endocrine dysfunction. 5\n\n【33】The small intestine is the most common GI site affected by systemic amyloidosis and presentation is often dependent on the pattern of protein deposition. Symptoms typically differ based on the type of amyloid deposition. AA amyloid is more often defined by symptoms of diarrhoea and malabsorption likely due to its mucosal predominance of protein deposition. 6 However, AL generally is more predominant in the muscular layer and can present with obstructive symptoms. 6 8 Endoscopic AL amyloid involvement of the GI tract is more characterised by polypoid protruding masses as opposed to AA amyloid which is usually characterised by friable mucosa and ulcerations. 8–10 There are previous cases of AL amyloidosis diagnosed following the presentation of life-threatening GI bleeding. 3 11 Proven GI tract involvement in AL amyloidosis is rare; in one review of 2300 amyloid cases, just 3.2% (76 patients) had biopsy-proven GI involvement. 4 The majority of these cases were identified due to symptomatic involvement of the GI tract, with the most common symptoms including early satiety, GI bleeding and diarrhoea. 4 Management of small bowel amyloidosis is generally aimed at treating the underlying process which in the case of AL amyloid often involves chemotherapy targeted at controlling the production of the precursor protein. However, symptomatic management which can range from antinausea, dysmotility and antidiarrhoeal agents are all important treatment modalities. 6 7\n\n【34】Localised GI amyloidosis without evidence of other organ involvement or an associated plasma cell dyscrasia is rare. A retrospective review of 2300 patients identified only 16 with localised amyloidosis of the GI tract. 4 Symptoms included GI bleeding in eight (50%), heartburn in eight (50%) and constipation in three patients (19%). 4 Biopsy sites included the stomach in 8 (50%), colon in 7 (44%) and small bowel in 3 patients (19%) and 11 of the 16 cases had AL type disease. Supportive care without treatment was recommended for all patients. All were alive at a median 39 months follow-up mark. 4 However, case reports with fatal GI bleeds as manifestations of localised amyloidosis have been described, suggesting that the complete spectrum of the disease remains unknown. 11\n\n【35】Our patient with localised AL amyloidosis, involving the jejunum, is interesting as localised jejunal involvement in amyloidosis is very rare. To our knowledge, only one other case of jejunal amyloidosis has been reported to date. 11 In contrast to our patient who was asymptomatic, the previously described patient presented with pain and fatal GI bleeding. Clinically, our patient continues to be asymptomatic 3 years after diagnosis, without any need for intervention or additional therapies. While our case underscores the importance of considering localised GI amyloid deposits in the differential diagnosis of unexplained small intestinal submucosal masses or ulcerations, it also emphasises the importance of recognising subclinical localised GI involvement in amyloidosis. It highlights the need to outline the natural history of the disease to better define when to, initiate appropriate treatment and in turn, limit tissue damage.\n\n【36】### Learning points\n\n【37】*   While small intestinal involvement of amyloid light chain amyloidosis is well established, isolated jejunal involvement with the absence of typical symptoms or other organ involvement is unusual and demonstrates amyloidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of isolated submucosal masses of the small intestine.\n    \n*   Localised amyloidosis to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is rare and an extensive evaluation for end-organ involvement is essential in order to determine appropriate treatment and surveillance.\n    \n*   Early recognition of the disease is important to limit tissue damage, organ dysfunction and prevent GI complications like mucosal ulcerations, GI bleeding, diarrhoea, weight loss and malabsorption.\n    \n\n【38】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【39】The authors will like to thank, Dr. Sandeep Bahadur for performing the endoscopy and providing biopsies for the diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

It has a male predominance seen during the sixth and seventh decade. 1 It arises from the urothelium although has a pure glandular histology. 2 Haematuria is the most common presenting symptom and various cystoscopic morphologies exist like solid, papillary, sessile or ulcerated. Notable risk factors for adenocarcinoma include schistosomiasis, chronic irritation, cystocoele and exstrophy bladder. Adenocarcinoma of the bladder may be primary in origin or may be secondary to involvement by adjacent organs. Urachal adenocarcinoma although a separate entity is frequently grouped with bladder adenocarcinoma. No case has been ever reported in the literature of a bladder carcinoma with inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus. This is a first case of its kind to be reported with tumour extending through the iliac veins into the IVC.\n\n【5】A 60-year-old man presented with haematuria and history of transurethral resection of bladder mass done elsewhere. General and physical examination revealed no positive findings and he had a poor performance status. Histopathology was suggestive of adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder with tumour infiltrating the deep muscle. Contrast enhanced CT scan revealed 7.2×6.5 cm mass arising from the dome and the right posterolateral wall of the urinary bladder and extending into right ureter for a length of 3.5 cm causing gross hydroureteronephrosis ( figure 1 ). The mass was seen extending into the small bowel mesentery and the mesorectal fascia and seminal vesicles. An enhancing tumour thrombus was also seen for a length of 5.2 cm in the distal IVC extending into bilateral common iliac veins and the right internal and external iliac veins. Metastatic work up revealed extensive lesions in the lungs and the skeleton ( figure 2 ). Creatinine clearance of the patient improved to 70 mL/min post insertion of the nephrostomy tube. The patient was started on low-molecular weight heparin and also received palliative chemotherapy. The patient succumbed to illness 3 months after presentation.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Coronal sections showing the bladder mass and the inferior vena cava thrombus (A) and the upstream right hydroureteronephrosis as a result of the bladder mass and right ureteric extension (B).\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Axial section of the thorax revealing multiple parenchymal pulmonary metastatic deposits.\n\n【14】Prevention of pulmonary embolism is of utmost priority in such patients with anticoagulation and IVC filter being the mainstay. 3 Although low-molecular weight heparin is preferred with total/near total tumour thrombus or those with a bland thrombus, IVC filter may be required in patients when anticoagulation fails or is contraindicated.

It was developed by Donald Nuss in 1987 and implemented as primary treatment in the late 1990s. 1 This minimally invasive surgery achieves improvement of thoracic anatomy, aesthetics and cardiopulmonary function. 1 2 However, early and late complications of the Nuss procedure often occur. Complications may be seen intraoperatively (eg, haemothorax, pericardial perforation, arrhythmias) or postoperatively (eg, bar displacement, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, wound infections, pericardial effusion). 1 Bar displacement is one of the most prevalent complications. 1 Three types of bar displacement can be distinguished: lateral sliding, flipping or posterior disruption. Displacement is mostly seen within 30 days after initial placement, 3 although it can occur at any point during follow-up. Fortunately, due to the introduction of stabilisers and fixation techniques, the incidence has decreased over the years from 15% to 3%–7%. 4\n\n【10】In this report, we present a patient with an abdominal location of a bar due to the extraordinary occurrence of subdiaphragmatic migration following the Nuss procedure.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】The patient is an adolescent boy with a history of mild scoliosis and epilepsy, without any seizures or medication in the 7 years prior to surgery. To remedy cosmetic problems of PE, he underwent a thoracoscopic-guided Nuss procedure. During the procedure, no unexpected events occurred and the patient completed his admission without complications. Perioperative images showed a good intrathoracic placement of the Nuss bar. One month after surgery, he presented with thoracic pain, which was interpreted as persistent postoperative pain. Physical examination and a thoracic X-ray showed no abnormalities and an unaltered position of the Nuss bar. Eight months after surgery, he presented with position-dependent discomfort and a recurrence of the PE, for which bar revision was indicated. During surgery, subdiaphragmatic and intra-abdominal migration of the bar were seen. Subsequently, the bar was removed, and a new bar was placed intrathoracically.\n\n【13】Initial Nuss bar placement\n--------------------------\n\n【14】The initial bar placement by video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) was done under both general and epidural anaesthesia, with the patient placed in supine position. The bar was measured and bent to fit size. An incision was made on both sides of the thorax, followed by submuscular tunnelling. A 5 mm trocar was introduced in the anterior section of the axillary region on the right side, followed by insufflation of carbon dioxide and tunnelling under thoracoscopic vision. A precordial tunnel from side to side was created. A silicon tube was secured to the tunneler, after which the previously bent bar was pulled back through the precordial tunnel ( figure 1 ). The bar turned with good result, and haemodynamic changes were not noted. A fixation plate was introduced on the left side, on which the lateral part of the bar was bent to prevent slip-off of the plate. Haemostasis of the precordial tunnel and operative wounds was achieved. The wounds were closed in layers. The procedure was carried out without any complications and with minimal blood loss. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3.\n\n【15】<img/>\n\n【16】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【17】Figure 1\n\n【18】Intraoperative view of first bar placement.\n\n【19】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【20】The first postoperative X-ray showed a good position of the bar ( figure 2 ). When thoracic symptoms persisted, a second X-ray was performed, which was initially described as showing no abnormalities ( figure 3 ). A second reading, however, did show caudal displacement and potential rotation of the bar with the right hemidiaphragm projecting over the bar.\n\n【21】<img/>\n\n【22】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【23】Figure 2\n\n【24】Postoperative X-thorax after first bar placement.\n\n【25】<img/>\n\n【26】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【27】Figure 3\n\n【28】Follow-up X-thorax.\n\n【29】Treatment\n---------\n\n【30】The revision by VATS was carried out under both general and epidural anaesthesia, with the patient placed in supine position. Incisions were made at the same level as during the previous surgery and scar tissue was excised. Subsequently, the bar and fixation plate on the left side were mobilised. Led by palpable movement, localisation of the bar was attempted on the right side without any success. A 5 mm trocar was introduced in the frontal axillary region on the right side, followed by creating thoracoscopic vision. Under direct vision, the bar could not be identified on the right side of the thorax. Migration to the subdiaphragmatic region appeared to have occurred, as movement of the bar was seen below the diaphragm. There were no signs of damage to the diaphragm or surrounding tissues ( figure 4 ). The left thoracic incision site was extended, and the Nuss bar was manually removed through the left side, without any haemodynamic changes. A precordial tunnel from side to side was created again. A silicon tube was secured to the tunnelling instrument, after which the newly bent bar was retracted through the precordial tunnel. The bar turned with good result and without any haemodynamic changes. A fixation plate was introduced; this time on the right side, on which the lateral part of the bar was bent to prevent slip-off of the plate. Haemostasis of the precordial tunnel and operative wounds was achieved. The wounds were closed in layers. The operation was carried out without any complications and with minimal blood loss. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3.\n\n【31】<img/>\n\n【32】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【33】Figure 4\n\n【34】Intraoperative view of absent intrathoracic bar with intact diaphragm.\n\n【35】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【36】The postoperative course was without complications. Five days after the revision procedure, adequate correction of anatomy and appearance of the thorax were seen. The patient had no thoracic symptoms and was pleased with the result. The X-ray showed an adequate position of the bar ( figure 5 ).\n\n【37】<img/>\n\n【38】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【39】Figure 5\n\n【40】Postoperative X-thorax after bar revision.\n\n【41】Discussion\n----------\n\n【42】Extrathoracic or intra-abdominal migration of a Nuss bar is a rare event, in contrast to intrathoracic bar displacement, which occurs rather frequently.\n\n【43】Several cases have been reported with different types of bar displacement and only a few with intra-abdominal migration. Simon _et al_ have reported an intra-abdominal migration of a bar into the stomach in a man in his 20s. 5 Tahmassebi _et al_ reported a case of a man in late adolescence, in which VATS failed to view an intrathoracic bar. 6 By instrumental palpation, subdiaphragmatic position of the bar was concluded. Via an incision in the diaphragm, the bar was successfully removed without complications.\n\n【44】Moreover, Tahmassebi _et al_ present 12 other bar migration cases from literature, in most of which the aetiology remained unclear. Migration sites included peritoneum, ascending aorta, left ventricle of the heart and liver. 6\n\n【45】Among other types of displacement, Hoel _et al_ reported a life-threatening laceration of the ascending aorta in a young boy 2 months after a Nuss procedure. A cardiac tamponade was the consequence of this laceration, which was relieved by immediate needle aspiration from the pericardium and subsequent median sternotomy for removal of the bar. 7 Furthermore, Yang _et al_ presented a similar case in which displacement of the bar caused cardiac tamponade 6 months after the Nuss procedure. 8\n\n【46】Kanegaonkar and Dussek presented a case report of three bar migration cases. One case was a patient in early adolescence who at the age of 2 years had received a lower lobectomy for an unresolving lobar consolidation. Because of sternal depression, the patient underwent resection of the costal cartilages from the third rib downwards and a partial transverse sternotomy followed by a bar placement. During elective bar removal after 2 years, a part of the bar was seen buried into newly formed bone of the sixth rib. The other two cases presented by Kanegaonkar and Dussek concerned bar migration into the thoracic cavity. One was observed during elective bar removal, the other was seen on CT after a failed attempt to remove the bar because it could not be located during surgery. 9\n\n【47】While bar displacement may occur in 3%–7% of cases, bar migration is a rather extraordinary occurrence with an unknown prevalence. It could be defined as passage of foreign material through organs or tissues without any damage to those organs or tissues. 6 In our case, indeed, damage to the diaphragm was seen neither during the initial procedure nor during the second procedure. Several mechanisms have been proposed that could cause such migration events, including cardiac and lung activity, patient rotation activities, narrow thickness of the bar and unilateral fixation of the bar where the movement of the contralateral side is not limited. Furthermore, in the case of bar migration to the subdiaphragmatic region, self-healing of the diaphragm could conceal the extrathoracic position of the bar during surgery.\n\n【48】If migration of a Nuss bar is suspected, thorough examination through X-rays and, if necessary, CT scans are advocated to be the first course of action. Furthermore, an ultrasound could confirm whether the bar is located above or below the diaphragm. In addition, MRI could assess if the bar has penetrated diaphragmatic structures. When bar migration or displacement of the bar is highly suspected, but not seen on imaging techniques, a second look through thoracoscopic surgery is indicated.\n\n【49】When intra-abdominal migration is seen on additional imaging, a revision through endoscopic surgery is necessary to safely remove the bar. Furthermore, VATS or laparoscopy may be insufficient to locate and remove the migrated bar, such as in the case described by Tahmassebi _et al_ . In such circumstances, an open approach through laparotomy may be the best option for correct and safe removal of the Nuss bar. 6\n\n【50】Nevertheless, novel methods have been proposed for reducing the risk of bar migration or displacement. For instance, Tam _et al_ recently presented the ZipFix stabilisation method in 20 patients without any recurrence or bar displacement, by using a biocompatible cable-tie implant. 10 However, these methods are yet to be further studied for their success rates.\n\n【51】In conclusion, bar migration following the Nuss procedure is a rare occurrence with an unknown aetiology. On occurrence or suspicion of bar migration, cautious action through X-ray, CT scan and VATS is essential. New methods that could reduce the risk of bar migration or displacement are yet to be studied.\n\n【52】### Learning points\n\n【53】*   Extrathoracic or intra-abdominal migration of a Nuss bar is a rare but potential appearance.\n    \n*   The aetiology of this type of migration is unknown.\n    \n*   Low-threshold X-thorax, CT of the thorax and possibly revision are essential when new thoracic symptoms present in patients with a Nuss bar.\n    \n\n【54】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【55】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【56】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The boy was diagnosed with Graves’ disease a year before due to goitre and easy fatigability and was under treatment with an antithyroid drug. He remained in an euthyroid state with 15–20 mg/day of methimazole. Since the disease onset, he had been reporting discomfort during swallowing owing to the enlarged goitre. Ultrasonography of the thyroid performed 6 months earlier showed a highly diffused goitre with a heterogeneous echogenic pattern (40 mm width, 40 mm thickness, 60 mm height in the right lobe and 35 mm width, 40 mm thickness, and 60 mm height in the left lobe). No apparent tracheal stenosis was noted. Furthermore, with the increase in duration of physical education after entering the high school, the boy became aware of dyspnoea during exercise. The CT scan of the neck showed that the minimum tracheal diameter was 3 mm ( figure 1B ), indicating severe tracheal stenosis. Therefore, total thyroidectomy (thyroid weight: 300 g) was performed with an oral tracheal intubation under conscious control. Histopathological examination revealed no neoplastic lesion. The tracheal stenosis did not improve immediately after thyroidectomy; therefore, intraoperative tracheostomy was performed. The cannula was removed on postoperative day 5, and tracheal stenosis was not detected on day 14 ( figure 1C ).

After the symptoms of tracheal compression become clinically evident, the occurrence of complete airway occlusion may be sudden and unpredictable. Hence, when goitre-induced tracheal stenosis is evident, an early thyroidectomy is recommended.\n\n【10】### Learning points\n\n【11】*   An enlarged goitre may cause dyspnoea due to tracheal stenosis even in adolescents with Graves’ disease whose thyroid function is normally controlled.\n    \n*   Early thyroidectomy is recommended in patients with severe tracheal stenosis due to goitre associated with Graves’ disease.\n    \n\n【12】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【13】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【14】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosis starts with clinical investigations while histological examination is required for a definitive diagnosis. In the case presented, a young man presented with painless swelling of upper lip over the past 3 months. Given the clinical history and biopsy results, the diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis was made which is considered a rare manifestation of metastatic Crohn’s disease. Treatment options remain debated, though in the situation presented a conservative approach was adopted, consisting of antibiotics and corticosteroid therapy, which resulted in significant remission in lip swelling without recurrence after a 3-month follow-up.\n\n【2】*   Dermatology\n*   Inflammatory bowel disease\n*   Dentistry and oral medicine\n\n【3】http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2022-251829\n\n【4】Statistics from Altmetric.com\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】*   Dermatology\n*   Inflammatory bowel disease\n*   Dentistry and oral medicine\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】Macrocheilia represents a great challenge in terms of diagnosis and therapeutic approach through the variability in morphological presentation and similarities to other dermatoses as from the incostant response to therapeutic options and the lack of a randomised control studies reported in the literature. Both systemic and local conditions can contribute to macrocheilia, which may even reveal a systemic disease. Granulomatous disease, as orofacial granulomatosis, is defined as a pattern of disease characterised by granulomatous inflammation with persistent and/or recurrent labial swelling, oral ulcers and a variety of other orofacial features, which is localised to orofacial region. The aetiopathogenesis of orofacial granulomatosis remains debate: it includes hypersensitivity to food or food additives or various dental materials, hereditary and genetic predisposition, inflammatory/immunological and microbiological factors, sarcoidosis, Crohn’s disease (CD) and Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. 1 A detailed history and physical examination may help narrow the differential, but a biopsy of the lesion is often necessary for diagnosis. Handa _et al_ presented a clinic-pathological study of 28 patients having chronic macrocheilia. Out of 28 patients, 13 patients (46.4%) had granulomatous cheilitis and diagnosis was made by histological examination. Miest _et al_ presented a retrospective study of 76 patients complaining lip swelling which had biopsies performed, 40 (47%) had granulomatous inflammation. 2 Granulomatous cheilitis is considered a rare manifestation of metastatic CD (MCD) which is known as a great mimicker and is often misdiagnosed. 3 In this situation, diagnosis is confirmed by a colonoscopy usually showing gastrointestinal involvement. In the absence of bowel disease, it may be difficult to distinguish Crohn’s cheilitis from Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, cutaneous sarcoidosis, tuberculosis or other granulomatous disorder. Tuberculin skin test could also be done to exclude mimickers of MCD.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A late adolescence presented to his family physician with a pronounced swelling on his right upper lip over the past 3 months. He was otherwise healthy. During the assessment, he stated that the lesion was usually pale pink, but on occasion became bright red. On skin examination, a 2 cm, not well-demarcated pink-coloured oval nodule was observed on his cutaneous central upper lip; the neoformation presented a median skin fissure ( figure 1 ). First of all, tuberculin skin was done to exclude mimickers of MCD. Then, due to the inconsistency of the pathological features, it was necessary to schedule an MRI, followed by a punch biopsy. MRI reported superior macrocheilia with orbicular muscle component identifiable, incorporated and thickened with oedematous manifestations of the bundles ( figure 2 ); these findings were not typical of CD-related cheilitis. Histological examination with H&E stain showed well-formed granulomas surrounded by mixed chronic inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, Langhans giant cells and plasma cells present throughout the dermis extending into the superficial fat. Focal spongiosis and exocytosis were also noted. Examination by polarisation and stains for fungi and mycobacteria (periodic acid–Schiff staining), acid and alcohol-fast bacilli testing, Grocott’s methenamine silver stain, were negative. Suspecting granulomatous cheilitis as a metastatic Crohn localisation, a colonoscopy was scheduled showing coarsening involvement of the mucosal pattern in the terminal ileum ( figure 3 ). A biopsy from the terminal ileum was taken, confirming the same pattern of the previous one. Given the clinical history and biopsy results, the diagnosis was made. Considering the clinical situation, various treatment options were discussed with the patient which opted to treat just the cheilitis lesion. This conservative approach imposed a strict and scheduled follow-up cooperating with the gastroenterology equipment. Marked improvement of the lesion was observed at his 3-month follow-up appointment ( figure 4 ).\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 1\n\n【13】Clinical appearance at the first visit.\n\n【14】<img/>\n\n【15】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【16】Figure 2\n\n【17】MRI.\n\n【18】<img/>\n\n【19】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【20】Figure 3\n\n【21】Colonoscopy showing hyperaemic ileal mucosa with sores and erosions.\n\n【22】<img/>\n\n【23】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【24】Figure 4\n\n【25】Three months control.\n\n【26】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【27】Macrocheilia is often misdiagnosed. Differential diagnosis is listed in table 1 including the whole granulomatous and non-granulomatous disease pattern.\n\n【28】View this table:\n\n【29】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【30】Table 1\n\n【31】Differential diagnosis of metastatic macrocheilia\n\n【32】Non-granulomatous disorders are mostly discriminate by the clinical examination. For example, hidradenitis suppurativa, impetigo, erysipelas present peculiar clinical features: erythematous boils, scabs in the context of an oedematous generally tender tissue. Orofacial granulomatosis is defined as recurrent or persistent facial soft tissue swelling in the absence of a specific previously diagnosed local or systemic disease. When it is associated with fissured tongue, lip swelling and facial palsy, the condition is more specifically associated as Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. On the other hand, isolated swelling or enlargement of the lip is known as granulomatous cheilitis which can be associated with sarcoidosis, CD (as a manifestation of MCD) and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. 4\n\n【33】Due the inconsistency of the pathological clinical features and considering the importance of a biopsy in same case, it is necessary to schedule an MR to characterise the lesion. MR narrows the diagnosis excluding, for example, vascular lesion and, moreover, allows to find out cleavage plan to programme an eventual surgery radical excision, especially if it could lead to nerve damage. 5–7\n\n【34】In the case presented, biopsy results showed well-formed granulomas surrounded by mixed chronic inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, Langhans giant cells and plasma cells present throughout the dermis extending into the superficial fat. Focal spongiosis and exocytosis were also noted. Histological examination gave the deep suspect of granulomatous cheilitis as a metastatic Crohn localisation supported also by examination by polarisation and stains for fungi and mycobacteria (periodic acid–Schiff staining, acid and alcohol-fast bacilli testing, Grocott’s methenamine silver stain, tissue cultures) which resulted negative.\n\n【35】Colonoscopy and a biopsy from the terminal ileum confirmed diagnosis.\n\n【36】Multispecialty coordination between primary care physicians and specialists such as maxillofacial, rheumatology, dermatology or gastroenterology will lead to faster and more efficient diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【37】Treatment\n---------\n\n【38】Although it has been reported that the cutaneous lesions of granulomatous cheilitis can spontaneously resolve, the vast majority are persistent. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on standard treatment as no clinical trials have been done to guide treatment. 8 Several methods have been trialled varying in treatment length and response. Currently, the treatment is based on prednisone or prednisolone 20–40 mg daily or oral deltacortene 25 mg daily associated with antibiotics (metronidazole or doxycycline) if infection is present. 9\n\n【39】In recalcitrant lesions originally treated with prednisolone, adding sulfasalazine 2–4 g/day systemically or sulfasalazine 3% ointment topically has been successful. 9 Cyclosporine 4 mg/kg/day or 250 mg two times per day, azathioprine 2 mg/kg 10 and 6-mercaptopurine have also shown some promise.\n\n【40】Severe refractory has been shown to respond to infliximab 400 mg infusions over a period of 7 weeks. In one case, methotrexate was also concurrently used with infliximab treatment. 8 In patients who have had a prior infusion reaction to infliximab, certolizumab combined with methotrexate has recently been shown to resolve the cutaneous lesions. Recent studies indicated treatment with an anti-TNF agent (mainly ustekinumab) as the most recommended therapeutic option for granulomatous cheilitis (with or without CD) after failure of conventional treatments. 11\n\n【41】Recurrence may take place with any of the above treatment modalities. Healed lesions can leave behind hypertrophic scars; however, these have been well treated with CO2 laser. 9\n\n【42】In the case presented, considering the clinical situation, a conservative approach with doxycycline 100 mg and deltacortene 25 mg daily was chosen. This choice was supported by the patient but imposed a strict and scheduled follow-up cooperating with the gastroenterology equipment.\n\n【43】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【44】After the diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis has been made, the patient was assessed also by gastroenterology equipment. Colonoscopy showed coarsening of the mucosal pattern in the terminal ileum even any kind of symptoms were not already present. A conservative approach with doxycycline 100 mg and deltacortene 25 mg daily was chosen. This choice was supported by the patient but imposed a strict and scheduled follow-up with periodic check every 6 months with a medical examination and evaluation of the global disease activity by blood chemistry tests (ESR, PCR, blood count, sideremia, liver and kidney function). A control colonoscopy was scheduled after a year or wherever necessary. Marked improvement of the lesion was observed at his 3-month follow-up appointment. The patient follow-up is still ongoing.\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】Macrocheilia is a descriptive term commonly used to describe a variety of conditions that exhibit similar microscopic and clinical features. It usually describes persistent enlargement of the soft tissues of the oral and maxillofacial region especially upper and lower lips. Clinical presentation is very changeable but usually recurrent facial swelling, mainly in the lips with or without intraoral manifestations, is the single most common clinical feature at onset. The association with systemic conditions such as CD or sarcoidosis has been widely reported in literature. Moreover, it may precede CD by several years, frequently remaining the only evident active focus of the disease, and it may frequently represent an extraintestinal manifestation of CD in which oral lesions can be the first sign of an unknown intestinal disease. 12 13\n\n【47】The detection of specific oral manifestations often preceded by painless gingival enlargement (diffuse lip and buccal mucosal swelling, oral cobblestoning, buccal sulcus ulceration and mucosal tags) and/or unspecific or ancillary ones (cheilitis, scaly perioral erythematous rashes and frank intraoral abscess formation, labial and tongue fissuring, glossitis and aphthous stomatitis) is mandatory for the early diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis as a form of MCD.\n\n【48】Hence, the inflammatory bowel disease is a common illness that gastroenterologists encounter, about 40% of patients with CD have cutaneous symptoms, making the skin the most common site of extraintestinal involvement. 14 This association between gut and skin can be classified into three broad groups described in table 2 .\n\n【49】View this table:\n\n【50】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【51】Table 2\n\n【52】Classification of cutaneous manifestation of Crohn’s disease\n\n【53】No clear correlation between the development of MCD and severity of underlying Crohn’s has been established. In fact, the skin lesions may be present during, after and in rare cases before the presence of the inflammatory bowel disease. Cutaneous findings tend to occur more often with CD that involves the large bowel. Granulomatous cheilitis, such as other forms of oral CD, may precede, coincide with or follow the onset of gastrointestinal disease as in the case presented. In the absence of bowel disease, it may be difficult to distinguish granulomatous cheilitis from the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.\n\n【54】Diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis starts with clinical investigations but a biopsy of the lesion is always necessary.\n\n【55】As regards clinical examination, cutaneous manifestations of MCD have fairly variable morphology, 3 for example, lesions present in intertriginous areas tend to have an ulcerated appearance; while lesions on the extremities tend to be erythematous and sometimes painful. Other morphological features include violaceous perifollicular papules and lichenoid papules found on the neck and lower limbs and erythematous plaques on the face and the extremities. In the situation presented, a 2 cm, not well-demarcated usually pink-coloured oval nodule was observed on his cutaneous central upper lip; the neoformation presented a median skin fissure. As mentioned, diagnosis is based on histological examination; microscopically, the dominant histological features of MCD are similar to the primary Crohn’s bowel lesions. 3\n\n【56】MRI could be more useful than an ultrasound scan even in this case MRI findings were not typical of CD-related cheilitis.\n\n【57】Colonoscopy with a biopsy is always recommended: they will confirm diagnosis especially in the absence of clinical bowel manifestations as in this situation. In this situation, as in the most cases, biopsy confirmed the same pattern of the previous obtained from the lip.\n\n【58】Considering the clinical situation, various treatment options were discussed with the patient which opted to treat just the cheilitis lesion. This conservative approach imposed a strict and scheduled follow-up cooperating with the gastroenterology equipment. This choice was supported by the patient but imposed a strict and scheduled follow-up with periodic check every 6 months with a medical examination and evaluation of the disease activity by blood chemistry tests. A control colonoscopy was also scheduled after a year or wherever necessary. Patients with asymptomatic CD often develop complications during their clinical course because the absence of symptoms does not imply an absence of inflammation. The prognostic value and objectivity of endoscopy remains irreplaceable. Together with endoscopy, the role of less invasive techniques such as imaging tests (MR enterography, CT enterography and even echography, with and without contrast agent) and faecal markers (faecal calprotectin) has been reaffirmed in the literature in order to follow up the disease course. White blood cells, procalcitonin, PCR (C reactive protein), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), anti-TNF and its antibodies are precious indicators of inflammation. It is also mandatory to do periodic check of complete blood count, iron and ferritin, folate, transferrin, group B vitamins looking for anaemia. Finally is recommended to exclude faecal occult blood and a possible cancer degeneration.\n\n【59】Even treatment options remain underwhelming due to the lack of randomised control studies and varying responses of reported therapeutic methods, marked improvement of the lesion was observed after 3-month follow-up.\n\n【60】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【61】‘I’m very happy about my situation now. I was very scared because I did not find any kind of help and the lesion on the face was growing up. A correct diagnostic and therapeutic approach gave me the opportunity to improve my health and prevent complications. I could choose from various treatment options and I opted for a conservative approach to treat just the cheilitis lesion which resulted very useful. After just 3 months, the upper lip lesion has improved. I am sure that gastroenterology equipment will manage in the best way any kind of systemic manifestation of my pathology.’\n\n【62】### Learning points\n\n【63】*   Macrocheilia is a descriptive term commonly used to describe a variety of conditions that exhibit similar microscopic and clinical features.\n    \n*   Granulomatous cheilitis is a possible option in differential diagnoses of macrocheilia and is the rarest manifestation of metastatic Crohn’s disease.\n    \n*   Cutaneous findings may precede, develop concurrently with or follow gastrointestinal involvement.\n    \n*   A biopsy is always required for a definitive diagnosis.\n    \n*   A correct diagnosis and a well-targeted therapeutic approach led to an improvement of the clinical status.\n    \n\n【64】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【65】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【66】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【67】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【68】None.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

It appears as skin lesions with erythematous patches or papules of linear, multiple, flagellate structures. Flagellate dermatitis can be triggered by several causes, which are most commonly associated with bleomycin. This paper reports two cases of flagellate dermatitis, one in a patient with germ cell carcinoma and another in a patient with osteosarcoma who were both diagnosed with flagellate dermatitis after the administration of bleomycin.\n\n【2】*   Dermatology\n*   Skin\n\n【3】http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

It is isolated from the _Streptomyces verticillus_ strain and was first developed in Japan by Umezawa in 1966. It has been used to treat various cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, germ cell tumour, testicular carcinoma and malignant pleural effusions. It is also used by dermatologists to treat recalcitrant warts, hypertrophic scars and keloids. The use of bleomycin is currently limited due to several side effects that have been reported such as pulmonary fibrosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, alopecia, onychodystrophy, gangrene, oedema and flagellate dermatitis. 1 2\n\n【10】Flagellate dermatitis is a rare toxic reaction to bleomycin with 8%–66% incidence rate. 1 3–5 The term ‘flagellate’ is derived from the Latin word ‘flagellum’, which means a whip-like appearance. 1 While flagellate dermatitis is most commonly linked to bleomycin, it can also be caused by the chemotherapy agents peplomycin and docetaxel as well as shiitake mushroom toxin, and is sometimes found on patients with dermatomyositis. 6 7 This paper describes two cases of flagellate dermatitis, one in a patient with germ cell carcinoma and another in a patient with osteosarcoma who were both diagnosed with flagellate dermatitis after the administration of bleomycin. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of how this unique toxic reaction to bleomycin manifests on the skin so that clinicians can take it into consideration when administering this chemotherapy drug. In addition to that, this paper also intends to explore other causes of flagellate dermatitis besides bleomycin.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】### Case 1\n\n【13】A man in his 20s was referred to the dermatology department with rashes and itchy patches on the body. Lesions first appeared the previous day as itchy hives in the form of irregular lines on the stomach and red spots which spread to the back and legs. The patient did not experience any muscle weakness. He had no history of similar conditions, allergies, atopy or hives. The patient had not been using topical medication, consuming mushrooms or inflicting self-injury using sharp objects. Family history also had no record of similar reports.\n\n【14】A month prior, the patient was diagnosed with mixed germ cell intra-abdominal malignant tumour along with cerebral metastases. He had received the first cycle of BEC chemotherapy regimen which consisted of bleomycin (30 U/m <sup>2 </sup> intravenously on days 1, 8 and 15), etoposide (150 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on days 1–5) and cisplatin (30 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on days 1–5). The skin lesions appeared after the administration of bleomycin on day 15. Vital signs were within normal limits and there was no evidence of muscle weakness. The dermatological status on the abdomen, back and waist showed erythematous patches that were linear in shape with a flagellate arrangement ( figure 1 ).\n\n【15】<img/>\n\n【16】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【17】Figure 1\n\n【18】(A) Linear erythematous patch with flagellate arrangement on the abdomen. (B) Confluent erythematous papules form a linear line. (C) Linear, multiple hyperpigmented patches with flagellate arrangement on the abdomen and back.(D) Linear erythematous patch with flagellate arrangement on the waist.\n\n【19】### Case 2\n\n【20】A woman in her teens was referred to the dermatology department with whiplash-like pattern marks and scratch mark-like hyperpigmentation on the body. The lesions appeared the week before as itchy hives in the form of irregular lines on the abdomen and waist. Two days later, the patient’s parents noted dark brown-coloured hyperpigmentation resembling scratch mark on some areas and marks of whiplashes on others. The patient did not experience any muscle weakness. Similar to the first patient, the second patient also never suffered from similar conditions. She did not have allergies, atopy or hives. There were no history of topical medication use, mushroom consumption, mental disorders and self-inflicted injury using sharp weapons. Family history also did not have any record about similar reports.\n\n【21】The second patient was diagnosed with osteosarcoma 10 months prior. She received osteosarcoma chemotherapy protocol, which included high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) (8 g/m <sup>2 </sup> intravenously in weeks 3, 4, 8, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19, 23 and 24), bleomycin (30 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and actinomycin D (0.75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> in week 15). Doxorubicin (90 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and cisplatin (75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) were administered in weeks 5 and 10. After the administration of HDMTX, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin, the patient did not experience any lesions on the skin. The patient mentioned the lesions appeared after the administration of bleomycin in week 15. Vital signs were within normal limits and there was no evidence of muscle weakness. The dermatological status on the abdomen and waist showed erythematous-hyperpigmented patches that were linear in shape with a flagellate arrangement ( figure 2 ).\n\n【22】<img/>\n\n【23】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【24】Figure 2\n\n【25】Linear, multiple erythematous and hyperpigmented patches with flagellate arrangement on the (A) abdomen, (B) waist and (C) back.\n\n【26】### Investigations\n\n【27】Dermatographism was not found on both patients. Laboratory tests showed normal level of creatine kinase and creatine kinase myocardial band. The diagnosis was based on the connection between bleomycin and skin lesions. A skin biopsy was not performed.\n\n【28】### Differential diagnosis\n\n【29】The differential diagnosis of flagellate erythema includes bleomycin flagellate dermatitis, shiitake mushroom intake, dermatomyositis, adult-onset Still’s disease and dermatitis artefacta. 8 9 Skin manifestations which appear following bleomycin administration and hyperpigmentation which occurs after drug suspension are associated with bleomycin-induced skin disorders. The patients did not experience any skin complaints after the administration of other chemotherapy agents.\n\n【30】### Treatment\n\n【31】The first patient was given one dose of 16 mg of methylprednisolone daily for 3 days and 10 mg of cetirizine also once per day. In the second patient, cetirizine and desoximetasone ointment in oleum cocos was applied topically two times per day.\n\n【32】### Outcome and follow-up\n\n【33】After a week of treatment, the lesion turned into linear hyperpigmentation with flagellate arrangement and the patients no longer complained about itching. The first patient died while undergoing treatment so the therapy was discontinued. The second patient was still given bleomycin considering there was only one administration left.\n\n【34】### Discussion\n\n【35】The diagnosis in these two cases was based on clinical diagnosis which discovered a temporal relationship between the use of bleomycin and the appearance of skin lesions. Skin lesions in the first case appeared on the body after the third bleomycin administration, while in the second case it appeared after the first bleomycin administration. In the first case, some of the lesions on the body initially took the form of urticaria which turned into erythematous patches and then became hyperpigmented patches. In the second case, the lesion first appeared as an erythematous patch which then became a hyperpigmented patch. Dermatological examination on the body showed erythematous patches and hyperpigmented patches, linear in shape, multiple, with flagellate arrangement. 1 7 10 11 Various other case reports have also mentioned the occurrence of flagellate dermatitis after the administration of bleomycin ( table 1 ). 1 2 4 6 8 9 11\n\n【36】View this table:\n\n【37】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【38】Table 1\n\n【39】Reported cases of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis 1 2 4 6 8 9 11\n\n【40】Bleomycin-induced flagellate dermatitis is a rare toxic response to bleomycin. 1 The condition typically appears as skin lesions which begin as urticarial lesions that progress into erythematous patches or papules in the form of linear, multiple, flagellate arrays and, in most cases, are accompanied by pruritus, although it may also be non-pruritic. 1 2 12 Lesions usually appear on the trunk. 13 The residual lesion is hyperpigmented. Flagellate dermatitis may appear 24 hours to 6 months after the initial exposure to bleomycin and occur within 12 hours after subsequent drug re-exposure. 11\n\n【41】The postulated pathophysiological mechanism for cutaneous manifestations is assumed to be due to lack of bleomycin hydrolase enzyme in the skin, which inactivates bleomycin. This results in an accumulation of bleomycin in the skin. Furthermore, the pruritus that is caused by these alterations may trigger excoriations, resulting in abrasions and microtrauma, which can lead to vasodilation and increased bleomycin deposition. 11 Bleomycin damages endothelial cells by upregulating TGF- β (tumour necrosis factor beta), triggering keratinocyte death, and causing a cytotoxic effect on melanocytes, among other mechanisms for cutaneous inflammation and pigmentation. 9\n\n【42】Bleomycin-induced flagellate dermatitis is a dose-dependent reaction that usually occurs with cumulative doses above 200 IU. 8 However, there are several case reports indicting otherwise. These reports state that the occurrence of these lesions is an idiosyncratic reaction that is independent regardless of the dose and can manifest after the administration of various doses of bleomycin ranging from 5 IU to 465 IU. 11 14\n\n【43】Bleomycin-induced flagellate dermatitis has no absolute or characteristic histopathological appearance. In the acute phase, there is inconspicuous spongiosis, vacuolisation of the stratum basale of the epidermis, a superficial lymphocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and eosinophilic granulocytes, dermal oedema and scattered dyskeratotic keratinocytes. In later stages, only a few post-inflammatory changes were found such as pigment incontinence, melanophages in the papillary dermis and increased melanin pigmentation in the stratum basale are present. 4\n\n【44】In majority of the cases, these lesions resolve spontaneously after the discontinuation of bleomycin and leave hyperpigmentation marks. In other cases, flagellate hyperpigmentation may persist even after a year of therapy. 15 Managing symptoms is the main treatment to limit trauma to the skin. This can be done by administering antihistamines and topical corticosteroids or oral corticosteroids. Short-term oral corticosteroids have been used in patients with extensive lesions. Discontinuation of bleomycin can be an option in the case of severe lesions.

He had a non-blanching, palpable and purpuric rash on both legs extending up to his abdomen. He felt otherwise well and reported no other symptoms. His medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 and dyslipidaemia. His regular medications included linagliptin, bisoprolol, simvastatin, warfarin, paracetamol and low-dose furosemide. He had no documented history of gout in primary or secondary care and no symptoms or signs of gout were documented in his admission clerking.\n\n【5】The patient was started on 30 mg oral prednisolone once daily with a likely diagnosis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. He received intravenous fluid therapy in the initial days of his admission and his acute kidney injury (AKI) resolved over the course of his 7 day inpatient stay. On day of discharge, a junior doctor, while taking blood samples, highlighted extensive gouty tophi affecting both of his hands ( figure 1 ). He had not seen a rheumatologist and had never taken oral medication for gout. On further questioning, he clarified that none of his other joints had been previously affected by gouty arthritis. He had minimal alcohol intake. The patient used over-the-counter ibuprofen to alleviate severe pain that mainly affected him when doing the washing up or driving for long periods. On examination, there was no evidence of tophi elsewhere. A serum urate level added to his blood tests was raised at 832 µmol/L (normal range is 200–400 µmol/L). Based on the clinical appearance of this patient’s hands alongside the raised urate, we diagnosed gouty tophi, commenced 200 mg allopurinol once daily and arranged follow-up in rheumatology clinic.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Severe gouty tophi affecting both hands, mainly seen on the palmar aspects of the patient’s digits. Multiple skin breaks are seen where tophi have erupted and caused open sores appearing as punched-out lesions.\n\n【10】The large majority of patients with hyperuricaemia will remain asymptomatic; however, gout is a painful but treatable condition that can result from raised serum urate levels. Hyperuricaemia is caused by increased production and/or decreased excretion of uric acid. 1 Gout can then present in the following clinical scenarios: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, acute gout flares, intercritical phases or chronic tophaceous gout. The development of severe tophi with no history of previous gouty arthritis is rare but recognised in case reports. 2 3 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine can alleviate acutely painful inflammatory changes seen in early presentations of gout. 4 5 Urate-lowering medications, namely xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol, help prevent late presentations of hyperuricaemia including chronic gouty tophi and kidney stones, 6–8 such as the tophi seen in this patient.\n\n【11】There is debate about the exact impact and role of hyperuricaemia in AKI and CKD. However, evidence suggests that raised serum urate levels can cause or exacerbate AKI through systemic effects of raised serum urate and local tubular effects of uric acid in urine. 4 8 9 In this case, the patient’s significant hyperuricaemia and subsequent use of ibuprofen were previously unexplored factors that could have contributed to or exacerbated his AKI. His hyperuricaemia may also contribute to the progression of his CKD.\n\n【12】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【13】Nobody has ever taken this much notice of my hands before. I never knew anyone would find them interesting; they have been this way for so long now that I hardly notice them. I did not realise there was anything I could do about them.\n\n【14】### Learning points\n\n【15】*   The development of gouty tophi without a prior history of gouty arthritis is a rare but recognised presentation of gout.\n    \n*   Early prophylactic treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors can help prevent severe and painful chronic gouty tophi.\n    \n*   Significant hyperuricaemia can have a role in development of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Physicians should consider the benefits of treatment to lower urate levels on kidney function.\n    \n\n【16】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【17】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【18】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【19】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【20】Thank you to Dr Thomas Adams for his support.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Five months after the first visit, she was admitted to our hospital to undergo the planned thyroid lobectomy and parathyroidectomy. Her blood tests on admission showed thyrotoxicosis, with negative thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor and thyroid-stimulating antibody. Notably, her anti-thyroglobulin antibody and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody, which were originally negative, became positive after SARS-CoV-2 infection. She was diagnosed with painless thyroiditis. Her general condition and vital signs were stable, and the surgery was cautiously performed.

Hence, we report the case of a patient with painless thyroiditis whose anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) were negative before SARS-CoV-2 infection became positive after SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A woman in her 50s was referred to our hospital for surgery for papillary thyroid cancer and primary hyperparathyroidism. At the first visit, her thyroid function test results were as follows: free T4, 1.35 ng/dL (normal, 0.9–1.7 ng/dL); free T3, 3.88 pg/mL (normal, 2.3–4.0 pg/mL); and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 0.785 µIU/mL (normal, 0.61–4.23 µIU/mL). TgAb was less than 28.0 IU/mL (normal, 0–40 IU/mL) and TPOAb was less than 16.0 IU/mL (normal, 0–28 IU/mL). These were all measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLusys; Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan). Results of other biochemical tests were as follows: serum thyroglobulin 25.9 ng/mL (normal, 0–46.05 ng/mL), serum calcium 10.8 mg/dL (normal, 8.2–10.2 mg/dL), serum phosphate 3.0 mg/dL (normal, 2.5–4.5 mg/dL) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) 75 pg/mL (normal, 15–70 pg/mL). The urinary calcium/creatinine ratio calculated from spot urine was 0.017.\n\n【12】Thyroid ultrasonography showed a solid, hypoechoic 12 mm nodule with slightly irregular borders in the left lobe of the thyroid ( figure 1 ). An enlarged right lower parathyroid gland was also detected ( figure 2 ). The estimated thyroid volume was 21.2 mL, and the thyroid gland was homogeneous with normal blood flow. On fine needle aspiration biopsy, the thyroid nodule was classified as malignant (Bethesda Category VI, papillary carcinoma).\n\n【13】<img/>\n\n【14】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【15】Figure 1\n\n【16】Thyroid ultrasonography showing a solid, hypoechoic 12 mm nodule with slightly irregular borders in the left lobe of the thyroid at the first visit.\n\n【17】<img/>\n\n【18】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【19】Figure 2\n\n【20】Enlarged right lower parathyroid gland.\n\n【21】Her surgery was scheduled for 4 months later; however, 3 months later, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 by reverse-transcription PCR, and the operation was postponed. She had fever and sore throat, but her illness was mild and spontaneously resolved without treatment.\n\n【22】Five months after her first visit (2 months after the COVID-19 diagnosis), the patient was admitted to our hospital for surgery. The thyroid function test on admission revealed elevated free T4 of 2.54 ng/dL and free T3 of 8.96 pg/mL, with a suppressed TSH level of less than 0.005 µIU/mL. TgAb was 111.0 IU/mL and TPOAb was 34.2 IU/mL, while antibodies to the TSH receptor (TRAb) was 1.04 IU/L (normal, 0–2 IU/L) and thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb) was 103% (normal, 0–120%). TRAb was measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) (ECLusys; Roche Diagnostics) and TSAb was measured using a bioassay enzyme immunoassay (Yamasa; Yamasa Shoyu, Chiba, Japan). Thyroglobulin was 62.0 ng/mL, and serum C reactive protein was less than 0.5 mg/dL (normal, 0–0.5 mg/dL). PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on admission was negative. She had no symptoms such as neck pain, and her vital signs were stable. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody was positive, with a titre of 8.77 U/mL (normal, 0–0.80 U/mL). It was measured by high throughput ECLIA (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S; Roche Diagnostics).\n\n【23】From the time of the first visit to our hospital until admission, she had no other infection aside from SARS-CoV-2 infection. She has not received any COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, she had no prior medical history other than that of papillary thyroid cancer and primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\n【24】The anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody in the remaining serum cryopreserved at the first visit was negative and the titre was <0.4 U/mL.\n\n【25】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【26】Thyroid ultrasonography showed a slightly heterogeneous, enlarged thyroid gland with an estimated thyroid volume of 26.8 mL and normal Doppler flow. The thyroid gland was slightly enlarged compared with that at the initial examination ( figures 3 and 4 ). The nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid gland and parathyroid gland enlargement had not changed since the initial examination. Her 20 min technetium-99m thyroid scintigraphy uptake was 0.63% (normal uptake: 0.5–3.0%) ( figure 5 ).\n\n【27】<img/>\n\n【28】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【29】Figure 3\n\n【30】Ultrasound examination on admission showing a slightly enlarged thyroid gland as compared with the initial examination.\n\n【31】<img/>\n\n【32】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【33】Figure 4\n\n【34】Thyroid ultrasonography on admission showing a slightly heterogeneous, enlarged thyroid gland with normal Doppler flow.\n\n【35】<img/>\n\n【36】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【37】Figure 5\n\n【38】20 min technetium-99m thyroid scintigraphy uptake at 0.63%, which is low normal range.\n\n【39】Treatment\n---------\n\n【40】The patient was diagnosed with painless thyroiditis. Her general condition and vital signs were stable, and the operation was cautiously performed as planned. Three days after admission, she underwent left thyroid lobectomy and parathyroidectomy.\n\n【41】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【42】The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and blood test results on the third postoperative day were as follows: free T4 3.21 ng/dL, free T3 8.10 pg/mL, TSH 0.006 µIU/mL, serum calcium 8.9 mg/dL, serum phosphate 4.7 mg/dL and iPTH 26 pg/mL. She was discharged 4 days after surgery.\n\n【43】Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma and parathyroid adenoma. The postoperative stage was pT1bN0M0. Thyroid tissue showed chronic inflammatory cell infiltration associated with destruction of the thyroid follicles ( figure 6 ). The findings were consistent with painless thyroiditis. 5\n\n【44】<img/>\n\n【45】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【46】Figure 6\n\n【47】Thyroid tissue showing chronic inflammatory cell infiltration associated with destruction of the thyroid follicles.\n\n【48】Her blood tests 2 weeks after discharge showed improved thyroid function as follows: free T4 0.93 ng/dL, free T3 3.65 pg/mL, TSH 0.011 µIU/mL, serum calcium 9.3 mg/dL, serum phosphate 3.5 mg/dL and iPTH 44 pg/mL.\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】Painless thyroiditis is referred to by other names, such as silent thyroiditis, sporadic painless thyroiditis, sporadic thyroiditis, destructive thyroiditis and spontaneously resolving lymphocytic thyroiditis. 5 It is well known that a similar form of thyroiditis develops post partum, called postpartum thyroiditis. Postpartum thyroiditis is thought to be a variant of painless thyroiditis because it is frequently positive for antithyroid antibodies and shows similar histopathology and clinical manifestations. 5\n\n【51】Painless thyroiditis is considered to be an immune-mediated disorder, which may be caused by immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs and various cytokines, such as interferon-alpha and interleukin-2. 5 6 The clinical course of painless thyroiditis is characterised by the destruction of the thyroid gland, resulting in excess thyroid hormones and transient thyrotoxicosis. This thyrotoxicosis improves spontaneously and is often followed by a period of hypothyroidism and full recovery.\n\n【52】Recently, two cases of painless thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis diagnosed after SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported. 3 4 A man in his 50s admitted to the hospital for treatment of COVID-19 was incidentally found to have thyrotoxicosis in a blood test on admission. TgAb, TPOAb and TRAb were all negative. He had no symptoms suggestive of thyrotoxicosis and no neck pain. Thyroid scintigraphy showed a marked decrease in thyroid gland uptake, and he was diagnosed with painless thyroiditis. On follow-up medical examination, thyroid function normalised without any specific medication. 3 In the other case, a woman in her 20s was reported to be diagnosed with postpartum thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection. She had a history of painless thyroiditis with a background of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and was infected with SARS-CoV-2 103 days after delivery. Thirty-three days after the SARS-CoV-2 infection, she was diagnosed with postpartum thyroiditis. Her thyroid function was as follows: free T4, 2.0 ng/dL; free T3, 5.44 pg/mL; and TSH, 0.020 µIU/mL. TgAb was positive, while TPOAb and TRAb were negative. No neck pain was found on examination. Her thyroid function normalised 2 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection without treatment. 4\n\n【53】In addition to painless thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis, Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis have been reported as autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection. 2 7 SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell through the ACE-2 receptor, 8 which is expressed in various organs, including thyroid follicular cells and lung cells. 9 10 The transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is also considered to play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, 11 and a high expression of TMPRSS2 mRNA has been reported in the thyroid tissue. 12 Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 genome and viral proteins such as spike and nucleocapsid proteins have been detected histologically in thyroid follicular cells of patients with COVID-19. 13 14 SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in immune cell hyperactivity involving Th1/Th17 lymphocytes. 15 Interestingly, partially similar immune cell activation patterns have been reported in interferon-alpha-induced destructive thyroiditis, including painless thyroiditis. 15 16\n\n【54】Furthermore, it has been reported that the spike protein and nucleus of SARS-CoV-2 are similar in structure to thyroid peroxidase (TPO). 17 This means that antibodies produced after SARS-CoV-2 infection may also cross-react against TPO, resulting in autoimmune thyroiditis. 2\n\n【55】Cristinel _et al_ reported increased TPOAb and TgAb levels in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and a history of chronic hepatitis C 1 month after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 18\n\n【56】Notably, our case had no history of AITD, and negative TgAb and TPOAb at initial presentation became positive after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although this does not confirm a causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and painless thyroiditis, it is postulated that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have triggered an immune response that led to painless thyroiditis.\n\n【57】There have been many reports of autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection, but painless thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection is less commonly reported than Graves’ disease or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. One possible speculation is that painless thyroiditis may be overlooked because of its mild symptoms. Indeed, our patient and the previously reported case 3 were asymptomatic and were diagnosed incidentally by blood tests.\n\n【58】Although the causal association between COVID-19 and autoimmune thyroiditis is uncertain at the current time, physicians should consider the possibility of autoimmune thyroiditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be sought while taking medical history.\n\n【59】Even though there are several reports exploring COVID-19 and thyroid disease, their pathogeneses remain poorly understood and further research is needed.\n\n【60】### PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE\n\n【61】I was surprised when I was told that my thyroid hormone levels were abnormal during a blood test when I was hospitalised.\n\n【62】But I am thankful that the operation was successful.\n\n【63】### Learning points\n\n【64】*   Although the causal relationship is uncertain, autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported.\n    \n*   Painless thyroiditis may be overlooked due to its mild presentation of symptoms.\n    \n*   When seeing a patient with autoimmune thyroiditis, previous instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be ascertained while taking medical history.\n    \n\n【65】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【66】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【67】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The patient reported that the filling had dislodged and has been refilled multiple times previously. On further enquiry, he complained of tenderness on the left cheek, left nasal blockage and postnasal drip occurring sporadically for over a year. The patient had visited physicians and otorhinolaryngologists and has been prescribed multiple courses of antibiotics with no effect. At the time of dental visit the patient was on Augmentin 625 mg as prescribed by the physician. He was also given the option of surgical treatment of the chronic maxillary sinusitis by the physician, but he was not interested in this course of action.\n\n【5】On oral examination there was a fractured disto-occlusal tooth coloured filling extending subgingivally on tooth 26 with food impaction. Tooth 26 was tender on percussion and showed no response to electric pulp test. Diagnostic periapical radiograph of tooth 26 did not show anything conclusive, so cone beam CT (CBCT) with voxel size of 150 µm was advised. Three-dimensional CBCT imaging increases the accuracy of detecting periapical lesions and any abnormalities of the nasal and paranasal sinuses when compared with conventional imaging modalities. 1 Axial and coronal sections of the CBCT images revealed total opacification of the left maxillary sinus, as seen in figure 1A,B . The sagittal section of CBCT showed that the root apices of tooth 26 protruded into the maxillary sinus through a perforation in the thin cortical boundary of the maxillary sinus ( figure 2A ). A diagnosis of necrotic tooth 26 resulting in odontogenic maxillary sinusitis was made. A conservative and non-surgical treatment approach was considered. Thus, endodontic treatment of tooth 26 was advised.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】(A,B) Coronal and axial sections of preoperative cone beam CT showing total opacification of the left maxillary sinus (arrow), while the right sinus appears normal.

(B) Postobturation Intra-oral Periapical Radiograph of tooth 26.\n\n【14】Following administration of buccal infiltration anaesthesia and isolation with rubber dam, access cavity preparation was done on tooth 26. Mesiobuccal, distobuccal and palatal canals were detected. Initial working length was determined with an apex locator (Root ZX, J Morita), which was 21 mm in the palatal and distobuccal canals and 20 mm in the mesiobuccal canal. Chemomechanical preparation was completed using ProTaper and Hyflex CM rotary files (Coltene Whaledent, Altstätten, Switzerland). Irrigation during mechanical instrumentation was done using 2.5% sodium hypochlorite. Calcium hydroxide intracanal medicament was placed into the root canals and the tooth was filled temporarily with Cavit. In the next appointment after 2 weeks, irrigation was done with 2 mL of 17% EDTA solution, followed by a final rinse of 5 mL saline solution. Obturation was completed by cold lateral condensation technique using AH Plus sealer ( figure 2B ) and a composite restoration was done on tooth 26.\n\n【15】At 1-month follow-up appointment, the patient had complete resolution of symptoms of sinusitis and there was no discomfort in relation to the endodontically treated tooth. Following this a full coverage restoration was fabricated and placed on tooth 26. A simple yet thorough endodontic treatment was able to sort the patient’s dental as well as sinus issues which have been troubling him for over a year. This case thus enforces and highlights to the clinician the importance of eliciting proper case history and using appropriate investigative tools such as CBCT. Similar treatment outcomes have been achieved in various case reports in the literature using non-surgical endodontics. 2 3 Thus following this protocol will contribute to accurate diagnosis and treatment, which will provide swift relief to patients.\n\n【16】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【17】I never imagined that a visit to the dentist would result in the successful treatment of my blocked nose and sinus issues. I had gone to my dentist to get a pesky filling sorted. The dentist was very thorough in her queries and was soon to figure out why I was having repeated bouts of sinus pain, and bad phlegm in my mouth when I slept. Multiple visits to the ENT resulted in me having lots of anti-biotics and even considering surgery for my sinus issues. But a simple and painless root canal treatment fixed my sinus and dental concerns. I will always be grateful to my dentist for her patient listening and her excellent treatment. Now I believe dental treatment is not only about fixing teeth but the body also.\n\n【18】### Learning points\n\n【19】*   Otorhinolaryngologists should consider dental aetiology in cases of persistent unilateral maxillary sinusitis and refer patients for further dental consultations to achieve early diagnosis and effective treatment.\n    \n*   Odontogenic maxillary sinusitis is most commonly associated with infected maxillary molars due to the close anatomical proximity between root apices and sinus boundaries.\n    \n*   Cone beam CT has different advantages including high contrast resolution, elimination of superimposition of anatomical structures and reduced radiation exposure compared with multislice CT and so should be considered in such cases.\n    \n\n【20】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【21】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【22】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

They are known for their good prognostic factors as they typically present with smaller lesions, are of lower nuclear grade and have lower risk of recurrence and metastasis. Peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignant ascites are uncommon in RCC. They might be attributed to direct tumour extension or metastasis via haematogenous spread or tumour seeding from prior surgical resection. 1–3\n\n【10】We report a case of symptomatic malignant ascites with evident peritoneal nodules diagnosed 5 months following a laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for a Bosniak IV malignant cystic renal mass, later identified as pT2, Fuhrman grade 2, type 1 papillary RCC (pRCC).\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 69-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of worsening generalised abdominal pain, abdominal distension and loss of appetite. His clinical examination indicated the presence of ascites associated with generalised mild abdominal tenderness. He was haemodynamically stable with no evidence of systemic infection. There were no features suggestive of peritonism.\n\n【13】This presentation occurred 5 months following a laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy for an 80 mm contrast-enhancing, Bosniak IV left lower pole cystic renal mass. The procedure was performed via a transperitoneal approach, with care taken to avoid spillage by first aspirating the cystic content, which was sent for cytological analysis. Gauze was then used over the ruptured portion of the cyst to further minimise spillage during dissection until the specimen was bagged and delivered through a separate left abdominal incision. The renal bed was then irrigated with distilled water. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged the following day.\n\n【14】Histopathology of the specimen showed a pT2 Nx type 1 pRCC, nuclear grade 2, with the greatest tumour dimension of 80 mm ( figure 1 ). Necrotic features were evident. Negative surgical margin was achieved, and all tumours were shown to be confined within the renal capsule without lymphovascular invasion. There was no evidence of rhabdoid or sarcomatoid differentiation. The cytology from the aspirated cystic content showed no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【15】<img/>\n\n【16】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【17】Figure 1\n\n【18】(A–B) Histopathology sections with H&E stain showing invasive carcinoma of predominantly papillary architecture (×200).

Repeat ultrasound (US) prior to discharge from inpatient services showed marked interval reduction of the ascites volume.\n\n【33】He was subsequently reviewed by the Medical Oncology team, which commenced on 20 mg daily dose of cabozantinib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. He initially reported good improvement in his abdominal pain symptoms within 1 month of therapy commencement. This improvement was further supported by a repeat staging CT of the brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis, showing stable peritoneal and pulmonary nodules and resolution of ascites and pleural effusion. There was no evidence of other metastatic foci on CT and whole-body bone scan.\n\n【34】Shortly following a trial of higher dosage, the patient developed multiple symptoms, including chest pain, abdominal pain, heartburn and swelling on his hands and feet, prompting subsequent decision for dose reduction. He subsequently developed recurrence of malignant ascites, occurring 5 months after his presentation to the emergency department, which was managed with regular paracentesis due to reaccumulation.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】RCCs are the most frequently encountered primary malignancy of the kidney. They refer to a group of cancers originating from the renal epithelial cells, which may arise either sporadically or as a familial disease. They can be categorised into different histological subtypes, with clear cell RCC (ccRCC) as the most common, followed by pRCC, chromophobe, oncocytoma, collecting duct and not otherwise specified (NOS). 4 Most RCC cases are diagnosed incidentally as either solid or cystic mass through radiological imaging modalities, such as US, CT or MRI. 5 Despite mostly present in the form of solid mass, approximately 1%–14% may have cystic components. More commonly known as cRCC, they are the leading cause of malignant cystic lesions in the kidney. 5–7 They can manifest as intrinsic unilocular cysts, intrinsic multilocular cysts, cysts with necrotic features and unilocular cysts originating from existing mural tumours. 6 7 Most of the different RCC histological subtypes can present as these complex cysts. but among which ccRCCs and pRCCs are the two most common. 8–10\n\n【37】cRCCs are known to confer good prognosis, especially following surgical resection, as they typically present with smaller tumour size and of lower stage and grade. 8–11 Winters _et al_ demonstrated these through a retrospective study comparing 678 cRCCs with 46 677 solid ccRCCs, where cRCCs were reported to be significantly smaller (mean size of 38 mm for cRCC vs 45 mm for solid ccRCC, p<0.001), of lower stage (pT1a 66% for cRCC vs 55% for solid ccRCC, p<0.001) and more commonly well differentiated (33% for cRCC vs 16% for solid ccRCC, p<0.001). Winters _et al_ also highlighted those with cystic necrosis, such as demonstrated in our patient, to have lower 4-year survival of 80% compared with 100% without necrotic features. 11\n\n【38】The characterisation of cystic renal lesion relies on the Bosniak Classification, which provided means to stratify malignancy risks based on a multitude of radiological features, including the appearance of cyst wall, cystic content, septation, calcifications and contrast enhancement. 8 Bosniak IIF, III and IV lesions are more likely to be cancerous, each with malignancy risks of 5%–38%, 40%–70% and 90%–91%, respectively. 8–10 The latter two were more often referred for surgical management as, in addition to the risk of being malignant, higher Bosniak categories were known to be associated with raised likelihood of pT3–4 tumours (IIF 0% vs III 3.5% vs IV 15.6%, p=0.04) and of the higher nuclear grade 3–4 tumours (IIF 0% vs III 12% vs IV 36%, p<0.001), as demonstrated by Nouhaud _et al_ and Boissier _et al_ , respectively. 8 9 Bosniak categories, however, were not associated with increased incidence of recurrence or differences in the 5-year recurrence-free survival (IIF 82% vs III 92% vs IV 92%, p=0.60). 8–10\n\n【39】The recurrence rate of malignant cystic renal lesions following surgical resection, including those presenting as locoregional recurrence or distant metastases, is relatively low, ranging between 1.1% and 8.6%. 8–10 More common metastatic sites include retroperitoneal lymph nodes, lung, liver, bone and brain. Peritoneal involvement in RCC, which can lead to malignant ascites, as observed in our case was relatively uncommon, only affecting 1% of the population. 2 Nevertheless, the incidence of malignant ascites appeared to be higher in pRCC, compared with other histological subtypes of RCC, even in the absence of other distant metastatic sites. These were demonstrated by Sidana _et al_ , who found malignant ascites in 20% of their 100 patients with pRCC. Of the 20 patients with ascites, distant metastatic sites at the time of diagnosis were identified in 30% with no significant differences compared with 24.1% patients without ascites (p=0.609). More importantly, malignant ascites was recognised as a poor prognostic indicator with significantly reduced median overall survival in those affected (25 months in patients with ascites vs 42.5 months in patients without ascites, p=0.041). 1\n\n【40】The relatively high prevalence of malignant ascites reported by Sidana _et al_ may be surprising given the limited number of prior publications for evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis and/or malignant ascites attributed to RCC. Based on previous reports, peritoneal carcinomatosis, with or without ascites, can be associated with ccRCC, pRCC and NOS histological subtypes. 2 12–18 As reported by Sidana _et al_ , ascites may develop up to 73 months following the initial RCC diagnosis with a median time of 16 months. 1 As reflected in table 1 , peritoneal carcinomatosis may also be identified before or after primary tumour resection. 2 12–18 Ploumidis _et al_ identified a 5 mm omental nodule 24 months after a transperitoneal robot-assisted radical nephrectomy for a Fuhrman grade 1, pT2 pRCC. 12 Pandey _et al_ reported a case of multiple peritoneal nodules at the ileocolic junction diagnosed on exploratory laparotomy for right iliac fossa pain 6 months after radical nephrectomy. 13 Similar to our patient, the two postoperative peritoneal carcinomatosis cases were diagnosed together with other potential distant metastatic foci, with ours being the subpleural apical nodule. 12 13\n\n【41】View this table:\n\n【42】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【43】Table 1\n\n【44】Previously published case reports of peritoneal carcinomatosis secondary to different histological subtypes of RCC, with or without malignant ascites\n\n【45】In terms of pathophysiology, it was postulated that peritoneal carcinomatosis in RCC might be secondary to either direct tumour extension outside of the renal capsule and Gerota’s fascia, or an embolic haematogenous metastatic event into the omentum, mesentery and peritoneum. 1 2 14 However, considering the possibility of the disease to manifest in the setting of smaller, low-stage and low-grade primary tumours, such as the Fuhrman grade 2, pT2 pRCC lesion in our case and the grade 1, pT2a pRCC lesion reported by Ploumidis _et al,_ 12 the latter hypothesis might be more likely. Certain general factors can contribute to tumour recurrence, which can be differentiated into tumour-related factors, local wound and patient’s immune response, as well as surgical approach and perioperative complications. 19 Through their multivariate analysis, Boissier _et al_ identified Fuhrman grade 4 tumours and patient’s general status at the time of surgery in the form of their American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) score to be prognostic factors for recurrence. 8\n\n【46】Regarding surgical approach, the cystic nature of cRCC should necessitate caution to minimise the risk of perioperative cyst rupture, which may lead to consequent seeding. This is more relevant for cRCC, for the smaller, well-localised and well-differentiated tumours often prompt clinicians to consider less invasive approaches, in the likes of laparoscopic and/or nephron-sparing surgeries. Chen _et al_ identified that factors such as greater endophytic properties of the tumour, closer proximity to renal collecting system, Bosniak III lesions and surgeon’s experience correlate with risk of intraoperative cyst rupture. 3 However, despite the risk, the incidence of tumour seeding following urological laparoscopic surgery is relatively low, ranging between 0.1% and 4%, 19 and the cyst rupture may not necessarily cause tumour seeding and subsequent recurrence. In a study involving 268 partial nephrectomy patients with 18.7% incidence of cyst rupture, Pradere _et al_ found no evidence of recurrence or peritoneal carcinomatosis and port-site metastasis up to 100 months postoperatively. 20 A prior study by Spaliviero _et al_ involving 284 laparoscopic partial nephrectomy cases echoed a similar phenomenon, whereby only one retroperitoneal recurrence was reported 14 months postoperatively despite the negative margins and absence of intraoperative cyst rupture in all cases. 21 The study by Chen _et al_ also highlighted that only four of nine patients with recurrence were reported to have cyst rupture, and no association can be derived between cyst rupture with the site of recurrence (p=1.00). 3 Our case was an example of recurrence presenting as peritoneal carcinomatosis following a laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in the setting of negative cytology from the aspirated cystic content intraoperatively without any involvement of the renal bed or retroperitoneal lymph node. One potential explanation can be that tumour recurrence is more associated with the aggressiveness of the primary malignancy rather than intraoperative cyst rupture, as the malignant component of cystic tumours is usually more limited to its solid portion. 20\n\n【47】### Learning points\n\n【48】*   Peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignant ascites, although being uncommon in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), are important to recognise as it may indicate poor prognosis.\n    \n*   Recurrence of cystic RCC may occur following surgical resections, even in those of lower stage and lower nuclear grade primary tumours.\n    \n*   High incidence of intraoperative cyst rupture in malignant cystic renal lesions does not always translate to tumour seeding, but appropriate perioperative planning and intraoperative measures still need to be applied to minimise the risks.\n    \n\n【49】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【50】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【51】Obtained.\n\n【52】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【53】The authors thank Dr Benjamin Popp, Anatomical Pathologist, Dorevitch Pathology Footscray Hospital.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Here, we present a case of Libman-Sacks endocarditis and APS that showed drastic changes in endocardial vegetation morphology under different anticoagulation regimens.\n\n【5】A 51-year-old woman with a 10-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus was admitted to our hospital with dizziness and right-sided ataxia. She had developed a flare of lupus nephritis months prior to presentation and received prednisone 20 mg/day. She had no history of injection drug use. She had a history of atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria of 2.8 g/day on admission. Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies were present according to the serum analysis. This finding was compatible with secondary APS. Brain MRI revealed an acute right cerebellar infarction ( figure 1A ). No stenosis or occlusion was found in the intracranial arteries. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) on admission revealed thickening of the mitral valve, but no abnormality in the aortic valve ( figure 2A ). A diagnosis of cardioembolic stroke attributable to atrial fibrillation was made, and apixaban 5 mg twice daily was initiated.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Diffusion-weighted MR images on admission (A) and on day 23 (B).\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Transoesophageal echocardiogram in the long-axis view on admission showing no abnormality in the aortic valve (A).

Ao, aorta; LA, left atrium; LV, left ventricle.\n\n【14】Although no neurological deterioration was observed, follow-up MRI on day 23 revealed acute cerebral infarctions in multiple vascular territories ( figure 1B ). Repeated TEE on day 25 revealed a newly developed vegetation in the aortic valve ( figure 2B ). Blood cultures were negative; she was afebrile and had no skin or eye lesions. The predisposing heart condition was not present. Thus, infective endocarditis was unlikely. Valve abnormalities and positivity for antiphospholipid antibodies suggested Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Apixaban was ineffective and switched to continuous heparin infusion. The vegetation diminished within a week of initiation of heparin therapy ( figure 2C ). She had no signs of systemic embolism. After 2 weeks, heparin was switched to warfarin. Prednisone was increased to 50 mg/day and mycophenolate mofetil was added to treat lupus nephritis as proteinuria greater than 2 g/day persisted. Follow-up MRI revealed no recurrent stroke. The vegetation disappeared on day 75 ( figure 2D ).\n\n【15】The vegetations in Libman-Sacks endocarditis are sterile abnormal growths of tissue around the valves with autoimmune inflammation and thrombotic pathogenesis. 1 The natural history and optimal treatment of Libman-Sacks endocarditis have not been fully elucidated, but some valvular abnormalities respond to anticoagulation therapy. 2 In the present case, the vegetation in the aortic valve developed despite treatment with apixaban and diminished drastically after the initiation of heparin infusion.\n\n【16】Whether direct factor Xa inhibitors are useful for preventing thromboembolic complications of APS is controversial, but recent studies have shown that direct oral anticoagulants are less effective than warfarin. 3 4 Thrombin potential was less inhibited with a factor Xa inhibitor than with warfarin. 5 This insufficiency in preventing hypercoagulability by direct factor Xa inhibitors may be associated with higher rate of thromboembolic complications in APS and may be reflected in the vegetation growth in the present case.\n\n【17】In conclusion, this case highlights the limited efficacy of factor Xa inhibitors for preventing thromboembolic complications of APS by demonstrating morphological changes in Libman-Sacks endocarditis under different anticoagulation regimens.\n\n【18】### Learning points\n\n【19】*   Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a cardiac manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome.\n    \n*   Factor Xa inhibitors may be less effective for preventing thromboembolic events in Libman-Sacks endocarditis than heparin or warfarin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Peak incidence occurs in the second-to-third decade of life, with 75% of patients presenting before the age of 30 and men being more commonly affected than women (M:F=2:1). The typical presenting complaint is one of pain and/or swelling; however, smaller lesions can be asymptomatic. The lesion itself is most commonly located within the metaphyseal region of the long bones (60%), particularly surrounding the knee joint in either the distal femur or most classically within the proximal tibia (25%). Other locations may include the flat bones (40%) or small tubular bones of the hands/feet (17%); however, involvement of the pelvic bones specifically is extremely rare (10%). 1\n\n【10】Ever since it was first described by Jaffe and Lichtenstein in 1948, clinical diagnosis has remained a significant challenge. 2 First, its radiological findings are non-specific across all modalities. Second, the occurrence of CMF in older patients and/or in atypical locations such as the pelvis, where in both scenarios the incidence of malignant lesions such as chondrosarcoma (CS) is higher, and in the latter where benign lesions can grow to a larger size, can significantly alter the index of suspicion. 3 Third, despite the fact that histological sampling is required for definitive diagnosis, cellular findings can still overlap, with the presence of large pleomorphic cells and/or cells with oval nuclei and longitudinal grooves simulating the appearances of CS and chondroblastoma (CB), respectively. 4 5\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A young woman in her early 20s with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presented to our rheumatology department complaining of worsening back pain and tenderness over the left sacroiliac joint. In light of the patient’s known inflammatory arthropathy the initial clinical suspicion was for an axial spondyloarthritis.\n\n【13】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【14】Initial blood tests were positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) but negative for anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (CCP) antibodies, rheumatoid factor (RF) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27. A precontrast and postcontrast MRI of the sacrum/pelvis was performed to assess for evidence of axial spondyloarthritis. The T1-weighted sequences showed a 27 mm × 24 mm × 29 mm (anteroposterior (AP) × transverse (TS) × craniocaudal (CC)), well-circumscribed, homogeneous, hypointense lesion centred over the posterior left sacroiliac joint with associated scalloping of the adjacent sacrum and ilium, and sclerosis of the ilium. The lesion demonstrated mildly heterogeneous but predominantly high signal on short tau inversion recovery (STIR)-weighted sequences and peripheral nodular enhancement following administration of intravenous contrast ( figure 1 ).\n\n【15】<img/>\n\n【16】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【17】Figure 1\n\n【18】MRI of the sacrum/pelvis with (A) axial and (B) coronal precontrast T1 sequences, which show a 27 mm × 24 mm × 29 mm (AP × TS × CC), well-circumscribed, homogeneous, hypointense lesion centred over the left posterior sacroiliac joint with associated scalloping of the adjacent sacrum and ilium, and sclerosis of the ilium.

We conducted a literature review in PubMed by combining the term chondromyxoid fibroma with pelvis, ilium and sacroiliac, and identified several studies relevant to our own, which included 80 cases of pelvic bone CMF with 58 localised to the iliac bones. 3 5–21 Of the latter, 17 cases included information on demographics; the median patient age was 36 with a range of 10–68; 8 patients were men and 9 were women. Ten cases provided information on lateralisation and lesion size; six lesions occurred on the left and four on the right; the median lesion diameter was 5.0 cm with a range of 2.1–17.6 cm. The main presenting complaint was one of chronic pain relating to the lower back, buttock, pelvis, lower limb or groin; however, a palpable mass and lower limb weakness were also documented.\n\n【36】The radiological appearance of CMF is non-specific and can vary according to anatomical site. Wu _et al_ reviewed the clinical, radiographic and pathological features of CMF in a series of 278 patients and noted that the most common plain radiographic findings were of an osteolytic lesion with a purely lucent matrix (90%), sharp margins (94%), cortical thinning (90%) and expansion (85%). Other less common findings included a lobulated outline (58%), sclerotic rim (59%) and focal absence of the cortex (50%). 5 Overall, the appearance is invariably one of a benign osteolytic lesion.\n\n【37】CT is useful to assess for intralesional calcification, disruption of the cortex and soft tissue extension. While microscopic calcification has been reported on histology in up to 35% of cases, the presence of macroscopic calcification on plain film and/or CT is far less common (2%–15%) and should lead one to include other more common cartilaginous bone tumours within the differential ( table 1 ). 1 5 22–24 Interestingly, the incidence of calcification in CMF has been reported as being higher in both older patients and in lesions occurring in the flat bones, which may add to diagnostic uncertainty. 5 Pathological fractures relating to CMF are extremely rare (1.6%) and are thought to be the main cause of periosteal reaction, though this is not true for all cases. 5 10 Lastly, Wu _et al_ also described soft tissue extension as an uncommon occurrence; however, this observation was based on plain radiographic findings alone and without the use of cross-sectional imaging. 5\n\n【38】View this table:\n\n【39】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【40】Table 1\n\n【41】Common cartilaginous bone tumours and chondromyxoid fibroma 1 5 22–24\n\n【42】MRI provides further characterisation and demonstrates the extent of the lesion and its relationship with surrounding structures. The MRI features of CMF were relatively uniform across all studies and consisted of low-to-intermediate signal on T1-weighted sequences, diffuse low signal on T2-weighted sequences and heterogeneous intermediate-to-high signal on T2 fat-saturated sequences. 3 In one study, peripheral nodular enhancement was demonstrated in approximately 70% of cases and diffuse heterogeneous or homogeneous enhancement in the other 30%. 25 Other studies have described specific MRI features including a low signal intensity rim on all sequences and a lack of or minimal bone or soft tissue oedema as useful in distinguishing CMF from CS; however, such findings appear unreliable and are not commonly used. 3\n\n【43】Ultimately histology is required for definitive diagnosis. For the practising histopathologist, the important distinction to be made is between CMF and CS. CMF can be misdiagnosed histologically as a malignant lesion due to the presence of large pleomorphic cells; however, in well-differentiated CS the well-formed hyaline cartilage is usually easily appreciated and the myxoid metachromatic matrix and hypocellular central area of the lobules seen in CMF are usually absent. 19 CB also may contain areas of myxoid tissue and spindle cells similar to those seen in CMF; however, other features such as a pericellular ‘chicken wire’ pattern of calcification are not uncommon and pathognomonic for CB. 19 Enchondroma may also be included in the histopathological differential diagnosis; however, the presence of mature hyaline cartilage in these tumours is a good differentiating feature. 26\n\n【44】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【45】This case demonstrates CMF, an already rare bone tumour, in a rare location. The patient’s age and size of the lesion is concordant with descriptions of CMF in more typical locations throughout the body. With regard to pelvic bone CMF, prior studies often describe difficulties in establishing a definitive diagnosis. Peak incidence may occur beyond the accepted third decade of life and lesions may grow to a larger size to fill the pelvic bones. The imaging findings are similar for both pelvic and non-pelvic CMF, yet non-specific overall. Useful differentiating features such as intralesional calcification, while more common in malignant lesions such as CS, can still occur in CMF with higher rates reported in pelvic CMF specifically.

An occupational therapist, in collaboration with care staff, evaluated the patient and routinised the household chores included in IADL. Consequently, a routine of household chores was established, reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and long-term care burden, and the quality of life (QOL) of the patient improved.

Previous studies have reported a few routinising therapies that use stereotyped behaviour associated with FTD to immerse patients in activities of interest, such as hobbies and preferences. Tanabe _et al_ 4 reported that routinising the work that the patient was interested in reduced his/her troubles with others and the long-term care burden of caregivers. Lough and Hodges 5 reported that routinising simple work was effective in improving behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). However, after these reports were published, almost no research on routinising therapy in patients with FTD has been reported in recent years. Moreover, it is unclear whether IADL, which involves complex processes, can be adapted to routinising therapy for patients with FTD.\n\n【10】We present a case study where intervention for routinising IADL was introduced in a patient with FTD, who had never performed any IADL at all while living in a group home. 6 It is expected that routinising therapy is effective in improving IADL in patients with FTD.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】The patient was a 69-year-old woman. She gave birth to a child at the age of 25 years and was a (full-time) homemaker until she got divorced at the age of 34. She started living alone at the age of 43 after her child entered university. After working for 20 years at a supermarket, the woman retired at the age of 54. Thereafter, she increasingly spent time alone at home during the day. After a few years, she started repeating acts such as trying to take items from convenience stores without paying (shoplifting), and making loud noises when entering or leaving her house, such as knocking or slamming the door, which led to complaints from nearby stores and neighbours. Accordingly, at the age of 57, she underwent psychiatric examination and was diagnosed with FTD. After this diagnosis, she was placed in a group home. The patient has lived in the group home ever since.\n\n【13】The subject did not have any physical function impairment that would inhibit the activities of daily life. In the group home, she used to perform minimum self-care, such as cleaning her room by herself. However, in the group home, she rarely performed the household chores that she used to undertake while living in her house. Previously, she had at times engaged in making seasonal ornaments with the care staff, but she did not continue such activities for long. When in a bad mood, she had altercations with other residents and care staff, and even locked herself in her room at times. There were instances where watching other residents participating in activities with care staff, in which she was not participating, resulted in a bad mood out of jealousy. She used to be angry if she was not the first one allowed to take a bath. The patient would spend most of her time doing nothing, sitting at the same table and in the same chair in the living room, and used to take meals at the same place every day. The burden on the care staff was high since the patient created a commotion if some other resident occupied her usual place.\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】The patient was assessed before the intervention and 2 weeks after the intervention administered by the occupational therapist. The scores shown in tables 1 and 2 were recorded using the following assessment tools:\n\n【16】*   Hyogo Activities of Daily Living Scale (HADLS). 7\n    \n*   Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH). 8\n    \n*   Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD). 9\n    \n*   Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). 10\n    \n*   Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). 11\n    \n\n【17】View this table:\n\n【18】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【19】Table 1\n\n【20】Improvement of activities of daily living (HADLS) score after the intervention of the IADL\n\n【21】View this table:\n\n【22】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【23】Table 2\n\n【24】Improvement of BPSD and burden (NPI-NH), QOL (QOL-AD), cognitive function (MMSE), staging of dementia (CDR) score after the intervention of the IADL\n\n【25】HADLS is a comprehensive impairment scale for daily life activities in patients with dementia. NPI-NH is a facility version tool for assessing BPSD, and a version in Japanese is also available. 12 QOL-AD is a QOL scale specifically designed for patients with dementia, for which a version in Japanese is also available. 13 All these assessment scales have been confirmed to be reliable and valid.\n\n【26】The patient’s total HADLS score for activities of daily living was 46.8, with a score of 2.7 for subitem ‘clean-up after meals’, which she seldom undertook. The occupational therapist clinically judged that the clean-up after meals can be performed if done together with the care staff. The total NPI-NH score for BPSD was 14, with subitem scores of 4 for agitation, 3 for apathy, 3 for disinhibition and 4 for irritability. The level of long-term care burden due to BPSD was assessed as 7 given by the long-term care burden item in NPI-NH. The QOL scores using QOL-AD was 39. Cognitive function score assessed using MMSE was 18. The degree of severity of dementia assessed using CDR was 2 ( tables 1 and 2 ).\n\n【27】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【28】In the guidelines for the treatment of dementia 2017 supervised by the Japanese Society of Neurology, FTD is used as a clinical diagnostic name that encompasses behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia and progressive non-fluent aphasia. 14 The subject met the diagnostic criteria for bvFTD, that is, the clinical picture with progressive and persistent symptoms including early behavioural disinhibition, early apathy, early loss of empathy and early stereotyped behaviour that meet international consensus criteria for bvFTD by the International Behavioural Variant FTD Criteria Consortium. 1 However, due to the patient’s financial constraints and barriers to a definitive diagnosis, no formal cognitive screening, diagnostic imaging or pathological examination was performed to examine the diagnosis or stage of disease in detail. As a result, the subject was also diagnosed with FTD since the Japanese guidelines use FTD as a clinical diagnosis that encompasses all three types.\n\n【29】Treatment\n---------\n\n【30】Routinising therapy refers to the method in which the patient is guided to perform activities that the patient is interested in or prefers, by using the easily preserved episodic memory, procedural memory and visuospatial cognitive functions of patients with FTD. 2–5 14 Such activities are then incorporated into the daily routine by appropriately using the stereotyped behaviour in a positive sense. Using HADLS, the occupational therapist, together with the care staff, extracted the IADL that the patient was undertaking in daily activities at her residence but not doing currently at the group home. The occupational therapist selected the IADL of ‘clean-up after meals’ assuming that the patient would likely be able to complete the task if it was done together with care staff. Next, a positive response was obtained when the patient was asked whether she would like to try ‘clean-up after meals’. In line with the patient’s wish, it was decided that the IADL of ‘clean-up after meals’ would be the task undertaken in the routinising therapy. The occupational therapist instructed the care staff to guide the patient in performing the clean-up after meals more than once per day. Moreover, the care staff was also instructed to say words of appreciation and gratitude every time the patient completed the clean-up after meals. The intervention period was set as 2 weeks, hypothesising that even in a short time routinising the IADL would lead to an improvement in IADL capability.\n\n【31】The care staff guided the patient in performing the household chores every day for 2 weeks, and the patient was able to complete the household chores together with the care staff. On day 1 and day 2, responding to the guidance by the care staff with a smiling face and in good mood, the patient performed the clean-up after meals. On day 3, the patient on her own volition performed the activity of ‘wiping the table’ when she noticed the wiping cloth placed on the table. On day 4 and afterwards, she was able to wash the dishes even more carefully. On day 6 and afterwards, she started looking forward to clean-up after meals as soon as she had finished eating. On day 7 and afterwards, she wanted to wear an apron while performing the household chores. On day 8 and afterwards, the instances in which she conversed the care staff with a smile while performing clean-up after meals also increased.\n\n【32】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【33】After the intervention, the total HADLS score was 44.8, with a score of 0.7 for the subitem ‘clean up after meals’. The total NPI-NH score was 4, with subitem scores of 3 for agitation, 1 for apathy, 2 for disinhibition and 2 for irritability. The QOL-AD score was 44. The MMSE score was 18. The CDR score was 2 ( tables 1 and 2 ).\n\n【34】In the follow-up over 1 month after the 2-week intervention, the routine of clean-up after meals was found to be established. Moreover, the patient started to amicably converse even with the residents whom she had previously disliked. Additionally, instances of locking herself up in her room became fewer, and instances of altercations with other residents ceased almost completely.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】In this case study, we referred to the current ADL status and daily living history of the patient having more than three clinical features in formulating the routinising therapy to adapt the stereotyped behaviour to IADL. Moreover, a new finding for us was that focusing on IADL in the intervention enabled the patient to perform it in a short time, improving the IADL capability. Additionally, another point worthy of attention was that the BPSD decreased as the IADL capability improved.\n\n【37】In the Japanese guidelines, non-drug therapies such as care and behaviour therapy considering FTLD symptomatology are recommended as 2C (‘weak recommendation, weak rationale’ based on the combination of recommended grade and evidence level) category. 14\n\n【38】Disinhibition, stereotyped behaviour and decreased spontaneity are observed as the early-stage symptoms of FTD. However, memory impairment and visuospatial impairment are not noticeable in the early stage. 4 15 In this case, as the intervention continued, the patient increasingly looked forward to performing the IADL. The point worthy of attention here is that it indicates that for a patient with FTD, it is easier to preserve prospective memory for remembering what to do from now on. In summary, patients with FTD exhibit less memory (functional) impairment compared with patients with Alzheimer dementia and other types of dementia, and this can be considered important in formulating the therapy strategy for treating behaviour impairment associated with FTD. 4\n\n【39】The long-term care burden of caregivers due to BPSD in patients with FTD has been reported as an issue. 16–19 In care facilities also, it is necessary to reduce the long-term care burden. It has been reported that introducing routinising therapy inwards has reduced the long-term care burden. 4 In this case, routinising therapy was administered guaranteeing patient-centred care, by obtaining consent before the IADL intervention that the patient wants to do household chores. Consequently, troubles with others and BPSD such as agitation, apathy, disinhibition and irritability were reduced, resulting in a reduction in long-term care burden. In a systematic review of clinical experiments on non-drug therapies, Shinagawa _et al_ 20 mentioned that based on a study with six patients with FTLD, Ikeda _et al_ from Japan have reported that care using memory function and visuospatial function was effective, leading to sustaining QOL. Merrilees _et al_ 21 reported that there were cases where it was possible to decrease abnormal behaviour and reduce the burden on caregivers, by using the (remaining) preserved functions and past lifestyle of the patient. In this case, also, using the patient’s stereotyped behaviour to adapt to IADL in the routinising therapy improved the QOL of the patient and reduced the long-term care burden of the care staff. These findings corroborate the observations in previous reports.\n\n【40】In this case report, since the investigation was limited to the comparison of before and after the intervention for only one case (patient), it cannot be said that the results apply to every patient with FTD. However, it is especially worth mentioning that incorporating IADL in the activities in routinising therapy improves IADL capability and QOL of the patient, which leads to reducing BPSD and long-term care burden. Incorporating such measures in care for patients with FTD can be considered effective hereafter.\n\n【41】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【42】The patient said, \"I look forward to cleaning up after meals every day. Up until now, no one expected me to clean up after meals or let me do it. I was made to spend my time just sitting in the living room. But I feel a little bit happier now.”\n\n【43】Her care staff said, \"She’s started to clean up after her meals and she’s happier and smiles more every day. And most importantly, she is less angry and verbally abusive. It has made it easier for us to care for her.”\n\n【44】### Learning points\n\n【45】*   Sustaining and improving Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) using the residual (preserved) functions such as memory function in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an important strategy in providing care.\n    \n*   Adapting IADL of patients with FTD living in group home to routinising therapy is an effective measure.\n    \n*   Using routinising therapy likely improves IADL and quality of life, and consequently, behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and associated long-term care burden also reduce.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The evidence is scarce on best choice once first-line therapy fails. Beta-blockers had been used in the past successfully but with concerns about safety. The ultrashort acting beta-blockers like esmolol can be used more safely in this scenario, and should be reconsidered, particularly given the mechanism of ventricular arrythmias in these poisonings.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A woman in her 30s presented to a remote hospital after a very large intentional amitriptyline overdose of up to 10 g (up to 128 mg/kg). Her medical history included only major depressive disorder, and there was no family history of arrythmia or cardiac disease.\n\n【12】She required immediate intubation for persisting coma and seizures. Sodium bicarbonate and hyperventilation were initiated for electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria of widened QRS and coma, and titrated to a pH of 7.55. After discussion with a toxicology specialist, intralipid was commenced and aeromedical retrieval was arranged. The aircraft was diverted to our hospital after two inflight episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) requiring defibrillation.\n\n【13】At our hospital, the patient continued to have frequent and intractable ventricular tachycardia progressing to fibrillation, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. She had aggressive electrolyte replacement aiming for potassium levels of 4.5–5, magnesium levels>1.3 mmol/L and normal ionised calcium. Multiple repeated doses of sodium bicarbonate up to 1600 mmols and hypertonic saline 1500 mmols were administered, titrated to achieve a pH of 7.55, and Na>155. The ECG showed sinus tachycardia with increasingly broader complexes progressing to monomorphic VT of 200 beats/min with increasing automaticity then deteriorating to ventricular fibrillation, with no features of a torsades pattern or Brugada criteria. Further infusion of intralipid was given (6 hours after the first) and further magnesium infusion and then lidocaine infusion were all given without apparent effect. Inotropes and pressors were required to maintain a perfusing mean arterial blood pressure of >60 mm Hg.\n\n【14】In view of the failure to resolve the arrhythmias and echocardiographic evidence of reducing ventricular function after multiple defibrillations, the patient was discussed with a tertiary cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) for consideration of extra-corporeal cardiac support (ECMO). To support the progressively lower cardiac output and to facilitate transfer an intra-arterial balloon pump (IABP) was inserted.\n\n【15】Despite the above treatments, the patient continued to have VT/VF, a total of 28 episodes requiring CPR and defibrillation over the next 8 hours. It was observed that after a successful defibrillation the ECG would normalise when the rate was below 100 and begin to have progressively longer QT interval as the rate increased. Given that all treatment goals were being met and arrhythmias were continuing, a trial of intravenous esmolol (ultra-short acting B-blocker) was given. The patients heart rate initially reduced to 60 beats/min and slowly increased to 100 over the next 30 min with no arrhythmias occurring.\n\n【16】When the heart rate returned above 100 beats/min, the ECG again displayed increased QRS duration (>200 ms) and automaticity, provoking ventricular tachycardia which soon deteriorated to VF. An esmolol infusion was recommenced, targeting a heart rate of 80–100 beats/min. The ECG now showed a rate of 98 beats/min with QRS duration of 120 ms. The patient had no further arrhythmias with this therapeutic manoeuvre and was stable on transfer to the tertiary cardiac centre, with a reducing inotrope requirement. Attempts to stop or wean the esmolol infusion resulted in recurrence of tachycardia then VT/VF and the esmolol was continued for 72 hours. The IABP was weaned within 48 hours, and the patient extubated on day 7.\n\n【17】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【18】There was no family history suggesting that the patient had an underlying familial or genetic tendency to VF such as Brugada syndrome, where the use of amitriptyline can block sodium channels I <sub>Na </sub> I <sub>to </sub> and I <sub>Kr </sub> leading to unmasking of Brugada ECG phenotype, or exacerbate a Congenital prolonged QT syndrome. 1 2 It is unlikely that she had undiagnosed critical coronary arterial disease in view of her age and subsequent follow-up. The patient had taken one of the largest overdoses we are aware of, as much as 10 g of amitriptyline, and this was evidenced by retrospective amitriptyline levels from the day of admission being beyond the limits of the assay (>1000 µmols/L), quantifiable by day 4 as 994 µmols/L and normalising to 232 µmols/L by day 10 (see figure 1 ). Some people with cytochrome p phenotypes can have delayed clearance of amitriptyline, but this is not routinely assessable.\n\n【19】<img/>\n\n【20】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【21】Figure 1\n\n【22】Amitriptyline/nortriptyline levels versus days from presentation. The tricyclic levels from the first days of the admission were higher than the upper level of the assay.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】The most common mode of death in tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdoses that reach hospital is refractory hypotension with progressive cardiac dysfunction due to contractile failure. The mechanisms leading to low cardiac output and hypotension are numerous. 3\n\n【25】Spontaneous ventricular tachycardias and fibrillation are less common, but dramatically increase the risk of death. Slowed depolarisation and subsequent repolarisation of the cardiac action potential throughout myocardial conducting and contractile tissue leads to a relatively longer refractory period owing to use-dependant sodium channel blockade. 4–6 Acidosis, hypokalaemia, hypoxaemia, hyperthermia, hypotension and excessive adrenergic stimulation may also predispose to arrhythmias. 7 Blockade of the hERG human potassium channel by amitriptyline may also cause increased automaticity and arrhythmias in this setting of excessive adrenergic activity. 8\n\n【26】In animal models, it appears that the combination of increased sinus node rate and prolonged QRS is key to the occurrence of VT/VF here. 6 9 Models first proposed in the 1970s predicted that block produced by tertiary amine local anaesthetics (like amitriptyline) may be enhanced by depolarisation, and that recovery from depolarisation-induced block is time dependant. As the heart rate increases, the diastolic period is shortened and there is insufficient time for complete drug unbinding between beats. The increasing presence of drug-associated (blocked) sodium channels reduces maximum sodium current and conduction velocity in cardiac muscle, resulting in QRS prolongation, and increases the likelihood of re-entrant type arrhythmias. 10\n\n【27】Prevention of sinus tachycardia in experimental amitriptyline toxicity by sinus node destruction, beta-blockers, direct vagal stimulation, physostigmine and specific bradycardia agents like zatebradine effectively prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmias, as well as reduce QRS prolongation. 6 9 11 12\n\n【28】Beta-blockade infusion was chosen in our patient to reduce the heart rate because we observed that the QRS and QT prolongation increased with rate, and arrythmias and triggered automaticity occurred exclusively when the heart rate was >110 and QRS prolonged, and we hoped to prevent the tachycardia and ventricular arrythmias despite the risks of reduced cardiac contractility.\n\n【29】Any potential reduction in contractility or blood pressure could be offset by careful titration of esmolol to a safe rate, the restoration of a perfusing rhythm, and in extremis the use of a cardiac support device such as IABP or ECMO. In this case, we minimised the dose of esmolol by titrating to a pulse range of less than 100 beats/min and more than 80beats/min. The malignant rhythm reappeared once the pulse rate was over 110 beats/min at several different times in her course. It was a successful intervention suggested by the fact that premature cessation of esmolol infusion on two occasions led to tachycardia and recurrence of ventricular tachycardia then fibrillation.\n\n【30】Currently first-line therapy of amitriptyline cardiac toxicity is generous use of IV sodium bicarbonate to provide sodium ions and alkalinisation. 13–16 Five to 7.5% hypertonic sodium has been shown to have as good or better effect than dilute sodium bicarbonate in reversing hypotension and QRS, and both are more effective than alkalinisation by hyperventilation alone, suggesting that the sodium dose is important. 17 Intra-lipid infusion (‘lipid rescue’) was recommended by the toxicologist, commenced at the referring hospital and was continued as recommended, with no apparent benefit. Positive anecdotes of successful use of intralipid are not supported by clinical trails and human or animal models so far. 18–20\n\n【31】There is no consensus over the recommended ‘second line’ therapy of magnesium, lidocaine or phenytoin for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and sodium channel blockers such as flecainide, procaianamide and amiodarone are strongly contra-indicated. 21–24 There are no trials comparing them, but currently small case series and animal models favour lidocaine. 5 23 Physostigmine was observed to reduce anticholinergic symptoms, tachycardia and arrhythmias, but avoided due to adverse events. 25 Long-acting beta-blockers have been used in past decades, with some successful cases but significant concerns about reducing ventricular contractility and worsening shock. 26–29\n\n【32】The antiarrhythmic mechanism of betablockers is complex and depends on the specific mechanism of the arrhythmia. 30 In this situation, the ventricular arrhythmias may have been caused by triggered activity due to afterdepolarisations in a situations where the action potential is already prolonged by the rate dependant block, as well as the profound sympathetic stimulation of cardiac arrest.\n\n【33】We propose that in cases of severe amitriptyline toxicity complicated by intractable ventricular tachycardia and arrhythmias unresponsive to the typical first-line and second-line medications, and where all care has been given to controlling homeostasis by optimisation of potassium, magnesium, calcium, pH, oxygenation and perfusing blood pressure, that a titrated short acting beta-blocker infusion can be considered\n\n【34】### Learning points\n\n【35】*   Resistant ventricular arrythmias greatly increase the risk of death in tricyclic antidepressant toxicity and can be difficult to treat.\n    \n*   The type of sodium channel blockade caused by tricyclics means that recovery from depolarisation-induced block is time dependant, suggesting that an increased heart rate can lead to greater risk of ventricular arrythmia occurrence.\n    \n*   Second line medications to treat VT or VF in TCA toxicity have poor evidence and efficacy, and although extra-corporeal cardiovascular support is an option, it is not always available.\n    \n*   In severe amitriptyline toxicity complicated by intractable ventricular arrhythmias unresponsive to the typical first and second-line therapies, and attention to homeostasis, that a titrated short acting beta-blocker infusion can be considered, and may be lifesaving.\n    \n\n【36】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【37】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【38】Consent obtained from next of kin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

She was a never smoker and had a history of recurrent pneumothorax (one bilateral, one right sided and one left sided). There was no history of exposure to organic dust. She had a slender stature with a flattened thoracic cage. At the time of initial examination, she was 154 cm tall and weighed 30.4 kg with a body mass index of 12.8. She had an oxygen saturation of 93% while breathing ambient air. Sounds on auscultation of the lungs were normal. Arterial blood gas analysis on ambient air showed hypoxemia with mild hypercapnia (PaO <sub>2 </sub> , 58 torr; PaCO <sub>2 </sub> , 49 torr; and pH, 7.46). Laboratory investigations revealed a normal Krebs von Lungen-6 level (216 U/mL; normal range of 0–449 U/mL) and a normal β-D glucan level. Antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Repeated sputum examinations were sterile without _Mycobacterium_ or _Aspergillus_ . Posteroanterior ( figure 1A ) and lateral chest radiography ( figure 1B ) showed bilateral upper lobe-predominant consolidations, a rightward tracheal deviation (arrowheads) and a flattened thoracic cage.

The prognosis of idiopathic PPFE is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of 23–58%. 2 Some investigators have described a poorer prognosis of idiopathic PPFE than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 3 Antifibrotic agents including nintedanib and pirfenidone have been reported to be effective in a broad range of interstitial lung diseases. However, there is no established treatment for idiopathic PPFE. Clinicians should be aware of this interstitial pneumonia type, as it is sometimes misdiagnosed as obsolete tuberculosis or pulmonary apical cap. The obsolete tuberculosis or pulmonary apical cap are localised and have quite slow or no progression, while PPFE is extensive and progressive. During one year of follow-up, the patient’s pulmonary lesions gradually progressed, and home oxygenation therapy was introduced.\n\n【15】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【16】I will be glad to be of help for future healthcare.\n\n【17】### Learning points\n\n【18】*   Idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis is a rare subtype of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, which is characterised by upper lobe-dominant pulmonary fibrosis with peculiar clinical features of recurrent pneumothorax, flattened thoracic cage and progressive emaciation.\n    \n*   Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is sometimes misdiagnosed as obsolete tuberculosis or residual scarring.\n    \n*   Retrospective review or prospective investigation of imaging data is necessary to differentiate idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis from obsolete tuberculosis or residual scarring.\n    \n\n【19】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【20】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【21】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

She had history of fall and injury to her left knee 3 years earlier. Following the injury, the child had intermittent pain and swelling of the knee joint, especially on performing activities like running or jumping. She also experienced minor difficulty in walking. She occasionally had episodes of locking of the joint. On examination, she was found to have lateral joint line tenderness. A fixed flexion deformity of 15° and a range of movement of 15°−100° was noted. Thigh muscle was also present. Lachman’s test, anterior and posterior drawer tests, McMurray’s test, Apley’s grinding test and varus and valgus stress tests were all negative.\n\n【5】Radiographs of the knee joint appeared normal. MRI of the knee joint showed a cystic lesion in the anterior compartment of the knee originating from the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the intercondylar notch ( figure 1A ). The lesion appeared hypointense in T1-weighted images and hyperintense in T2-weighted images ( figure 1B,C ). The rest of the ACL appeared mildly thickened and oedematous. On arthroscopy, a 1.5×1 cm cherry red nodular mass was noted in the intercondylar notch originating from the ACL ( figure 2 ). The mass was excised arthroscopically and all remaining capillaries were ablated ( video 1 ). The histopathological examination revealed closely packed spindle cells with spaces filled with blood, consistent with capillary haemangioma. Postoperatively, the child was started on isometric muscle strengthening exercises and mobilised on the first postoperative day.

MRI remains the investigation of choice for diagnosis. 3 MRI helps to differentiate these from synovial chondromatosis, pigmented villonodular synovitis and gouty tophi. For a lesion involving the ACL like in our case, the closest differential to be considered was a ganglion cyst involving the ACL. 4 It has a similar shape, size and can involve the ACL. It can be differentiated from ACL haemangioma by a fat-suppressed, contrast-enhanced MRI which shows a thin, rim-enhancing feature of ganglion cysts, or by histopathological examination. 5 The available literature suggests arthroscopic excision as the preferred modality for treatment of ACL haemangioma/intra-articular haemangioma over open resection and synovectomy. 1 2\n\n【16】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【17】We are glad that our daughter has not had any problems after the surgery and has been able to do all the activities that she was not able to do earlier due to the pain and swelling.\n\n【18】### Learning points\n\n【19】*   Intra-articular synovial haemangioma is a rare cause of pain and swelling of the knee joint which can infrequently involve the anterior cruciate ligament.\n    \n*   MRI is the diagnostic investigation of choice.\n    \n*   Arthroscopic excision is the preferred modality of treatment.\n    \n\n【20】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【21】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【22】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The patients present characteristic facial features such as ocular hypertelorism, narrowing of the palpebral fissure, ptosis, a flat nasal bridge and low-set ears, as well as heart disease, short stature and thoracic abnormalities. 1 Eighty per cent of patients with NS show several cardiac disorders including pulmonary valvular stenosis (PS), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and/or atrial septal defects. 2 HCM is a serious cardiac comorbidity in patients with NS, especially in those who are diagnosed within 6 months of age with congestive heart failure. 3 Arrhythmia with or without HCM in NS is a rare comorbidity with a complicated clinical course and poor prognosis. 3\n\n【11】At present, 13 genes are known as the causative genes of NS in the RAS/MAPK signal transduction system, and these are collectively called RASopathies. 4 Disease-causing mutations usually enhance the signal flow through this pathway. _RAF1_ gene mutations have been detected in 5% of patients with NS, _SOS1_ gene mutations in approximately 10%, _RIT1_ gene mutations in 5% and _KRAS_ gene mutations in less than 5%, whereas _PTPN11_ gene mutations are found in more than half of all cases, although the detection rate of major gene mutations in NS varies depending on the report. The incidence of common cardiac symptoms in NS depends on the major causative genes. PS is predominant in patients with _PTPN11_ , _SOS1_ and _RIT1_ gene mutations. HCM is common in patients with _RAF1_ and _RIT1_ gene mutations and rare in patients with _PTPN11_ and _SOS1_ gene mutations.\n\n【12】We present the case of a male infant with NS with _RAF1_ gene mutation, who showed various types of arrhythmias along with HCM and mild PS. He developed life-threatening heart failure due to uncontrollable arrhythmias. We attempted several antiarrhythmic agents and finally controlled the arrhythmias to establish a normal sinus rhythm with a combination of amiodarone and flecainide.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A woman in her late 20s was referred to our hospital in week 14 of pregnancy because of nuchal fold thickness. Chromosome analysis based on Giemsa banding and fluorescence in situ hybridisation did not detect any karyotypic abnormalities. In week 31, polyhydramnios due to fetal hydrops led to a risk of premature delivery. Fetal ultrasonography detected macrocephaly and venous defects. A male baby was born at 32 weeks and 2 days of gestation by emergency caesarean section due to endometrial infection with a 5-min Apgar score of 8. His birth weight, height and head circumference were 1793 g (0 SD), 40.1 cm (−0.91 SD) and 32.0 cm (+1.58 SD), respectively. Postnatal respiratory distress syndrome was treated with mechanical ventilation for 2 days followed by high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy for 33 days. He received a clinical diagnosis of NS based on (1) facial features, such as intereye dissection, flat nasal bridge and low-set ears; (2) heart disease, such as HCM and mild PS and (3) cryptorchidism. In addition, a missense mutation (c.770C<T, p.Ser257 Leu) due to a single-nucleotide substitution of the _RAF1_ gene was detected on genetic diagnosis which confirmed the diagnosis of NS. There were no mutations in the _PTPN11_ , _SOS1_ , _RIT1_ , _KRAS_ , _NRAS_ , _SHOC2_ , _CBL_ or _BRAF_ genes.\n\n【15】At around 1-month-old, the patient was admitted to our department from the neonatal care unit with poor feeding, apnoeic attacks and transient supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). He had no family history of heart disease including arrhythmias. On admission, chest radiography showed an enlarged cardiothoracic ratio of 60% ( figure 1A ). ECG revealed premature atrial contractions (PACs) with left axis deviation ( figure 1B ). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed myocardial hypertrophy with 6 mm of interventricular septum thickness (Z score = +5.3) and 4 mm of left ventricular posterior wall thickness (Z score = +2.8) without left ventricular outflow tract stenosis ( figure 1C ) and mild PS (peak velocity = 1.58 m/s and estimated pressure gradient = 10 mm Hg) ( figure 1D ). We administered propranolol for SVT for 3 days and discontinued the medication because there was no recurrence. In the subsequent 2 weeks, he gained weight without any signs of heart failure, respiratory distress or persistent arrhythmia except for sporadic PACs ( figure 2A ). The level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 80 ng/L (normal range <18.4 ng/L). However, on day 55, the monitor ECG suddenly presented 30 s of torsade de pointes (TdP) while sleeping ( figure 2B ). We then resumed propranolol and subsequently added sotalol, a potassium channel blocker, for consecutive premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) at 2 months of age ( figure 2C ). However, the PVCs did not decrease with propranolol and sotalol; instead, atrial fibrillation (AF) appeared at 2.5 months of age ( figure 2D ) with a significant increase in the BNP level to 2000 ng/L. We then performed several attempts of cardioversions that failed to terminate AF while infusion of flecainide, a sodium channel blocker, finally terminated AF. However, 20 min later, he experienced cardiopulmonary arrest after transient bradycardia and apnoea. After successful resuscitation, he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at our hospital. He showed marked atrial enlargement by TTE ( figure 2E ) and decreased ventricular contractility with various origins of arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia (VT) and recurrent AF ( figure 2F ).\n\n【16】<img/>\n\n【17】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【18】Figure 1\n\n【19】(A) Chest and abdominal radiography on admission.

His haemodynamics were unstable even with the support for the first week in the ICU. However, his condition gradually improved even with continued arrhythmias in the second week. He was extubated at about 3 months old and returned to the general paediatric ward with several types of arrhythmias ( figure 2G ). We administered several combinations of antiarrhythmic agents, such as amiodarone alone, amiodarone with sotalol, amiodarone with propranolol and amiodarone with flecainide. Finally, a combination of amiodarone with flecainide terminated AF, PVCs and PACs at around 4 months of age ( figure 2H ). His heart failure further attenuated with a BNP level of approximately 100 ng/L after the termination of the arrhythmias ( figure 3 ).\n\n【26】<img/>\n\n【27】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【28】Figure 3\n\n【29】Clinical course of the patient with the combinations of antiarrhythmic drugs (illustrated by Hagino M).\n\n【30】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【31】He was discharged from the hospital around 5 months of age with flecainide and amiodarone. We have been following him for 1½ years and gradually decreasing the amount of the drugs. He showed HCM without any recurrence of arrhythmia.\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】In the present case, a missense mutation (c.770C<T, p.Ser257 Leu) of the _RAF1_ gene was detected. RAF1 is a MAPK which belongs to the RAS family of membrane-bound GTPases in the RAS/MAPK signalling pathway. In NS, mutations are concentrated in the CR2 region of a phosphorylation site that suppresses RAF1 activity. 5 This case also involved a mutation in the CR2 region. In patients with NS with a _RAF1_ gene mutation, the frequency of heart disease is high. Arrhythmia is a relatively rare cardiac complication in NS, while more than half of the patients with _RAF1_ mutations have arrhythmia. 3 5 Mutations in _RAF1_ behave as gain-of-function mutants and induce high levels of phosphorylation of mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which are downstream targets of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Activated ERKs regulate cellular proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and migration of cardiomyocytes which lead to cardiac hypertrophy in NS. 5–7 Furthermore, mutations in _RAF1_ are associated with the activation of Ca <sup>2+ </sup> /calcineurin through the RAF-calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells pathway. 7 This pathway causes arrhythmia and cardiac hypertrophy due to pathological cardiac remodelling. 8 In our case, the patient had already presented with moderate-to-severe HCM soon after birth. Therefore, it was difficult to determine whether the arrhythmia was associated with HCM, NS-related or both. The types of arrhythmia in our patient were SVT, AF and VT, which are common in RAS/MAPK-associated arrhythmia due to the aforementioned mechanisms and as well as HCM-induced arrhythmia due to myocardial fibrosis and left atrial enlargement. 9 His arrhythmia terminated after the treatment of heart failure with catecolamine support in the ICU in combination with antiarrhythmic agents, and his heart failure further attenuated after arrhythmia termination; thus, his condition may have been complicated by the HCM and several types of arrhythmia-related injury in cardiomyocytes.\n\n【34】We administered several combinations of antiarrhythmic drugs, including propranolol alone, propranolol with sotalol, sotalol with flecainide, amiodarone alone, amiodarone with sotalol, amiodarone with propranolol and amiodarone with flecainide. It was very difficult to choose the antiarrhythmic drugs for this patient because the types of arrhythmia changed during the clinical course. In addition, there are no consensus guidelines for the arrhythmia of the preterm infants, the patients with neonatal HCM or NS. 10 In our case, we finally found the combination of amiodarone with flecainide which ceased the long-lasting arrhythmia. However, we should have paid more attention to the possible exacerbation caused by the several combinations of the drugs, that is, TdP with sotalol plus amiodarone, heart failure with flecainide or overlapped β-blocking effects of sotalol and propranolol. Levin _et al_ reported 11 cases of non-re-entrant atrial tachycardia in NS occurring independently of HCM. 3 They reported that propranolol alone and/or with digoxin failed to control NS-associated arrhythmia, while flecainide alone and/or with propranolol, amiodarone alone or propranolol with verapamil successfully attenuated the arrhythmia. Flecainide suppressed the increase of the action potential by suppressing the increase in intracellular Na <sup>+ </sup> concentration, amiodarone inactivated K channels, sympathetic nerves and Ca channels as a multichannel blocker. Although we avoided administering verapamil because of the risk of worsening cardiac function in the infant, calcium blockers may be a good choice to block the Ca <sup>2+ </sup> /calcineurin pathway. 11 Cyclosporine was also a candidate to suppress the RAF1-associated Ca <sup>2+ </sup> /calcineurin activation and cardiomyocyte remodelling as shown in in vivo studies. 7 11\n\n【35】In conclusion, we attempted several antiarrhythmic agents and finally controlled the arrhythmias to establish a normal sinus rhythm with a combination of amiodarone and flecainide in a male infant with NS with HCM.\n\n【36】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【37】Parents' perspective: When he was in the ICU, we spent very hard time because of the uncontrollable arrhythmia. Therefore we were very happy when he could discharge from the hospital. However, we are still worried about his condition with HCM and heart failure.\n\n【38】### Learning points\n\n【39】*   _RAF1_ is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and refractory arrhythmia in Noonan syndrome.\n    \n*   The combination of amiodarone and flecainide was effective in life-threatening arrhythmias in an infant.\n    \n*   It is important to choose the best combination of antiarrhythmic drugs with the balance of the effects and the patients’ conditions.\n    \n\n【40】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【41】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【42】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).\n\n【43】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【44】We would like to thank Editage (www.editage.com) for English language editing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Her vital signs were normal, and a physical examination revealed pain on compressing the periumbilical area. There were no peritoneal signs.

Based on these findings, intussusception secondary to pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) was diagnosed. The patient successfully underwent radiological hydrostatic reduction. An abdominal radiograph taken 7 hours after the reduction revealed multiple, colonic cysts mainly in the caecum ( figure 3 ).

The most common age range at presentation is 3 months to 36 months. 2 If intussusception develops in a patient outside this age range, a pathological lesion should be sought as the lead point. In our patient, PCI developing in the caecum acted as the lead point, telescoping the caecum into the transverse colon. Although most PCI cases can be managed conservatively, complications, including intussusception, are sometimes known to occur. 3\n\n【20】In the present case, abdominal radiography played a major role in diagnosing intussusception because the intramural air in the large intestine hampered ultrasonographic evaluation. On abdominal radiograph, delineation of the tip of the intussusceptum outlined by the intestinal air within the intussuscipiens is called the meniscus sign, which is known to be highly specific to ileocecal intussusception. 4 Although the air within the transverse colon was not seen on abdominal radiograph in our patient, intramural air in the inverted caecum outlined the crescent-shaped contour of the intussusceptum, leading to the suspicion of intussusception. In patients with PCI, a crescent-like distribution of cysts on an abdominal radiograph may serve as an important clue to detecting this complication.\n\n【21】### Learning points\n\n【22】*   Intussusception is a rare complication of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis.\n    \n*   Since ultrasonographic evaluation could be hampered by intramural air, an abdominal radiography may serve as an important clue to detecting intussusception in patients with pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis.\n    \n\n【23】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【24】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【25】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Patients have typically stable serostatus; that is, patients who are positive for one or more of these autoantibodies tend to remain thus and vice versa. We describe a rare instance where a woman in her 50s was diagnosed with primary SS and developed new autoantibodies subsequently through serological epitope spreading. She demonstrated primarily glandular features only and clinical stability despite serological evolution.

While these SS-associated autoantibodies are generally stable in patients, we discuss a rare instance of a patient who develops autoantibodies subsequent to diagnosis in an act of intermolecular epitope spreading.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A woman in her 50s was referred to the immunology clinics following the finding of a high-titred antinuclear antibody (ANA) test (speckled > 1:2560) in the context of recurrent thromboembolic events. Her background history included recurrent provoked and unprovoked deep vein thromboses on rivaroxaban, a left middle cerebral artery stroke on aspirin and rosuvastatin, and being a lifelong non-smoker. There is no family history of autoimmune disorders.\n\n【14】On further history, she described several years of a dry mouth complicated by severe dental caries and occasional dry eyes necessitating the use of daily lubricating eye drops. She complained of some global alopecia but no fatigue, arthralgias, salivary gland swellings, cutaneous lesions, oral/nasal ulcers, neuropathic symptoms, Raynaud’s, psychiatric or constitutional symptoms.\n\n【15】On examination, she was normotensive. There was no appreciable synovitis in her hands. Her cardiorespiratory examination was unremarkable. She had slightly prominent and non-tender parotid glands but no adenopathy. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Schirmer’s test in unanaesthetised eyes after 5 min was 10 mm and 5 mm in the right and left eyes, respectively.\n\n【16】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【17】Key investigations revealed anti-Ro52 autoantibody without anti-Ro60/La, normal C3/C4 complements, anti-double-stranded DNA not detected, no detectable rheumatoid factor, mild lymphopaenia (0.9×10 <sup>6 </sup> /L), normal biochemistry and HIV was not detected. Prothrombotic screens including antiphospholipid antibodies were unremarkable. Targeted human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II phenotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific oligonucleotide (PCR-SSO) typing ( online supplemental table 1 ). Our patient did not receive a minor salivary gland biopsy.\n\n【18】### Supplemental material\n\n【19】\\[bcr-2023-254632supp001.pdf\\]\n\n【20】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【21】Our patient was formally diagnosed with primary SS as per American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) criteria. 2 Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily was introduced as an immunmodulating agent; however, she self-ceased this after several weeks as found it not helpful to her situation. Three years after diagnosis, repeat serology revealed the development of new autoantibodies to Ro60 and La; yet, her clinical course remained relatively stable to that date ( figure 1 ). This was assessed by the EULAR SS disease activity index (ESSDAI). At a further 3 years, despite the previous serological evolution, she still remained clinically stable ( figure 1 ). She did not display any new features of serological evolution with a persistently high-titred ANA (>1:2560 speckled across the 3 years), no other new antiextractable nuclear antigens or rheumatoid factors \\[RhF\\], and relatively stable total IgG level ranging from 11.5 to 11.9 g/L (< 15.6).\n\n【22】<img/>\n\n【23】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【24】Figure 1\n\n【25】Longitudinal serological profiles and corresponding European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) Sjögren’s syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI).

Original figure created by author Lee.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】Autoantibodies are the archetypal autoimmune biomarkers for systemic autoimmune disorders like SS. For the latter, they form part of the diagnostic criteria making them important laboratory parameters for the disease. 2 IgG antibodies towards the Ro/La RNP complex (anti-Ro52/anti-Ro60 and anti-La) can be found in up to 73% and 45% of cases, respectively, in large cohort studies. 3 The Ro/La RNP complex is a cytoplasmic conglomeration of non-coding RNAs (Y RNAs) and several proteins including Ro52, Ro60 and La, to which autoantibodies are commonly found towards in diseases like SS and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 4\n\n【28】In the diagnostic laboratory, these autoantibodies may be measured by line immunoassays and (ELISAs). Other key autoantibodies that are usually measured, but not part of the latest diagnostic criteria, include the ANA test and RhF. These are positive in 79% and 49% of patients, respectively; however, these are not specific for SS. 3 The ANA is commonly measured by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on the HEp-2 substrate (or variations thereof). Positivity rate is dependent on the laboratory’s dilution cut-off and the definition of ‘nuclear’ staining. In around 15% of SS patients, these autoantibodies are not detectable 5 and are termed seronegative SS, requiring other supportive evidence—such as minor salivary gland biopsies—to diagnose SS. Seronegative SS patients may also be positive for novel autoantibodies that are not routinely measured in the diagnostic laboratory, including antisalivary protein 1 and antiparotid secretory protein. 6 These autoantibodies are thought to be early autoantibodies and typically appear before the anti-Ro/La autoantibodies. Other novel, specific autoantibodies, such as antienolase, are associated with severe pathologies or end-organ manifestations and therefore may be helpful in identifying subsets of patients. 6\n\n【29】Ro/La autoantibodies are thought to be persistent from long-lived memory B-cell responses. 7 8 Despite minor fluctuating titres of autoantibodies, the Ro52/Ro60 autoantibodies in SS tend to persist and once positive, remains so. 9 10 Likewise, it is unusual to develop new autoantibodies such as anti-Ro60 in patients tracked longitudinally. 11 This points to an immune response and autoantibodies that is likely ‘hard-wired’ and reliant on adaptive memory responses.\n\n【30】However, what occurs in human disease is in stark contrast to experimental mice models that show spontaneous and rapid epitope spreading of autoantibodies from Ro52 to Ro60 and La autoantigens after immunisation. 12 13 To our knowledge, no other case of SS in the literature has documented the epitope spreading of Ro52 to Ro60 and La. In spite of the immunological maturation, this did not coincide with an appreciable evolution of her disease with relatively stable EULAR SS disease activity indices (ESSDAI) throughout the last few years of observation ( figure 1 ).\n\n【31】It is also conceivable that other SS patients follow a similar trajectory yet be overlooked in the clinic as they may not have had autoantibodies serially tested. Serial autoantibody (antiextractable nuclear antigen) testing is currently dissuaded as there is little clinical benefit and it is costly. 14 Furthermore, Ro/La autoantibodies may appear many years before the onset of clinical symptoms and diagnosis in SS. 15 Thus, epitope spreading and development of autoantibodies at the start of failed immunological tolerance may be occurring in this predisease phase which may continue in the symptomatic phase. As support for this theory, SS patients who also have more Ro/La autoantibodies also tend to have autoantibodies of other specificities and higher ANA titres, indicating likely antigen epitope spreading. 16\n\n【32】One factor that may influence the tendency to develop autoantibodies is the patient’s HLA genotype. Interestingly, our patient did not harbour any recognised SS HLA class II risk alleles ( online supplemental table 1 ), particularly HLA-DRB1\\*0301. 17 These HLA risk alleles are also associated with SS patients that tend to have greater serological activity and epitope spread to Ro/La autoantigens, as opposed to remain singularly positive for anti-Ro52 or anti-Ro60. 18 19 At a pathophysiological level, these risk HLA alleles probably relate to the T cells’ abilities to recognise and engage in Ro/La autoantigens. 19 This is supported in part by the recent observations of a higher diversity of T cell clonotypes associated with Ro/La positivity in SS patients. 20\n\n【33】The natural molecular evolution and the pathogenesis of autoantibodies is still poorly understood. It is conceivable that dying or apoptotic cells cause the exposure of these RNP autoantigens. 21 The defective clearance of these cells and autoantigens coupled with other stimulatory factors such as Toll-like receptor signalling contributes to the autoantibody pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. 22 In addition, molecular mimicry between pathogens and these autoantigens may provide a mechanism for the development of autoantibodies and in SLE, it is hypothesised that key cross-reactive, ‘driving’ epitope sequences, to which autoantibodies appear early to, can help promote diversification of the immune response. 23\n\n【34】Autoantibodies may hold prognostic information in SS. Seropositive SS patients with anti-Ro/La autoantibodies are more likely to be younger and develop extraglandular manifestations including haematological, neurological and immunological complications. 24 25 Although isolated anti-Ro52 SS patients have rarely been studied, a recent study found that patients with isolated anti-Ro52 (which was initially the case for our patient) may represent a severe subset of SS patients with higher disease activity over patients with additional autoantibodies. 26 Among seropositive SS patients, those with isolated anti-Ro52 are rarer (around 11%) compared with those with anti-Ro60 and/or anti-La. Anti-Ro52 autoantibodies are found in a range of autoimmune diseases (38% in a diagnostic laboratory cohort) and non-autoimmune diseases such as malignancies and interstitial lung disease (ILD). 27 By themselves, the autoantibodies are non-specific; yet hold distinct clinical utility from anti-Ro60, warranting separating detection in the diagnostic laboratory. 28 One recognised utility for anti-Ro52 is in the identification of ILD patients that have poorer prognoses over anti-Ro52-negative patients. 29\n\n【35】These observations support the accurate serological phenotyping of patients with SS. Whether there is clinical benefit to periodic monitoring of autoantibodies to the Ro/La RNP remains to be decided in longitudinal studies. Although autoantibody titres may fluctuate longitudinally, it is rare for there to be the acquisition or loss of a particular autoantibody. 7 11 30 It may not be unreasonable, however, to consider rechecking these Ro/La autoantibodies if there has been a clinical change; for example, if the patient has developed features of a secondary autoimmune disorder. In our department, rechecking of autoantibodies are variable, are clinician-dependent and may occur every 6–12 months at their regular follow-up, or only once at baseline.\n\n【36】In brief, we describe an interesting case of clinically stable SS despite molecular evolution. Given that serological manifestations including autoantibodies may precede the onset of clinical features and SS diagnosis by many years and appear in otherwise healthy individuals, 15 31 it is reasonable for us to continue periodically monitoring the patient to check for the development of severe extraglandular manifestations. However, SS is a disease that generally sees clinical stability in longitudinal studies, 1 providing some reassurance. Autoantibody profiles tend to also remain very stable and to our knowledge, we provide the first described instance of an SS patient longitudinally developing new autoantibodies to the Ro/La RNP complex. It is possible that we have captured the early stages of our patient’s disease. Future studies are required to unearth the origins and mechanisms of autoantibodies and epitope spreading, as this will likely lead to insights into the immunopathogenesis of autoimmunity and possible targeted therapeutics.\n\n【37】### Learning points\n\n【38】*   Autoantibodies are key by-products of failed immune tolerance in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS).\n    \n*   The serostatus (detected/not detected) of autoantibodies to ribonucleoproteins tend to remain stable longitudinally and yield prognostic clinical information.\n    \n*   Further research to unearth the origins and mechanisms of failed humoral tolerance and hence, the development of autoantibodies, will be instrumental in developing appropriate, targeted therapies in SS.\n    \n\n【39】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【40】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【41】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

This tumour type is most frequently found in skin, subcutaneous tissue and oral cavity, mostly in black middle-aged women. 1 This lesion type can involve any organ, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The appendicular involvement though is extremely rare.\n\n【5】We report a case of a pregnant female patient in her early 30s who went to the emergency department after 2 days of enduring persistent pelvic pain. The blood tests indicated leucocytosis, neutrophilia and elevated C reactive protein concentration.\n\n【6】Abdominal ultrasound examination revealed an outer appendiceal diameter of 8 mm, with a markedly thickened and stratified wall. The increased density of the surrounding fat tissue was consistent with phlegmon.\n\n【7】A laparoscopic appendectomy was performed.\n\n【8】Careful gross examination showed that the appendix was increased in size, the appendiceal wall was markedly thickened and the lumen filled with faecal material.\n\n【9】The complete histological analysis of the specimen revealed a well-circumscribed and unencapsulated nodule with 0.5 cm in diameter confined to the submucosa. There was also a florid granulomatous chronic inflammation measuring 1.2 cm extending to the tip of the appendix (as shown in figure 1A ). This granulomatous inflammation was located in the wall and involved its entire thickness, except the overlying mucosa. The multiple, coalescent microgranulomas (non-necrosing granulomas) were composed only of epithelioid histiocytes. The authors want to emphasise that there was no clinical or imaging procedure of the thorax, which may constitute evidence for tuberculosis diagnosis. The surrounding tissues showed reactive and hyperplastic mucosa, with no atrophy.

We describe a case of _M. hominis_ pneumonia in an immunocompetent man in his early 40s without any risk factors presenting with a cavitary lesion who developed empyema and necrotising pneumonia requiring surgical debridement. Identification of _M. hominis_ and subsequent modification of antibiotic therapy led to favourable outcome. _M. hominis_ should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with treatment resistant pneumonia especially in patients with trauma, intracranial injury, lung transplant or if immunocompromised. While _M.

Among cited infections of the respiratory tract, many of the reports are in patients with manipulation of the urogenital tract, concurrent trauma, intracranial injury, transplant patients or otherwise immunocompromised patients. 1–6 Outside of the respiratory tract, _M. hominis_ has been implicated in cases of mediastinitis, meningitis, joint infection and endocarditis. 7–11\n\n【10】_M. hominis_ is a common coloniser of the urogenital tract where it was originally discovered along with other genital mycoplasmas such as _Ureaplasma urealyticum_ . 12 _M. hominis_ can be found in the urogenital tract of up to 53% of sexually active asymptomatic women, with slightly less incidence in men. 13 While these organisms are thought to be commensal colonisers, they have been implicated in infections of the urogenital tract, pregnancy complications, neonatal infections and infertility. 14–17\n\n【11】_M. hominis_ may often go under recognised as a cause of infection due to its fastidious growth requirements, difficulty growing and being recognised using standard blood culture methods, or the difficulty to see the colonies it forms on standard cell culture. 2 3 12 18 While culture remains the gold standard for identification and is important for susceptibility testing, PCR methods have also been used to identify cases.\n\n【12】As mycoplasma species do not have a cell wall, they are inherently resistant to antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis such as beta-lactams, cephalosporins and glycopeptides. _M. hominis_ also demonstrates resistance to commonly used macrolides such as erythromycin but is generally susceptible to fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines, although some resistance to different agents has been noted. 19–21\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A man in his early 40s presented with 5 days of worsening fever, body aches, sore throat, shortness of breath and productive cough with accompanying pleuritic pain. He was hypotensive and tachycardic. He had increased work of breathing with diminished lung sounds in the right lung field. He had leucocytosis of 13.6/mm <sup>3 </sup> (normal range 4–11/mm <sup>3 </sup> ) and neutrophil count of 12.7/mm <sup>3 </sup> , and procalcitonin was elevated to 9.46 ng/mL (normal range <0.05 ng/mL). Chest radiograph (CXR) and CT imaging of the chest revealed a mass-like 5.2 cm cavitary lesion in right upper lobe, left lower lobe consolidation and small left pleural effusion ( figure 1 ). SARs CoV-2 testing was negative via nasopharyngeal PCR swab, and there were no sick contacts. He had a history of well-controlled asthma on combination long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch for weight loss 14 years prior, and was on emtricitabine-tenofovir for pre-exposure prophylaxis.\n\n【15】<img/>\n\n【16】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【17】Figure 1\n\n【18】(A and B) The chest radiograph at time of initial presentation (A) demonstrating the cavitary mass in the right upper lobe measuring about 5.2 cm in diameter, left lower lobe consolidation and small left pleural effusion. CT imaging of the chest (B) confirming cavitary lesion. Official read also commented on mass-like nature of the lesion and elevated concern for likely atypical infectious or inflammatory aetiology.\n\n【19】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【20】Initial infectious work up included strep swab and throat culture, HIV testing, blood cultures, _Legionella_ urine antigen and _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ urine antigen which were all negative. Infectious disease was consulted and recommended further investigation with _cryptococcus_ blood antigen, _histoplasma_ urine antigen, sputum culture and PCR testing for respiratory viruses and bacteria, (1,3)-β-D-Glucan and _Aspergillus Galactomannan_ antigen which were all subsequently negative. Over the subsequent days, the patient had clinical improvement with decreased oxygen needs, symptomatic improvement and decreased procalcitonin to 2.18 ng/mL. While bronchoscopy was considered, this was not pursued at initial presentation due to his improving clinical course. Ammonia level, zinc or selenium were not checked throughout the evaluation.\n\n【21】Nine days following his initial presentation, he was found to be hypotensive with diminished left lung sounds despite lack of symptoms while receiving his daily antibiotic infusion at an outpatient infusion centre. On evaluation in the emergency department with this second presentation, there was a new leucocytosis of 19.5/mm <sup>3 </sup> , and CXR was notable for large left hydropneumothorax with signs of tension ( figure 2 ).\n\n【22】<img/>\n\n【23】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【24】Figure 2\n\n【25】(A–D) Chest radiograph at time of readmission (A and B) demonstrates large left hydropneumothorax with evidence of tension demonstrated by midline shift and also persistence of right upper lobe cavitary lesion. CT of the chest obtained at the time (C and D) of readmission demonstrating increase in cavitary lesion size, multifocal opacities, subcutaneous emphysema, chest tube and mediastinal gas at various levels.\n\n【26】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【27】Two cultures from pleural fluid were collected at the time of his second presentation. One noted growth of _M. hominis_ in the thioglycolate broth only and was reported out by the lab 5 days after chest tube placement. Blood cultures remained negative. Fungal cultures, silver stain and cytology performed on pleural fluid also remained negative. Sputum cultures with acid-fast bacilli with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ DNA direct probe PCR were all negative. Serum IgG, IgA and IgM were all within normal limits.\n\n【28】Treatment\n---------\n\n【29】He was initially treated empirically with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. Following improvement during initial presentation, antibiotics were transitioned to intravenous ceftriaxone and oral metronidazole with a plan to complete 4 weeks of this therapy outpatient and repeat imaging towards the end of this course. At initial discharge, he was noted to have cavitary lesions without empyema and did not have any indication for surgical treatment.\n\n【30】Following chest tube placement at second presentation, 2 L of purulent material were drained. CT imaging at this time again demonstrated mass-like cavitary lesion in right lung in addition to an interval increase is opacities of the left upper and lower lobe, significant bilateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema likely secondary to chest tube placement and mediastinal gas on the right. Antibiotic therapy was broadened to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at this point. Following clinical improvement, he was transitioned to vancomycin and cefepime and later restarted on intravenous ceftriaxone and oral metronidazole. Identification of _M. hominis_ from pleural fluid prompted addition of oral doxycycline 100 mg two times per day to the antibiotic regimen.\n\n【31】Repeat CT imaging 1 week into this hospitalisation showed some improvements in pneumomediastinum, noted stable cavitary areas and raised new concerns for bronchopleural fistula due to subcutaneous gas with possible signs of infection. Thoracic surgery was consulted with consideration of video-assisted thoracoscopic decortication.\n\n【32】Initial findings in the operating room included a large chest wall abscess under serratus anterior muscle, necrosis of serratus and intercostal muscles as well as the overlying fascia, loculated pleural effusions, dense adhesions with thick pleural rind and other purulent material. This was debrided and irrigated extensively before the wound was packed. No clear sign of bronchopulmonary fistula was noted during initial decortication. The patient would require two more trips to the operating room for irrigation, debridement, and finally wound vac placement.\n\n【33】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【34】Due to concern for possible tetracycline resistance and with _M. hominis_ susceptibility testing still pending at an outside lab, the patient was discharged on a 6-week course of oral levofloxacin to cover _M. hominis_ and oral metronidazole for empiric anaerobic coverage. Susceptibility testing at an outside laboratory did demonstrate susceptibility to clindamycin, tetracycline and levofloxacin. Follow-up imaging demonstrated resolution of the hydropneumothorax.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】We have described a case of _M. hominis_ pneumonia presenting with a cavitary lesion and progressing to empyema and necrotising pneumonia in an immunocompetent adult without clear risk factors. While _M. hominis_ has been noted to cause severe disease with progression to necrotising pneumonia, it has not been associated with cavitary lesions previously. Our case also reinforces challenges noted in similar cases in that empiric antibiotics commonly used to treat pneumonia are ineffective against _M. hominis_ , identification can be difficult as it is a fastidious and slow-growing organism, and recovery can depend on transition to appropriate antibiotic therapy. We feel that the unique aspects of this case add to previously reported cases of _M. hominis_ pneumonia in immunocompetent patients.\n\n【37】Identification of the organism is a crucial step in the clinical course of patients with _M. hominis_ so that appropriate modifications to therapy can be made. _M. hominis_ can be lysed or killed by saline, the wooden shaft of collection swabs or sodium polyanethol sulfonate found in blood culture bottles. 2 12 _M. hominis_ has also been noted to not cause visible change in blood culture bottles or turbidity due to its small size 12 22 and may require subculture for detection as was done in two of the cases reviewed. 2 6 The colonies that grow on agar are also small with a classically described ‘fried-egg’ appearance due to the clear pinpoint centre and translucent surrounding which can be difficult to identify with the naked eye. 2 23 Despite this, culture remains the gold standard for identification of _M. hominis_ as it can help guide therapy with susceptibilities, with increasing resistance to antibiotics typically used to treat. Similar to other cases, _M. hominis_ was not identified in our case until 14 days after his initial presentation and 5 days after chest tube placement and drainage of a pulmonary empyema.\n\n【38】PCR methods, usually targeting 16S rRNA, can also be used to identify _M. hominis_ . 13 In one of the cases reviewed, eubacterial PCR was used to identify the organism, and culture was later used to yield susceptibilities. 5 Identification with PCR may be less useful to demonstrate clinically significant disease in the urogenital tract as it is a commensal organism commonly found there but could be more useful in extragenital locations.\n\n【39】The biology of _M. hominis_ informs antibiotic treatment and its inherent resistance to numerous classes of antibiotics. As _Mycoplasma_ species lack a cell wall, they are naturally resistant to therapies that target peptidoglycan synthesis such as cephalosporins, beta-lactams and glycopeptides as well as demonstrating resistance to other classes of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides, sulfonamides and trimethoprim. 22 Unlike _M. pneumoniae_ , _M. hominis_ exhibits resistance to commonly used macrolides such as azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin. 6 20 21 The most commonly recommended antibiotics for treatment of _M. hominis_ include tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and clindamycin.\n\n【40】Early case reports have expressed concern about increasing resistance to tetracycline in association with the tetracycline-resistant element (tetM). 19 20 Resistance to tetracycline seems widely variable based on geography with some areas of the USA having tetracycline resistance as high as 50%, and there is susceptibility to doxycycline even in stains resistant to tetracycline. 12 24 Fluoroquinolones have been cited as better treatment options with lower resistance rates, except in China. Resistance to fluoroquinolones is due to changes in quinolone resistance-determining regions which are coding regions for DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV, the drug targets. 25 Two studies demonstrating the high rates of fluoroquinolone resistance in China reported 52/57 and 11/13 of _M. hominis_ samples were resistant, with comparisons showing higher resistance to ciprofloxacin over levofloxacin. 25 26\n\n【41】In Samra _et al_ , looking at rates of resistance in _M. hominis_ samples in Israel found 9/110 resistant to doxycycline with higher resistance to tetracycline, while noting none of the samples had resistance to levofloxacin. 21 In Krausse _et al_ , 290 _M_ . _hominis_ and _Ureaplasma_ samples collected over a 20-year period in Germany found doxycycline to be most effective against both but noted 10% of _M. hominis_ samples were resistant to doxycycline. Of these samples, 7.9% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and less than 2% were resistant to oxfloxacin. 27 Finally, in Morris _et al_ , when using international set thresholds by Clinical Laboratory Science Institute, only 1/100 of collected samples from Wales demonstrated resistance to tetracycline, while 0/100 demonstrated levofloxacin resistance. 21 28 Clindamycin is also commonly used and effective, which may present great option for neonatal or perinatal infections. 19\n\n【42】Our review of previous case series and case reports of _M. hominis_ pneumonia in immunocompetent patients yielded 14 patients spanning three decades. 1–6 22 29 30 Among the four patients who died, none of them had modification of therapy, although one patient from Garcia _et al_ withdrew due to worsening of illness and significant comorbidity. 2 4 30 Two of the earlier cases recovered despite no change in therapy or the inadequate change to erythromycin. 6 22 Other patients were noted to have significant improvement after identification of _M. hominis_ and transition to a fluoroquinolone and/or tetracycline antibiotic. Common associations or risk factors identified in some of these patients included two patients with pneumonia in the peripartum period 1 29 and five patients who suffered trauma or closed head injury. 3 4 6 30 Four cases also identified co-infection with another bacterial source. 1 4 22 30\n\n【43】Many of the other various extragenital infections had found a large proportion of cases involve immunocompromised patients or transplant patients emphasising lower cell-mediated immunity and hypogammaglobulinaemia. 31 _M_ . _hominis_ and _U. urealyticum_ have been implicated as possible aetiology of non-hepatic hyperammonemia which should prompt antibiotic coverage of these organisms in such cases to prevent further complications. 32 Our patient did not have any immunoglobulin deficiencies identified. _M. hominis_ can also progress to very severe illness such as other reviewed cases in which patients developed empyema requiring drainage with chest tube, but other cases did not describe the extent of surgical intervention required in this case.\n\n【44】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【45】Our patient added with his consent form, ‘Thanks so much again for all you did to help me get better!’\n\n【46】### Learning points\n\n【47】*   This case demonstrates that _Mycoplasma hominis_ can cause severe respiratory infection and cavitary lesion in an immunocompetent adult despite lack of previously identified risk factors.\n    \n*   _M. hominis_ should be considered on the differential of patients with treatment resistant pneumonia or other infection especially in patients with trauma, intracranial injury, lung transplant or if immunocompromised.\n    \n*   Institutions should consider availability of PCR testing for _M. hominis_ or broader eubacterial PCR testing to help identify offending organisms quickly.\n    \n*   Cultures should be collected for further use in monitoring susceptibility patterns with increase in resistance to tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones.\n    \n*   We recommend levofloxacin or other fluoroquinolone to most effectively treat, while doxycycline would be a potential alternative.\n    \n\n【48】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【49】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【50】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【51】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【52】We would like to thank our patient for allowing us to present this case.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Two weeks prior, a respiratory tract infection left him bedbound with progressive pain during ambulation. The patient denied the history of thromboembolic phenomena, clotting disorders, stroke or MI. His only symptoms were fatigue, poor appetite and leg pain. He specifically denied chest pain, palpitations, dyspnoea, weight loss and bleeding.\n\n【6】On presentation, he was tachycardic. His blood pressure was 150/70 mm Hg. Physical examination of the lower extremities revealed grossly intact sensory and motor function bilaterally but absent dorsalis pedis on the right and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally with impending gangrene of all toes. ECG revealed non-specific anterolateral ST elevations. This prompted point-of-care echocardiogram which demonstrated biventricular thrombi and an LV ejection fraction estimated at <20%. These findings were confirmed by a formal echocardiogram ( figures 1 and 2 ). Contrast-enhanced chest CT was performed which confirmed pulmonary embolism along with large-volume biventricular thrombi ( figure 3A,B ).\n\n【7】<img/>\n\n【8】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【9】Figure 1\n\n【10】Transthoracic echocardiography without contrast demonstrating large-volume biventricular thrombi.

High-sensitivity troponin rose from 29 to 33 ng/L. HIV and coagulopathy testing, including lupus anticoagulant, protein C, protein S and cardiolipin all returned negative.\n\n【20】For subacute bilateral limb ischaemia without Doppler-detectable pulses below the right posterior tibial artery, the vascular surgery team attempted catheter-directed tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that ultimately proved unsuccessful. Cardiac surgery to remove the ventricular thrombi was determined to be risk-prohibitive in the setting of evolving heart failure.\n\n【21】The patient subsequently developed an acute anterior ST-elevation MI complicated by ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest. Cardiac catheterisation revealed an organised thrombus in the left anterior descending artery, indicating a chronic occlusion of days to weeks. Following shared decision-making with the patient’s family, he was made comfort care. He expired 7 days after the initial presentation from VT.\n\n【22】The aetiology of biventricular thrombi is possibly myocarditis from an infection leading to cardiomyopathy and stasis of ventricular blood. Silent MI from the LV thrombus caused the ST elevations on presentation, leading to progressive myocardial ischaemia and cardiac arrest. Further decompensation resulted from peripheral arterial emboli, multiterritory cerebral infarcts and pulmonary embolism. This case highlights the role of point-of-care echocardiography as a quick tool to detect biventricular thrombi. The case also demonstrates multiple devastating complications in the same patient.\n\n【23】### Learning points\n\n【24】*   Point-of-care transthoracic echocardiography is a quick and easy modality for ventricular thrombus detection that can guide management and expedite treatment in acute settings.\n    \n*   Ventricular thrombi are associated with a wide spectrum of complications including myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial embolism, stroke and pulmonary embolism.\n    \n*   The differential diagnosis for the aetiology of biventricular thrombi includes hypereosinophilic syndromes, restrictive cardiomyopathy, viral infections, myocardial infarction and endomyocardial fibroelastosis.\n    \n\n【25】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【26】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【27】Next of kin consent obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 1.78 logMAR in the right eye and 0 logMAR in the left eye. Cycloplegic retinoscopy revealed a refractive error of a −15 dioptre sphere with a −3.5 dioptre cylinder at 180° in the right eye. The patient had right exotropia of 10 prism diopters on modified Krimsky’s test with full extraocular motility. He had no stereopsis and demonstrated right eye suppression on sensory examination. Dilated fundus examination was performed, which showed the presence of a myelinated retinal nerve fibre layer in the right eye along the superior and inferior temporal arcades covering the whole posterior pole with a dull foveal reflex ( figure 1A ). The left eye fundus was normal ( figure 1B ). The axial length of the right eye was 27.60 mm and that of the left eye was 22.07 mm. Optical coherence tomography was performed, which depicted parafoveal hyper-reflective retinal nerve fibre layer in the right eye and left eye was normal ( figure 2 ). An optical correction was prescribed in the form of a contact lens in the right eye and occlusion therapy was given in the left eye. There was no improvement in the visual acuity after 6 months of amblyopia treatment and the patient was explained about the possible need for strabismus surgery in the future. Straatsma syndrome is defined as myelinated nerve fibre with myopia and amblyopia. 1 Myelination of the optic nerve begins from the lamina cribrosa and the lamina cribrosa acts as a barrier at term. Defects in the lamina cribrosa or ectopic oligodendrocyte progenitor cells lead to the myelinated retinal nerve fibre layer. 2 Amblyopia, if detected early in life, can be treated with good visual outcomes. 3 4\n\n【5】<img/>\n\n【6】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【7】Figure 1\n\n【8】(A) Fundus photo of the right eye showing extensive myelination of the retinal nerve fibre layer.

The paramedics found the patient somnolent with systolic blood pressure 110 mm Hg, heart rate 130 bpm, oxygen saturation 79% with notable cyanosis and diaphoresis. EMS reported a scale and white powder at the scene. He was intubated after a tonic-clonic seizure, developed ventricular fibrillation, defibrillated at 200 J, and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) was initiated as the cardiac rhythm degraded to pulseless electrical activity. Intravenous medications administered included 2.5 mg epinephrine 1:10 000, 1 g calcium chloride, 100 mEq sodium bicarbonate 8.4% and 5 g hydroxocobalamin.\n\n【5】The patient was transported to the emergency department (ED) with ongoing CPR. On hospital arrival in the ambulance bay, the paramedics were given 100 mg methylene blue to administer intravenously as they did not have the antidote in their ambulance. During the primary survey in the ED, he was in asystole, with end-tidal CO <sub>2 </sub> 12 mm Hg and blue-grey discolouration of the skin. The patient received intravenous 2 mg epinephrine, 1 g calcium chloride, 50 mEq sodium bicarbonate 8.4%, 50 mg methylene blue and 125 mL intralipid. Arterial blood gas was obtained with notable brown-black appearance ( figure 1 ) and pH 7.03, PCO <sub>2 </sub> 87 mm Hg, PaO <sub>2 </sub> 2 mm Hg, bicarbonate 22 mmol/L, lactate 30 mmol/L. The haemoglobin was 12.4 g/dL with 28.8% methaemoglobin (reference range 0.4%–1.5%). Resuscitation was ceased 50 min after the initial arrest. Postmortem-combined nitrate and nitrite level was 5300 µmol/L (reference range 0–53) and autopsy revealed brown discolouration of muscle tissue consistent with methaemoglobinemia ( figure 2 ).\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】Arterial blood gas syringe containing brown-black blood seen in methaemoglobinemia.\n\n【10】<img/>\n\n【11】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【12】Figure 2\n\n【13】Brown discolouration of muscle tissue from fatal sodium nitrite exposure on left, compared with normal muscle appearance on right.\n\n【14】Sodium nitrite is commonly used in food preservation and in treating cyanide toxicity. It is a powerful oxidative agent, which oxidises haemoglobin to methaemoglobin, reducing oxygen carrying capacity of erythrocytes and causing tissue hypoxia. 1 2 Clinical manifestations of sodium nitrite toxicity include hypotension, hypoxemia, encephalopathy, dysrhythmia and cardiac arrest. 1 3 Chocolate-coloured blood may be noted during intravenous access and phlebotomy. Arterial blood gas measurements may show a normal PaO <sub>2 </sub> due to electrochemical measurement of dissolved oxygen in blood, rather than the oxygen associated with haemoglobin, although co-oximetry will yield an elevated methaemoglobin concentration. 1 Hydroxocobalamin administration, which was given by EMS for possible cyanide toxicity, may have interfered with co-oximetry testing given its strong colour and absorbance. Despite this, the diagnosis is clear when considering the initial patient report of sodium nitrite ingestion, his clinical presentation, profound acidaemia and nitrite test results. 4\n\n【15】Methylene blue is the mainstay of treatment for methaemoglobinemia and is dosed 1–2 mg/kg, infused over 5 min and can be repeated if symptoms persist. 1 Methylene blue is a catalyst for reducing methaemoglobin to haemoglobin within erythrocytes, via the enzyme NADPH-methaemoglobin reductase ( figure 3 ). 2 Additional treatment approaches include ascorbic acid, hyperbaric oxygen, exchange transfusion and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 3 5\n\n【16】<img/>\n\n【17】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【18】Figure 3\n\n【19】Reduction of methaemoglobin to haemoglobin via the primary pathway, catalysed by cytochrome-B5 reductase (below), in contrast to the methylene blue-dependent alternative pathway via NADPH-methaemoglobin reductase (above).

The anterior and posterior pituitary glands have different embryological origins (the oral ectoderm and the neural ectoderm, respectively). This cleft (a remnant of the embryonic Rathke’s pouch) is usually obliterated in a lot of individuals. There is a rare possibility of the intervening Rathke’s cleft developing a cyst(s). Rathke’s cleft cyst (RCCs), depending on size, are usually largely asymptomatic. 1 There is increasing documentation of RCC with incidental, concurrent or onward findings of pituitary adenomas in the body of medical literature. Whether this association is an incidental one or whether there is a causative relationship between these two entities remains to be fully explored. 2\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A middle-aged woman presented at the emergency department with a 3-day history of frontal headache and over the left side of her face, of gradual onset, constant and rated 7/10 in severity at presentation. She had reported recurrent similar headaches within the preceding year. She reported normal vision at the time of review but reported having recurrent intermittent blurred vision and dizziness. She reported no recent head trauma and had not noticed any changes to visual fields. She reported no nausea or vomiting. No weakness/numbness in limbs was reported.\n\n【12】She reported swollen feet and hands and her wedding ring does not fit anymore. She had noticed an increase in her shoe size and had increased gaps between teeth. She reported a gradual weight gain and weighed 95 kg (but usually had been around 80 kg). The patient had undergone a tympanoplasty 5 years prior. Her other medical history also includes bilateral otosclerosis, uses hearing aid and tinnitus masker.\n\n【13】On examination, a coarse facial, frontal bossing and proximal myopathy was noted. Blood pressure 144/79 with a pulse rate of 97 beats per minute and height of 173 cm. Her chest was clear to auscultation. Her abdomen was soft, with no palpable organomegaly or localised swelling. She had a 5/5 power throughout, normal sensations globally. Right pupil size was 5 mm and left pupil was 4 mm in diameter.There was normal pupillary reaction to light bilaterally. Cranial nerves examination, including visual field assessment, were normal bilaterally. She had no cerebrospinal fluid leak through the nose. She had no hearing loss or facial weakness. She had no evidence of abnormal fine limb movements. She had no evidence of abnormal gait. No evidence of base skull fracture or dysphasia was noted. She had no evidence of injury to the neck, no inappropriate or abnormal behaviour and no loss of vision.\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】She was reviewed at an ear, nose and throat clinic a year prior for vertigo and otalgia. MRI head done on recommendation by the ears, nose and throat team showed possible trigeminal nerve irritation and an incidental finding of a RCC. A pituitary and an internal acoustic meatus MRI scan with contrast done 3 months afterward showed a 6.5×9 mm non-enhancing cyst in the pituitary sella (see figure 1 ), which appeared to be displacing the normal pituitary tissue superiorly and slightly posteriorly. There was no visible pituitary adenoma on the MRI sections. There was no supra or parasellar extension. The optic chiasm was preserved. The pituitary stalk was not deviated and showed normal enhancement post-contrast. No space-occupying lesion, infarction, mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalous was seen. The cisternal spaces were clear and the grey-white matter interface preserved. No abnormal enhancement following intravenous contrast. Scattered high signal white matter foci were seen and were thought to be most attributable to a low burden of ischaemic small vessel disease. The seventh and eighth cranial nerves had a normal appearance bilaterally with no evidence of an internal acoustic meatus or cerebellopontine angle mass lesion. The internal ear structures appeared intact.\n\n【16】<img/>\n\n【17】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【18】Figure 1\n\n【19】Showing a sagittal section of a contrast MRI pituitary scan in patient demonstrating the Rathke’s cleft cyst and displaced pituitary tissue.\n\n【20】Pituitary hormones profile study done 8 months to this case submission showed only elevated insulin-like growth factor at 43.3 nmol/L (reference range 6.2–24 nmol/L) and a repeated check 2 months afterward at 51.3 nmol/L. Serum prolactin level check alongside was 213 mIU/l (ref:<700 mIU/L), 10:00 hours cortisol—222 nmol/L (ref: 140–690 nmol/L), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level - 1.3 mU/l (ref: 0.27–4.2 mU/l) and T4 level—12 pmol/L (ref: 12–22 pmol/L). An oral glucose tolerance test was done afterward and revealed a failure to suppress serum growth hormone (GH) to <1 μg/L. Nadir GH level during the test was 2.3 μg/L.\n\n【21】Treatment\n---------\n\n【22】Her presenting symptoms improved initially with analgesics prescribed and was considered for further outpatient follow-up appointments after an uneventful period of in-hospital observation. Safe-netting instructions were given. She was referred for a formal visual field assessment. Her case was also reviewed at a tertiary centre’s endocrinology multidisciplinary meeting. The outcome of the meeting recommended patient to have an octreotide test dose and for further follow-up reviews. Her case was also recommended for further pituitary tumour clinicopathologic deliberations as well as for discussion of feasibility for surgery. The octreotide challenge test showed good response (see table 1 below) but patient opted for surgical intervention due to the intolerable gastrointestinal side effects of octreotide she experienced.\n\n【23】View this table:\n\n【24】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【25】Table 1\n\n【26】Octreotide challenge test\n\n【27】She underwent a transsphenoidal surgery and excision of pituitary tumour was done. On macroscopy, biopsy specimen consists of multiple pieces of soft white tissue fragments measuring in aggregate 8×3×2 mm. On microscopy, sections showed multiple pieces of a pituitary neuroendocrine tumour/adenoma. The tumour is arranged in diffuse sheets of cells with oval shaped, mildly atypical nuclei and eccentric abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Only rare mitotic figures are identified (1 per 10HPF). There was no necrosis in the tumour. The reticulum pattern was disrupted. Immunohistochemistry showed strong diffuse positivity with GH and pan-α-subunit. Very rare TSH positive cells were also noted. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was positive on the edge of the biopsy, probably representing infiltrated non-neoplastic cells. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), Leuteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin were negative. Transcription markers Pit-1 and SF1 were positive, while T-pit was positive only in very occasional infiltrated non-neoplastic cells at the edge of the sample. MNF116 reveals only very rare fibrous bodies, in addition to weak cytoplasmic positivity in most tumour cells. Proliferation index was 2% by Ki67. Histopathology report in summary revealed a strongly GH-positive adenoma, PRL staining negative, PIT1 positive, SF1 positive (and positive on repeat), but FSH and LH negative, Ki67 1–2.\n\n【28】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【29】The patient required one dose of DDAVP (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) for a transient diabetes insipidus prior to discharge from the tertiary neurosurgical centre following her pituitary surgery. The patient had an admission at her district general hospital (DGH) 1-week postsurgery to assess her recurrent polyuria. Her hormone profile checked at that time is presented in table 2 .\n\n【30】View this table:\n\n【31】*   View inline\n*   View popup\n\n【32】Table 2\n\n【33】Hormone profile check 1-week postsurgery\n\n【34】She was assessed jointly with her tertiary hospital’s endocrine and neurosurgery unit, and she was recommended to be started on oral hydrocortisone 20 mg two times per day, based on her laboratory finding of serum sodium 125 mmol/L, plasma osmolality of 261 mmol/kg (ref: 275 to 295 mmol/kg), random urine osmolality 541 mOsm/kg (ref: 500–850 mOsm/kg), and random urinary sodium of 179 mEq/l (ref: around 20 mEq/l). Her polyuria did improve afterwards but she had required one DDAVP dosage after the above test result samples had been collected. She was discharged home after 1 week of representation to her DGH on oral hydrocortisone replacement and was recommended for periodic follow-ups in clinics at her DGH and tertiary centre. Multidisciplinary discussion about patient at the tertiary centre shortly before her discharge recommended patient for a post-operative IST and GH day curve tests, and to have an interval MRI head study after 3 months.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】This case report further sheds lights on the increasing association being accorded to the concurrent finding of RCC(s) and pituitary adenoma in recent literatures. In this index case, a diagnosis of a GH-producing pituitary adenoma was diagnosed in a middle-aged patient with a radiologic finding of RCC displacing the pituitary tissue.\n\n【37】The anterior pituitary (a derivative of the embryologic oral ectodeum) contains about 50% growth-hormone producing cells and about 10%–25% of its cells secreting prolactin. The posterior pituitary gland has its origin as a down-growth extension of the diencephalon and secretes oxytocin and anti-diuretic hormone. 3 The Rathke’s cleft in most growing individuals is an obliterated space between the anterior and posterior pituitary gland. In a few individuals, this obliterated space could remain as a cyst or cysts which largely remain asymptomatic, but in some other situations produce symptoms such as headaches or visual disturbance by compression on the optic chiasma. 4\n\n【38】There is yet no direct explanation for the cause of concurrent findings of RCC and pituitary adenoma beyond case reports and case series descriptions in the literature. However, the concept of collision tumours (tumours or lesions occurring together but with distinct borders and with different cell populations) has been described in medical literature and these two entities could fit this description. 5\n\n【39】Within the literature, there are reported to be up to 14 cases of both RCCs and associated acromegaly. 6 Some of the earliest research regarding these entities dates to 1978 when a transitional cell tumour located within a RCC wall was first described. 7 Light and electron microscopy done in their case identified the tumour cells to be like that of the early developmental stage of the anterior pituitary gland. This led to the commonly reported theory that functioning pituitary adenomas (FPAs) and RCCs shared a common embryological origin. However, a case report by Ikeda _et al_ , describing acromegaly in a patient whose pituitary adenoma was found located within a RCC negated the afore. They demonstrated via immunohistochemical findings that the cells within the cyst did not resemble those of an early embryological developmental stage. 8\n\n【40】In 2014, an entirely different causal mechanism of acromegaly was associated with a case of RCC, demonstrating granulomatous anterior hypophysitis. It was suspected that the cyst caused hypophysitis which clinically presented with acromegaly. This case was surgically managed but the authors were suspicious that the case could have been managed without surgical intervention. 9 A similar causal mechanism was demonstrated in another study of a suspected pituitary adenoma and RCC case. During the surgery, no adenomatous tissue was discovered and it was theorised that the Rathke’s cyst caused inflammation that generated hormone release, mimicking a plurihormonal pituitary adenoma. 10\n\n【41】A wider issue of pituitary adenomas and RCC was also explored in a 2018 study that audited 284 cases of known pituitary adenomas. Four were demonstrated to be associated with an RCC, three were hormone-producing, and one of those caused acromegaly. The authors took a slightly different stance from the previous literature and highlighted the importance of suspecting a RCC in all cases of pituitary adenoma, particularly when cysts are non-enhancing on MRI. 11\n\n【42】Sumita _et al_ in their 2001 publication of a retrospective review of 374 patients with sellar or juxtasellar tumours who had undergone a contrast 1.5 Tesla MRI scan study revealed a 2.1% frequency of finding concurrent RCC and pituitary adenoma. They also revealed that the RCC was adjacent to the pituitary adenoma in seven out of eight of the patients in whom this concurrent association was found and in one of the patients, the cyst enclosed the adenoma. 12 Pojskić _et al_ in their 2017 publication claimed to have described the first case of two ectopic pituitary lesions: a RCC and a silent adrenocorticotropic hormone adenoma, found in the sphenoidal sinus. 13\n\n【43】Azarpira _et al_ reported a concurrent finding of RCC and a combined pituitary adenoma with gangliocytoma in a 50-year-old woman in their 2013 publication. 14 Tamura _et al_ in their publication in 2014 described a concurrent suprasellar RCC and a GH-producing pituitary adenoma in a 53-year-old man who was earlier assessed on his hospital visit with a lacunar infarction in the left basal ganglia. 15 Bader _et al_ in their publication in the year 2004 described the successful role of a modified transsphenoidal skull-based approach towards performing a selective transsphenoidal adenomectomy and decompression of the suprasellar cyst in a patient with concurrent symptomatic RCC (with visual disturbance) and a GH-secreting pituitary adenoma. 16\n\n【44】Surgical consideration (transsphenoidal pituitary adenomectomy) is considered the first-line therapy for the management of most FPAs except prolactinomas (which show a good response to treatment with dopamine agonists (eg, cabergoline). Treatment of FPA is aimed to achieve remission as well as to shrink the size of the adenoma. Medical treatment and/or radiation therapy can be deployed as an adjuvant treatment following transsphenoidal surgeries for these FPAs. For patients with growth-hormone producing pituitary adenomas with ensuing acromegaly, somatostatin analogues, dopamine agonists, and GH receptor antagonist have been used as a single therapy or in combination, and the high remission rate can be achieved. In patients with acromegaly, preceding treatment with somatostatin analogue helps to improve the rate of success with transsphenoidal surgery. 17 Consideration can be given to the transsphenoidal resection of a symptomatic RCC and a symptomatic pituitary adenoma at the same surgery where they occur together.\n\n【45】### Patient's perspective\n\n【46】My diagnosis of acromegaly was both daunting and a venture into the unknown. I had been feeling ‘not quite right’ for many years, and despite far too many visits to general practice, there was no real conclusion to my symptoms, of which there were many. As time wore on, I began to despair of the constant fatigue that took me to bed every afternoon. I had earache and a twitching eye that was put down to stress, as was the blurred vision that accompanied it. Three years prior to this publication, I began sweating profusely, spent a lot of time urinating without warning, along with swollen feet and fingers. My heart rate was often high. It was the earache that brought me to the door of endocrinology due to a finding of a Rankthe’s Cleft Cyst during an MRI examination. After some queries regarding this and the importance of it in terms of my symptoms, I was referred to Dr AA at the William Harvey Hospital who diagnosed acromegaly. Since then, I have also been diagnosed with short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with autonomic symptoms (SUNA) syndrome – which explained a lot of the headaches, eye and ear symptoms.\n\n【47】I had transphoidal surgery to remove this neuroendocrine tumour in June 2022 via the specialist unit at Kings College Hospital as this is not available in my local NHS Trust. Since then, some of the symptoms have subsided. I no longer have feet that resemble ‘pigs trotters’. The headaches, unfortunately, remain for now, but that will require further investigation. My hands remain swollen at the present time, and whilst the fatigue is less, it is still there, and I have to identify when I should pace myself. I imagine that, due to the longevity of the condition before diagnosis, this will be a ‘work in progress’, so I remain patient. I am prescribed 20mg of Hydrocortisone for the time being, and wait for further input regarding the future dose, if any. I am told that my facial features are not as coarse, but I am equally learning to cope with the changes that would not revert.\n\n【48】### Learning points\n\n【49】*   Clinicians and surgeons are reminded about increasing literature evidence of the concurrent occurrence of symptomatic Rathke’s cleft cyst(s) and pituitary adenoma(ta).\n    \n*   Patient education can be further facilitated, and expectations managed in the setting of one or both entities occurring.\n    \n*   More explanations beyond case reports or case series evidence will be required to explain the concurrent association between these two clinical entities.\n    \n\n【50】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【51】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【52】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【53】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【54】The authors wish to thank the patient for giving consent to this case report submission.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

Furthermore, multicentric Castleman’s disease is occasionally associated with elevated levels of serum IgG <sub>4 </sub> , complicating its distinguishment from IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease. 2 Infection with HIV is also closely associated with the development of human herpesvirus-8-related diseases, such as Kaposi’s sarcoma; Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated inflammatory syndrome was recently described as a human herpesvirus-8-related disease. 3 4 Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated inflammatory syndrome presents with varying degrees of lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia and signs of systemic inflammatory syndrome, rendering it clinically indistinguishable from multicentric Castleman’s disease. Numerous studies have shown that multicentric Castleman’s disease is frequently resistant to treatment with corticosteroids. 5 Nonetheless, treatment with steroids is effective against IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease. Multiple differential diagnoses should be considered for patients with suspected multicentric Castleman’s disease receiving long-term treatment with steroids who develop respiratory symptoms with bilateral diffuse lung consolidation and granular shadows. These symptoms indicate steroid-resistant multicentric Castleman’s disease, worsening the differential diagnosis of multicentric Castleman’s disease and opportunistic infections. In particular, infection with _Cryptococcus_ presents with a variety of imaging findings in patients with compromised T cell immunity. Furthermore, it is difficult to distinguish exacerbation of steroid-resistant multicentric Castleman’s disease from cryptococcal infections through imaging analysis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A woman in her 60s with a medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension presented with mild cough and general malaise. Seven years earlier, she had visited the Department of Haematology for hyper-γ-globulinaemia and hypercalcaemia with malaise. Eventually, the patient was diagnosed with polyclonal hyper-γ-globulinaemia rather than multiple myeloma. Multiple lung lesions were detected, and the patient was referred to the Department of Respiratory Medicine. CT showed multiple centrilobular granular shadows of the lobules and nodular shadows in both lungs, as well as swelling of the mediastinal lymph nodes ( figure 1 ). In addition, she had elevated levels of IgG <sub>4 </sub> and IL-6. Four years earlier, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-CT showed mild FDG accumulation in the lung nodules, as well as in the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Moreover, strong FDG accumulation was detected in the palatine tonsils. However, biopsy tissue of the palatine tonsils did not reveal notable abnormalities. Three years earlier, a transbronchial lung biopsy was performed. Dense inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in areas thought to be bronchial vascular bundles and alveolar septa ( figure 2 ). The infiltrating cells were mostly lymphocytes, along with a limited number of plasma cells. Individual cells did not show signs of dysplasia, and there was no evidence of a lymphoepithelial lesion. Immunostaining revealed a mixture of B and T cells, with predominance of the former type. There was no light chain restriction, and chain-positive cells were mixed. There were more CD43-positive cells than CD3-positive cells, and there was positivity for cells other than lymphocytes; hence, it was not possible to determine the malignancy. The IgG <sub>4 </sub> /IgG-positive cell ratio was 10%–20%. Clonal cell proliferation was not demonstrated, and the low IgG <sub>4 </sub> /IgG-positive cell ratio was not suggestive of malignant lymphoma or IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease. Based on the above results, multicentric Castleman’s disease was strongly suspected. Six months earlier, treatment with oral prednisolone (30 mg/day) had been initiated owing to mild anaemia and cough. A CT scan at the time of the present visit revealed diffuse infiltrative, nodular and granular shadows in both lungs ( figure 3 ).\n\n【12】<img/>\n\n【13】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【14】Figure 1\n\n【15】CT of the chest lung window.

Exacerbation of multiple lung lesions 6 months after steroid therapy was noted.\n\n【24】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【25】Laboratory tests yielded the following results: leucocyte count, 11 .01×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (with neutrophils accounting for 84% of the total number); C reactive protein (CRP), 5 mg/dL (reference range: <1.0 mg/dL); erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 116/hour (indicating inflammation); haemoglobin, 108 g/L; serum protein, 11.5 g/dL; and albumin, 2.5 g/dL. In addition, there was an increase in polyclonal γ-globulin in the protein fraction (ie, IgG: 5952 mg/dL; IgM: 213 mg/dL; IgA: 881 mg/dL and IgG <sub>4 </sub> : 710 mg/dL). The level of haemoglobin A1c was 7.1%. The level of IL-6 increased to 15.6 pg/mL (reference range: <7 pg/dL). The free light chain was not skewed. The results of the HIV-1/2 antigen and antibody screening test were negative.\n\n【26】A month after this visit, a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery biopsy of the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Grocott’s staining revealed numerous black yeast-like fungi and giant cells in the airspace ( figure 4 ). Polynuclear giant cells contained fungi that stained red with Periodic acid–Schiff stain and blue with Alcian blue stain. A growing fungus was found in the vacuole of giant cells, where it produced mucous substances. There were no epithelioid cell granulomas, suggesting that steroid therapy was ineffective in inducing cell-mediated immunity against yeast. A panfungal PCR test was performed using paraffin sections, and 100% homology with _C. neoformans_ was obtained; thus, the lung lesion was recognised as pneumonia caused by _C. neoformans_ .\n\n【27】<img/>\n\n【28】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【29】Figure 4\n\n【30】Histopathological findings in tissue obtained from the right lung tissue and the mediastinal lymph nodes. (A) Presence of numerous black yeast-like fungi and giant cells in the airspace (Grocott’s staining: lung tissue) was observed. (B) Presence of numerous lymphoid follicles with germinal centres (H&E staining: mediastinal lymph node) was noted. (C) The IgG/IgG <sub>4 </sub> ratio was approximately 40%–50% (immunostaining: lymph node).\n\n【31】In the mediastinal lymph node tissue (short-axis diameter: >1.5 cm), numerous lymphoid follicles with germinal centres were found. The spaces between the follicles were slightly reddish and enlarged. Most of the inflammatory cells were plasma cells, and numerous Russell bodies were found. A large amount of immunoglobulins was produced. In immunostaining, the IgG/IgG <sub>4 </sub> ratio was approximately 40%–50%. Both IgG <sub>4 </sub> and IL-6 levels were elevated; therefore, it was necessary to distinguish between multicentric Castleman’s disease and IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease. The serum CRP levels were increased to 5.45 mg/dL (reference value: 0.80 mg/dL); the levels of IgA were 881 mg/dL (reference value: 330 mg/dL). There was no atopy predisposition observed, and lesions were distributed in both lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes. However, they were not found in the eyes, lacrimal glands/salivary glands or pancreas. PCR testing using whole blood did not detect human herpesvirus-8 DNA. There was positivity for cryptococcal antigen in the serum, but not in the cerebrospinal fluid; moreover, the cerebrospinal fluid culture was negative. Consequently, this patient was diagnosed with multicentric Castleman’s disease complicated by cryptococcal pneumonia.\n\n【32】Treatment\n---------\n\n【33】Oral treatment with fluconazole (400 mg/day) was initiated as treatment for lung-only infection. Currently, the dose of prednisolone is gradually reduced, and treatment with this agent will eventually be discontinued after 12 months.\n\n【34】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【35】A CT scan performed 4 months after initiating the anti-fungal treatment showed improvement in the lung lesions; however, the lung lesions attributed to multicentric Castleman’s disease persisted ( figure 5 ). We are currently considering to add tocilizumab for the treatment of multicentric Castleman’s disease.\n\n【36】<img/>\n\n【37】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【38】Figure 5\n\n【39】CT of the chest lung window performed 4 months after the initiation of anti-fungal treatment.\n\n【40】Discussion\n----------\n\n【41】This case report emphasises two points: (1) the differentiation between IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease and multicentric Castleman’s disease; and (2) the differentiation between cryptococcal pneumonia and diffuse lung disease in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n【42】Multicentric Castleman’s disease involves the overproduction of IL-6 by the lymph nodes. IL-6 differentiates B cells into plasma cells to produce immunoglobulins, resulting in elevated serum IgG <sub>4 </sub> levels and IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-positive plasma cell infiltration. The histological findings of IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease are similar to those of Castleman’s disease (type I). 6 Hence, it is necessary to differentiate IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease with lymph node lesions from the plasma cell type of Castleman’s disease. For the reasons stated above, it is difficult to distinguish between multicentric Castleman’s disease and IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease using the IgG <sub>4 </sub> /IgG ratio. 7\n\n【43】Clinical studies have examined markers that could be useful for the differentiation of these diseases. Despite increases in IgG and IgE, CRP or globulins are not increased in IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease. According to the results of a study, 8 the presence of the following findings are indicative of multicentric Castleman’s disease: serum CRP >0.8 mg/dL; IgA >330 mg/dL, absence of atopy predisposition, and no involvement of the eye, lacrimal gland/salivary gland, or pancreas in the lesion.\n\n【44】In immunocompromised patients, cryptococcal pneumonia can cause diffuse lung disease. Furthermore, in the absence of response to steroid therapy, it is important to distinguish _C. neoformans_ infection from exacerbation of multicentric Castleman’s disease. In a study of 151 patients without HIV with pulmonary cryptococcosis in Japan, 84 patients had underlying disease; diabetes was found in 32.1% of the patients; moreover, steroid users accounted for 37% of the population. 9 Steroids suppress T cells, particularly CD4+ T helper cells. 10 T helper 1 cells control immunity against intracellular parasites by producing interferon-γ, and steroids exert a marked effect on these cells. Thus far, there are few reports of multicentric Castleman’s disease associated with cryptococcal infection. A search conducted using the MEDLINE database yielded only disseminated cases that occurred during treatment with tocilizumab and cases of cryptococcal tendonitis. 11\n\n【45】_C. neoformans_ lung lesions are generally more extensive in immunocompromised individuals versus immunocompetent individuals. 12 13 These are characterised by multiple nodules located immediately below the peripheral lung and pleura, infiltrative shadows, cavity shadows, bilateral pneumonia and occasionally diffuse granular shadows; in addition, histological analysis may not reveal a granulomatous reaction.\n\n【46】_C. neoformans_ lung disease is classified into four patterns based on the formation of granuloma and the degree of inflammation. 14 Granulomatous inflammation controls the growth of _C. neoformans_ in static lesions. However, there is no inflammatory response in patients with severe cellular immunodeficiency (eg, HIV), and a large amount of _C. neoformans_ is present in the alveoli, interstitium and capillaries. In the present case, cellular immunodeficiency was noted following the administration of steroid therapy, diabetes was present and there was no observation of granuloma formation. Granulomatous pneumonia with immunodeficiency owing to inflammatory cell infiltration and polynuclear mobility was considered.\n\n【47】### Learning points\n\n【48】*   The serum levels of IgG <sub>4 </sub> are elevated in some cases of multicentric Castleman’s disease; differentiation from IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease using case clinical data is necessary.\n    \n*   Cryptococcosis in immunocompromised individuals presents with a variety of imaging findings.\n    \n*   Differential diagnosis (eg, _Cryptococcus neoformans_ pneumonia) for diffuse parenchymal lung disease, such as multicentric Castleman’s disease, should be considered.\n    \n\n【49】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【50】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【51】Parental/guardian consent obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}

The patient had difficulty passing urine and felt mass bulging through the vaginal opening for 6 months. She reported three to four episodes of incontinence per day and two to three episodes of enuresis per night with a poor flow for the last 2 months. Clinical examination of the pelvis revealed inferior descent of urinary bladder with hard consistency and posteroinferior descent of the rectum. There was complete prolapse of the uterus and vagina with external os exposed. An unenhanced MRI of the pelvis was advised to look for the pelvic viscera’s status and assess the protruding hard consistency mass.\n\n【5】Unenhanced MRI of the pelvis revealed complete prolapse of the uterus, vagina (procidentia) and rectum below the pubococcygeal line (middle and posterior compartment prolapse) ( figure 1A,B ). There was inferior descent of the urinary bladder forming an hourglass appearance with a large well-defined, oval-shaped structure in the prolapsed part of the bladder lumen suggestive of cystocele with a large calculus (anterior compartment prolapse) ( figure 2A,B ). The calculus appeared hypointense on all MRI sequences. Cystocele was irreducible due to the presence of the large calculus. The primary goal was to remove obstructive urinary symptoms, considering weak pelvic muscle, significantly large hiatus and large calculus in the bladder lumen. The abdominal approach was selected due to vaginal wall oedema, and correction of rectal prolapse by rectosigmoidectomy, reanastomosis and posterior colporrhaphy was done. Cystolithotomy was performed, calculus was removed and hiatus was repaired using an abdominal approach by the urologist. The bladder wall was significantly inflamed, and the vaginal route was not selected to avoid fistula formation as bladder mucosa was significantly inflamed. Considering the age of the patient, an abdominal supracervical hysterectomy was done. The vaginal wall and pelvic floor muscles were provided mainly by posterior colporrhaphy and sacrocolpopexy using native tissue. For rectal prolapse, posterior colporrhaphy was done after rectosigmoidectomy and reanastomosis. Burch urethropexy and perineoplasty were done to support the pelvis.\n\n【6】<img/>\n\n【7】*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n\n【8】Figure 1\n\n【9】(A,B) MRI.

The figure also demonstrates procidentia marked as a black arrow along with peritoneocele (white arrow). There is prolapse of the rectum inferiorly and posteriorly below the pubococcygeal line that suggests posterior compartment prolapse (white star).\n\n【14】A cystocele is a pelvic organ prolapse where the bladder descends inferiorly and posteriorly into the vagina and perineum. Cystocele is quite a common condition accompanied by other pelvic viscera prolapses. 1 2 The incidence of cystocele is around 9 per 100 women-years, and the affected age group is mainly the geriatric group. Muscles and tissue supporting the bladder become weak, allowing it to herniate out of its place. During vaginal childbirth, chronic constipation, violent coughing or heavy lifting can happen.\n\n【15】The occurrence of irreducible cystocele with procidentia caused by the simultaneous event of large urolithiasis is relatively rare. Developing obstructive urinary symptoms and changes (hydroureter and hydronephrosis) in the urinary tract makes this entity urgent for intervention.\n\n【16】The most common presentation in cystocele is increased urination frequency, stress incontinence, frequent urinary tract infection, discomfort and pain in the vagina and tissue protruding in the perineum that may be tender or bleeding. A pelvic examination can assess how far the uterus has slipped into the vagina. The investigation to diagnose cystocele is through cystourethrogram and MRI. Cystourethrogram helps in identifying the configuration of the bladder and any blockages. MRI is more valuable in cystocele to determine the full extent of bladder prolapse and helps in grading. MRI also provides information on other viscera and the status of muscles forming the pelvic floor.\n\n【17】Various surgical approaches have been proposed for procidentia and multiple compartmental prolapses with large bladder calculi. The predictive value of apical prolapse will increase as the cystocele stage increases. In the case of anterior compartment prolapse, proper suspension of the vaginal apex plays an essential role in treatment success. 3 A study of over 2700 women comparing isolated anterior repair versus combined anterior and apical repair found lower rate of 10-year reoperation in the combined anterior and apical repair group (11.6% vs 20.2%). 4\n\n【18】Correction of anatomical defect is the basic principle of surgery for cystocele. Laparotomy, laparoscopic and robotic system approaches can be preferred with vaginal or abdominal routes. The risk of fistula formation is higher if the calculus is removed by the vaginal route during anterior colporrhaphy. However, transvaginal cystolithotomy is the preferred surgery as it is minimally invasive. With the suprapubic cystotomy approach, no risk of fistula formation seems to occur and it cures the patient completely.\n\n【19】Apical prolapse surgeries are classified into two categories: the first one is the obliterative approach, and the second one is the restorative approach.\n\n【20】Abdominal sacrocolpopexy can be performed with various approaches, such as laparotomy, robot assisted-laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy or conventional laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy, and remains the gold standard for patients desiring restorative outcomes.\n\n【21】An obliterative procedure can be done in patients who cannot tolerate extensive surgery due to old age and no longer desire preservation of coital function.\n\n【22】There are three ways in case of prolapsed uterus in patients with apical prolapse. First is the supracervical hysterectomy with sacrocervicocolopopexy, in which the uterus is not preserved. The second option can be sacrohysteropexy. The uterus and vagina are fixed with a mesh to the sacral promontory, preserving the uterus. The third option is sacrocolpopexy, in which closure of the vaginal cuff is done after total hysterectomy. Based on these options, it is difficult to determine whether sacrohysteropexy and total hysterectomy and sacrocolpopexy result in superior outcomes given our current knowledge. 5–8\n\n【23】The supracervical hysterectomy is way better as it reduces the risk of mesh erosion and cautery-induced thermal injury to the vagina. 9 Warner _et al_ 5 observed that the mesh exposure rate was 4.9% in the total hysterectomy group. The supracervical hysterectomy group (p=0.03) showed no mesh exposure.\n\n【24】In 2006, a randomised study was conducted by Paraiso _et al_ 10 for comparing outcomes of three different rectocele repair techniques: posterior colporrhaphy, site-specific repair and site-specific repair augmentation with a porcine small intestinal submucosal graft. After 1 year, subjects who received site-specific repair alone (6 of 27; 22%) or posterior colporrhaphy (4 of 28; 14%) (p=0.02) had better results than those who received graft augmentation as there was a significantly greater anatomical failure rate (12 of 26; 46%).\n\n【25】The abdominal surgical route is preferred for patients with anterior and posterior prolapse and a high risk of recurrence.\n\n【26】This case is an unusual presentation of the large vesical calculus in the prolapsed part of the cystocele, which is further complicated by the neglected middle and posterior compartment, making it necessary because the surgical approach needs to be modified based on complications and age of the patients. 11\n\n【27】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【28】I was in pain for the past few months, and my symptoms have increased in severity, affecting my daily routine activity. I came to the hospital with great hopes. Doctors assured me about my condition and advised me to undergo surgery. After many discussions, I agreed to surgery, and I am happy that doctors had saved my life. Doctors also asked me to come for a general check-up every month.\n\n【29】### Learning points\n\n【30】*   Multispecialty approaches are needed in case of multicompartmental prolapse with irreducible cystocele containing calculus due to long-standing situation complicating the anatomy of the pelvis resulting in various urinary complications such as hydronephrosis and cystolithiasis.\n    \n*   Imaging has to cover the entire urogenital system to diagnose preoperatively. MRI was superior to CT because of its inherent soft tissue resolution and non-invasive nature.\n    \n*   Urgent surgical correction of the obstructive symptoms is essential. Inclination towards vaginal approach towards cystolithotomy is more in literature than the abdominal route. However, the patient’s age and clinical/local examination findings are essential to decide the surgical approach to avoid postoperative fistula formation and ureteral injuries.\n    \n\n【31】Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【32】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【33】Obtained.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}
