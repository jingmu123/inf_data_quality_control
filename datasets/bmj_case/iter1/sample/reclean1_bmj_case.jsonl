The anomalies of the distal spinal segment can range from sacral agenesis, genital malformation, cardiac anomalies, pulmonary hypoplasia or aplasia, renal dysplasia or aplasia, anomalies of the lower extremities including arthrogryposis and anorectal malformation. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Maternal diabetes is a major risk factor for developing CRS presenting as sacral agenesis syndrome and hypoplasia of the lower extremities. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>This defect is thought to occur during the fourth to seventh week of embryogenesis as a result of impaired development of the mesoderm. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A term male neonate was referred to our tertiary hospital from one of the primary hospitals in the city for respiratory support and orthopaedic management. He was delivered via assisted breech delivery at 30 weeks’ gestation with an APGAR score of 7 and 10 at the first and fifth, minutes, respectively, with a birth weight of 1.9 kg.\n\n【10】Both parents are in their early 30s and with no comorbidities. This is their third child, and the other two siblings are well. There was no family history of similar condition in the parents or the two older siblings. The parents are non-consanguineous. The mother started to attend antenatal clinics in the second trimester. She was not given folic acid however was given malaria prophylaxis at 20 weeks’ gestation that comprised of three tablets stat of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (1500/75 mg) and an iron supplement of 60 mg tablets of ferrous sulfate daily. This malaria prophylaxis was given on two occasions only at 20 weeks and 24 weeks. She had two antenatal ultrasound scans, both reported normal findings. She was normotensive throughout the pregnancy and had no history of gestational diabetes with negative serology results for syphilis using the VDRL and HIV infection. Her random blood glucose at 20 weeks was 5.5 mmol/L and a repeat at 28 weeks was 5.4 mmol/L; she was euglycaemic and the attending obstetrician did not do the HBA1C. This was done 2 months after delivery and it was 5.1%, which is normal. There is no history of diabetes or similar genetic illness in the family. There is no exposure to any other drugs like minoxidil, sodium valproate or creams with retinoic acid.\n\n【11】On admission, the baby had moderate respiratory distress with Silverman-Andersen score of 4 with central cyanosis. The respiratory rate was 70 breaths/min, oxygen saturation was 70% and heart rate was 147 beats/min. There was a pan-systolic murmur, and 100% oxygen supplementation did not seem to improve cyanosis. On examination, he had a short neck and low-set ears, otherwise no obvious facial deformity. Both lower limbs appeared short with flexion knee and hip contracture putting the baby in splayed posture; upper limbs were normal. He had bilateral undescended testes and microphallus of 1 cm and prominence of the spine at T12 vertebra; his lumbar and sacral bones could not be palpated and he had bilateral deep dimples at the femoral trochanter area . Sensation was present in both lower limbs. He has patulous anus with faecal incontinence. The occipital frontal circumference was 28 cm and length was 40 cm.\n\n【12】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【14】(A) (Flexed hip joints with flexion contractures of both knees (’frog-like posture’).

He was weaned off oxygen on day 3 of life, his saturation ranging 90%–93%. He was initiated on expressed breast milk via an orogastric tube and later transitioned to intermittent direct breast feeding.\n\n【16】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【17】A full skeletal survey, echocardiogram and abdominal ultrasound were done.

Our case did not have a sacral mass.\n\n【29】Treatment\n---------\n\n【30】Treatment is mainly supportive. Our patient was reviewed by a cardiologist and scheduled for a monthly follow-up while waiting for the correction of DTGA. He was also reviewed by an orthopaedic surgeon where correction of the contracture will be done once cardiac condition is corrected. The agenesis of the sacrum cannot be remedied, but physiotherapy and occupational therapy will be needed intensively as he grows.\n\n【31】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【32】The baby is having regular monthly follow-up clinics with the cardiologist and orthopaedic surgeons.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】CRS is very rare and occurs in approximately 1:100 000 live births. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>Th embryogenesis at 4–7 weeks of life is characterised by failure of development of the lumbosacral vertebra and caudal spinal cord due to defects in the development of the caudal mesoderm and the structures that it ultimately forms. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【35】The teratogenic insult caused by hyperglycaemia has been found to be one of the major factors for CRS. Hyperglycaemia increases the risk of malformation to the fetus by negatively impacting the DNA structure. The role of genetic mutation of the VANGL1 gene, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait located in short arm (p) chromosome 1 (1p13), has been found. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Unfortunately, in our country, genetic studies are not done; however, samples can be sent abroad. This is usually very expensive and results take almost 8 weeks–4 months to be reported. 删除9：<u>5 6</u>\n\n【36】The mother of the patient we present did not have any risk factors during antenatal period. She was normotensive and had no diabetes mellitus during pregnancy or otherwise. Some studies have shown an association between folic acid and CRS. Environmental factors also play a role in the development of caudal regression. These include hypoxia, retinoic acid, radiation and alcohol consumption. When retinoic acid homeostasis is impaired during the first trimester, it affects both embryogenesis and organogenesis/agenesis through impaired cell migration and differentiation. 删除9：<u>6 7</u>\n\n【37】The detrimental and irreversible effects of folate deficiency on the fetus are well established. 删除9：<u>8 </u>An inadequate concentration of periconceptional supplementation of folic acid impairs/inhibits DNA synthesis and other cellular processes. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Fetal structural anomalies may also be prevented by folic acid by regulation of homocysteine metabolism especially when given in the first trimester. 删除9：<u>7 10 </u>Antenatal supplementation of folic acid is crucial; however, our patient started antenatal clinics in the second trimester and therefore was not given folic acid. 删除9：<u>7 8 </u>The antenatal ultrasound done in the second trimester could not pick any anomaly and calls for a proper expert ultrasonography with the intent to visualise anomalies.\n\n【38】CRS is rare, and its early recognition is important. It can be detected prenatally and just like other such highly lethal malformations, interventions can be instituted early. Its prevalence in infants of mothers with diabetes is reported at 1 in 350 live births, which includes all the variants. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【39】The CRS is 250 times more common among offspring of mothers with diabetes. The absence of diabetes should prompt doctors to look into other possible causes, such as maternal exposure to cocaine or alcohol consumption, vascular steal or hypoperfusion, fetal hypoxaemia and amino acid imbalance. 删除9：<u>11 12</u>\n\n【40】Family history and maternal diabetes mellitus are two of the risk factors for this disorder. Of all the CRS, 16% are related to maternal diabetes (the abnormal embryological development of the caudal mesoderm occurs within the first 4 weeks of embryonic development). 删除9：<u>13</u>\n\n【41】In our case, none of the possible risk factors were noted.\n\n【42】This case is reported to highlight the early diagnosis of the syndrome, and the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment postnatally. It is indeed a rare condition and can be associated with various abnormalities and poor quality of life and increased mortality, so recognition early on during antenatal period is important.\n\n【43】Classification of CRS done by Renshaw in 1978 describes the types of defect and articulation between bones. 删除9：<u>6 </u>According to this classification, our patient had type III CRS.\n\n【44】Management is a multidisciplinary approach aimed at supportive care in order to improve functionality of the deformity and to reach their highest potential. Our patient has been reviewed by the cardiologist and orthopaedic surgeon, who are following the patient closely. The orthopaedic surgeon will correct the contracture and further assist the baby with orthopaedic support in order to maintain functionality once the cardiac anomaly has been resolved.\n\n【45】Prognosis depends on the degree of the defect in the vertebra and spinal cord and other associated malformations including bowel or urinary bladder incontinence. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Our patient, in addition to orthopaedic deficit, has faecal and urinary incontinence. No cognitive impairment has been reported. Patients with CRS lack motor skills below the level of the normal spine; however, sensation is intact just like in our patient, and it could be explained due to fairly normal segmental development of the neural tube at the level of agenesis.\n\n【46】Long-term follow-up is required for growth and developmental milestone including orthopaedic reviews for improving pelvic stability and hence functionality and nephrologist assessment in view of neurogenic bladder that may develop later on in life.\n\n【47】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【48】I am sad because my baby has a skeletal deficit even though the antenatal ultrasound that I did were reported normal. I am also sad because I was told that my baby has a cardiac problem even though the cardiologist will correct the problem next month and orthopedic doctors will follow up with my baby to help with the knee problem.\n\n【49】### Learning points\n\n【50】*   The novel information is that this is a rare condition, but information is scarce especially from Africa.\n\n【51】*   Early diagnosis during antenatal period is possible if there is an index of suspicion from a family history. Now that this case has been reported, there is going to be increased awareness in our setting.\n\n【52】*   As for this case being sporadic or possibly genetic, we do not have genetic testing, and all other possible conditions predisposing to caudal regression syndrome were not present, such as diabetes, hypertension, substance abuse, smoking, alcohol and so on.\n\n【53】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【54】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【55】Parental/guardian consent obtained.\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We acknowledge the nurses at the neonatal unit and all the colleagues who assisted in the care and management of the infant.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:36:50", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:37:11", "cost": 20.809}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:30", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:37:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:36:50"}

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of EC-PEL occurring synchronously with early syphilis specifically at the site of inoculation. This observation led us to raise the hypothesis that syphilis played a role in the recurrence of this rare lymphoma.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 59-year-old Caucasian man with a long history of treated HIV infection presented to a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic in October 2019 with complaints of rectal pain and fever. He was initially diagnosed with HIV infection in 2010 with a low CD4 T cell count of 60×10 <sup>6 </sup> /L and plasma HIV viral load of 151 000 copies/mL and was successfully treated with emtricitabine, tenofovir and raltegravir. He was later diagnosed with cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma (KS) with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy in 2012 and with HHV8-positive but EBV-negative EC-PEL with cutaneous involvement in 2014. 删除9：<u>2 </u>He was treated with liposomal doxorubicin (LD) for his KS and with four cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, oncovin and prednisone) for his lymphoma, as previously described. 删除9：<u>2 </u>His CD4 T cell count remained below 100×10 <sup>6 </sup> /L on the same antiretroviral therapy (ART), and although he had recurrences of his lymphoma 通用删除7(英):<u>(2015–2017)</u> involving the skin and tonsils without lymphadenopathy he had been in remission since October 2017.\n\n【12】His rectal pain developed 3 weeks after a single episode of receptive anal sexual intercourse with another man, precisely on 29 June 2019. On 7 October 2019, he presented to an STI clinic in Montreal with worsening rectal pain, tenesmus, mucoid discharge, constipation alternating with diarrhoea, and fever (38.4°C). He also complained of severe constitutional symptoms, including drenching night sweats, weight loss (about 9 kilogram) and extreme fatigue. He denied any bright red blood per rectum, melaena or vomiting. Physical examination of his palms, soles, torso, penis, anus, mouth, spleen and lymph nodes was unremarkable, and no lesion or ulcer was identified.\n\n【13】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【14】On 7 October 2019, the patient underwent serological testing for syphilis, and samples from the throat, anus and penis were collected for sexual screening, including testing for _Chlamydia trachomatis_ and _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ . Based on clinical presentation, he was treated with doxycycline for suspicion of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) proctitis. However, the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for chlamydia and gonorrhoea was negative, excluding LGV proctitis. Testing for syphilis showed a high rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titre of 1:128, consistent with early syphilitic infection. Treatment with penicillin was initiated, followed by a decline in fever, night sweats and relief in his constipation, accompanied by a rapid decline in the levels of inflammatory markers such as β2 microglobulin, C reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer (0.75 µg/mL) 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>. Furthermore, following penicillin treatment, the RPR titre declined from 1:128 to 1:8 and further to 1:2 on 19 December 2019 and 10 January 2020, respectively 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u> However, _T. pallidum_ was not identified on biopsies by immunohistochemistry performed 10 days after treatment for LGV and syphilis.\n\n【15】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【16】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【17】Summary of the patient’s serological test results before and after relapse of EC-PEL</u>\n\n【18】The patient underwent rectosigmoidoscopy on 17 October 2019, which revealed a 5 cm rectal mass, of which multiple biopsies were taken. The patient was also referred to his haematologist at the McGill University Health Centre where he had been followed and treated for his lymphoma. Whole-body positron emission topography/computed topography (PET/CT) scan revealed intense 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) activity in the rectum and hypermetabolic activity in the left external iliac, porta hepatis and internal mammary lymph nodes, most consistent with a lymphoproliferative process.\n\n【19】Histopathological analysis of the endoscopic biopsies showed fragments of the tissue consistent with ulceration and infiltration by large atypical lymphoid cells . Immunohistochemistry revealed that the neoplastic cells were positive for HHV8, Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and negative for CD45, CD3, CD20, CD79a, PAX5, BCL6, CD30, CD15 and CD138. Kappa and lambda light chains were negative by in situ hybridisation, 删除13：<u>23 </u>with faint positive lambda light chain by immunohistochemistry. Epstein-Barr Encoding Region (EBER) in situ hybridisation was negative for EBV. The staining of atypical lymphoid cells was 95% positive for Ki-67 proliferation index. B cell receptor (BCR) gene rearrangement testing using PCR confirmed the clonality of the atypical B cells. These findings were similar to those from previous biopsies of the known EC-PEL in this patient, 删除13：<u>2 </u>thus consistent with rectal lymphoma relapse.

However, given the high RPR titre (1:128) and negative NAAT results for chlamydia and gonorrhoea, a diagnosis of syphilitic proctitis was made, 删除13：<u>24 </u>prompting treatment with penicillin and resulting in improvement of his symptoms and a decline in inflammatory markers 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>. Only on further investigations, including PET/CT scan, rectosigmoidoscopy and histopathological analysis of the endoscopic biopsies, the diagnosis of synchronous relapse EC-PEL was made, specifically at the site of inoculation with _T. pallidum_ .\n\n【28】HHV8-positive lymphoproliferative disorders other than PEL (or EC-PEL) include HHV8-positive multicentric Castleman’s disease, HHV8-positive diffuse large B cell lymphoma and germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Histologically, the main differential diagnosis of PEL is HHV8-positive diffuse large B cell lymphoma, but the latter usually arises in association with HHV8-positive multicentric Castleman’s disease, never present in this patient.\n\n【29】Treatment\n---------\n\n【30】The patient had been treated with ART since 2010, with persistently low CD4 T cell count (mean CD4 T cell count of 50–100 cells/mL) and with a plasma HIV viral load below the detection level (<20 copies/mL). The patient received four cycles of R-CHOP for the previous occurrence of his lymphoma and was treated with LD for cutaneous KS lesions with successful remission. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Later recurrences of his EC-PEL in the skin and tonsils were treated with LD only, with unexpected remissions. 删除9：<u>2 </u>At the patient’s request and to avoid second-line chemotherapy, LD was thus given between 2014 and 2017 for three recurrences of EC-PEL. The patient’s longest period of remission from lymphoma was 25 months, from September 2017 to October 2019, the last recurrence being herein reported.\n\n【31】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【32】Rectosigmoidoscopies performed on 16 January and 5 February 2020 showed rapid regression of the tumour after only one cycle of LD . On clinical management and treatment as described above, the patient demonstrated complete clinical and tumorous response and remained asymptomatic, even on his latest visit at the clinic on 27 October 2020.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】In immunosuppressed individuals, oncogenic viruses persist in infected cells where they more effectively transformed into malignant cells. HHV8 is a DNA oncovirus that can infect endothelial cells as well as B cells and bring about the malignant transformation of both cell types. Distinct from other herpesviruses, a significant proportion of HHV8-infected cells can produce high levels of a virally encoded interleukin 6 (IL-6), contributing to inflammation and B cell extrafollicular maturation. 删除9：<u>25 </u>When endothelial cells are preferentially infected, KS results; 5 26 27 when B cells are infected, 删除9：<u>26 </u>HHV8 creates a fertile epigenetic milieu for B cell dysfunction and establishes a pro-lymphomagenic environment, which may lead to multicentric Castleman’s disease, diffuse large B cell lymphoma or PEL. In individuals living with HIV, two or more of these conditions may develop either simultaneously or independently over time. 删除9：<u>28 </u>Importantly, the precise diagnosis and classification of HHV8-associated lymphoproliferative disorders and KS are crucial, as their treatments and prognosis differ markedly.\n\n【35】PEL, a large B cell lymphoma presenting with an inflammatory syndrome, constitutes approximately 4% of HIV-related lymphomas. Whereas PEL usually presents as effusions in body cavities without identifiable tumour masses, the EC-PEL variant presents as non-cavitary masses most commonly involving the lymph nodes, skin or occasionally digestive tract. Digestive tract and mucosal involvement by EC-PEL is not common and is solely reported in a handful of cases. We reviewed the literature for these cases 5 14–17 29 and included a summary of their clinicopathological features in table 2. Both PEL and EC-PEL share similar morphological, immunophenotypic and virological characteristics. 删除9：<u>3 30 </u>The extrafollicular development of these lymphomas has been demonstrated by class-switching recombination and somatic hypermutation. 删除9：<u>25 </u>Morphology of the malignant cells may show immunoblastic, plasmablastic or anaplastic features. 删除9：<u>2 </u>By immunohistochemistry, they often reveal prominent features of terminally differentiated plasma cells, and the presence of HHV8 in the neoplastic cells is essential for the diagnosis. This lymphoma is also distinctive due to the common lack of expression of pan-B cell markers such as CD20, CD79a and CD19, and therefore may require BCR gene rearrangement testing to confirm its B cell lineage and clonality. CD45 expression may be low or absent, and activation markers, plasma cell markers and non-lineage-associated antigens are often expressed, including CD30, CD138 and EMA, with rare aberrant expression of T cell-associated antigens. 删除9：<u>12</u>\n\n【36】HIV causes persistent immune dysfunction in B cell follicles due to the absence of T cell immune surveillance, which in turn contributes to the dysregulation of EBV latency. Therefore, as most cases of PEL and EC-PEL occur in the context of HIV, it is not surprising that over 80% of these lymphomas are associated with EBV coinfection. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Nevertheless, cases of PEL without EBV coinfection in the neoplastic cells are occasionally reported, as in our patient, although this is most common in elderly non-immunocompromised individuals living in Eastern Mediterranean regions. Despite decades of successful ART and non-detectable HIV plasma viral load, the patient had a low stable CD4 T cell count (100×10 <sup>6 </sup> /L) and a low CD4:CD8 ratio (0.4), indicating a reduced capacity of immune reconstitution. Interestingly, although EBV could not be demonstrated in the neoplastic cells of his lymphoma by EBER in situ hybridisation, EBV viraemia was present at the time of relapse.\n\n【37】One additional peculiarity of this case is that the exact date of syphilis transmission is known. In fact, the patient acquired syphilis precisely on 29 June 2019, during a single episode of receptive anal intercourse with another man, the only sexual intercourse he had over the past year, as reported. To further emphasise this, a negative RPR titre was also documented in May 2019. The patient presented 4 months after in an STI clinic in Montreal with complaints of rectal pain associated with severe constitutional symptoms and elevated inflammatory indicators, such as increased CRP, ferritin, D-dimer and β2 microglobulin 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>. Medical history and symptomatology were consistent with syphilitic proctitis, and treatment with penicillin resulted in the improvement of symptoms, with a rapid decline in inflammatory markers. However, identification of a 5 cm ulcerated rectal mass revealed a rectal biopsy-proven recurrence of EC-PEL. The peculiar synchronous onset of rectal syphilis and rectal recurrence of EC-PEL led us to raise the hypothesis that syphilis played a role in the recurrence of this rare lymphoma.\n\n【38】Particularly, we speculate that the prominent inflammation induced by syphilis in the rectal mucosa may have triggered the activation of HHV8-infected B cells, favouring local development of lymphoma. As it is the case for KS, the development of PEL and EC-PEL may be dependent on sustained proinflammatory signals to render B cells more permissive to infection, subsequent activation and proliferation. In addition, using complementary in vitro and in vivo studies, mast cells have been identified as a source of proinflammatory cytokines within the tumour microenvironment. 删除9：<u>31 </u>Consistent with this, treatment with penicillin also led to subsiding digestive symptoms and a drop in inflammatory indicators. The decline in the inflammatory microenvironment may have decreased the pro-tumorous effect of syphilis and may have increased the sensitivity of the tumour cells to chemotherapy. During the last few decades, chronic inflammation, infection, and even commensal bacteria and viruses have been reported at various extent to be associated with the development of certain Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas. 删除9：<u>23 32 33</u>\n\n【39】In sum, the concomitant diagnosis of early syphilis and rectal recurrence of EC-PEL in a 59-year-old man living with HIV poses a diagnostic challenge, as both conditions may present with lymphadenopathy, skin involvement and constitutional symptoms. Rectosigmoidoscopy was key in the identification of the tumour and pathological diagnosis of recurring EC-PEL. As the development of virally induced lymphoma depends in part on the immune status of the patient, where both immunosuppression and inflammation may play a role, we consider that the syphilis-induced inflammation was a contributor to the development of the EC-PEL in this patient with low immune reconstitution. This is supported by the ‘cytokine strom’ occurring during early syphilis. Following its acquisition, _T. pallidum_ is taken up by dendritic cells, which then trafficked it to draining lymph nodes to present treponemal antigens to naive B cells and T cells. After priming, activated T cells secrete interferon γ, enhancing the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor and IL-6, which in this context may trigger a recurrence of EC-PEL. 删除9：<u>34 </u>It is well established that both HHV8 and human IL-6 contribute to the transformation of infected B cells into PEL. 删除9：<u>35 </u>Globally, IL-6 triggering, temporal association, anatomical co-localisation of syphilis and recurring EC-PEL may infer a causal or contributory role to syphilis in lymphomagenesis during HIV infection.\n\n【40】### Learning points\n\n【41】*   Syphilis may mimic lymphoma by presenting as generalised lymphadenopathy with constitutional symptoms.\n\n【42】*   In this case report, the patient presented with early syphilis concurrently with the recurrence of extracavitary primary effusion lymphoma (EC-PEL) in the rectum, specifically at the site of _Treponema pallidum_ inoculation.\n\n【43】*   Rectosigmoidoscopy with biopsy was key in the diagnosis of lymphoma.\n\n【44】*   Temporal association and anatomical co-localisation of syphilis and recurring EC-PEL may infer a causal or contributory role to syphilis in lymphomagenesis.\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank the patient for his consent and help in reconstituting his complex medical history.

The true incidence of these cysts may be higher, as corroborated by various autopsy series (0.064%–0.18%), as most of them are clinically silent. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>They often present with non-specific clinical and radiological findings and are thus usually incidentally diagnosed. When large, they may present with mass effects resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms. Though rarely associated with malignant changes, they may carry clinically detrimental consequences if misdiagnosed. Cystic adrenal lesions exhibit a broad histomorphological spectrum, ranging from pseudocysts, endothelial cysts, epithelial cysts and parasitic cysts. Pseudocysts are the most frequently identified cystic lesions in surgical series, and endothelial cysts account for the most in autopsy series, up to 45%. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Here we discuss the case of a left-sided adrenal pseudocyst in a young woman, presenting to our department.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A young woman in her 20s, with no known comorbidities, presented to our department with left-sided vague abdominal pain on and off over a period of 3 months. The pain was associated with intermittent episodes of nausea and generalised weakness. There was no history of fever, abdominal distension, weight loss, diarrhoea, constipation, jaundice, haematemesis or melaena. The patient never had similar symptoms in the past, and there was no evidence of similar symptoms in any other members of the family. On clinical examination, she was stable haemodynamically with no palpable organomegaly.\n\n【10】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【11】Laboratory investigations revealed a haemoglobin level of 133 g/L, total leucocyte count of 7.0 x 10 <sup>99 </sup> /L and platelet counts of 147 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Her viral markers were all negativend her coagulation profile was within normal limits. Liver function tests, renal function tests, C reactive protein, plasma and urinary fractionated free metanephrines, anti-citrullinated antibody, rheumatoid factor assay, anti-p-ANCA and anti-c-ANCA were all within the normal range. The patient underwent contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) of the abdomen, which showed a well-defined suprarenal fluid-attenuating lesion  measuring 7.7×7.8 cm in the axial plane and 10.4 cm in the craniocaudal extent, with thin marginal calcification at places. The lesion was superior to the upper pole of the left kidney just abutting the left adrenal gland and posterior to the tail of the pancreas. There was no evidence of any obvious enhancing solid component or any regional lymphadenopathy. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was done, which showed no abnormality.\n\n【12】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【14】A well-defined suprarenal fluid-attenuating lesion (white arrow) measuring 7.7×7.6 cm in the axial plane and 10.4 cm in the craniocaudal extent, located superior to the upper pole of the left kidney just abutting the left adrenal gland and posterior to the left pancreas.</u>\n\n【15】Treatment\n---------\n\n【16】The patient was then provisionally diagnosed as a case of exophytic cystic lesion of the adrenal glands and was planned for exploratory laparotomy with excision of the cyst. The splenic flexure was taken down, and a 10×8 cm cystic lesion was noted in the left suprarenal region , arising from the inferolateral aspect of the left adrenal gland, and was free from the upper pole of the left kidney. The cyst was excised along with a partial left adrenalectomy, and the specimen was sent for histopathological evaluation.\n\n【17】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【18】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【19】(A) The intraoperative image of the cystic lesion, with adherent adrenal tissue (B) and (C) the excised specimen measuring about 10×8 cm.</u>\n\n【20】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【21】The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged by the fourth postoperative day. On macroscopic histopathological examination of the specimen, the specimen had a smooth outer surface, with a focally attached adrenal gland and cut surface showed a unilocular cyst. On microscopic examination , normal adrenal tissue was seen along with a fibrous cyst wall having focal areas of dystrophic calcification. Some areas showed small foci of large round polygonal cells projecting into the lumen and adherent to the cyst wall. The cells showed abundant cytoplasm with small pyknotic nuclei and condensed chromatin. Also, haemosiderin pigment was identified and no evidence of atypia or malignancy was seen. Further immunohistochemistry evaluation showed polygonal cells to be positive for CD68 and negative for inhibin and synaptophysin. Hence, the diagnosis of adrenal pseudocyst was made. The patient is currently asymptomatic at 9 months of follow-up.\n\n【22】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【23】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【24】Multiple sections with normal adrenal tissue along with a fibrous cyst wall having focal areas of dystrophic calcification.</u>\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】A cystic lesion of the adrenal glands was first described in 1670 by Greselius, an Austrian anatomist when it caused death in a patient following the rupture of more than 4 kg of blood and fluid content of the cyst. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Since then, multiple case series and reports have described these lesions with an incidence ranging from 5% to 6% in surgical adrenalectomy specimens, which was lower than in other autopsy series. Adrenal ‘incidentalomas’ identified on imaging may be seen in 5%–9% of the general population, of which an estimated 4%–22% are adrenal cysts. 删除9：<u>5 6 </u>Most of the adrenal cysts are unilateral but around 8%–15% can present bilaterally. 删除9：<u>2 </u>They are most common in the third to fifth decade with a female preponderance (2–3:1) and a size ranging from a few millimetres to as large as 50 cm in some case reports. 删除9：<u>7 8 </u>The larger lesions are traditionally associated with symptoms of a mass effect, displacing the adjacent abdominal organs. They often present with a palpable flank mass, gastrointestinal symptoms, and more commonly, vague abdominal pain as was seen in our case. Larger lesions also have the risk of massive haemorrhage, rupture, cyst infection or arterial hypertension despite negative hormonal status, which is due to distortion of renal vessels and neuroendocrine/vasoactive stimulations. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【27】Cystic adrenal lesions are often associated with a variety of syndromes, including polycystic renal disease, 删除9：<u>9 </u>Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, 删除9：<u>10 </u>Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, 删除13：<u>11 </u>schwannomas, aortic aneurysms, abdominal neuroblastomas and rarely with pregnancy. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Infrequently, metastasis from other organs like the breast, pancreas, lungs and colon can present as cystic adrenal lesions, which need to be evaluated accordingly. 删除9：<u>13</u>\n\n【28】Cystic lesions of the adrenal glands have a wide morphological spectrum, as a result of which, multiple classifications have been attempted. The earliest of these was in 1906 by Terrier and Lecene, 删除13：<u>14 </u>which included haemorrhagic cysts, endothelial cysts, congenital retention cysts, cystic adenomas and parasitic cysts. Further modifications by Abeshouse _et al_ 3 in 1959 and subsequently by Foster 15 in 1966 from an autopsy series have delineated four different subtypes: pseudocysts (39%), endothelial cysts (45%), epithelial cysts (9%) and parasitic cysts (7%). However, when compared with a surgical series of 41 patients by the Mayo Clinic, pseudocysts (78%) were the most frequently identified cystic adrenal lesions. 删除9：<u>16 </u>Both pseudocysts and endothelial cysts are types of vascular-origin cysts, whereas the other two are non-vascular. Also, there exists controversy regarding the classification of the cystic neoplasms arising from the cortex or medulla as some authors argue that they should be classified as pseudocysts owing to the inner cyst wall being devoid of any lining, whereas other authors believed them to have epithelial/neuroectodermal derivation.\n\n【29】Pseudocysts are the second most common subtype of adrenal cysts as per autopsy series (39%), but many surgical series describe them to be the most common. 删除9：<u>3 </u>They are complex cysts, resulting from haemorrhage into the adrenal parenchyma due to trauma, toxins or infections. Other causes include uraemia, pregnancy, Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, acute trauma, burns, adrenal vein thrombosis, syphilis, leukaemia and incompatible blood transfusions. 删除9：<u>15 </u>There may be anomalous vascular and lymphatic channels surrounding them. They are usually unilocular, encapsulated and devoid of inner wall lining, as seen in our case. Sixty per cent of the cases may show calcification within the fibrous capsules. The cyst cavity usually contains blood clots and proteinaceous materials, and no necrotic debris is usually present. A series by Foster describes around 7% association of pseudocyst with neoplastic lesions including adenomas, haemangiomas, pheochromocytomas or malignant haemangioendothelioma. 删除9：<u>15 </u>Other smaller series have estimated it to be as high as 18%–44%. 删除9：<u>17 </u>The pseudocyst usually results from degenerative necrosis and haemorrhage within these tumours. The appearance on imaging in these lesions can vary with the stage of disease progression and is difficult to differentiate from tumours, metastases or abscesses. 删除9：<u>18 </u>There may be septations, blood or a soft tissue component, but these organise with time and evolve into a homogeneous thin-walled collection with eventually an absence of solid components. MRI can also be used in cases with active intracystic haemorrhage, with acute bleeds seen to be isointense and subacute bleeds hyperintense on T1—both being low intensity on T2. 删除9：<u>19</u>\n\n【30】Endothelial adrenal cysts account for 45% of all the cysts as per autopsy series, but the incidence drops to 2%–24% in surgical series, signifying its more incidental nature. 删除9：<u>3 16 </u>They are simple cysts, usually less than 2 cm in diameter, and are thought to arise from pre-existing vascular malformations or ectatic lymphatic channels subsequent to some obstruction. 删除9：<u>3 20 </u>Accordingly, they are subclassified as hamartomatous, angiomatous and lymphangiomatous subtypes. These lesions have a smooth, flattened and non-proliferating endothelial lining, with clear fluid content (usually in lymphangiomatous cases), and are rarely associated with malignancy. Angiomatous cysts are rarer, with only four case reports to date. 删除9：<u>1 </u>On imaging, they are unilateral thin-walled lesions with smooth borders. Lymphangiomatous subtypes may usually have internal septations. Any rim enhancement on CECT may be due to the peripheral compressed adrenal tissue. 删除9：<u>8 19 </u>MRI shows findings similar to simple cysts of other organs, with homogeneous lesions having low T1/high T2 intensity. 删除9：<u>5</u>\n\n【31】Epithelial cysts are true cysts with a reported incidence of around 6%–9%. 删除9：<u>21 </u>They are subdivided into 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> glandular or retention cysts due to the presence of displaced urogenital tissue, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> cystic adenomas and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> embryonal cysts. 删除9：<u>17 22 </u>They are thought to have a mesothelial origin due to positive mesothelial immunostaining. They are differentiated from other simple cysts by the true epithelium lining the flattened wall. Imaging is similar to simple cysts and it is rare to find calcification or enhancement in the walls. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【32】Parasitic cysts are usually echinococcal in origin, and rarely associated with leishmaniasis. 删除9：<u>7 </u>They are commonly associated with hydatid cystic lesions in other organs too. The cysts are thick walled and may or may not have wall calcification, depending on the stage of the lesion. The usual complications seen with liver or spleen hydatid lesions are also seen with adrenal hydatid lesions. The imaging is also typical with the appearance of echo-free cysts, hydatid sands, floating membranes or daughter cysts. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【33】Functional cystic adrenal lesions have also been described in the cortex as well as medulla, and owing to severe implications with pheochromocytoma, a thorough evaluation is a must. About 15% of incidentalomas are functional, with an even lesser number of cystic incidentalomas being functional. 删除9：<u>6 </u>A cystic pheochromocytoma can have negative hormonal screening but CECT shows tumour rim enhancement with a central cystic mass. Also, MRI shows hyperintense lesions in T2 imaging, also called the ‘light bulb sign’. 删除9：<u>5 </u>In cases with a diagnostic dilemma, metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy has 95% specificity for pheochromocytomas. 删除9：<u>13 18</u>\n\n【34】The cysts with solid components can harbour neoplastic lesions ranging from benign adenomas to malignant carcinomas. The risk of malignancy is less than 6% in lesions less than 6 cm in size, 删除13：<u>13 </u>and there is a reported incidence of around 7% typically within pseudocysts. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Most malignant cysts are usually metastasis (95%), followed by pheochromocytoma and adrenal cortical lesions. 删除9：<u>23 </u>CECT is the preferred modality for differentiating these lesions from simple cysts, with MRI beneficial in adrenal adenoma cases. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Hyperattenuating lesions with wall thickness >5 mm, wall enhancement, thick rim or central stippled calcification may suggest malignancy. 删除9：<u>8 18 </u>The 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography can also help in distinguishing adenomas from malignancy. 删除9：<u>13 </u>Table 1 describes the radiological and histological characteristics of common differentials of cystic adrenal lesions.\n\n【35】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【36】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【37】Comparison of various radiological and histological characteristics of cystic adrenal lesions</u>\n\n【38】Owing to the relatively low incidence of cystic adrenal lesions and the usual lack of preoperative pathological diagnosis, ambiguity exists regarding the preferred management for these. Various modalities have been tried, including fine-needle aspiration (FNA), sclerotherapy, surgical resection or cyst marsupialisation. 删除9：<u>1 7 </u>The management includes ruling out the functional status, evaluation for the risk of malignancy by imaging and weighing the benefits of conservative management against potential complications, especially in large cysts. 删除9：<u>23 24 </u>A general agreement exists that cysts larger than 5 cm should be resected due to the potential risk of haemorrhage and secondary complications. Studies recommend surgical resection for lesions, which are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> symptomatic, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> functional, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> greater than 5 cm, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> heterogeneous in nature suggestive of malignancy, 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> parasitic cysts and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> cysts associated with other anomalies like superior vena cava syndrome. 删除9：<u>2 7 </u>Other small asymptomatic lesions can be followed conservatively with imaging by CECT, MRI or ultrasound, but no consensus exists regarding the surveillance protocol. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【39】Percutaneous FNA has a sensitivity of around 85% for detecting malignancy in adrenal cysts. Haemorrhagic aspirate, positive cytology or irregular cyst lining on examination should prompt surgical excision of the lesion. Some lesions might regress completely following aspiration and require only surveillance, but the fluid may reaccumulate in about 30%–50% of cases even after sclerotherapy. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>Decortication or marsupialisation of the cyst can be done with open or minimally invasive techniques, similar to those done in renal cysts. 删除9：<u>25 </u>There is a small theoretical risk of malignant spread or seeding, but it has not been corroborated in any study. Surgical excision can be done with simple enucleation of the cyst, which is the procedure of choice for simple cystic lesions. 删除9：<u>21 </u>In some cases, partial or total adrenalectomy may also be required. Minimally invasive cyst excision can be done laparoscopically or robotically, and have low morbidity and with less blood loss, short hospital stay and better cosmesis. 删除9：<u>26–30 </u>Resection can also provide a specimen for pathological examination, giving a definitive diagnosis and guiding further follow-up.

However, diagnosis and management can be challenging due to their heterogeneous appearance and difficulty in ascertaining the pathological subtype on routine imaging. It is essential to rule out malignancy and functional status when managing these lesions. Any functional lesion, potentially malignant lesion or lesion more than 5 cm should be surgically managed, while other cases can be managed conservatively. Owing to advances in surgical techniques and minimally invasive options, the morbidity and mortality associated with these lesions have been significantly reduced, even when detecting malignancy by imaging is difficult.\n\n【44】### Learning points\n\n【45】*   Uncommon group of lesions which are clinically silent in most cases.\n\n【46】*   Exhibit a broad histomorphological spectrum, ranging from pseudocysts, endothelial cysts, epithelial cysts and parasitic cysts.\n\n【47】*   Ruling out malignancy and functional status is vital to the management.\n\n【48】*   Have a heterogeneous appearance based on the pathological subtype, which can be difficult to ascertain on routine imaging.\n\n【49】*   Any functional lesion, potentially malignant lesion or lesion more than 5 cm deserves surgical management, whereas others can be managed conservatively.\n\n【50】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【51】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【52】Obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:26:17", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:27:02", "cost": 44.649}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:27:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:26:17"}

Following aortic valve resection, mitral valve was clearly visualised by endoscopy through the aortotomy . The midpoint (equidistant from the two commissures) of the free edge of the anterior leaflet was identified. By lifting this area with a retractor, the posterior leaflet was exposed. Its midpoint was also lifted with a retractor. Identification of the midpoints is aided by observation of how the chordae fan out from both leaflets to the anterolateral and posteromedial papillary muscles. The midpoints of the posterior and anterior leaflets were then sutured together using a Gore-Tex CV-4 suture (W. L. Gore & Associates, USA). The suture was placed approximately 4 mm from the free edge of the leaflets. The existing aortic prosthetic valve was replaced with a 23 mm bioprosthetic valve (Carpentier-Edwards pericardial bioprosthesis; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California, USA).\n\n【10】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【11】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【12】(A) Video: Endoscopic surgical findings of a mitral valve clearly visualised by aortotomy.

Following aortic valve resection, mitral valve was clearly visualised by endoscopy through the aortotomy.</u>\n\n【14】Before discharge, postoperative transthoracic echocardiography revealed a mild-to-moderate MR . The patient was discharged home 15 days after surgery. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed a mild-to-moderate MR and increased mean transmitral pressure gradient up to 1.85 mm Hg 6 months after surgery.\n\n【15】The described technique offers a simple way of correcting MR without adding significant time or complexity to the procedure. Although a mild-to-moderate MR with significant aortic stenosis usually improves after AVR, specific patient populations will benefit from a fast and simple repair. In retrospect, a repositioning of an Alfieri stitch might have been more efficient. This approach would be even more attractive for the Alfieri stitch, which is already both fast and simple per se. Therefore, the simplicity of the procedure might promote a more aggressive correction of concomitant MR, and consequently, eliminate late corrections of the residual MR. This innovative approach to MR is particularly valuable in technically challenging cases, such as reoperations and fragile patients.\n\n【16】Several technical concerns should be emphasised. The suture must be placed centrally at a point best identified by pulling the leaflet taught and identifying the decussation point of the chordae from the two papillary muscles on each leaflet. Since no paracommissural sutures are possible, only central MR can be addressed.\n\n【17】The endoscopic view is wider than direct vision through a limited wound and is less affected by the anatomical variations of the patients. To our best knowledge, this case represents the first report of endoscopic transaortic Alfieri stitch via right thoracotomy during AVR.\n\n【18】### Learning points\n\n【19】*   We presented a case of endoscopic transaortic Alfieri stitch via a right thoracotomy during aortic valve replacement (AVR).\n\n【20】*   Endoscopic transaortic Alfieri stitch via a right thoracotomy during AVR is safe and feasible, with potentially improved surgical view.\n\n【21】*   This innovative approach to mitral regurgitation is particularly valuable in technically challenging cases, such as reoperations and fragile patients.\n\n【22】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【23】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【24】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:49:50", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:50:00", "cost": 10.173}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:50:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:49:49"}

The patient has a heart rate (HR) of 60/min and blood pressure of 110/80 mm Hg on the right arm. The surgery went on smoothly, but postsurgery, we noted that he had increased tonicity in his bilateral lower limb and had bradycardia. An urgent CT scan showed a loose piece of bone impinging the cord . However, any signs of lateralisation were absent. The next day, an emergent re-exploration was done, and the anaesthesia workstation monitor showed a pulse rate of range 46–48/min . The piece was challenging to localise intraoperatively. However, the corpectomy window was enlarged, and a suspected bony part adhered to the duramater was removed. As we started the closure with lots of anxiety and fingers crossed, we noted a change in the HR that increased to 90/min, as shown in the monitor . This was the subtle indicator of a successful surgery, and our anaesthesia monitor guided us akin to intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM).

Píšová _et al_ in their literature review spoke about the effects of the endocranial vasculature on the inner surface of the cranial vault. The most common grooves found are those of the course of the middle meningeal artery.

Six weeks prior to presentation, he had received an abatacept injection for the first time. The succeeding doses had been administered weekly. On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 38°C, and poorly demarcated erythematous lesions, measuring less than 5 cm, were noted on his chest and back . Laboratory examination showed a whitecell count of 15.5x10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and a C reactive protein level of 22.3 mg/dL. The tests for anti-nuclear, anti-SS-A, anti-SS-B and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies yielded negative results. Two sets of blood cultures did not grow any bacteria. Ultrasonography revealed hyperechoic areas in the subcutaneous adipose tissue underlying the erythematous region . A skin biopsy of the erythematous lesions revealed diffuse inflammatory infiltrates, composed mainly of neutrophils, in the lobules of the adipose tissue. The elastic fibres of the vessels were preserved . These findings indicated panniculitis without vasculitis. The cultures of the specimens yielded no bacterial growth. The abatacept injections were discontinued and administration of colchicine 1.5 mg/day was initiated. Three days later, the fever and erythema resolved. The patient was treated with colchicine for 14 days, and abatacept treatment was not resumed.

He was advised some topical medications from a local hospital. Family members also tried to remove the stingers with a piece of cloth. Without any remission, he sought a second opinion at our institute. Examination revealed best-corrected visual acuity of 20/30 and intraocular pressure (IOP) of 14 mm Hg in the RE. Slit-lamp evaluation revealed mild circumcorneal congestion, focal corneal oedema with overlying minimal punctate epithelial keratopathy, three intracorneal stingers, mutton-fat keratic precipitates and 3+ cells in the anterior chamber (AC) . Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) further confirmed the exact location of stingers . The RE posterior segment and left eye examination were unremarkable. The patient was started on topical prednisolone acetate 1%, moxifloxacin 0.5%, carboxymethyl cellulose 0.5% and homatropine 2%. A diagnosis of multiple retained corneal bee stingers with secondary intraocular inflammation was made and the need for the removal of stingers was explained. Under topical proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%, a clear corneal incision was made at 10’o clock with a 15-degree knife . With the help of a 23-gauge end-grasping forceps, two stingers were grasped from the endothelial side and removed carefully after injecting a viscoelastic agent in the AC. The remaining intrastromal stinger was removed with a 31-gauge needle from the epithelial side . Four weeks postoperatively, visual acuity in the RE improved to 20/20 (partial) with normal IOP, and resolution of corneal oedema and AC inflammation were noted. Corneal endothelial cell density was within the normal range postoperatively.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】(A) Anterior segment imaging with slit-illumination showing two overlapping corneal stingers (yellow arrow) and a separate stinger (white arrow).

The clinical features include history of tonsillitis, odynophagia, drooling saliva and trismus. An inflamed peritonsillar area and soft palate are the cardinal clinical signs. This abscess can spread to parapharyngeal space leading to risk of airway obstruction and septicaemia. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【6】Septic arthritis of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is rare. Local trauma and infection like otitis externa and parotitis are the common aetiological factors while haematogenesis spread from distant site has also been implicated. _Staphylococus aureus_ , _Streptococcus_ , _Heamophilus influenzae_ , _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Neisseria gonorrhoea_ are the most common organisms responsible for this rare pathology. However, aetiology remains unknown in majority of the cases. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>Majority of these cases respond to treatment but distant spread can occur rarely depending on the general condition of the host and virulence. Unusual spread has been found in the deep neck spaces, epidural space and cerebrum. 删除9：<u>4–6</u>\n\n【7】It is very unusual to find abscess spreading from other head and neck spaces to peritonsillar space. Here, we present the first case report of peritonsillar abscess after septic arthritis of TMJ.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A man in his late 30s is presented with fever, painful swallowing and inability to open mouth for last 3 days. A detailed history revealed that patient suffered pain in the left preauricular area during chewing movement last week. He visited dental outpatient department and diagnosed with internal derangement of left TMJ and advised oral amoxyclavunate and analgesics. However, 删除13：<u>4 </u>days later, he developed severe trismus, and progressive swelling and pain. He was started on parental amoxyclavunate and analgesic. An orthopantogram found anterior dislocation of left TMJ. Three days later, patient had swelling in parotid and temporal area for which he was referred for ear, nose, throat (ENT) consultation.\n\n【10】The examination found grade 1 trismus, oedematous and congested anterior tonsillar pillar and soft palate on left side. Left tonsil and uvula were pushed medially. There was another mild diffuse, tender, non-fluctuant swelling in the left parotid region. The jaw movements were painful. Further examination did not reveal any significant finding. A probable diagnosis of peritonsillar abscess with parotitis was made and patient subjected to further investigations.\n\n【11】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【12】A contrast-enhanced CT revealed a heterogeneously enhancing lesion with faint peripheral enhancement in left masticator, parotid and TMJ spaces causing its widening and anterior and lateral dislocation of condylar process of mandible, suggestive of an evolving abscess . MRI  revealed an altered signal intensity area in the left masticator, pterygoid, parotid and parapharyngeal spaces with bulge in the left tonsillar area. This lesion was heterogeneously hyperintense on T2 with peripheral postcontrast enhancement and central non-enhancing areas. This enhancement was continued up to left TMJ with slight lateral dislocation of the condyle. Haematological and biochemical investigations were normal except for an elevated total leucocyte count (18.0 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L).\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【15】: CT scan showing heterogeneously enhancing lesion with faint peripheral enhancement in left masticator, parotid, pterygomandibular and parapharyngeal spaces suggestive of an evolving abscess.</u>\n\n【16】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【17】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【18】: MRI (coronal section) showing inflammation and abscess in temporomandibular joint, pterygoid and parapharyngeal spaces.</u>\n\n【19】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【20】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【21】: MRI (axial section) showing inflammation and abscess in temporomandibular joint, pterygoid and parapharyngeal spaces.</u>\n\n【22】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【23】The clinical features and investigations were in favour of septic arthritis of TMJ with abscess of various head and neck spaces as mentioned earlier. The diagnosis of acute peritonsillar abscess is straight forward on clinical examination and usually does not require any radiological investigation. Similarly, acute parotitis also does not require any radiology. It is rare to find acute parotitis and acute peritonsillar abscess simultaneously. Immunocompromised state should be checked in such cases while CT and/or MRI should be done to assess abscess in deep neck abscess. Malignancies (leukaemia and extranodal lymphoma) with secondary infection can also present similarly.\n\n【24】Treatment\n---------\n\n【25】The patient was started with intravenous antibiotics (cefipime and ornidazole) and anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac and paracetamol). The mouth opening improved with medication that allowed better view of oropharynx. An incision and drainage of the left peritonsillar abscess was performed. The pus culture did not show any microorganism growth after 48 hours of incubation. Intravenous antibiotics were continued for a week with repetitive dilatation of incision site. Patient was discharged 1 week after significant improvement.\n\n【26】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【27】Two days after discharge, patient came with discharged in the left ear. Examination found purulent discharge coming from the floor of external ear canal (EAC). Tympanic membrane was normal and intact. About 1 mL of pus was drained with dilatation of the pus point which appeared to be from TMJ. Pus culture revealed _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ sensitive to ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, cefotaxime, cefepime and impenem. Patient was infused with ciprofloxacin for 2 days and switched to oral formulation for 5 more days. Follow-up after 2 weeks found complete resolution of the clinical features. Patient was referred to dental OPD for further treatment where he was advised physiotherapy and regular follow-up.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Peritonsillar abscess, also known as quinsy, is a localised collection of pus in peritonsillar space between the tonsillar capsule and superior constrictor muscle. It is the most common deep neck space abscess managed by otolaryngologist. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Peritonsillar abscess is usually seen in adolescent with male preponderance. 删除9：<u>7 </u>The clinical features include odynophagia, muffled voice and fever. Trismus can occur in advance stage when it extends beyond peritonsillar space. Antibiotics with needle aspiration or incision drainage is the treatment of choice. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【30】Septic arthritis of the TMJ is rare. It usually follows trauma, local and haematogenic infection while majority of time aetiology remains unknown. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>Septic arthritis has been reported after tonsillitis, otitis media and otitis externa. 删除9：<u>8–10</u>\n\n【31】Septic arthritis of the TMJ usually presents with fever, pain and swelling around the joint along with restricted jaw movements. The causative microorganisms include anaerobes as well as both gram positive and negative aerobes. CT is the investigation of choice, but MRI is more sensitive especially in early phase. 删除9：<u>1 </u>The treatment is incision and drainage of the abscess or needle aspiration along with broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics till microbial culture and drug sensitivity is available. It needs aggressive treatment to avoid morbidity and fatal complications. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【32】Locoregional abscess formation is an unusual complication of septic arthritis. To our best of knowledge, this is the first case report of the septic arthritis of TMJ presenting with peritonsillar abscess. Gayle _et al_ has reported such unusual complication with involvement of masseteric and pterygomandibular spaces with extension to the left deep temporal region and the skull base. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Wittig _et al_ has reported a case of epidural abscess after septic arthritis of temporomandibular abscess which was managed by craniotomy and drainage. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Doving _et al_ reported cerebral abscess and Lemierre’s syndrome in a man in his early 70s and managed successfully with aggressive treatment. 删除9：<u>6 </u>They found necrotic tissue in masseter muscle, temporal muscle, and pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossa. Cerebral abscess and Lemierre’s syndrome was managed non-surgically.\n\n【33】The cervical fascia divides the neck into various spaces through its deep and superficial layers. These spaces are closely located and communicates with each other. The parapharyngeal space is one of the largest neck spaces extending from base of skull to hyoid. It is bounded by buccopharyngeal fascia medially and parotid laterally. It communicates with smaller neck spaces like masseteric, parotid, peritonsillar, submandibular and retropharyngeal spaces directly while mediastinal communication is through its contents like carotids, internal jugular vein and vagus nerves.\n\n【34】The cervical fascia carries lymphatic channels and act as disease barrier. However, highly virulent microbes or an immunocompromised state exploits these fascial planes to act as easy pathway for the spread of infection to other spaces and finally complications. The parapharyngeal abscess commonly involves masseteric and parotid spaces and vice versa.\n\n【35】The clinical presentation of present case can be explained on these anatomical correlations. Further, the TMJ has very close proximity to the parapharyngeal, masseteric and parotid space and hence its infection can easily spread to these spaces. As stated earlier, the buccopharyngeal fascial forms the medial boundary of the parapharyngeal space and hence this fascia commonly gets inflamed during parapharyngeal infection. As we know, buccopharyngeal fascia together with pharyngeal muscles forms the floor of the tonsil and hence large parapharyngeal abscess presents with medial displacement of tonsil beside the common features of trismus and neck swelling. Authors have observed in their clinical practice that sometimes/rarely parapharyngeal abscess presents more medially in oropharynx than neck and can be drained through tonsillar approach. On these considerations, we can infer that our patient had septic arthritis due to the TMJ injury during chewing that spread to other spaces due to the close proximity and communications between them as stated above. This patient did not have any aetiological factor for development of septic arthritis while other laboratory investigations were normal, still patient developed parapharyngeal abscess and presented with peritonsillar abscess rather than usual cervical presentation, which is quite rare but explainable on anatomical proximity.\n\n【36】In conclusion, this case report emphasises on prompt management of septic arthritis of TMJ and neck abscesses. A CT or an MRI scan with appropriate antibiotics and surgical drainage should be performed so as to avoid further complications.\n\n【37】### Learning points\n\n【38】*   Septic arthritis of temporomandibular joint is a rare but can be potential cause of widespread complications.\n\n【39】*   Acute peritonsillar abscess should be evaluated thoroughly to rule out non-tonsillar causes.\n\n【40】*   Septic arthritis of temporomandibular joint and acute peritonsillar abscess require aggressive management to avoid morbidity and mortality.\n\n【41】*   Suitable radiological investigations in terms of CT or MRI scan are the cornerstone for the ideal management of neck infection/abscess.\n\n【42】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【43】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【44】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:24:44", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:24:59", "cost": 14.707}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:24:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:24:44"}

Purpureal rashes are essentially patches of petechiae. They are commonly described and seen together though petechiae are caused by intradermal capillary bleeding while purpuric lesions result from bleeding within the skin or coalescence of smaller petechiae. A spectrum of pathologies can lead to the appearance of these rashes. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Traditionally purpureal and petechial rashes are due to underlying thrombocytopaenic clotting disorders for instance autoimmune conditions, anticoagulant medications or due to non-thrombocytopaenic factors such as cutaneous blood vessel damage following strenuous exercise, muscular activity such as in marathon runners or after long walks. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>The former conditions require effective clinical management while resting, reassurance is all that is required for activity-induced purpureal and petechial rashes. A high index of suspicion, awareness, focused history, clinical examination and complementary investigations can assist in differentiating between the two scenarios.\n\n【4】Here we present a man in his 60s who developed spontaneous onset exercise-induced petechiae (EIP) of his forearm following railing-assisted squat exercise at a gymnasium.\n\n【5】A man in his sixth decade developed diffuse erythematous, petechial rashes predominantly over the volar aspect of both forearms , and to a lesser extent on the thighs on three successive occasions, after recently starting railing-assisted squats at his gymnasium .

The petechial rashes (1–3 mm) were itchy and of non-blanching nature. Apart from local discomfort, these did not result in any restriction of joint movements and the rashes disappeared spontaneously after an hour, without any residual effect.\n\n【13】Precautionary laboratory investigations for bleeding and clotting disorders (platelet count, bleeding and clotting time, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin clotting time), and the capillary fragility test were normal.\n\n【14】The patient was managed with reassurance and suggested activity modification to prevent a further such episode in the future.\n\n【15】This is the first reported case of EIP on the forearms, after gym exercise. Such lesions have been described before as ‘purpura’ and ‘vasculitis’, which is a misnomer for our case, as the skin lesions were smaller. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>Palpability (ie, the lesion is raised) is an important diagnostic clue for inflammatory conditions such as vasculitis, hence the term ‘palpable purpura’ is used to describe vasculitis. EIP is reported to occur on the lower legs after intense muscular activity, especially in hot weather. It is thought to develop due to venous stasis that is induced by the acute failure of the muscle pump and thermoregulation decompensation, after prolonged and unusual exercise. 删除9：<u>1 </u>These lesions are known to relapse after precipitating exercises. It can also probably represent the fragility of cutaneous blood vessels. EIP is a self-limiting condition which can improve with modification of the exercise regime and does not require any specific management. However, awareness of this entity is crucial to avoid unnecessary anxiety, investigations and treatment.\n\n【16】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【17】‘When I noticed the rash suddenly develop following my gym visit, I was worried. I initially thought it to be due to allergies or due to some insect bite. When it reappeared 2nd and 3rd time after the same exercise, I consulted my doctor. He listened to my story, organised some basic blood tests and suggested modifying how I do my exercises’.

PH is defined by a resting mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of ≥20 mm Hg. In addition, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is defined by a pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of ≤15 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥3 wood units (WU), as assessed by right heart catheterisation (RHC). 删除9：<u>1 </u>Previous studies have shown an incidence of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) between 8% and 35% in PH, increasing as the disease becomes more advanced. 删除9：<u>2–8 </u>In this case report, continuous cardiac monitoring was applied in an end stage PAH patient.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Eight years ago, a woman in her 50s was diagnosed with idiopathic PAH. The mPAP was 48 mm Hg, PVR 10 WU (823 dynes/s/cm <sup>-5 </sup> ), cardiac index 2.3 L/min/m <sup>2 </sup> and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 9 mm Hg. Specific PAH therapy was sequentially increased to include tadalafil, macitentan and treprostinil IV (Chrono five infusion pump device), supplemented with warfarin, spironolactone and long-term oxygen therapy (2 L O <sub>2 </sub> /min). Despite intensified triple therapy including treprostinil up to 34 ng/kg/min, PAH symptoms progressed from WHO functional class (WHO FC) III to IV, with the observation of increasing shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness and palpitations. Four years ago, the patient was listed for bilateral lung transplantation (BLTX). An ECG showed sinus rhythm and right bundle branch block. At the same time, the patient was included in a study with continuous cardiac monitoring with the placement of an implantable loop recorder due to symptoms of palpitations; in order to assess arrhythmias, heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】From the primary diagnosis 8 years ago and until the listing for BLTX 4 years after, the tricuspid regurgitation gradient had increased from 55 mm Hg to 104 mm Hg, and the right atrium and ventricle had become increasingly dilated with reduced right ventricular ejection fraction . At the time of listing for BLTX, the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was reduced to 15 mm. The left ventricle was D-shaped and with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Additional echocardiographic and cardiovascular MR (CMR) data are presented in tables 1 and 2 , these findings likewise supported the diagnosis. Lung function test with forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of 2.3 L (96% of expected) and forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.1 L (109% of expected), while diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was reduced to 58.1%. An N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level of 670 pmol/L was observed. Furthermore, at the time of the listing for BLTX a 6 min walking test was performed with oxygen supplementation of 2 L/min; walking distance was 380 m, and pretest/post-test levels of blood oxygen saturation, heart rate and baseline dyspnoea index were 92%/79%, 87/132 beats per minute and 2/10, respectively.\n\n【14】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【15】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【16】Echocardiography characteristics</u>\n\n【17】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【18】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 2\n\n【19】CMR characteristics</u>\n\n【20】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【21】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【22】Anatomical normalisation in the size of the right atrium and ventricle within 2.5 months.

Echocardiography revealed a highly dilated right ventricle and a tricuspid regurgitation gradient of 60 mm Hg but no other pathology. CT angiography showed no signs of pulmonary embolism. Coronary enzymes were only discreetly elevated, and ECG showed no ST-deviations. The patient was admitted to the PH clinic, and RHC confirmed the diagnosis of PAH with mPAP of 48 mm Hg, PVR of 10 WU and a cardiac index of 2.31 L/min.\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】### BLTX management\n\n【27】The patient deteriorated with increasing dyspnoea despite triple PAH-specific therapy. Due to donor status, the first BLTX had to be aborted after sternotomy. After an additional 6 days, the patient underwent successful transplantation after being listed for urgent transplantation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment was initiated 1 day post-transplantation and continued 4 days due to biventricular heart failure.\n\n【28】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【29】### Heart rhythm and HRV\n\n【30】During continuous cardiac monitoring for 100 days preceding BLTX, unexpectedly no arrhythmias were observed. However, in the first 3 weeks after BLTX, a total of 23 episodes of self-limiting atrial fibrillation (AF) occurred lasting from 6 min to 10 hours . Short-term amiodarone was given until the seventh-day post-BLTX. Apart from 22 min of self-limiting AF, sinus rhythm was stable from week 4 to 36 after BLTX . Two and a half months after BLTX, CMRI showed complete normalisation of cardiac index, end diastolic volume (EDV), stroke volume (SV) and RVEF, left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) .\n\n【31】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【32】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【33】Representation of events before and after BLTX.

In the present patient with end-stage PAH, interestingly no arrhythmias were observed before sternotomy despite disease progression. The patient did experience palpitations and once activated a symptom activator, which revealed sinus tachycardia (120 beats per minute). Additionally, this patient average HRV increased significantly by a mean 17 ms post-BLTX.\n\n【41】Previous studies have shown an incidence of SVT between 8% and 35% in PH, increasing as the disease becomes more advanced. 删除9：<u>3–8 </u>Arrhythmias lead to progression in symptoms of right heart failure and more frequent hospitalisations and restoration of sinus rhythm have shown to be prognostically advantageous. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Several parameters have previously been associated with the development of arrhythmias in PAH, including 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> enlarged right-sided atrial and ventricular volume, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> increased right atrial pressure, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> increased PVR, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> decreased cardiac index, 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> increased NT-proBNP level and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> left atrial diameter. 删除9：<u>3 4 </u>In this case, the left atrial diameter was normal, while all the other parameters were severely affected.\n\n【42】As this patient’s risk for arrhythmias was intrinsically high, it is noteworthy that no arrhythmias were observed preoperatively despite the use of continuous monitoring.\n\n【43】Only in the postoperative period did the patient have transiently occurring arrhythmias, which are a known and common complication to BLTX. 删除9：<u>9 10</u>\n\n【44】As HRV is correlated with the autonomic system, with a low HRV representing high sympathetic tone and low cardiac adaptability, 删除13：<u>11 12 </u>the significant increase (28%) from pretransplantation to post-transplantation could be seen as a sign of increased autonomic balance with less sympathetic activity after the afterload reduction subsequent to BLTX. The same phenomenon seems to be reflected in the decrease in heart rate at night-time. The fact that the onset of change in HRV and heart rate at night-time first occurred after the recovery period from the BLTX emphasise the value of long-term cardiac monitoring and the potential of HRV as a clinical marker of risk. Larger studies are ongoing to assess the prognostic significance of HRV in relation to PAH.\n\n【45】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【46】This is the first presentation of long-term continuous cardiac monitoring in pulmonary arterial hypertension pre-BLTX and post-BLTX. Notably in a patient with terminal PAH, WHO FC IV, no arrhythmias were observed in a 100-day period pretransplantation. Post-BLTX, the patient experienced clinical improvement and CMR showed complete normalisation of cardiac index, EDV, SV, left and right ejection fraction. Interestingly, HRV increased and heart rate at night-time decreased significantly in the post-BLTX period. Especially, the HRV was correlated to this patient’s clinical condition. Continuous cardiac monitoring in PAH not only provides the assessment of arrhythmias but also HRV and heart rate that could be a significant parameter in risk assessment in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n【47】### Learning points\n\n【48】*   Implantation of a loop recorder offers a unique opportunity to long-term monitoring of heart rhythm. Interestingly, no arrhythmias were observed before bilateral lung transplantation in this patient with terminal pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n【49】*   Increasing heart rate variability (HRV) and lower resting heart rate were observed after bilateral lung transplantation.\n\n【50】*   Since HRV and heart rate at night-time correlate with this patient’s clinical condition, they might be of value in risk assessment and guidance of therapy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n【51】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【52】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【53】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:40:53", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:41:32", "cost": 38.853}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:41:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:40:53"}

It revealed that the direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) had been switched from apixaban to dabigatran 2 months before when the doctor in charge of management of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation changed from a cardiologist at a general hospital to his family doctor. He took dabigatran with a large amount of water as his family doctor instructed. However, he used to lie down immediately after consuming the medication. Therefore, we considered dabigatran-induced oesophagitis (DIE). His oral medication was reverted to apixaban, and his condition improved in a few days.\n\n【8】Various drugs have been shown to cause oesophagitis, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, quinidine, doxycycline, tetracycline, clindamycin, ideocyclin, oxytetral ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, alprenolol chloride, theophylline, mycophenolate mofetil, warfarin, cyproterone acetate, ethinylestradiol, rifampin, cefotiam hydrochloride, phenytoin and dabigatran. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Toya _et al_ reported that DIE occurred in 21% of patients who took dabigatran 1 ; furthermore, in the reviewed literature, no cases of oesophagitis induced by DOACs other than dabigatran have been reported. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Dabigatran is prescribed as a relatively large capsule (18–19 mm in length, 删除13：<u>280–390 </u>mg in weight), which can easily get lodged in the oesophagus. 删除9：<u>2 </u>It is reported that the size and weight of the capsule affect the oesophageal transit time, and capsules are more likely to adhere to the oesophageal mucosa compared with tablets. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>Therefore, dabigatran has a tendency to get lodged in the oesophagus. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Dabigatran is the only DOAC containing the eluting tartaric acid core, which can cause oesophageal injury. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Because dabigatran can dissolve in a strongly acidic environment, it has tartaric acid as the core, which is coated with dabigatran etexilate. 删除9：<u>2 </u>The pH of tartaric acid is 2.4; a significantly acidic environment is created. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Instructing patients to take dabigatran orally with a large amount of water and to maintain an upright position for a while after taking it have been reported as effective ways to prevent dabigatran from lodging in the oesophagus. 删除9：<u>2 </u>For patients who cannot continue taking dabigatran due to side effects, switching to another DOAC may be an effective way to improve gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【9】### Learning points\n\n【10】*   Oesophagitis occurs in 21% of patients who took dabigatran; furthermore, in the reviewed literature, no cases of oesophagitis induced by direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs) other than dabigatran have been reported.\n\n【11】*   Dabigatran is the only DOAC containing the eluting tartaric acid core that can cause oesophageal injury.

The episodes of chest pain occurred only at night and during sleep, lasting between 5 and 10 min, waking her up. The patient had been experiencing these episodes for the past 2 months. For this reason, she initiated a 24-hour Holter recording the day before being admitted to our ED, which she was still wearing during her first medical contact in our ED. However, what worried the patient and prompted the visit to the ED was the episode of syncope that occurred shortly after the onset of chest pain during the night, which had never occurred before. Her only cardiovascular risk factor was arterial hypertension, for which she was medicated with losartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities, and she had a normal 12-lead ECG, a normal transthoracic echocardiogram and negative high-sensitivity troponin levels.\n\n【4】Since the patient experienced a chest pain episode during Holter monitoring, tracings were obtained, revealing increasing ST-segment elevation in lead II, followed shortly after by Mobitz I atrioventricular (AV) block and Mobitz II AV block . ST-segment elevation lasted for about 5 min, and syncope occurred during this period. ST changes gradually normalised after the episode, as well as the conduction abnormalities, ending in T-wave inversion.\n\n【5】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【6】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【7】24-hour Holter recording with ST-segment elevation in lead II, Mobitz I atrioventricular (AV) block, and Mobitz type II AV block during an episode of chest pain and syncope.</u>\n\n【8】The patient was referred for coronary angiography, which showed an ectatic right coronary artery (RCA) with mild distal stenosis . As the bradyarrhythmias were short-lived, and the patient was not taking specific medication for Prinzmetal angina (PA), we chose not to implant a pacemaker at this time. There were no further events during the hospital stay, and she was discharged with isosorbide dinitrate 40 mg two times a day, amlodipine 5 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily. As we did not implant a pacemaker, we chose not to administer non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. The patient remained asymptomatic at the 3-month, 6-month and 1-year follow-up consultations, and serial Holter monitoring did not show further repolarisation or conduction abnormalities.\n\n【9】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【10】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【11】Coronary angiography revealing ecstatic right coronary artery with mild distal stenosis.</u>\n\n【12】PA is a clinical condition characterised by chest pain at rest accompanied by ST-segment elevation. In some cases, PA can result in serious complications such as ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, high-degree AV block or sudden cardiac death. 删除9：<u>1 </u>The majority of patients with coronary artery spasm (CAS) predominantly experience symptoms at rest, primarily between 18:00 and 06:00. They also occur in a cyclical manner. CAS episodes tend to be prolonged and relatively resistant to nitrates. They also occur in a cyclical manner. Two-thirds of cases are women, and the condition is unrelated to cardiovascular risk factors. It has recently been demonstrated that CAS reflects the impairment of the vasodilator/anti-aggregatory synergy between nitric oxide and hydrogen sulphide. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Crises of CAS are associated with inflammatory damage to the endothelial glycocalyx layer, resulting in platelet activation and aggregation: this is reversed by infusion of N-acetylcysteine, a hydrogen sulphide donor. Given that the ORBITA trial 3 revealed that stenting of large coronary stenoses was ineffective for the prevention of (exercise-induced) angina, it is conceivable that overt CAS plays a role.\n\n【13】The diagnosis of PA can be made based on symptoms, ST-segment changes during an anginal episode or invasive provocative testing. Holter monitoring is a useful tool for diagnosing PA, as chest pain is only present in 20%–30% of cases of ischaemic ST-segment elevation. 删除9：<u>4 </u>The mainstay of treatment for PA is medical and non-medical therapy, with calcium-channel blockers and nitrates being the primary therapies. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Less is known about the best management of patients with PA who develop bradyarrhythmias, as there are only a handful of case reports. 删除9：<u>6 7 </u>In both cases, pacemaker implantation was decided due to more severe presentation. In our case, ECG changes were inferior and were associated with mild stenosis in the RCA, which increases the probability of AV block (the AV nodal artery usually arises from the RCA). Nonetheless, the presence of AV block could have been complicated by development of torsade de pointes, reason of temporary pacemaker implantation prior to acetylcholine coronary reactivity testing.\n\n【14】However, in our case, medical therapy successfully managed coronary spasm and AV block, leading to symptom-free follow-up. Therefore, pacemaker implantation should be considered only for refractory or severe cases.\n\n【15】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【16】*   These episodes of pain were very bothersome and they made me quite worried. When I fainted, I was really scared and went straight to the Emergency Room. Thankfully, everyone treated me well and since I started taking the medication, I haven't had any more chest pain or fainting spells. Thank you very much!\n\n【17】### Learning points\n\n【18】*   Consider Prinzmetal angina in patients experiencing recurrent episodes of nocturnal chest pain, particularly if it awakens the patient from sleep.\n\n【19】*   Prinzmetal angina may manifest as high-degree atrioventricular block. Patients with high-risk factors for cardiogenic syncope should be admitted for extended electrocardiographic monitoring.\n\n【20】*   Individualised treatment decisions regarding pacemaker implantation are crucial and should consider the patient’s clinical presentation, underlying conditions and risk factors.\n\n【21】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【22】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【23】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:31:21", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:31:38", "cost": 16.843}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:31:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:31:21"}

Physical examination revealed normal contour of the cranium and a normal hairline. The face exhibited a long and narrow profile, but individual features were unremarkable in size, shape or position. Neurological examination was notable for central hypotonia and developmental delay. MRI demonstrated a T2-hyperintense, T1-isointense cortical lesion along the left inferior mesial temporal lobe consisting of cystic and solid components, without reduced diffusivity, and multiple solid enhancing nodules on postgadolinium sequences . The neuroradiographic differential diagnosis included ganglioglioma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, with lesser consideration for pilocytic astrocytoma. A stereotactic biopsy of the lesion was performed, and neuropathological evaluation revealed biphasic neoplastic architecture comprising regions of densely compact eosinophilia and other, more microcystic, areas . Piloid cells and a fibrillar background with focal Rosenthal fibres were visible within the compact eosinophilic areas. Large dysmorphic ganglion cells with vesicular chromatin were interspersed throughout the tumour, in addition to intermixed lymphocytic infiltrates. No significant mitotic activity, necrosis or microvascular proliferation were observed. Immunostaining revealed a mixed population of neoplastic cells, with some neoplastic cells and the fibrillar background immunopositive for glial fibrillar acidic protein and other neoplastic cells immunopositive for synaptophysin and NeuN .

The mechanism underlying DSP is thought to be a compensatory increase in dopamine receptor density in the striatum caused by long-term antipsychotic treatment. Previous animal studies have reported that antipsychotics increase serotonin 5-HT2A receptor density in the striatum and that 5-HT2A receptor blockers suppress dopamine-sensitive psychomotor activity, which may be linked to the pathophysiology of DSP. In this paper, we describe a patient who was hospitalised with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Following treatment with high-dose antipsychotic polypharmacy for 10 weeks, the patient experienced worsening of psychotic and extrapyramidal symptoms. The patient was then started on second-generation antipsychotic asenapine while other antipsychotics were tapered off, resulting in improvement of these symptoms. Retrospectively, we presumed that the high-dose antipsychotic polypharmacy caused DSP, which was effectively treated by the potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonism of asenapine.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   schizophrenia\n*   psychiatry (drugs and medicines)\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

However, their administration requires close monitoring because of their potential to induce a variety of adverse events, which include exacerbation of psychotic symptoms and side effects, such as drug-induced parkinsonism. Of note, dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (DSP) is thought to explain the phenomenon in which patients often relapse following slight dose reductions, discontinuation or switching of antipsychotics. Chouinard _et al_ estimated that 50% of treatment-resistant schizophrenia cases are related to DSP. 删除9：<u>1 </u>A possible mechanism is that long-term antipsychotic treatment causes a compensatory increase in dopamine receptor density in the striatum, which leads to a dopamine supersensitive state. 删除9：<u>2–5 </u>Moreover, recent studies have shown that the prevalence rate of DSP in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia in Japan is as high as 70%. 删除9：<u>6 </u>The differences in the proportions of patients with DSP may be explained by the common use of high-dose antipsychotic polypharmacy in Japan. 删除9：<u>5 7 </u>From the perspective of treatment strategies for DSP, one possible molecular mechanism involves the interaction between dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. Previous animal studies have reported that antipsychotics increase receptor density of serotonin 5-HT2A, a serotonergic receptor subtype, in the striatum and that 5-HT2A receptor antagonists suppress dopamine-sensitive psychomotor activity, which may be linked to the pathophysiology of DSP. 删除9：<u>8 </u>We report a case of a male patient with schizophrenia, who developed DSP following high-dose antipsychotic polypharmacy. Symptoms improved following treatment with asenapine, an atypical antipsychotic that has high 5-HT2A antagonist binding potential.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】Mr A, a single man aged 44 years, suddenly ran outdoors 13 years earlier with the belief that he was contacting his old friend telepathically. He was referred to our hospital that year and we observed symptoms of delusions, hallucinations and castrophrenia. His previous medical history included purulent meningitis in infancy, hyperlipidaemia, hyperuricaemia, hypertension and obesity.\n\n【10】Treatment\n---------\n\n【11】He was diagnosed with schizophrenia (ICD-10 code F20.0) and started receiving antipsychotic therapy at our hospital. He was prescribed maximum doses of risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and aripiprazole at each previous hospitalisation because of a worsening of psychotic symptoms. These maximum doses were taken over to an outpatient setting and gradually reduced to 2 mg/day of risperidone in the last year. He two times experienced rebound psychosis during switching of antipsychotics, 删除13：<u>13 </u>and 6 years earlier. The first episode occurred after switching 8 mg/day of risperidone to 20 mg/day of olanzapine and the second after switching 600 mg/day of quetiapine to 20 mg/day of olanzapine, during which oromandibular dyskinetic movement was observed. These symptoms, alongside a history of high-dose antipsychotic medication, suggest DSP at an earlier period. His latest hospital admission was voluntary and was because of a slight irritation (day 0). Because his symptoms were not causing significant distress, he was followed up without any changes in prescription. However, on day 7, he developed prominent thought disorder, delusions of being injured by broken glass and a variety of visual and auditory hallucinations. Therefore, risperidone was increased to 8 mg/day for the following 2 weeks, and quetiapine was initiated at 200 mg/day (day 17) and slowly increased to 600 mg/day over the next 2 weeks, with an expectation of anxiolytic and sedative drug effects. However, the patients showed inadequate response to these medications. From day 28, risperidone was gradually replaced with olanzapine, and at day 50, olanzapine was increased to 30 mg/day. Despite temporary symptomatic improvement, we observed further aggravation of psychotic symptoms when chlorpromazine equivalence reached 1850 mg (day 59). During the course of the abovementioned antipsychotic medication reinforcement and replacement , he developed extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) of akathisia and stuttering; the latter was suspected to be a tardive dyskinetic movement of the tongue. Given the risk of metabolic side effects and the inadequate sedative effect, quetiapine was tapered and discontinued, while brexpiprazole was gradually increased to 4 mg; however, the patient experienced no symptomatic improvement. We considered using clozapine because the patient met the definition of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and evidence has suggested that clozapine is the treatment of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. 删除9：<u>9–11 </u>However, the patient’s mother did not agree to the administration of clozapine because of fear of side effects, such as agranulocytosis. Finally, he was treated with asenapine, which was initiated at 10 mg/day (day 84) and increased to 20 mg/day (day 93). Olanzapine and brexpiprazole were tapered and discontinued.\n\n【12】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【14】Reinforcement and replacement of antipsychotic medication worsened psychotic symptoms.

He subsequently willingly participated in an occupational therapy programme and was discharged on day 229.\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】In our patient, increasing antipsychotics worsened psychotic symptoms, which was against our expectations. He fulfilled the clinical characteristics of DSP, as reported by Chouinard _et al_ , which are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> improvement in acute psychotic symptoms, at least initially, by increasing antipsychotic dose, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> at least 3 months of cumulative exposure to antipsychotics, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> tolerance to antipsychotic effects, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> rapid relapse following drug discontinuation, dose reduction or switching of antipsychotics, 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> worsening of psychotic symptoms with life stressors, such as minor life events or daily hassles, 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> appearance of new or more severe psychotic symptoms, 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> treatment resistance and 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u> movement disorders, such as tardive dyskinesia. 删除9：<u>5 12 </u>These symptoms were all observed during the most recent hospitalisation. However, his previous experiences of rebound psychosis and oromandibular dyskinetic movement during switching of antipsychotics suggest that he had developed DSP during an earlier period.\n\n【19】We question whether a period of 4 weeks for improvement of the established DSP state with asenapine was too short. A therapeutic course of several months is usually suggested for clinical cases of treatment-resistant schizophrenia with DSP. 删除9：<u>13 </u>However, an animal study demonstrated rapid (within minutes to an hour) suppression of DSP-like activity using a 5-HT2A antagonist, 删除13：<u>8 </u>which corresponds to several hours in humans. 删除9：<u>14 </u>This may explain the rapid therapeutic effect induced by the agent in our patient. In light of this, it is possible that improvement of an established DSP state can be achieved within several days or weeks.\n\n【20】Several human studies have demonstrated that the underlying mechanism of DSP is a compensatory increase in dopamine D2 receptor density in the striatum caused by long-term administration of antipsychotics. 删除9：<u>4 5 </u>Both lower and higher antipsychotic doses have been shown to induce dopamine supersensitive states in animal studies, but only the higher dose increased the number of striatal D2 receptors. 删除9：<u>3 15 </u>Moreover, the relationship between DSP and 5-HT2A receptor function has also been demonstrated in an animal study that showed that chronic exposure to antipsychotic medications increases amphetamine-induced locomotion relative to antipsychotic-naïve rats, which is indicative of a dopamine supersensitive state. In contrast, ritanserin and MDL100,907, both 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, suppress locomotion in antipsychotic-treated rats. Additionally, haloperidol was shown to decrease 5-HT2A receptor density in the prelimbic cortex and nucleus accumbens core and increase 5-HT2A receptor density in the caudate–putamen. 删除9：<u>8 </u>It should also be noted that asenapine exhibits the highest affinity for 5-HT2A receptors within second-generation antipsychotics. 删除9：<u>16 </u>Given these findings, it is possible that, in our patient, DSP was induced by high-dose antipsychotic polypharmacy, and dopamine sensitivity was reduced by 5-HT2A receptor blockade by asenapine. To date, there has only been one report that suggested a positive effect of asenapine on DSP, which was in a patient with delusional disorder whose DSP was thought to have been induced by ziprasidone. 删除9：<u>17</u>\n\n【21】Other than the action on the 5-HT2A system, there are other antipsychotics profiles of note that are closely related to DSP: half-life period, affinity to dopamine D2 receptors and dopamine partial agonists. First, the instability of drug blood levels accounts for the instability of psychiatric symptoms. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Long half-life period, sustained release or long-acting injectable antipsychotics are considered to be effective for preventing DSP because of the stability of blood drug levels. 删除9：<u>18 </u>Half-life periods of representative antipsychotics are 20 hours for risperidone, 删除13：<u>19 7 </u>hours for quetiapine, 删除13：<u>20 33 </u>hours for olanzapine, 删除13：<u>21 91 </u>hours for brexpiprazole 22 and 24 hours for asenapine. 删除9：<u>23 </u>Asenapine has the advantage of a longer half-life period than that of risperidone or quetiapine. Second, antipsychotics that have higher affinity to dopamine D2 receptors are presumed to be effective in the treatment of DSP. 删除9：<u>24 </u>Asenapine has higher affinity to dopamine D2 receptors than that of risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine. 删除9：<u>11 25–27 </u>Finally, according to animal studies, a dopamine partial agonist is likely to be effective for DSP. 删除9：<u>28 29 </u>However, they may exacerbate psychotic symptoms in cases where DSP has already developed. 删除9：<u>30 </u>This would explain why brexpiprazole, which is a dopamine partial agonist, was ineffective in our case.\n\n【22】In conclusion, this case presents an important clinical implication for use of antipsychotic agents. Both long-term use as well as high-dose polypharmacy of antipsychotics should be avoided as much as possible because of their potential to cause DSP due to increases in D2 receptor density and changes in 5-HT2A receptor density across various brain regions. Antipsychotics with strong 5-HT2A antagonism may be effective for the treatment of DSP.\n\n【23】### Learning points\n\n【24】*   This case presents an important clinical implication for the use of antipsychotic agents.\n\n【25】*   Both long-term use and high-dose polypharmacy of antipsychotics should be avoided as much as possible because they may cause dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (DSP).\n\n【26】*   Antipsychotics with potent 5-HT2A antagonism may be effective for DSP.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:43:06", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:44:05", "cost": 58.687}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:44:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:43:06"}

It accounts for only 1.6% of all head and neck malignancies and 0.2%–8% of all MMs. 删除9：<u>1 </u>The significance lies in early detection of the lesion because MM has a poor prognosis, and oral MMs are worse in this regard compared with those on the skin. About a third of all oral MMs are seen on the palate with a definite male gender predilection. They can arise from naevus or pigmented macules or de novo like in this case. Clinical appearance is generally an irregular asymmetric patch >6 mm in size with colour variation and a raised rough surface with a history of constant growth. Oral MM has been classified pigmented or non-pigmented and nodular, macular or mixed depending on the clinical appearance. Regional lymphnode metastasis and distant metastasis to the bone, lungs and liver have also been reported in advanced cases. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Physiologic pigmentation, melanotic macule, smoker’s melanosis, drug-induced melanosis, melanocytic naevus and pigmentation due to systemic causes like Addison’s disease, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, etc may be considered in the differential diagnosis. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Histologically atypical melanocytes, with hyperchromatism and nuclear pleomorphism in the junction of the epithelium and connective tissue together with immunohistochemical markers positive for S-100, HMB-45 are considered confirmatory for the diagnosis of MM. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>Radical excision with disease-free margins is the mainstay of treatment in MM with recurrence in about 20% of cases.\n\n【4】A 60-year-old manreported with black spots in the right side of the palate.

On physical examination, an irregular black patch was seen in the left side of the posterior maxillary alveolus in relation to 1517 region  involving the alveolar mucosa buccally  and the hard palate . The lesion was 3 cm×1.5 cm in size, black in colour interspersed with shades of grey. The borders were irregular but well-defined, surface smooth and it was rough to touch, unscrapable, non-tender on palpation. A provisional diagnosis of MM was made and the patient was subjected to haematologic, radiologic and histopathologic investigations.\n\n【5】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【6】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【7】Irregular brownish-black patch present on the left side of the (A) maxillary alveolus extending both (B) buccally (C) and palatally in relation to molar teeth.</u>\n\n【8】Panoramic radiograph revealed haziness in the right maxillary antrum with the obliteration of the outline of the antral floor .

MM poses a diagnostic challenge as there are no pathognomonic clinical features. Hence, an asymptomatic blackish-brown pigmented patch needs to be excised due to its tendency of rapid metastasis.\n\n【17】Surgical resection is the most preferred treatment modality for oral MM. Though once considered resistant to radiotherapy, adjuvant therapy involves the use of radiation for local control. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Chemotherapy and immunotherapy are other adjuvant therapies which are being used recently with favourable results. 删除9：<u>6 </u>The prognosis is extremely poor with a 5-year survival rate <30% which is attributed to diagnostic delays and distant metastasis. In this case also, the patient delayed undergoing surgery and passed away within 3 months of diagnosis.\n\n【18】MM of the oral cavity is not only rare but also lethal. An oral physician is the most likely person to observe and diagnose this rapidly progressive lesion early and save lives. Therefore, it is imperative to increase awareness among dentists, regarding considering MM in the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic irregular melanotic lesions.\n\n【19】### Learning points\n\n【20】*   Malignant melanoma is an exceedingly rare oral malignancy which is extremely aggressive and a rapidly spreading tumour.\n\n【21】*   The clinical presentation may be misleading due to the asymptomatic nature of the lesion and needs to be investigated thoroughly.\n\n【22】*   Early diagnosis and prompt treatment could be lifesaving as the prognosis is very poor.\n\n【23】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【24】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【25】Consent obtained from next of kin.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:59:48", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:59:53", "cost": 5.833}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:59:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:59:47"}

Little research attention has been directed on pulmonary embolism management in the primary care setting. 删除9：<u>17–19 </u>How the recent expansion of telemedicine in primary care can be applied to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute pulmonary embolism has not been well studied. We explore the utility of telemedicine in a case of comprehensive clinic-based outpatient pulmonary embolism management using video visit, telephone follow-up and secure messaging in a health system with an integrated electronic health record.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A healthy, active woman in her 70s with a remote history of provoked pulmonary embolism presented to her primary care physician (PCP) with 2–3 months of dyspnoea on exertion during the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient is an active open-water swimmer and initially noticed reduction in exercise tolerance, both in the water and when walking up inclines, which she attributed to deconditioning. She also endorsed palpitations and occasional dizziness, but denied chest pain, cough, fevers, syncope and dyspnoea at rest. She had no recent surgery, periods of reduced mobility or known history of malignancy. However, she had a history of provoked pulmonary embolism in the setting of air travel 3 years prior, for which she had completed 3 months of dabigatran. The initial evaluation for this current episode was conducted through secure video visit as in-person visits were limited during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Through video, the PCP noted no acute distress and no laboured breathing.\n\n【11】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【12】Initial outpatient laboratory work-up was ordered on day 1 and completed on day 3. It showed normal complete blood count, thyroid stimulating hormone and elevated D-dimer of 2.41 µg/mL (normal <0.49 µg/mL). Results were transmitted to the patient, who sent a secure message to her PCP reporting mild improvement in symptoms and inquiring about next steps. They discussed by messaging the likelihood of pulmonary embolism. He ordered advanced imaging by CT pulmonary angiography. It was performed the next day (4 days after presentation) and demonstrated new partial filling defects of the distal right upper lobe pulmonary artery. Prior hypercoagulable work-up was negative. COVID-19 testing was declined based on self-assessed low-risk exposure from strict social distancing adherence.\n\n【13】Treatment\n---------\n\n【14】At the end of the imaging study, the patient waited on campus while the radiologist called the PCP with the results. The PCP then spoke by phone with haematology, who advised indefinite anticoagulation therapy in the setting of recurrent pulmonary embolism. Age-appropriate cancer screening and COVID-19 testing were also recommended. The PCP called the patient, discussed the results and directed her to the pharmacy on campus to pick-up the rivaroxaban he ordered. He also submitted a referral for a haematology appointment.\n\n【15】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【16】The pharmacy-led anticoagulation management service provided next-day patient education by telephone and supplemental instructions sent by secure messaging. She had a secure video visit with haematology 1 week after her pulmonary embolism diagnosis. This second haematologist agreed with the earlier recommendation of indeterminate anticoagulation. After 1 month of rivaroxaban, the patient learnt that its reversal agent was less accessible in many hospitals than idarucizumab, the agent designed for dabigatran reversal. She then requested switching to dabigatran, with which she has continued treatment. She has experienced no bleeding complications nor recurrence of venous thromboembolism.\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the utilisation of telemedicine as healthcare systems grappled with restrictions on in-person evaluation. 删除9：<u>20 </u>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the US Department of Health and Human Services have also incentivised telehealth with waivers related to reimbursement and liability. 删除9：<u>21 22 </u>One cross-sectional analysis found a 35.3% increase in telemedicine use along with a 21.4% decrease in office visits and fewer laboratory testing during the second quarter of 2020, suggesting both structural changes in healthcare delivery and associated challenges. 删除9：<u>23</u>\n\n【19】### The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in primary care\n\n【20】Many professional societies recommend evidence-based, high-value diagnostic strategies for the evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism using validated clinical prediction rules (eg, Wells criteria) and selective probability-driven D-dimer measurements. 删除9：<u>24–27 </u>Such a risk-stratified approach has been externally validated in the primary care setting. 删除9：<u>28 29 </u>The PCP in our case followed this internationally endorsed approach.\n\n【21】The time from initial presentation in primary care to diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism varies widely. The evaluation can be prolonged if a pulmonary embolism diagnosis is not pursued until after diagnostic tests for other conditions (eg, chest radiographs for pneumonia) fail to explain the symptoms. Most in-person work-ups for acute pulmonary embolism (starting with the initial presentation) are completed within 7 days, though about 25% run longer. 删除9：<u>30 31 </u>We would not expect a telemedicine approach to greatly differ in duration. Our patient’s diagnostic evaluation was completed within 5 days, which is within the normal range of in-person work-ups described in the literature. The British Thoracic Society guideline recommends that ‘patients with suspected (pulmonary embolism) should, where reasonably practical, undergo investigation on the same day of presentation to exclude a diagnosis of (pulmonary embolism).’ 14 US guidelines across multiple specialties do not include similar temporal parameters. 删除9：<u>24 26 32–34</u>\n\n【22】### Eligibility for telemedical care of acute pulmonary embolism\n\n【23】Telemedicine for pulmonary embolism management in the primary care setting has not been well described in the literature. Our case sheds light on this novel approach. This patient was particularly well-suited to video-based outpatient diagnosis and treatment because of her familiarity with technology, established PCP relationship, access to advanced imaging and laboratory testing, as well as prior pulmonary embolism and anticoagulation experience. Additionally, the patient’s ready access to close follow-up and her PCP’s timely responses via secure messaging and telephone both facilitated outpatient management.\n\n【24】Although the PCP did not document any formal risk evaluation in the electronic health record, the patient appears to have met low-risk criteria for outpatient management from the American College of Chest Physicians: ‘clinically stable with good cardiopulmonary reserve; no contraindications…; expected to be compliant with treatment; and the patient feels well enough to be treated at home.’ 13 She also likely met outpatient criteria of the Hestia clinical decision rule, if we assume that continued ocean swimming and absence of dyspnoea at rest suggest haemodynamic stability and pulse oximetry ≥90%, though this correlation has not been studied. 删除9：<u>35</u>\n\n【25】Home measurement of her vital signs would have helped complete her outpatient eligibility assessment. Obtaining heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature at home have been possible for many years. The ability to accurately measure pulse oximetry at home is a more recent development, following the advent of reliable portable devices. 删除9：<u>36 </u>Smart phones may also soon be used for pulse oximetry measurements. 删除9：<u>37 </u>The increasing availability of reliable home vital sign measurements may open the door for research on selective in-home use of risk stratification triage tools, like the Hestia decision rule and the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index. 删除9：<u>9 35 38 </u>Some insurance companies cover the costs of remote patient monitoring devices, such as pulse oximeters and blood pressure monitoring devices. Reimbursement may continue to expand with the modernisation of telehealth.\n\n【26】### Comprehensive primary care-based pulmonary embolism management\n\n【27】This case report adds to the emerging literature describing comprehensive pulmonary embolism management in the primary care setting, including 3 in-person cases. 删除9：<u>17–19 </u>All 3 patients did well and developed no recurrent venous thromboembolism or bleeding complications. These cases met Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index and Hestia eligibility criteria for outpatient management. As in our current case, their PCPs also had ready telephone access to on-call haematologists and pulmonologists for consultation. The patients received prompt anticoagulation therapy with supplemental education and long-term monitoring by pharmacy-led anticoagulation management services, a centralised model adopted by many institutions. 删除9：<u>39</u>\n\n【28】### The promises and limitations of telemedicine\n\n【29】The scope of telemedicine has progressed since the American College of Physicians 2015 recommendation on telemedicine use in primary care citing the technology’s potential to improve access to care and patient satisfaction and to reduce cost. 删除9：<u>3 </u>As the COVID-19 pandemic catalysed telemedicine’s rapid expansion from niche to necessity and revolutionised the structure of primary care, 删除13：<u>23 40 </u>important limitations including access, quality and adoption must be considered. While telemedicine aims to increase access to care, particularly in rural and underserved areas, persistent inequities exist, including age, socioeconomic status, disability, level of education, smart device literacy, bandwidth and broadband access. 删除9：<u>4 41–43 </u>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses reveal that telemedicine is likely comparable with in-person visits for certain services, such as mental health and rehabilitation, although is likely less effective for others, such as dermatology. 删除9：<u>44</u>\n\n【30】With regard to acute pulmonary embolism management, the current literature is sparse on using telemedicine to evaluate acute complaints in general. 删除9：<u>45 46 </u>The benefits of quick access via telemedicine are pitted against the absence of a complete physical examination. For this patient, missing critical objective components include a complete set of vital signs and detailed cardiopulmonary and extremity examinations. While additional testing including a 12-lead ECG and two-view chest radiograph may partly remedy initial examination shortcomings, these are predicated on timely access to diagnostic testing. As discussed above, the emergence of reliable tools for home vital sign measurements may help broaden the capacity of telemedicine. Elements of a proposed pathway for the telemedical evaluation of possible deep vein thrombosis may be adaptable for a similar pulmonary embolism pathway. 删除9：<u>47</u>\n\n【31】Telemedicine expanded in 2020 as a convenient means of providing healthcare without increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Given an eligible patient in the right care setting supported by adequate resources and infrastructure, this case raises the possibility that telemedicine may be used safely and effectively to diagnose and manage select cases of acute pulmonary embolism without the need for transfer to a higher level of care. However, one case report cannot justify wholesale a new pattern of care. Research should be undertaken to establish the safety and effectiveness of this approach and to identify patients who are best suited for telemedicine management. How well triage tools like the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index and the Hestia criteria might perform to identify patients with acute pulmonary embolism eligible for telemedical care without complete physical examination data is unknown. Expanding these questions beyond acute pulmonary embolism to other acute care conditions raises questions about which patients with which complaints in which care settings are eligible for comprehensive telemedical care. More research is needed to help us understand the possibilities and limitations of telemedicine in the management of patients with high-acuity complaints, including pulmonary embolism, and to ensure equitable patient access and outcomes. Preference for using telemedicine will likely remain higher after the pandemic, but the degree to which it is used or useful in a non-pandemic period is not yet clear.\n\n【32】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【33】I loved the flexibility of speaking with my PCP in a video visit. Having the visit virtually was convenient and by far the safer approach in a pandemic, many months before COVID-19 vaccinations were available. I was especially glad to avoid a trip to the emergency room — at no point did I have that ‘dread’ feeling that compels one to hightail it to the ER.\n\n【34】### Learning points\n\n【35】*   Telemedicine, including real-time patient–physician video visits, and asynchronous secure message exchange, was used to successfully coordinate outpatient primary and specialty care for a patient with acute pulmonary embolism without transfer to the emergency department or hospital.\n\n【36】*   This virtual approach to low-risk pulmonary embolism management is a particularly convenient means of providing healthcare without increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure or the burden on the emergency department.\n\n【37】*   This novel approach to the management of acute pulmonary embolism has never been studied and is not ready for broad clinical application. More research is needed to help us understand the possibilities and limitations of telemedicine in the management of patients with acute pulmonary embolism and other acute care complaints and diagnoses.\n\n【38】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【39】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【40】Obtained.\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank our patient for her enthusiastic participation.

Following this, patients are routinely treated with 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), unless there is a bleeding contraindication. In patients who require non-cardiac surgery while on DAPT, several considerations need to be balanced to manage risks to patients and overall outcomes.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A man in his 70s presented to our hospital via the primary acute myocardial infarction (MI) pathway having woken up at 04:00 with central chest pain radiating to both arms. His medical history included chronic kidney disease stage 3, hypothyroidism and osteoporosis with previous right inferior pubic ramus fracture 15 years previously. A 12-lead ECG demonstrated anterior ST elevation. He was loaded with 300 mg aspirin. During his transfer to hospital, he suffered a ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after a single cycle of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and a single direct current shock. Following this, he reported severe left leg pain.\n\n【10】Differential diagnoses\n----------------------\n\n【11】The primary diagnosis was confirmed as anterior STEMI on the basis of persisting anterior ST elevation on 12-lead ECG and anterior wall hypokinesis on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Due to pain in multiple limbs (both arms and left leg) in the setting of chest pain, an acute aortic syndrome was considered as a differential; however, there were no echocardiographic features to support the diagnosis. On clinical examination, there was no radio-radial delay and on palpation of the femoral pulses, which were present and equal, there was extreme tenderness in the left groin. The patient’s left leg appeared shortened and externally rotated. Therefore, in addition to the anterior STEMI, there was a high clinical suspicion of hip fracture.\n\n【12】Given the clinical urgency of performing coronary angiography, the patient was given a second antiplatelet drug (prasugrel) and immediately taken to the cardiac catheter laboratory.\n\n【13】Coronary angiography demonstrated mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery occlusion . Primary PCI to the culprit lesion with a single drug-eluting stent was performed, achieving an excellent angiographic result . Due to a large thrombus burden in the distal LAD, the patient was further treated with a glycoprotein IIB/IIIA infusion. There was no significant bystander coronary artery disease. The patient was started on DAPT. Formal TTE following PCI demonstrated preserved left ventricular ejection function (58%), with akinesis of the apex and septum.\n\n【14】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【15】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【16】Coronary angiography.

From an orthopaedic perspective, the fracture would be best managed with open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) surgery within 2 weeks. However, a long operation (estimated 4–5 hours) in the context of recent MI and DAPT was considered high risk from both an anaesthetic and bleeding perspective. The cardiology team were happy for an operation to be considered 7 days following MI, which would have allowed surgical management within the proposed 2-week time frame. However, it was considered too risky to discontinue DAPT due to potential acute stent thrombosis, putting the patient at high surgical bleeding risk. An alternative conservative approach of 6–8 weeks of bed rest, and the associated potential complications of this, were also considered.\n\n【23】Given the risks associated with both ORIF and conservative management, a hybrid strategy of an initial CT-guided percutaneous closed reduction screw fixation of the fracture, providing pain relief and facilitating mobilisation, followed by a staged definitive total hip replacement in due course, were decided on. The procedure was successfully performed, with a long lag screw and two supra-acetabular screws stabilising the fracture . Following the procedure, the patient had a significant reduction in his analgesia requirement. He was kept NWB on his left leg for 8 weeks, but was able to mobilise independently using a rollator frame. He was discharged 20 days after his MI and 6 days after his orthopaedic procedure.\n\n【24】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【25】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【26】Closed reduction and screw fixation of left acetabular fracture.

He will be routinely followed up by the cardiology team. Community cardiac rehabilitation and physiotherapy were arranged.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】In this case report, we have described the management of a complex acetabular fracture following defibrillation due to acute MI-induced ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. We believe this to be the first confirmed case report of acetabular fracture secondary to defibrillation. Non-traumatic acetabular fractures are very rare, but can occur following forceful contraction of the pelvic muscles. A previous case report described an acetabular fracture in the context of both a tonic–clonic seizure and defibrillation following MI, but whether the fracture was secondary to either the seizure or cardioversion remained unknown. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Other case reports have highlighted both subtrochanteric 2 and trochanteric 3 femoral fractures following electrical cardioversion. In all of these cases, patients had either osteoporosis or previous femoral fracture. In our case, the patient had both osteoporosis and a previous contralateral pelvic fracture, putting him at particularly high risk. This case highlights a small, but relevant, risk of fracture following defibrillation or cardioversion in patients with either osteoporosis or previous fracture, which should be investigated if patients reported pelvic/hip pain following a shock. In cases of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, patients should receive immediate treatment including defibrillation as per Advanced Life Support guidelines 4 ; however, the use of muscle relaxants may be considered in the context of elective cardioversion. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【30】Around 100 000 PCIs are performed in the UK each year. 删除9：<u>5 </u>The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends (IA recommendation) 12 months of DAPT, with a P2Y <sub>12 </sub> inhibitor on top of aspirin, for 12 months following acute MI with coronary stent implantation, to reduce the risk of both stent thrombosis and restenosis. 删除9：<u>6 </u>The risk of stent thrombosis and restenosis is significantly lower with newer generation drug-eluting stents, such as was implanted in this case, but DAPT is still necessary. It has been estimated that between 5% and 25% of patients with coronary stents will require non-cardiac surgery within 5 years of stent implantation. For patients still on DAPT, several aspects must be considered. These include: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> risk of stent thrombosis if DAPT is stopped, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> complications associated with surgical delays while still on DAPT and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the bleeding risks associated with performing surgery on DAPT. 删除9：<u>6 </u>In the acute phase following MI, the anaesthetic risk must also be considered. Optimal management strategies must consider and evaluate all of these variables, alongside patient preference.\n\n【31】In our case, the consensus decision was that given the acute timing of stent implantation, stopping DAPT would be very high risk for stent thrombosis. Given pelvic ORIF surgery is associated with high bleeding risk, the orthopaedic team were unable to proceed while the patient was on DAPT. Conservative management with 6–8 weeks of bed rest was considered, but was not deemed optimal as it would have left the patient in considerable pain and at risk of potentially life-threatening venous thromboembolism secondary to immobilisation. A hybrid staged approach was adopted, with the fracture stabilised percutaneously, which was performed with the patient on DAPT. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to identify a clear time frame for when patients can stop DAPT following coronary stenting with no or an acceptably low additional risk of undergoing surgery. In patients at high ischaemic risk due to a previous acute coronary syndrome presentation, the ESC recommends delaying surgery for 6 months following stent implantation if possible and the continuation of aspirin perioperatively if bleeding risk allows and to resume DAPT as soon as possible. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【32】### Learning points\n\n【33】*   Pelvic and femoral fractures are a rare, but recognised, complication of electrical cardioversion/defibrillation in patients with a background of osteoporosis or previous fracture.\n\n【34】*   For patients who require non-cardiac surgery while on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the risk of stent thrombosis if DAPT is stopped, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the risk of surgical delays associated with patients being on DAPT and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> bleeding risks associated with surgery while on DAPT, must be considered.\n\n【35】*   A multidisciplinary team approach is required when managing patients with multiple pathologies requiring intervention.\n\n【36】*   Percutaneous closed reduction screw fixation of acetabular fractures can be performed while patients are on DAPT, and this can be used to bridge the required DAPT period prior to definitive surgical management.\n\n【37】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【38】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【39】Obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:05:18", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:06:18", "cost": 59.739}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:06:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:05:18"}

Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies are strongly associated with NLE. Anti-La/SSB and anti-U <sub>1 </sub> \\-RNP antibodies are less frequent. Cutaneous and cardiac manifestations are prominent of NLE. Nearly half of the cases show either cutaneous or cardiac features, and 10% show both. Skin lesions may be congenital or develop within 12–16 weeks postpartum. Commonly, the lesions are characterised by erythematous scaly papules or plaques with annular or polycyclic configuration principally affecting the face and scalp, followed by the trunk and extremities. Characteristic periorbital involvement is described as ‘raccoon eyes’ sign. These lesions usually resolve within a year. Uncommonly, vitiligo-like, morpheaform, erythema multiforme-like, atrophic-telangiectatic, purpuric and discoid-atrophic lesions are seen. Acral papular and bullous lesions have also been described. Cardiac involvement usually develops in the second trimester and is characterised by irreversible complete heart block necessitating pacemaker in almost all the cases. A transient thrombocytopenia occurs in 20% of the cases accounting for the purpuric lesions. 删除9：<u>1–4 </u>Here, we report a case of NLE with various types of skin lesions in a newborn of an asymptomatic mother who was incidentally found to have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n【4】A full-term male neonate was brought with lesions on the face and trunk since birth.

Also noted on the abdomen was a smooth atrophic hypopigmented plaque with polycyclic erythematous margin, central telangiectasia and areas of brown pigmentation reminiscent of morphoea . Bilateral periorbital erythematous-hypopigmented patches were seen  and the back revealed multiple hyperpigmented atrophic plaques . Rest of the cutaneous and systemic examination was normal.

Both the mother and baby were positive for Ro/SSA and La/SSB antibodies.

Swift postpartum recognition of a pseudoaneurysm is essential to prevent a potentially life-threatening outcome. Successful diagnosis and treatment of the patient’s symptoms required interdisciplinary teamwork between obstetricians, interventional radiologists and haematologists. Uterine artery embolisation (UAE) was performed and complete resolution of the pseudoaneurysm was noted 6 weeks after the procedure. Haemorrhage was averted due to early detection of UAP prior to its rupture, and future fertility was preserved.

Type 1 vWD is the most common of these, and accounts for approximately 80% of cases. In type 1 vWD, levels of vWF can be either minimally to moderately decreased, whereas type 3 vWD is characterised by severely low or undetectable levels of vWF. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Type 2 vWD involves a qualitative deficiency of vWF, which is characterised by normal to near normal levels of vWF, but functional deficiency of the protein itself. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【8】Pregnant women with vWD are at a significantly higher risk of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) than pregnant women at baseline. 删除9：<u>3 </u>In the setting of concurrent uterine artery pseudoaneurysm (UAP), an obstetric case can quickly become fatal. A pseudoaneurysm is a blood‐filled cavity communicating with the arterial lumen due to a deficiency of one or more layers of an arterial wall. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Trauma to the uterine artery during perforation (such as during surgery) leads to a defect in the arterial wall, through which arterial blood escapes and diffuses through adjacent tissue, causing a collection of blood to form. When this collection is in continuity with the uterine artery which supplies a continuous flow of blood, a pseudoaneurysm forms. 删除9：<u>5 </u>The absence of a three‐layered arterial wall lining in the pseudoaneurysm differentiates it from a true aneurysm. 删除9：<u>6 </u>The prevalence of UAP is difficult to determine due to its rarity; however, the prevalence is cited as 2–6 per 1000 deliveries when asymptomatic patients are included. 删除9：<u>7 8 </u>Spontaneous evolution of a pseudoaneurysm can lead to rupture. UAP can occur after caesarean delivery, especially when there is arterial injury during the procedure. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Pseudoaneurysm rupture is a rare cause of PPH, which can occur up to 3 months after caesarean delivery. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Common misdiagnoses include hypermenorrhoea, retained products of conception or endometritis.\n\n【9】While the risk of increased bleeding in pregnant patients with type 1 vWD has been well documented, and the risk of PPH in patients with pseudoaneurysm is well established in the literature, delayed PPH resulting from UAP in patients with vWD is only rarely reported, and there are no standardised recommendations to guide management in these situations. Notably, the patient in that case was found to have vWD after she presented with a PPH. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【10】We present a case of a delayed PPH due to a UAP in the setting of vWD. We also discuss detailed strategies for preventing peripartum haemorrhage and PPH in patients with vWD, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of UAP in a postpartum patient.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A woman in her early 20s, gravida one para one, with a history of type 1 vWD, underwent a primary caesarean delivery for arrest of descent and cephalopelvic disproportion, complicated by acute chorioamnionitis. The patient was followed by haematology throughout her pregnancy and had no history of antepartum bleeding. At the time of admission for induction of labour, she received Humate-P (antihaemophilic factor-vWF (coagulation factors)) prior to delivery and Amicar (antifibrinolytic agent) following delivery for bleeding prevention. The caesarean delivery itself was uncomplicated, with an estimated blood loss of 850 mL. The preoperative haemoglobin (Hb) level was 112 g/L, and Hb level at discharge on postoperative day 2 was 95 g/L. This was considered an appropriate decline on the basis of the estimated blood loss during her surgery. No other haemostatic agents were required during her postpartum hospital stay.\n\n【13】The patient presented to the obstetric emergency room on postoperative day 35 with heavy vaginal bleeding, nausea, diarrhoea, and both periumbilical and right lower quadrant abdominal pain. She was afebrile and vital signs were within normal limits. Abdominal examination revealed a skin incision without erythema or warmth and there was mild tenderness to palpation along the incision and in bilateral lower quadrants. She had normoactive bowel sounds and the uterine fundus was palpated 3 cm below the umbilicus and moderately tender. There was no evidence of guarding or rebound. Pelvic examination was significant for bright red blood in the vaginal vault. Her Hb level on admission was 101 g/L and white cell count was 79x10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. A urine pregnancy test was negative. Based on these findings, there was a low suspicion for the more common causes of delayed PPH, such as endometritis, retained products of conception, or gestational trophoblastic disease or neoplasia.\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】A pelvic ultrasound revealed a 1.8 cm hyperechoic area at the level of the uterine fundus, and colour Doppler showed prominent vessels around the superior, anterior and posterior aspect of the hyperechoic area, suggestive of arterial malformation . An emergent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with intravenous contrast, which revealed a hypervascular structure within the fundus of the endometrial cavity measuring 1.6×1.0×1.4 cm.

Fertility was preserved, and the patient conceived again approximately 12 months later. She had an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivered by repeat caesarean section at term.\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】PPH is the most common cause of maternal death worldwide, 删除13：<u>9 </u>and prompt recognition, diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent poor outcomes. Primary PPH occurs within 24 hours of delivery and is caused by uterine atony in 80% of cases. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Secondary PPH occurs from 24 hours to 6 weeks after delivery, and is usually due to retained products of conception, infection, delayed involution of the placental bed or bleeding disorders. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Appropriate workup should be performed to rule out these common aetiologies. In a stable patient, imaging should be conducted prior to diagnostic dilation and curettage, as this operation could cause significant harm to a patient with a uterine vascular malformation, and potentially lead to catastrophic bleeding.\n\n【34】Bleeding due to a UAP is a rare cause of delayed PPH. 删除9：<u>9 </u>The most common presenting symptoms of UAP are abnormal vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. Caesarean delivery is the greatest risk factor for having a UAP. Spontaneous haemostasis can occur, reinforcing a misdiagnosis, and there can be a delay of up to 4 weeks before recurrence of bleeding. 删除9：<u>4 5</u>\n\n【35】Our patient developed a UAP in the setting of type 1 vWD. In a case report of a PPH due to UAP in a patient with vWD, the patient endured significant blood loss, likely because the diagnosis of vWD was not known prior to delivery, and delayed evaluation of the patient’s postpartum bleeding led to rupture of the pseudoaneurysm. In our case, a prenatal diagnosis of vWD facilitated preventive measures to avert heavy bleeding. Her pre-existing diagnosis of vWD also led to a heightened awareness of her increased risk of delayed PPH, which in turn prompted early imaging at the time of her presentation to the emergency room. This allowed for early detection of her pseudoaneurysm and likely prevented its rupture, which is associated with significant blood loss when it occurs. The finding of a pseudoaneurysm in a patient without a history of bleeding disorders should prompt an evaluation for possible bleeding disorders. 删除9：<u>10</u>\n\n【36】Pregnant women with type 1 vWD should be co-managed with a haematologist throughout pregnancy. Measurement of factor VIII and vWF levels is recommended and treatment should be administered when the factor VIII level is less than 25% of its normal range and the vWF level is below 50 IU/dL. 删除9：<u>11 </u>However, providers may also prophylactically treat in the late stages of labour and 3–4 days post partum if there is concern for bleeding despite normal levels of vWF and factor VIII. The treatment most commonly offered is intranasal desmopressin, a synthetic vasopressin that increases levels of vWF and factor VIII. 11 vWF/factor VIII concentrates have also been developed and are approved for use as an alternative therapy. Our patient received Humate-P (antihaemophilic factor-vWF) 50 units/kg intravenous loading dose with maintenance dose 20–30 units/kg intravenously at delivery, with repeat dosing every 12 hours for 72 hours post partum. She received Amicar 8000 mg every 6 hours orally for 48 hours. Additionally, the patient was prescribed Humate as needed to treat any acute onset of heavy bleeding in the outpatient setting.\n\n【37】Non-operative vaginal delivery is the preferred mode of delivery for patients with vWD; however, caesarean delivery should still be performed for usual obstetric indications. 删除9：<u>11 </u>Our patient had a primary caesarean delivery for arrest of descent in the setting of cephalopelvic disproportion.\n\n【38】For the detection of a pseudoaneurysm, B-mode imaging usually shows an anechoic lesion in the wall of the lower uterus, which may be pulsatile. Duplex Doppler ultrasound shows a mosaic flow pattern due to the arterial flow swirling in different directions and at different velocities. 删除9：<u>4 5 </u>Sonographic features may disappear during active bleeding due to arterial pressure deflation and spastic communication, especially when the pseudoaneurysm is small in diameter. Contrast‐enhanced CT or MRI may be used to confirm the diagnosis as its sensitivity to detect arterial lesions is comparable with angiography. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Angiography remains the gold-standard method for the diagnosis of UAP, and may facilitate definitive treatment. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Traditional management of UAP includes bilateral internal iliac or uterine artery ligation, and, when other treatments fail, hysterectomy. Transcatheter selective arterial embolisation has recently emerged as a safe and highly effective treatment due to its high success rate (>90%), low complication rate and its ability to preserve future fertility. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【39】Major complications following UAE are rare. About 8.5% short-term and 1.25% serious complication rates have been reported to date. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Postprocedural imaging is routinely performed to evaluate effectiveness of treatment and to identify potential post-UAE complications. For our patient, a surveillance CT angiogram was performed 6 weeks after UAE, with complete resolution of the pseudoaneurysm noted. The patient conceived again approximately 12 months later.\n\n【40】This case illustrates a scenario in which appropriate preventative measures were taken before delivery, during labour and in the postpartum period in a patient with known type 1 vWD. Postpartum vaginal bleeding or pain in a patient with known vWD should raise concern for pseudoaneurysm in the differential diagnosis. Appropriate workup for early detection and treatment with UAE is necessary to avert severe haemorrhage. This patient recovered well and was discharged home for outpatient surveillance the day after UAE was performed.\n\n【41】### Learning points\n\n【42】*   Uterine artery pseudoaneurysm is a rare complication of pregnancy or surgery, particularly caesarean delivery, and usually presents with abnormal vaginal bleeding and abdominal or pelvic pain.\n\n【43】*   Patients with von Willebrand disease (vWD) are more prone to developing uterine artery pseudoaneurysm and may experience catastrophic bleeding with pseudoaneurysm rupture. Optimising medical management of vWD, consulting with haematology and early detection of pseudoaneurysm with imaging such as ultrasonography with Doppler, CT or MRI are critical to avoid a misdiagnosis or delay in care.\n\n【44】*   Uterine artery embolisation is the treatment of choice when a pseudoaneurysm is identified. Surveillance angiogram is important to ensure resolution.\n\n【45】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【46】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【47】Obtained.\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We fully acknowledge the contribution of our patient to this work and appreciate her consent to share her medical journey.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:23:08", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:24:22", "cost": 73.206}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:24:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:23:08"}

The diagnosis is made clinically, relying heavily on characteristic physical findings. Signs of venous congestion, such as elevated jugular venous pressure, are nearly ubiquitous; however, a minority of heart failure patients present with a high-output state, which may produce additional, unique physical findings, such as Quincke’s pulse. When heart failure occurs in combination with high-output physiology, it is known as high-output heart failure.\n\n【8】Quincke’s pulse is characterised by alternating flushing and blanching of the nail bed in concert with the cardiac cycle, and frequently occurs along with wide pulse pressure. It is most commonly associated with severe aortic valve insufficiency; however, it can also be seen in patients with coarctation of the aorta as well as in patients with high-output physiology. The presence of Quincke’s pulse in a patient presenting with heart failure should raise suspicion for high-output heart failure. Recognising this subset of heart failure patients is critical because there are unique treatment options. Moreover, identifying and differentiating the specific underlying aetiology is crucial for initiating specific therapeutics.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A 74-year-old man with obesity and chronic alcohol use presented to the hospital with a 2-month history of progressive exertional dyspnoea and weight gain. The patient reported drinking three to four glasses of wine daily for at least 10 years. Physical examination was notable for a body mass index of 34.3 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , blood pressure of 177/56 mm Hg, dependent pitting peripheral oedema, jugular venous pressure of 18 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O with a normal waveform, unremarkable S1 and S2 without extra transient sounds or murmurs, and subungual capillary pulsations (Quincke’s pulse) 删除10：<u>( video 1 )</u>.\n\n【11】删除11：<u>Video 1</u>\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】Laboratory data were notable for haemoglobin of 100 g/L with a mean corpuscular volume of 103.3 fL. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a dilated inferior vena cava with normal biventricular systolic function and normal valvular function, raising the suspicion for high-output heart failure. Subsequent right heart catheterisation (after some diuresis) revealed elevated resting intracardiac pressures (mean right atrial pressure 9 mm Hg, mean pulmonary arterial wedge pressure 16 mm Hg), high cardiac output (12.3 L/min by thermodilution) and low systemic vascular resistance (587 dynes/s/cm <sup>−5 </sup> ), confirming the diagnosis. Whole blood concentration of thiamine diphosphate, the primary active form of vitamin B <sub>1 </sub> , was 39 nmol/L (reference 70–180 nmol/L).\n\n【14】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【15】The patient presented with symptoms and signs of heart failure, including exertional dyspnoea, weight gain, peripheral oedema and elevated jugular venous pressure. Given its prevalence, the diagnosis of traditional ‘low-output’ heart failure with preserved ejection fraction might be enticing in this case. However, the presence of wide pulse pressure and Quincke’s pulse suggest a more nuanced diagnosis. These findings are most often associated with aortic insufficiency; however, the absence of a diastolic murmur and the presence of normal valvular function on echocardiography argue against this. Wide pulse pressure and Quincke’s pulse are associated with a high-output state from any cause, and given the additional findings consistent with heart failure, high-output heart failure was suspected and subsequently confirmed with right heart catheterisation. The differential for the underlying cause of high-output heart failure is broad and includes obesity, liver disease, myeloproliferative disorders, lung disease, sepsis, severe anaemia, thyrotoxicosis, arteriovenous shunting and beriberi. 删除9：<u>2 </u>While obesity could account for the high-output physiology in this case, it should not be considered as the culprit until all other reasonable possibilities have been excluded. Given the history of chronic alcohol use, a thiamine level was checked and found to be low, confirming the diagnosis of wet beriberi.\n\n【16】Treatment\n---------\n\n【17】The patient was initially treated with diuretics to achieve euvolaemia as well as intravenous thiamine, receiving a total of 500 mg over the course of 5 days. He abstained from alcohol use and was started on oral thiamine replacement therapy (100 mg three times a day). Ongoing diuretic therapy was not required.\n\n【18】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【19】Alcohol abstinence and thiamine replacement therapy resulted in narrowing of the pulse pressure by nearly 40 mm Hg over 28 weeks  and complete resolution of symptoms without the need for diuretic therapy.\n\n【20】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【21】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【22】Blood pressure and pulse pressure trends over time with alcohol abstinence and thiamine repletion in a patient with wet beriberi.</u>\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Wide pulse pressure and Quincke’s pulse are most often associated with aortic valve insufficiency; however, these physical findings are indicative of hyperdynamic circulation from any cause: in this case, high-output heart failure from thiamine deficiency. The association between hyperdynamic circulation and thiamine deficiency has been recognised for over a century, with descriptions of wide pulse pressure and Quincke’s pulse in patients with wet beriberi first appearing in Western journals in the 1920s. 删除9：<u>3 4 </u>Since then, these findings have been associated with other causes of high-output heart failure, including thyrotoxicosis and arteriovenous fistula. 删除9：<u>5 6</u>\n\n【25】Making the distinction between traditional heart failure and high-output heart failure is important. Most patients with heart failure have low or normal cardiac output with high systemic vascular resistance, while a minority present with high cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance. There are many overlapping symptoms and signs between these conditions (eg, dyspnoea, peripheral oedema), however ‘low-output’ heart failure is significantly more common. Therefore, when patients present with the clinical syndrome of heart failure, clinicians are at risk of premature closure and settling on a diagnosis of low-output heart failure before recognising the pivotal and unique signs of high-output heart failure. This is particularly true when echocardiography demonstrates a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and patients are given the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved systolic function.\n\n【26】Evidence of hyperdynamic circulation in a patient presenting with the clinical syndrome of heart failure should raise concern for high-output heart failure. Signs not only include wide pulse pressure and Quincke’s pulse, but also warm and well-perfused extremities, bounding pulses (Corrigan’s or water hammer pulse), systolic bruit over the carotid arteries, pistol shot sounds over the femoral arteries (Traube’s sign), cervical venous hum, enlarged apical impulse and a loud first heart sound. 删除9：<u>3–6 </u>Clinical manifestations related to a particular cause of high-output heart failure (eg, painful glossitis in a patient with thiamine deficiency) may also be present.\n\n【27】Once the diagnosis of high-output heart failure has been established, it is important to identify the underlying cause in order to guide treatment, which can sometimes be curative. 删除9：<u>3 4 7 </u>In this case, whole blood concentration of thiamine diphosphate was 39 nmol/L (reference 70–180 nmol/L), confirming the diagnosis of wet beriberi from thiamine deficiency. This allowed for a specific treatment plan, including alcohol cessation and thiamine replacement. Additionally, some medications typically prescribed for low-output heart failure may be contraindicated in patients with high-output disease. For example, medications with vasodilatory properties, such as ACE inhibitors /angiotensin receptor blockers and some beta-blockers may further lower systemic vascular resistance in patients with high-output heart failure and are not recommended. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【28】This case demonstrates the importance of distinguishing high-output heart failure from other more common forms of heart failure, and the critical role that physical examination plays in this process. The observation of wide pulse pressure and Quincke’s pulse can provide a pivotal clue to the diagnosis of high-output heart failure, particularly when echocardiography is uninformative. If these important features of the case had gone unnoticed, the opportunity for curative treatment would have likely been missed.\n\n【29】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【30】This was my first encounter with Oregon Health & Science University. I was quickly diagnosed with congestive heart failure. During the first 3 hours, I met more doctors than I had met in my entire life. I was introduced to a great team of specialists who worked together to ensure that solving my main problem didn't cause other problems. But had it not been for one of the doctors (Dr André Mansoor), the root cause of my problem might never have been found. After multiple physical examinations, Dr Mansoor asked me if I noticed that my fingernails were blinking. Thinking that he was joking, I responded ‘well of course they are, it is a sign that my batteries are low and need charging’. Seeing that he was serious, I looked but couldn’t really see anything. He then took out his phone and took a video and showed me and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. This information was key for him to get permission for other tests that discovered that I had a rare issue with thiamine deficiency, which of course I had never heard of. Getting me onto B1 brought my thiamine level back to normal and I have been fine ever since. Today, I think back on how discovering this problem would have been impossible had it not been for Dr Mansoor’s physical examination and I am grateful for his persistence.\n\n【31】### Learning points\n\n【32】*   Wide pulse pressure and Quincke’s pulse are most commonly associated with aortic valve insufficiency; however, these findings are indicative of hyperdynamic circulation from any cause.\n\n【33】*   High-output heart failure is uncommon, but should be suspected when heart failure patients present with the physical findings of hyperdynamic circulation.\n\n【34】*   Making the distinction between high-output and low-output heart failure is critical because there are important differences in treatment and prognosis.\n\n【35】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【36】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【37】Obtained.\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Lori Vaskalis for creating the figure.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:03:46", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:03:51", "cost": 5.155}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:03:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:03:46"}

It is isolated from the _Streptomyces verticillus_ strain and was first developed in Japan by Umezawa in 1966. It has been used to treat various cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, germ cell tumour, testicular carcinoma and malignant pleural effusions. It is also used by dermatologists to treat recalcitrant warts, hypertrophic scars and keloids. The use of bleomycin is currently limited due to several side effects that have been reported such as pulmonary fibrosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, alopecia, onychodystrophy, gangrene, oedema and flagellate dermatitis. 删除9：<u>1 2</u>\n\n【8】Flagellate dermatitis is a rare toxic reaction to bleomycin with 8%–66% incidence rate. 删除9：<u>1 3–5 </u>The term ‘flagellate’ is derived from the Latin word ‘flagellum’, which means a whip-like appearance. 删除9：<u>1 </u>While flagellate dermatitis is most commonly linked to bleomycin, it can also be caused by the chemotherapy agents peplomycin and docetaxel as well as shiitake mushroom toxin, and is sometimes found on patients with dermatomyositis. 删除9：<u>6 7 </u>This paper describes two cases of flagellate dermatitis, one in a patient with germ cell carcinoma and another in a patient with osteosarcoma who were both diagnosed with flagellate dermatitis after the administration of bleomycin. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of how this unique toxic reaction to bleomycin manifests on the skin so that clinicians can take it into consideration when administering this chemotherapy drug. In addition to that, this paper also intends to explore other causes of flagellate dermatitis besides bleomycin.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】### Case 1\n\n【11】A man in his 20s was referred to the dermatology department with rashes and itchy patches on the body. Lesions first appeared the previous day as itchy hives in the form of irregular lines on the stomach and red spots which spread to the back and legs. The patient did not experience any muscle weakness. He had no history of similar conditions, allergies, atopy or hives. The patient had not been using topical medication, consuming mushrooms or inflicting self-injury using sharp objects. Family history also had no record of similar reports.\n\n【12】A month prior, the patient was diagnosed with mixed germ cell intra-abdominal malignant tumour along with cerebral metastases. He had received the first cycle of BEC chemotherapy regimen which consisted of bleomycin (30 U/m <sup>2 </sup> intravenously on days 1, 删除13：<u>8 </u>and 15), etoposide (150 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on days 1–5) and cisplatin (30 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on days 1–5). The skin lesions appeared after the administration of bleomycin on day 15. Vital signs were within normal limits and there was no evidence of muscle weakness. The dermatological status on the abdomen, back and waist showed erythematous patches that were linear in shape with a flagellate arrangement .\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【15】(A) Linear erythematous patch with flagellate arrangement on the abdomen.

(C) Linear, multiple hyperpigmented patches with flagellate arrangement on the abdomen and back.(D) Linear erythematous patch with flagellate arrangement on the waist.</u>\n\n【16】### Case 2\n\n【17】A woman in her teens was referred to the dermatology department with whiplash-like pattern marks and scratch mark-like hyperpigmentation on the body. The lesions appeared the week before as itchy hives in the form of irregular lines on the abdomen and waist. Two days later, the patient’s parents noted dark brown-coloured hyperpigmentation resembling scratch mark on some areas and marks of whiplashes on others. The patient did not experience any muscle weakness. Similar to the first patient, the second patient also never suffered from similar conditions. She did not have allergies, atopy or hives. There were no history of topical medication use, mushroom consumption, mental disorders and self-inflicted injury using sharp weapons. Family history also did not have any record about similar reports.\n\n【18】The second patient was diagnosed with osteosarcoma 10 months prior. She received osteosarcoma chemotherapy protocol, which included high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) (8 g/m <sup>2 </sup> intravenously in weeks 3, 4, 8, 9, 删除13：<u>13, 14, 18, 19, 23 </u>and 24), bleomycin (30 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and actinomycin D (0.75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> in week 15). Doxorubicin (90 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and cisplatin (75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) were administered in weeks 5 and 10. After the administration of HDMTX, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin, the patient did not experience any lesions on the skin. The patient mentioned the lesions appeared after the administration of bleomycin in week 15. Vital signs were within normal limits and there was no evidence of muscle weakness. The dermatological status on the abdomen and waist showed erythematous-hyperpigmented patches that were linear in shape with a flagellate arrangement .\n\n【19】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【20】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【21】Linear, multiple erythematous and hyperpigmented patches with flagellate arrangement on the (A) abdomen, (B) waist and (C) back.</u>\n\n【22】### Investigations\n\n【23】Dermatographism was not found on both patients. Laboratory tests showed normal level of creatine kinase and creatine kinase myocardial band. The diagnosis was based on the connection between bleomycin and skin lesions. A skin biopsy was not performed.\n\n【24】### Differential diagnosis\n\n【25】The differential diagnosis of flagellate erythema includes bleomycin flagellate dermatitis, shiitake mushroom intake, dermatomyositis, adult-onset Still’s disease and dermatitis artefacta. 删除9：<u>8 9 </u>Skin manifestations which appear following bleomycin administration and hyperpigmentation which occurs after drug suspension are associated with bleomycin-induced skin disorders. The patients did not experience any skin complaints after the administration of other chemotherapy agents.\n\n【26】### Treatment\n\n【27】The first patient was given one dose of 16 mg of methylprednisolone daily for 3 days and 10 mg of cetirizine also once per day. In the second patient, cetirizine and desoximetasone ointment in oleum cocos was applied topically two times per day.\n\n【28】### Outcome and follow-up\n\n【29】After a week of treatment, the lesion turned into linear hyperpigmentation with flagellate arrangement and the patients no longer complained about itching. The first patient died while undergoing treatment so the therapy was discontinued. The second patient was still given bleomycin considering there was only one administration left.\n\n【30】### Discussion\n\n【31】The diagnosis in these two cases was based on clinical diagnosis which discovered a temporal relationship between the use of bleomycin and the appearance of skin lesions. Skin lesions in the first case appeared on the body after the third bleomycin administration, while in the second case it appeared after the first bleomycin administration. In the first case, some of the lesions on the body initially took the form of urticaria which turned into erythematous patches and then became hyperpigmented patches. In the second case, the lesion first appeared as an erythematous patch which then became a hyperpigmented patch. Dermatological examination on the body showed erythematous patches and hyperpigmented patches, linear in shape, multiple, with flagellate arrangement. 删除9：<u>1 7 10 11 </u>Various other case reports have also mentioned the occurrence of flagellate dermatitis after the administration of bleomycin 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>. 删除9：<u>1 2 4 6 8 9 11</u>\n\n【32】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【33】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【34】Reported cases of bleomycin flagellate dermatitis 1 2 4 6 8 9 11</u>\n\n【35】Bleomycin-induced flagellate dermatitis is a rare toxic response to bleomycin. 删除9：<u>1 </u>The condition typically appears as skin lesions which begin as urticarial lesions that progress into erythematous patches or papules in the form of linear, multiple, flagellate arrays and, in most cases, are accompanied by pruritus, although it may also be non-pruritic. 删除9：<u>1 2 12 </u>Lesions usually appear on the trunk. 删除9：<u>13 </u>The residual lesion is hyperpigmented. Flagellate dermatitis may appear 24 hours to 6 months after the initial exposure to bleomycin and occur within 12 hours after subsequent drug re-exposure. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【36】The postulated pathophysiological mechanism for cutaneous manifestations is assumed to be due to lack of bleomycin hydrolase enzyme in the skin, which inactivates bleomycin. This results in an accumulation of bleomycin in the skin. Furthermore, the pruritus that is caused by these alterations may trigger excoriations, resulting in abrasions and microtrauma, which can lead to vasodilation and increased bleomycin deposition. 删除9：<u>11 </u>Bleomycin damages endothelial cells by upregulating TGF- β (tumour necrosis factor beta), triggering keratinocyte death, and causing a cytotoxic effect on melanocytes, among other mechanisms for cutaneous inflammation and pigmentation. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【37】Bleomycin-induced flagellate dermatitis is a dose-dependent reaction that usually occurs with cumulative doses above 200 IU. 删除9：<u>8 </u>However, there are several case reports indicting otherwise. These reports state that the occurrence of these lesions is an idiosyncratic reaction that is independent regardless of the dose and can manifest after the administration of various doses of bleomycin ranging from 5 IU to 465 IU. 删除9：<u>11 14</u>\n\n【38】Bleomycin-induced flagellate dermatitis has no absolute or characteristic histopathological appearance. In the acute phase, there is inconspicuous spongiosis, vacuolisation of the stratum basale of the epidermis, a superficial lymphocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and eosinophilic granulocytes, dermal oedema and scattered dyskeratotic keratinocytes. In later stages, only a few post-inflammatory changes were found such as pigment incontinence, melanophages in the papillary dermis and increased melanin pigmentation in the stratum basale are present. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【39】In majority of the cases, these lesions resolve spontaneously after the discontinuation of bleomycin and leave hyperpigmentation marks. In other cases, flagellate hyperpigmentation may persist even after a year of therapy. 删除9：<u>15 </u>Managing symptoms is the main treatment to limit trauma to the skin. This can be done by administering antihistamines and topical corticosteroids or oral corticosteroids. Short-term oral corticosteroids have been used in patients with extensive lesions. Discontinuation of bleomycin can be an option in the case of severe lesions. On the other hand, re-exposure to bleomycin can cause recurrence and spread of lesions. 删除9：<u>13 16 17</u>\n\n【40】In conclusion, this paper describes bleomycin-induced flagellate dermatitis found on two patients undergoing bleomycin chemotherapy.

We report the management of this condition in a low-resource setting. A teenage girl presented to our secondary-level remote rural hospital with haemoptysis. Initial surgery was performed with the facilities available at that time. Four years later, she had a recurrence of haemoptysis and underwent right middle lobectomy. Twenty years after the first surgery, the patient remains healthy. The case is reported for its rarity, the challenging circumstances in which the patient was treated and its successful outcome with long follow-up. Further, we discuss the social and economic factors that affect health-seeking behaviour, the ethical challenges in managing rare conditions (that are usually referred to tertiary care facilities) in a secondary level hospital with respect to the resources available to the institution and patient and suggest modifications to traditional decision-making protocols.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】### First presentation\n\n【10】A teenage girl presented to our remote rural hospital located in Assam in northeastern India. She was studying in school; her father was a marginal farmer and mother a housewife. She had experienced small amounts of haemoptysis at home over several months followed by a large bout, ‘half a bucket’ of fresh blood along with blood spilled on her clothes and the ground. She was taken to a district hospital, transfused 4 units of whole blood and referred to our hospital for further management. She was stable at initial presentation but was still coughing up small amounts of blood-stained sputum. She was afebrile.\n\n【11】Chest X-ray showed a rounded lesion in the lower half of the right lung. The hospital had a Picker 15 mA X-ray machine at that time which did not produce good quality images and the patient was therefore referred for a CT scan to an imaging centre 100 km away. The report of the CT scan was that there was a cystic lesion of the lung, probably a hydatid cyst . Her blood group was O positive, other routine investigations were within normal limits.\n\n【12】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【14】CT scan image at first presentation.</u>\n\n【15】At that time, the nearest large referral hospital was over 12 hours by road and a hospital with reliable lung surgeons was 1400 km away (2 days by train). The patient was not able or willing to travel and there was a significant risk of a life-threatening rebleed. Although lung surgery had not been done at the hospital at that time, the surgeon had experience with the pneumonostomy procedure for hydatid cysts of the lung as well as lung resections and it was proposed that the patient undergo pneumonostomy.\n\n【16】The hospital is situated in a remote rural part of northeast India. It started as a leprosy hospital, closed for 10 years and was reopened by the authors 7 years earlier. The authors had undergone postgraduate training in paediatric surgery and anaesthesia and returned a few months prior to the initial presentation of the patient. At that time, they were the only consultants at the hospital, the nearest telephone was 50 km away (2 hours by road), there was no internet access in the area, electricity was provided by a 15 kVA diesel generator and oxygen procured in cylinders from a major city 400 km away (12 hours by road). The hospital had two junior doctors and an outpatient volume of about 100–125 patients but inpatient volumes were low. The operating room used an ordinary 150 W incandescent bulb for lighting and an antique Bovie Spark-Gap machine for electro-cautery but the surgical instruments required for the proposed surgery, especially an adult chest retractor were available. The hospital did not have an intensive care unit or ventilators at that time but one of the authors was well trained in critical care and several sick patients had been managed successfully with hand ventilation when indicated. Considering the risk of a potentially fatal rebleed and the other constraints described above, the authors felt that they could confidently perform the pneumonostomy procedure with the facilities available after obtaining informed high-risk consent.\n\n【17】Anaesthesia was provided with an Epstein-Mackintosh-Oxford (EMO) apparatus using di-ethyl ether (anaesthetic ether) and atmospheric air . The patient was induced with thiopentone 100 mg intravenously and succinylcholine 100 mg intravenously, followed by pancuronium 4 mg intravenously, intubated with a reusable Rusch 7.0 endotracheal tube and a right posterolateral thoracotomy was done. Monitoring was done with intermittent manual sphygmomanometry, pulse oximetry and electrocardiography. A large firm mass was found in the lung with some areas that were cystic on palpation. Dense adhesions were encountered between the mass and the chest wall; when these were separated, the cystic part of the lesion was inadvertently opened causing the drainage of sebaceous material and a hair ball was removed . Palpation within the cavity showed that part of the wall contained firm material, presumably bone and cartilage. These findings indicated that the patient had a teratoma but the team was unprepared for a major excision. The full extent of the lesion was not obvious and in the absence of facilities for frozen section and an in-house pathologist, a histopathological diagnosis could not be made during surgery. Considering these factors and the significant constraints mentioned above, it was felt that the risks of attempting a major resection were unacceptable. Therefore, the contents of the cavity and part of the cyst wall were removed and the chest closed with a pleural drain. Muscle relaxation was reversed using neostigmine 2.5 mg intravenously with atropine 1.2 mg intravenously and the patient was allowed to recover from the effects of ether in the recovery room. There was no significant intraoperative bleeding and no blood was transfused during surgery. The patient made a complete recovery and was discharged on the 10th postoperative day. As there was no local histopathology service, the excised tissue was sent to a reputed institution in South India. Histopathological examination reported a mature teratoma. The hospital paid the cost of the histopathology examination. The patient was advised a second surgery to remove the remaining tumour. Since she was symptom-free, she was unwilling to undergo a second surgery at that time.\n\n【18】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【19】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【20】The Epstein-Mackintosh-Oxford apparatus (image used with permission from the Wood Library-Museum of Anesthesiology, USA).</u>\n\n【21】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【22】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【23】Sebaceous material and hair removed at first surgery.</u>\n\n【24】### Second presentation\n\n【25】The patient presented with recurrent small volume haemoptysis 4 years later . She was married and had her first child at that time. In the intervening period, the hospital had been modernised with better equipment. Chest X-ray, performed this time with a Siemens 100 mA machine, showed a recurrent lesion in the same location that had grown in size . The authors were still the only consultants but there were four junior doctors. The hospital used scarce resources to develop facilities for patients at the cost of facilities for staff who lived without electricity in their quarters for the first 14 years after the hospital was restarted. There was a ‘high-dependency unit’ with multiparameter monitors although a ventilator was yet to be installed. CT scan was not repeated as the chest X-ray clearly showed recurrence of the tumour with calcification along the borders, a histopathological diagnosis was available from the earlier biopsy and the expense of travel and another CT could be avoided. Surgery was planned and done as an elective procedure after obtaining informed consent. Anaesthesia was provided with a BOC Boyle machine using halothane, oxygen and nitrous oxide with the patient induced with thiopentone 100 mg intravenously and succinylcholine 100 mg intravenously, followed by pancuronium 4 mg intravenously with pain relief provided by pentazocine 30 mg intravenously. The patient was intubated with a Portex 24 left double lumen tube, with continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, electrocardiography, end-tidal carbon dioxide and invasive blood pressure. The chest was opened through the previous scar. Extensive adhesions were found between the chest wall and the lesion. Two overlying ribs were partially excised to provide better access. When the lung was freed from the chest wall, it was noted that the entire lesion was within the middle lobe of the lung. The horizontal and oblique fissures were dissected at the hilum until the inferior lobar bronchus was exposed. The vessels and bronchial branches entering into the right middle lobe were divided and ligated, excising the lobe. No obvious cause for haemoptysis was found during surgery. After completion of lobectomy, the double lumen tube was removed and replaced with a Portex 7.0 endotracheal tube; ventilation showed that the upper and lower lobes were inflating well with no air-leak and the chest was closed with a pleural drain . Muscle relaxation was reversed using neostigmine 2.5 mg intravenously and atropine 1.2 mg intravenously. The patient made an unremarkable recovery and was discharged on the tenth postoperative day. A chest X-ray at follow-up about a month after surgery showed only postoperative changes and the patient was not symptomatic. Histology was reported as mature teratoma with no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【26】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【27】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【28】Timeline of presentations (graphic created by VAI).</u>\n\n【29】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【30】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 5\n\n【31】Chest X-ray prior to second surgery.</u>\n\n【32】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【33】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 6\n\n【34】Intraoperative photograph after middle lobectomy.</u>\n\n【35】### Follow-up\n\n【36】Sixteen years after the second surgery, the authors met the patient incidentally and found her to be asymptomatic.

Further, social and economic factors cause patients from poor communities, especially those living in remote rural areas, to fear visiting hospitals with self-imposed delays and denials of treatment which contribute to poor healthcare outcomes.\n\n【44】*   Secondary-level hospitals with limited-resources fear taking on the risks of treating patients with limited financial means. They refer to distant hospitals leaving patients with the choice of either going home untreated or incurring expenses that may push their families into destitution while seeking treatment in distant hospitals.\n\n【45】*   Multiple factors lead to inequitable access to ethical medical management.\n\n【46】*   Fear of litigation causes doctors and hospitals to ‘play safe’ by following rigid ‘gold-standard’ guidelines, which do not allow the flexibility to treat patients effectively by using services at their disposal and considering the financial means available to patients.\n\n【47】Global health problem analysis\n------------------------------\n\n【48】### Rural hospital facilities\n\n【49】The hospital had facilities to do chest X-rays using a very basic machine and this showed an ill-defined rounded opacity in the right lower zone. To understand the lesion and its relationships better, the patient was referred for a CT scan to a centre 100 km away. The reports of the scan were that there was a cystic lung lesion, probably hydatid. Bronchoscopy, angiography and better radiological facilities were possible only at a large city, 删除13：<u>400 </u>km and 12 hours away. Further imaging options were therefore not pursued considering the risks of bleeding in transit and the unwillingness of the patient to be referred further away.\n\n【50】Cystic lesions of the lung include congenital cysts, parasitic cysts and abscesses. Haemoptysis is not a common symptom with most patients having these conditions presenting with cough or fever. In this case, the CT scan was reported by a radiologist in another hospital as a lung cyst, probably hydatid. Pathognomonic findings for teratoma on CT scanning, such as the presence of teeth, were not observed. Our hospital had treated several patients with hydatid cysts of the liver, so a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary hydatid cyst was reasonable at initial presentation to the hospital. An intrapulmonary cystic teratoma was not considered due to its extreme rarity and unusual location, the diagnosis was suspected during the initial exploratory thoracotomy and confirmed by subsequent histopathological examination.\n\n【51】Teratomas are most common in a gonadal location. The most common extragonadal site is the mediastinum. Intrapulmonary location for a teratoma was described in 1839 by Mohr and is very rare with less than 100 cases reported as of 2015. 删除9：<u>1 </u>They are commonly found in the upper lobes and the authors are unable to find any report of a right middle lobe location in the literature. Intrapulmonary teratomas may have varied radiological findings and have been confused with hydatid cyst of the lung. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Those with thicker walls and/or surrounded by solid areas, nodules or consolidation could be reported as cavitary lesions. They are postulated to arise from pluripotent stem cells of the third pharyngeal pouch or the ventral foregut which migrate along the developing lung bud. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Rarely, teratomas of the mediastinum and lung can occur in the same patient. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Lung teratomas are often cystic and may contain hair, bone, cartilage, sebaceous material, nervous tissue and skin. They commonly present with dry cough and sometimes with haemoptysis. Trichoptysis has been reported and when it occurs, may facilitate preoperative diagnosis. 删除9：<u>4 </u>They occur equally in males and females and present most commonly in the second and third decades of life. Malignant transformation can occur, with the most common pathology being squamous-celled carcinoma.\n\n【52】In this case, it is possible that erosion of surrounding vessels and bronchi led to haemoptysis. No definite cause of haemoptysis was found during surgery and bronchoscopy and angiography were not available.\n\n【53】### Decision making in austere circumstances\n\n【54】At first presentation, the patient was stable after receiving four units of blood at another hospital. Surgery is indicated for life-threatening haemoptysis in a situation in which the cause of bleeding can be treated by the intervention and the origin of the bleeding has been specifically and reliably located (strong recommendation, 删除9：<u>1</u>B—SEPAR guidelines). 删除9：<u>5</u>\n\n【55】With a presumptive diagnosis of hydatid cyst of the lung, the pneumonostomy procedure was planned. 删除9：<u>6 </u>During the surgery, efforts were made to avoid breakage of the cyst and cyst fluid leakage because this can cause anaphylaxis; the anaesthesiologist was aware of this possibility and was prepared to manage it. Further, viable parasite present in leaked cyst fluid can cause implantation and recurrence. The risk of this can be reduced by irrigation of the cyst with scolicidal agents. In this case, the risk was reduced by packing the surrounding area with surgical swabs soaked in a scolicidal agent (10% povidone iodine). Hydatid cysts of the lung are often solitary and grow within lung tissue stretching surrounding bronchi and vessels around them. When an intrapulmonary hydatid cyst is surgically removed, weakened bronchial walls lead to multiple perforations and significant air-leak which can cause collapse of the ipsilateral lung, bronchopleural fistula, significant hospital stay and loss of lung capacity. This can be avoided by using the pneumonostomy technique where the cavity is closed around a tube which is exteriorised to the atmosphere, creating a broncho-atmospheric fistula, similar to a tracheostomy. Since air does not leak into the pleural cavity, the lung does not collapse and patients recover quickly and completely with no loss of lung tissue as the bronchial perforations heal over time. This surgery is simple and easy to perform in a low-resource setting.\n\n【56】At surgery, it was noted that the lesion was adherent to the chest wall and was of variable consistency on palpation. A thinned-out part of the lesion had inadvertently opened during the release of adhesions and thick sebaceous material appeared. When the cavity was opened, a hair ball was found and palpation of the internal surface showed hard, firm and soft areas. These findings indicated that this was an intrapulmonary teratoma but since frozen section facility was not available, it was not possible to have histopathological confirmation or exclude a malignant component. Since there was no intrathoracic or airway bleeding after partial removal of the tumour, it was felt that an immediate rebleed would not occur. It was therefore decided to close the chest with drainage and reoperate after confirming the diagnosis on an elective basis or refer the patient to a specialist centre. When operating in similar challenging situations, partial excision or decompression of an intrapulmonary teratoma presenting with massive haemoptysis may be sufficient to prevent an immediate re-bleed.\n\n【57】The EMO anaesthesia machine was used during the first surgery—this machine was used at our hospital for more than 10 years with excellent results, we stopped using it only after it developed a malfunction and anaesthetic ether was no longer available in India. It was developed for field hospitals during World War II and is a temperature compensated, calibrated, draw-over ether vaporiser, commonly used with hand-operated ‘Oxford’ bellows. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Ether is an effective anaesthetic agent and adequate anaesthesia can be provided with atmospheric air in most circumstances. Additional oxygen needs to be supplemented only when required. Ether anaesthesia is safe, even in non-expert hands, although it is slow in onset and recovery. Induction may be hastened by using halothane with an attached Oxford Miniature Vaporizer but this was not available at the hospital. The other disadvantage of ether is its flammability. This is a significant risk when used with oxygen and electrocautery. In our case, oxygen was used only for preoxygenation and haemostasis was achieved primarily using ligatures and pressure with cautery used sparingly when oxygen was not in use. This technology is now considered obsolete and is not taught in modern anaesthesia training programmes. With modern anaesthesia performed by Boyle type machines that use newer anaesthetic agents and with the free availability of pressurised gases, anaesthetic ether is not manufactured in most countries. Penlon, the company that was producing the EMO machine has stopped manufacture due to absent demand. From a global health perspective, the EMO machine may still be used to provide safe, cheap, reliable anaesthesia in situations where electricity and oxygen supply are unreliable; it can be safely administered by trained anaesthesia providers and it should be considered as a realistic option in such resource limited settings. Ether is inexpensive, safe and provides excellent intraoperative pain control which extends several hours into the postoperative period and should be considered as a realistic agent for anaesthesia in situations where surgery needs to be performed under conditions of multiple major resource constraints—such as the conditions described above. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【58】Surgical excision provides a complete cure for benign mature teratomas of the lung and that was the procedure adopted at the second surgery. Extensive scarring and adhesions between the lung and chest wall necessitated partial excision of two overlying ribs to gain adequate exposure. Since the tumour was entirely within the right middle lobe, a right middle lobectomy was performed. Symptom-free follow-up 16 years after definitive surgery shows that simple lobectomy of the involved lobe was sufficient for complete cure of this rare condition.\n\n【59】### Financial pressures on patients to pay for healthcare\n\n【60】India has a low national per capita investment in healthcare as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and this results in high OOPE for patients. The resulting financial vulnerability caused by a single large healthcare expenditure is especially acute in remote rural communities and among the poor and marginalised. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Within India, healthcare accessibility and outcomes vary enormously. The Government of India has identified eight particularly vulnerable states, including Assam, which are collectively called the ‘Empowered Action Group States’ with under-5 mortality rate, maternal mortality rate and other healthcare indices being used as surrogate markers of healthcare access and outcomes 10 Healthcare outcomes in these states are enumerated in Annual Health Surveys, both nationally and for individual states such as Assam. 删除9：<u>11 12 </u>Within most states, urban areas fare better than rural areas. India’s rural:urban population ratio is 72:28 but the bed availability is exactly the opposite 28:72—government healthcare facilities are often poorly equipped/staffed and private ‘for profit’ hospitals almost non-existent in many remote rural areas. 删除9：<u>13 14 </u>There are many challenges in attracting and retaining committed manpower in needy rural areas. Professionally, they need to manage with the facilities available to be able to provide healthcare at affordable costs and personally, they face multiple inconveniences at home which they should be willing to accept.\n\n【61】In this case, the income of the family rested on a sole income generating individual, the father, who was a marginal farmer. At the time of presentation, there was no provision for government-funded health insurance and all expenditure would have been out-of-pocket for the family. The fear of the resulting catastrophic expenditure which could lead to sale of vital assets or borrowing at unsustainable terms and destitution led the family to refuse consent for distant referral. Assessment of how much the patient could pay without selling vital assets was used to provide charitable funds for both surgeries.\n\n【62】Other factors that affect healthcare access include lower public confidence in free or subsidised public healthcare services. This leads families to spend beyond their capacity to finance healthcare needs by going to private healthcare providers. 删除9：<u>15 </u>Many families live in chronic poverty and a sudden expenditure is coped with by curtailing already limited family budgets for basic necessities like food and schooling. Families with limited means may become destitute as a consequence of decisions to borrow unsustainably to fund health intervention, selling off vital assets, taking children out of school and even resorting to debt bondage. 删除9：<u>16 </u>The authors have noted that when a family sells their home or other vital asset to finance healthcare expenditure, it creates a chilling effect in the local community and this fear leads to self-imposed delays and denials of healthcare. A significant percentage of OOPE on healthcare is spent on non-medical expenses. 删除9：<u>17 </u>A realistic evaluation of these factors should encourage governments and healthcare institutions to develop strategies to close gaps in access. 删除9：<u>18</u>\n\n【63】Our hospital has observed many such events where delay and refusal of treatment, failure to report for follow-up as well as refusal of referral have occurred. 删除9：<u>19 </u>The hospital has developed a number of poor-centric strategies to alleviate fear and welcome poor patients to access its services. These strategies include ability-to-pay based pricing, equal access to services to all, hyper-tailored charity, removing cultural barriers through community engagement, revised gold standard treatment protocols as well as recruitment and retention of an efficient workforce. To illustrate one of these strategies, charity is ‘hyper-tailored’ based on the hospital’s assessment of financial distress where patients and their relatives prefer to starve in hospitals to save scarce financial resources to pay for treatment, request discharge before a patient dies as the cost of transporting a dead body is much higher or need to sell vital assets to finance healthcare—these are painful decisions that a non-poor family would not take. Assessment of how much a family can pay without selling vital assets goes into the quantum of charity provided to a family. 删除9：<u>20 21</u>\n\n【64】### Medical ethics in difficult circumstances\n\n【65】Fear of litigation causes many hospitals to overinvestigate, refuse treatment and refer patients that they are capable of treating. In addition, tertiary care is not available in most rural areas and distant travel may exceed 1000 km, which causes significant costs besides delay in accessing care which could impact outcomes. The number of cardiothoracic surgeons available in India is inadequate to service the needs of cardiac surgery. There are even fewer who specialise in general thoracic surgery. It is extremely difficult for a patient with a lung problem to access the services of a dedicated thoracic surgeon in what would be considered reasonable travel distance. The amount reimbursed to hospitals by public health schemes for lung surgical procedures is insufficient to meet the costs of thoracic procedures discouraging hospitals from providing thoracic surgical services. 删除9：<u>22 </u>Some parts of the country, such as northeast India do not have centres which were operating on such patients at the time when this patient was treated, with referral to mainland India being expensive and requiring significant travel time. The authors have noted that when local hospitals refer to distant hospitals, many poor patients simply go home and may die or suffer complications of untreated disease—this could have been the outcome in our case if the patient had been refused treatment. Each hospital should objectively examine the resources at their disposal and constraints under which they function to accept reasonable risks when the benefits are great.\n\n【66】The four modern principles of medical ethics, beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice, should be used to modify guidelines. 删除9：<u>23 </u>In this case, during the first surgery, considering the emergent situation and potential of a fatal rebleed, a simple exploratory thoracotomy, pneumonostomy or as it turned out, partial excision to stop haemoptysis was a reasonable risk to accept and therefore beneficence was exercised. However, in the presence of serious local constraints with the full extent and histopathological diagnosis unknown and contralateral lung protection unavailable, not assuming unacceptable risk and not proceeding with a lung resection was non-maleficence. Understanding the situation of the patient and respecting her wish not to be referred and operating with full informed consent after understanding risks involved is autonomy. Providing all possible access to quality treatment within the capacity of the institution in spite of severe constraints irrespective of poverty and rural residence is justice. Thus, the four pillars of ethical treatment have been employed in this case.\n\n【67】A definitive excision at a second sitting was performed in an elective setting with most of the constraints mentioned above resolved resulting in a successful outcome. This may be the most realistic way to treat such conditions ethically in resource-limited settings and among poor remote rural communities, using a strategy of ‘best possible treatment at the time under the circumstances’.\n\n【68】### Guidelines for ethical and professional treatment in austere environments\n\n【69】‘Gold-standard’ guidelines and protocols assume that the hospital has access to the latest equipment, manpower and when this is not possible, the patient can be transported safely and quickly without affecting the life of the patient or the financial security of the family. This ideal scenario is considerably modified in many countries as described above. Guidelines should be revised on a case-by-case basis taking into account an objective evaluation of the constraints and assets at the disposal of the operating team as well as the financial resources available to the patient to reach ‘revised gold standards’ that are realistic in that particular scenario. In this case, the EMO machine and anaesthetic ether were used in the first operation. Although both are considered obsolete, the older, time-tested equipment and agent are realistic and possibly best choices in many parts of the developing world, including war-torn areas. Our hospital used such a protocol in the management of this patient and also trains Global Health residents, doing their MD (Global Health and Tropical Medicine) course from the Netherlands, to create and use such protocols effectively under challenging circumstances across the globe. 删除9：<u>24</u>\n\n【70】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【71】I had an episode of massive coughing of blood 20 years ago and was taken to the local district hospital where four units of blood was transfused. I was referred to this hospital and was referred for a CT scan. An emergency surgery was done. After receiving the biopsy report, I was told that a second surgery was required but I was fine at that time and refused because of fear. I got married 18 months after the first surgery and after giving birth to my first son, I again started coughing out blood. X-ray showed that the tumour had returned and I agreed to a second surgery. Now, 删除13：<u>16 </u>years later, I am completely fine. I thank God and the hospital for saving my life.\n\n【72】### Learning points\n\n【73】*   Mature teratomas of the lung should be considered in the differential diagnosis of haemoptysis when imaging shows a cystic or cavitary lung lesion.\n\n【74】*   Partial excision of a mature cystic teratoma may be sufficient to prevent potential massive haemoptysis in an emergent setting.\n\n【75】*   The Epstein-Mackintosh-Oxford apparatus and diethyl ether can be used safely to provide anaesthesia in resource-limited settings.\n\n【76】*   Intrapulmonary teratomas can occur in the right middle lobe and treated successfully by right middle lobectomy.\n\n【77】*   The social and economic conditions of the patient and resources at hand should be objectively analysed to create ‘revised gold standards’ to treat patients in resource-limited settings.\n\n【78】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【79】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【80】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【81】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【82】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to acknowledge Dr. Joseph Duerksen, visiting anaesthesiologist who donated a left double lumen tube on hearing about this patient and Dr. Kenny David, visiting orthopaedic surgeon who assisted the second surgery.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:31:38", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:31:59", "cost": 21.928}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:32:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:31:37"}

The frequency of haemoptysis was about two to three times per month, and it was 5–10 mL in the amount in each episode. There was no history of associated cough, shortness of breath, fever, anorexia or weight loss. She was a life-long non-smoker and had no previous history of tuberculosis. She was diagnosed to have systemic sclerosis 3 years back when she had presented with skin thickening and Raynaud’s phenomenon. She was treated with low-dose steroids and nifedipine for Raynaud’s phenomenon. In view of recurrent haemoptysis, she had undergone a CT scan of thorax 3 months back which had demonstrated changes suggestive of early non-specific interstitial pneumonia. A flexible bronchoscopy (FB) was also done which was reported as normal. On examination, she had skin thickening, sclerodactyly and digital pitting scars. She had multiple cutaneous telangiectasias involving, face, hands and palms . The chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral clear lung fields. In view of the unclear source of haemoptysis, a diagnostic FB was performed which revealed multiple mucosal telangiectasias in the entire tracheobronchial tree . Narrowband imaging (NBI) was also performed during FB which confirmed the presence of telangiectasias . The rest of the bronchoscopic examination was unremarkable. No other source of haemoptysis could be found on CT thorax as well as bronchoscopic examination, and it was attributed to endobronchial telangiectasias. In view of the diffuse nature of lesions, no therapeutic procedure was done at present. The patient is currently under follow-up with a plan for therapeutic argon plasma coagulation (APC) application in case of recurrence of haemoptysis.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】(A) Clinical photograph showing telangiectasias over face.

Its causes include infections such as tuberculosis, postinfective fibrobronchiectasis, benign or malignant endobronchial tumours, arteriovenous malformations, and endobronchial telangiectasias. Haemoptysis occurring in a patient with systemic sclerosis may be due to infections, pulmonary fibrosis, development of malignancy or endobronchial vascular lesions. Endobronchial telangiectasias as a cause of haemoptysis have been described in systemic sclerosis as well as in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Endobronchial vascular lesions can also occur in patients with liver cirrhosis or sometimes may be idiopathic. Two most important investigations in evaluation of haemoptysis include CT scan of the thorax and a flexible bronchoscopy to look for sight of bleeding and any endobronchial lesion. Use of NBI may help in identifying superficial vascular abnormalities during FB. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Endobronchial telangiectasias can lead to haemoptysis which may be massive on occasions. The diagnosis of an endobronchial vascular lesion may be missed by a casual examination by an inexperienced operator during FB, and these patients may undergo multiple diagnostic procedures before the diagnosis is established. The treatment options include coagulation of the lesion or angioembolisation in case of large lesions if a feeding vessel is identified. Surgical resection is reserved for larger lesions not amenable to endovascular or bronchoscopic modalities. For superficial telangiectasias, electrocoagulation or APC remain important therapeutic modalities. As compared with electrocoagulation, APC has a lower risk of perforation or cartilage damage and better control of depth. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【8】This case highlights the importance of performing a careful bronchoscopic examination to identify mucosal vascular abnormalities in patients with haemoptysis.\n\n【9】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【10】I am thankful that the reason for bleeding from my mouth has now become clear.

Excessive recreational use can cause spinal cord myelopathy. Previous studies have discussed the medical management. However, none have specified the sensorimotor rehabilitation management. This case report documents the investigations, physical rehabilitation and functional outcomes in two cases of N <sub>2 </sub> O-associated myelopathy. Both presented with lower limb strength and sensorimotor integration impairments resulting in ataxic ambulation. Dorsal column signal abnormality was observed on T2-weighted MRI in one case. Myelopathy was diagnosed based on clinical presentation and both were treated with vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> . Rehabilitation was conceived and specified using the Rehabilitation Treatment Specification System (RTSS). Both cases achieved independent indoor gait on hospital discharge, and full function at 9 months in one case. Appropriate and timely medical management and reasoned rehabilitation provided excellent functional outcomes for N <sub>2 </sub> O-related myelopathy. By using the RTSS, reasoned rehabilitation efficacy can be tested in the future.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   Neurology (drugs and medicines)\n*   Healthcare improvement and patient safety\n*   Medical management\n*   Spinal cord\n*   Physiotherapy (rehabilitation)\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

The UK lifetime-user prevalence rate from a non-probabilistic sample is 38.6%; typical users appear to be male clubbers in their 20s. 删除9：<u>7 </u>The catering industry’s development of small 8 g steel recharging canisters for whipped cream dispensers containing pressurised N <sub>2 </sub> O (bulbs, whippits, nangs) has made them ubiquitous to buy cheaply (50p–£2 per canister 8 ) usually in packs of 100. Use from large cylinders (2–10 kg) has become more prevalent recently. 删除9：<u>9 </u>N <sub>2 </sub> O remains legal to buy in the UK although this is now under review 10 not least due to recent media concern about the increase in chronic abuse, 删除13：<u>11 </u>and the alarming increase in use reported in the Netherlands, which has led it to plan for formal controls in 2023. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Consuming N <sub>2 </sub> O directly from the canister is dangerous—the pressure (~200 kPa) can cause barotrauma, 删除13：<u>13 </u>and the temperature of the gas near the outlet (−55°C 14 ) can cause frostbite injuries. 删除9：<u>15 </u>Instead, the gas is typically transferred into balloons via either the whipped cream dispenser or a secondary device (creamers or crackers) easily available that can dispense the canister gas into balloons inserted over the device spout. The preferred recreational use is to inhale or rebreathe the N <sub>2 </sub> O via the balloon at parties and festivals. 删除9：<u>16</u>\n\n【9】Although recreational N <sub>2 </sub> O use is relatively safe compared with other drugs, acute harm includes falls, accidental injury, confusion 7 or vomit aspiration. 删除9：<u>17 </u>Acute death is rare. A 2016 systematic review of case reports found evidence of 29 case deaths mostly due to acute asphyxiation due to hypoxia with users consuming N <sub>2 </sub> O with a mask or plastic bag. 删除9：<u>18 </u>In the UK, 删除13：<u>17 </u>deaths were reported between 2006 and 2012 19 mainly due to accidental asphyxia when N <sub>2 </sub> O displaces oxygen if used in enclosed spaces. 删除9：<u>20 </u>Most users inhale low doses per session (1–2 canisters), but overuse exists (~100 canisters), which can lead to persistent neurological sequelae. Chronic clinical toxicity is due to N <sub>2 </sub> O’s interaction with vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> converting it from an active to an inactive form by irreversible oxidation. 删除9：<u>21 </u>By impairing methylation reactions and DNA synthesis, oxidation results in an accumulation of homocysteine and impaired maintenance of the myelin sheath. 删除9：<u>22 </u>Thus, B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency from excessive N <sub>2 </sub> O use can cause demyelination of the central and peripheral nervous system and a diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration (SACD). If demyelination presents in the spinal cord, the dorsal columns are classically affected, with sometimes the lateral but rarely the anterior columns. The associated diagnostic procedures, neural impairments (progressive vibratory and proprioceptive sensory abnormalities, ascending paraesthesia, ataxic gait, hyporeflexia or hyper-reflexia, and rarely muscle weakness and loss of sphincter control 23–25 ), and medical treatment options have been described in medical case reports and observational studies of SACD of the spinal cord previously. 删除9：<u>22 25–36</u>\n\n【10】In contrast, _rehabilitative_ treatment options for N <sub>2 </sub> O abuse SACD are not as pervasive in the literature. It is as if patients are expected to recover naturally with cursory reassurance and good luck. One published case study advocates physicians to be cognisant that tailored rehabilitation for a patient’s functional and neuropsychiatric impairments can limit the extent of neurological damage, 删除13：<u>37 </u>and another clinical review advises medical clinicians to refer to physiotherapy if a patient’s mobility is affected. 删除9：<u>38 </u>Yet, rehabilitation treatment is not well specified even in these welcome cases.\n\n【11】This lack of rehabilitation specificity is not unusual in research into rehabilitation treatment efficacy where objective definitions of treatments of interest, or even ‘usual care’, 删除13：<u>39 </u>are required. For surgical or pharmacological treatments, it is usual for active treatment ingredients to be obvious and be specified as chemical structures or anatomical results. In contrast, rehabilitation specification is challenging for several reasons. A binary definition of rehabilitation is tenuous because there are non-binary categories of rehabilitation, 删除13：<u>40 </u>rehabilitation ingredients are not obvious, rehabilitation treatments attempt to change multiple interacting patient functions (eg, muscle strength, movement fluidity, participation in occupation) and specific treatment ingredient definitions do not exist, let alone their downstream effect on patient function. 删除9：<u>41 </u>To date, the active ingredients of treatment at the macro level of acute inpatient rehabilitation are rarely specified, which equates with the ‘black box’ approach where little insight into the active treatment ingredients is given which is a typical criticism in the rehabilitation science and clinical communities. 删除9：<u>42 </u>The recently developed coherent framework (the Rehabilitation Treatment Specification System (RTSS)) addresses the black box problem by developing methods that specify, and ultimately measure, the rehabilitative content (ingredients), that via theoretical or observed processes (mechanisms of action), cause a change in desired systems (targets). 删除9：<u>43 </u>Because of relative rarity of both the clinical condition and the specification of its rehabilitation using the RTSS, the following report of two cases with spinal cord injury post-N <sub>2 </sub> O overuse is intended to provide an exemplar of holistic medical and rehabilitation management. It was prepared following the Case Report guidelines. 删除9：<u>44</u>\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】The patients were both male. Case 1 was in his early teens (mass 71.7 kg, height 183.0 cm, body mass index (BMI) 21.4 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and case 2 was in his 20s (54.1 kg, 173.5 cm, BMI 18.0 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) on presentation to our large, urban hospital emergency department. Case 1 presented with a 2-day history of gradually worsening lower leg weakness, sensory disturbance in a stocking distribution, reduced balance and mobility. Case 2 presented with a 3-month history of altered leg sensation/weakness commencing with bilateral distal sensory disturbance progressing to pins and needles in a stocking distribution with bilateral leg weakness and reduced mobility.\n\n【14】Neither disclosed any medical history, nor recalled using other recreational drugs except for case 1 who chose to smoke cannabis occasionally. Both confirmed consuming five to six units of alcohol socially per week. History of N <sub>2 </sub> O consumption was similar for both cases and varied from 50 to 100 canisters per month (usually with large quantities in a single sitting). However, both cases describe an acute escalation in consumption to 100–200 canisters in the week prior to hospital admission. Case 1 was in full-time education, and case 2 worked part time as a football coach. Both cases lived in rented flats; case 1 with his mother, and case 2 with his parents and siblings.\n\n【15】Both patients presented with normal cognition, orientation and fluent speech. The cranial nerves and upper limb examination were normal. There were no cerebellar signs. The sensorimotor lower limb impairments 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u> included distal lower limb weakness measured using the Medical Research Council ordinal rating scale 45 and translated into diminished ambulatory function with both cases requiring aids to transfer or walk. Neither case presented with any urinary or bowel dysfunction.\n\n【16】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【17】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【18】Clinical features and investigation findings at initial assessment</u>\n\n【19】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【20】Methylmalonic acid (MMA) serum levels were elevated above the normal threshold level of 243 nmol/L, 删除13：<u>46 </u>more so in case 1 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u> indicative of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency. Serum folate levels in both cases were unremarkable (3.8 μg/L and 4.9 μg/L for cases 1 and 2, respectively; both within the normal range of 3.1–20.5 µg/L). Other investigations are summarised in table 1 .\n\n【21】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【22】Thorough history taking identified a gradual onset of symptoms over several days, ruling out a vascular cause of neurological dysfunction such as spinal or cerebral stroke. Further neurological assessment and clinical investigations 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>, along with a history of excessive N <sub>2 </sub> O intake, led to a diagnosis of SACD of the spinal cord causing sensorimotor myelopathy.\n\n【23】Treatment\n---------\n\n【24】### Case 1\n\n【25】Intramuscular hydroxocobalamin injections (1 mg) were provided daily for 1 week and then on alternate days for a further week. The patient was advised to cease all recreational drug use including N <sub>2 </sub> O inhalation. Physiotherapy treatment (total with therapist 445 min) was provided in 11 sessions over a 12-day inpatient stay (mean 40.5 min/session). Clinical assessment revealed bilateral lower limb sensorimotor weakness, and a total score of 7 out of 56 on the Berg Balance Scale (BBS—a 14-item ordinal measure that assesses static balance, functional mobility and falls risk 47 ) indicated difficulties in functional mobility and balance particularly a reliance on visual sensory cues, and poor planning of whole body transitional movement and reactions to centre-of-mass excursions. Seeing as the mean (±SD) BBS for a sample of ambulatory spinal cord injured-paraplegic participants (American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale D (AIS-D)) 48 is 44.8 (±13.0), 删除13：<u>49 </u>case 1’s functional mobility and balance deficits at initial assessment were profound, a finding supported by their slow observed average (10 m) self-selected gait velocity (0.29 m/s) indicative of a home-only ambulator. 删除9：<u>50 </u>Overall activities of daily living function was moderate (modified Barthel Index 51 12 out of 20). The aims of physical rehabilitation treatment were safe community ambulation with or without walking aids.

He was also prescribed oral paracetamol 1 g four times a day, codeine phosphate 30 mg four times a day and gabapentin 300 mg three times a day for symptom control. Similarly to case 1, the patient was also advised to cease recreational N <sub>2 </sub> O inhalation. Physiotherapy treatment (370 min) was provided in 12 sessions over a 14-day inpatient stay (30.9 min/session). Assessment revealed similar impairments to case 1: bilateral lower limb sensorimotor weakness 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>. A combined time of 0/120 s on the modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (CTSIB-M—a performance measure quantifying postural standing control under four sensory conditions each tolerated for up to 30 s for a maximum score of 120 s 53 54 ) indicated their sensorimotor balance control was profoundly impaired. In fact, case 2’s impairments were so profound compared with case 1; they were unable to ambulate at all and required maximal assistance to transfer safely. The aims of treatment were nonetheless the same as in case 1 and remained safe community ambulation with or without walking aids. Treatment specification was undertaken based on the RTSS 删除10：<u>( table 2 )</u>.\n\n【31】While folic acid treatment was not indicated to correct abnormal serum folate levels in either of our cases, it should be noted that correcting any diagnosed folate insufficiency should be undertaken only after initial phase B <sub>12 </sub> replacement to prevent worsening of the neurological spinal cord degeneration. 删除9：<u>55</u>\n\n【32】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【33】Cases 1 and 2 improved with treatment and their MMA concentration levels were within the normal range prior to hospital discharge. There were however residual sensorimotor deficits. In case 1, plantarflexor strength was graded at 5/5 on reassessment prior to hospital discharge, but dorsiflexion strength had only recovered to 3/5 bilaterally. Proprioception was no longer impaired at the ankle, but distal impairments remained bilaterally. In addition, there were residual sensory impairments to light touch on the left in an L1–S1 and on the right an L5 dermatomal distribution. He was independently mobile with foot-up splints (due to dorsiflexor fatigue over longer distances) and two elbow crutches up to 45 m but could not ambulate outdoors. Average gait speed increased from 0.29 to 0.41 m/s, an increase of 0.12 m/s, which is a clinically meaningful difference 56 but still less than the comfortable average gait velocity threshold of 0.49 m/s that delineates community from household-only ambulation. 删除9：<u>50 </u>His sensorimotor recovery translated to a meaningful improvement in his BBS (47 of 56), and a Barthel score of 17 out of 20 on discharge. The patient was duly referred to local community physiotherapy services available at their discharge residence for treatment as specified.\n\n【34】On discharge, case 2 had residual impaired sensation to light touch bilaterally in an L4–S1 dermatomal distribution. Proprioception at the first metatarsals remained absent bilaterally. He was independently mobile indoors with two elbow crutches up to 60 m and was able to control the knee avoiding recurvatum during stance phases in ≥90% of gait cycles. Indoor independent gait velocity at discharge was 0.38 m/s. However, he could not ambulate outdoors independently similarly to case 1. His recovery translated to an improved CTSIB-M (71/120 s) revealing residual reliance on visual sensory information, and a Barthel score of 19 out of 20. He too was duly referred for outpatient therapy for treatment as specified; no community therapy options were available at his discharge residence.\n\n【35】Case 1 chose to not participate in further therapy or medical follow-up. In contrast, case 2 attended further physiotherapy and was reviewed in an outpatient medical clinic 3 weeks post-hospital discharge. He was ambulating independently but self-reported mildly impaired balance. While proprioception was intact on clinical examination, he presented with symmetrical, lower limb impaired light touch sensation in a stocking distribution, and could only tolerate the Romberg position (eyes closed) 57 for 22 s without excessive sway or losing balance.\n\n【36】At a subsequent outpatient medical clinic review at 9 months post-hospital discharge, case 2 reported a full recovery including being able to sprint on a treadmill in his physiotherapy sessions. Repeat neurophysiology tests showed improved conduction velocities and normal sensory studies; however, compound muscle action potentials in the lower limbs remained below the normal range.\n\n【37】Discussion\n----------\n\n【38】We observed profound sensorimotor impairment caused by excessive N <sub>2 </sub> O abuse which led to SACD of the spinal cord in two cases. The cases presented with typical features that collectively confirmed the diagnosis. First, a clinical myelopathy anatomically localised to the spinal cord (confirmed by MRI studies in case 1); second, evidence of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency; and lastly, an absence of identifiable central or peripheral nervous system pathology in keeping with the clinical findings. 删除9：<u>23 </u>The lack of confirmatory imaging studies in case 2 is not unusual—a published series of 54 patients with dorsal column injury reported low sensitivity with imaging confirming the diagnosis only in 8 patients (14.8%). 删除9：<u>58 </u>Previous literature has reported excessive N <sub>2 </sub> O use and vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency cases whose main presenting symptoms were weakness, paraesthesia and ataxic gait, 删除13：<u>22 28 32 </u>falls, 删除13：<u>31 33 </u>absent or impaired deep tendon reflexes and diminished vibration sense, 删除13：<u>26 29 </u>hyporeflexia, 删除13：<u>34 </u>limb proprioceptive abnormalities 27 30 and wide-based steppage gait, 删除13：<u>35 </u>not dissimilar to the present cases.\n\n【39】While resolution of symptoms following vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> therapy is sometimes incomplete in older patients (mean (±SD) age 55.9 (±15.5) years), it tends to be complete in younger patients (39.8 (±18.8) years). 删除9：<u>23 </u>So it was not surprising that the two young cases presented in this paper progressed in their recovery and made a near full sensorimotor recovery at 9 months, at least in the second case. Because their sensorimotor function returned to near normal, we can presume that the two cases did not re-abuse N <sub>2 </sub> O while we followed them up. If they had re-abused N <sub>2 </sub> O inhalation during the follow-up period, then B <sub>12 </sub> would have been deactivated very rapidly with a commensurate deterioration in neurology and we would have expected to have observed a relapse in balance and ambulation dysfunction. 删除9：<u>59 </u>Re-abuse could be a sign of addiction to N <sub>2 </sub> O although N <sub>2 </sub> O inhalation addiction is contentious within the literature. 删除9：<u>18 60 61 </u>While clinical discourse to persuade cessation of use appears to have been successful in these two cases, clinicians should be aware that patients presenting with acute recreational N <sub>2 </sub> O toxicity should be provided with necessary psychosocial support if difficulties in self-selected cessation of abuse are suspected. 删除9：<u>38</u>\n\n【40】The positive outcomes overall in the two cases presented here are almost certainly due to the medical diagnostic procedures and subsequent clinical decision to commence vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> treatment in a timely way with regular monitoring. What is less clear is whether the equally timely and novel specification of rehabilitation interventions using the RTSS led to a more reasoned and tailored physical therapy approach. To our knowledge, this is the first specified rehabilitation report using the RTSS in cases of this type. By acting as a coherent framework for specifying rehabilitation interventions based on the clinician’s treatment theory, the RTSS fractionates multidimensional and progressive rehabilitation interventions into entities (treatment components) that are amenable to clinical adoption (including among clinical colleagues) and empirical research. 删除9：<u>41 </u>Thus, the specification described herein acts first as a reasoned approach for fellow rehabilitation clinicians to use with these patients downstream of the acute hospital; second, as an example for other clinicians treating similar cases; and lastly, as a record of the specified treatment to inform researchers. It is worth noting though that the treatment specifications provided are examples peculiar to the two cases presented. They are not meant as a prescriptive regime for all patients presenting with sensorimotor system impairments due to recreational N <sub>2 </sub> O toxicity and functional B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency. Nonetheless, we contend that in successfully specifying the treatment in this way, the patient’s treatment was reasoned and tailored and thus verifies the RTSS’s utility.\n\n【41】The impairments (bilateral lower limb sensorimotor) and aims of treatment (restitution of normal ambulatory function) were specified identically between cases. Treatments were also identical based on organ function targets (muscle strengthening and stretching), and skills and habits targets (function balance and ambulation practise tasks). Representation targets were identical too. They were designed to influence cognitive processes when managing the musculoskeletal integrity and injurious falls risks inherently associated with distal lower limb paralysis, and ensure the consequences of failing to voluntary manage those risks were understood.\n\n【42】However, there were treatment specification differences between cases because case 2 initially presented with impairments so profound that no ambulatory function was possible. Case 2 presented with proximal lower limb joint symmetrical weakness and more widespread proprioceptive loss. Therefore, therapy time was prioritised towards specifying a more widespread and explicit strengthening programme and more rudimentary static balance tasks compared with case 1.\n\n【43】What's more, when case 2 progressed to ambulating, knee recurvatum (KR) was observed during some, but not all, stance phases. KR is a relatively common impairment observed in other neurological pathologies (eg, 30%–50% of ambulatory hemiplegic stroke survivors 62 63 ). In normal continuous gait, coordination between pretibial muscle contraction (which restrains ankle plantarflexion and allows the tibia to move forward over the foot during weight acceptance) and triceps surae/quadriceps contraction (crucial to restraining tibial forward motion during mid-stance while the femoral segment progresses forward distal to it with extension at the knee) controls knee flexion and forward tibial movement over the stationary foot in stance phases. 删除9：<u>64</u>\n\n【44】While the main cause for gait KR is premature overactivity or spasticity of the plantarflexors which prevents the knee from flexing during loading response in early stance 63 65 or vasti hypertonia, 删除13：<u>66 67 </u>we reasoned that KR in case 2 was due to dorsiflexion/plantarflexion muscle weakness, poor proprioception and reliance on forward placed walking aids. This is because no muscle hyper-reflexia was observed on assessment at the ankle or knee. The variability of KR observed in case 2 was probably due to instances when knee hyperextension was simply deployed to stabilise the knee in stance by adopting a quadriceps-avoidance strategy sometimes seen in anterior cruciate ligament deficient gait 68 in combination with plantarflexion weakness during mid-stance. 删除9：<u>69 </u>Our theory therefore was that treatment ingredients targeting muscle weakness and sensory integration (including proprioception) in static balance would ameliorate the KR in case 2. Passive treatment ingredients designed to target KR more directly to support the approach would include issuing of rigid ankle/foot orthotics which were avoided here. Instead, gait re-education was deployed via instructions based on implicit motor learning to avoid KR with delayed knowledge-of-performance feedback. 删除9：<u>70</u>\n\n【45】Specified treatments were not then all identical between cases and support the argument that treatment was tailored for the two cases. This is one of the advantages of the RTSS. Its coherent framework is intended to administer the complexity of rehabilitation practice in the interactions of clinical impairments, dysfunctions and participation in society in order to specify individuals’ rehabilitation treatment. 删除9：<u>43 </u>Yet, the two cases’ rehabilitation treatment aims were similar and were focused on ambulation function. Acute adult inpatient physical rehabilitation often includes stressing motor systems toward safe, independent ambulation because ambulatory function is a key milestone for discharge planning. This is important within the goal of reducing acute hospital length of stay (LOS) which is itself dependent on coherent, equitable and resourced rehabilitation services downstream of an acute setting. But the problem with yoking rehabilitation with minimising LOS is that the rehabilitation aim is often achievement of minimal _adaptive_ ambulatory function necessary for a safe discharge. The aim instead should be the _restitution_ 71 of ambulatory function, especially since stroke 72 and spinal cord-injured 73 neurorehabilitation patients express it as their primary goal. Restitution of ambulatory performance therefore requires rehabilitative progression towards premorbid performance, not merely an assessment of current ambulatory performance.\n\n【46】The RTSS includes accurate specification of rehabilitation progression and was included throughout the two cases described. For ambulatory function, a separate treatment ingredient was included so the two cases were proficient in self-monitoring their exertional fatigue—a common symptom burden for patients with acute spinal cord injury. 删除9：<u>74 </u>That allowed the ambulatory treatment’s progression to be specified in both cases by attributing the therapeutic dose of ambulatory practise (distance or time walked) with the patient’s increase in self-rated exertional fatigue (using a dual Numerical and Face Rating Scale 75 ) during ambulatory treatment ingredients.\n\n【47】Similar separate treatment ingredients were included in our specification designed for the cases to attain skills and habits in managing the risk to their musculoskeletal integrity by applying ankle resting splints and foot-up devices when ambulating. We contend that without the RTSS’s coherent framework, there would be a risk that therapists might not have clinically reasoned tailored treatments as thoroughly, nor been as accurate in specifying it.\n\n【48】In conclusion, the combination of timely medical treatment and specific and clinically reasoned rehabilitation in a structured format using the RTSS provided excellent functional outcomes in both the acute and subacute phases post-injury in two individuals who sustained N <sub>2 </sub> O-induced spinal cord injury. Stronger conclusions can be drawn when future studies determine the impact of rehabilitation on clinical outcomes at the impairment, activity and participation levels in this patient cohort by virtue of using the RTSS.\n\n【49】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【50】Case 2 and his next of kin were able to provide their perspective of their assessment and treatment.\n\n【51】Before the hospital admission we had no idea about the possible side effects of the inhaled canisters. Lots of the young people where we live took them at parties and we believed that they were risk free, we had never heard of others experiencing medical complications from taking them.\n\n【52】The profound loss of ambulation was terrifying particularly because there were no initial explanation why these symptoms had occurred.\n\n【53】When we initially went to hospital the doctors weren’t sure what was the cause of the weak legs and the inability to walk. After the scans the doctors explained that there was a problem with the nerves in the back and they weren’t totally sure if my son’s walking would fully recover. They thought that the gas canisters were the cause because of some of the blood test results. We were all shocked that this had happened and it was scary to hear that someone so young might have long term effects that they would have to live with. It was hard for us not to know what the future may hold for him, we felt very worried.\n\n【54】However, the medical assessment and treatment and the inpatient physical therapy rehabilitation delivered enabled meaningful recovery – a recovery that was complete after receiving longer term community physiotherapy.

The evidence is scarce on best choice once first-line therapy fails. Beta-blockers had been used in the past successfully but with concerns about safety. The ultrashort acting beta-blockers like esmolol can be used more safely in this scenario, and should be reconsidered, particularly given the mechanism of ventricular arrythmias in these poisonings.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A woman in her 30s presented to a remote hospital after a very large intentional amitriptyline overdose of up to 10 g (up to 128 mg/kg). Her medical history included only major depressive disorder, and there was no family history of arrythmia or cardiac disease.\n\n【10】She required immediate intubation for persisting coma and seizures. Sodium bicarbonate and hyperventilation were initiated for electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria of widened QRS and coma, and titrated to a pH of 7.55. After discussion with a toxicology specialist, intralipid was commenced and aeromedical retrieval was arranged. The aircraft was diverted to our hospital after two inflight episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) requiring defibrillation.\n\n【11】At our hospital, the patient continued to have frequent and intractable ventricular tachycardia progressing to fibrillation, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. She had aggressive electrolyte replacement aiming for potassium levels of 4.5–5, magnesium levels>1.3 mmol/L and normal ionised calcium. Multiple repeated doses of sodium bicarbonate up to 1600 mmols and hypertonic saline 1500 mmols were administered, titrated to achieve a pH of 7.55, and Na>155. The ECG showed sinus tachycardia with increasingly broader complexes progressing to monomorphic VT of 200 beats/min with increasing automaticity then deteriorating to ventricular fibrillation, with no features of a torsades pattern or Brugada criteria. Further infusion of intralipid was given (6 hours after the first) and further magnesium infusion and then lidocaine infusion were all given without apparent effect. Inotropes and pressors were required to maintain a perfusing mean arterial blood pressure of >60 mm Hg.\n\n【12】In view of the failure to resolve the arrhythmias and echocardiographic evidence of reducing ventricular function after multiple defibrillations, the patient was discussed with a tertiary cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) for consideration of extra-corporeal cardiac support (ECMO). To support the progressively lower cardiac output and to facilitate transfer an intra-arterial balloon pump (IABP) was inserted.\n\n【13】Despite the above treatments, the patient continued to have VT/VF, a total of 28 episodes requiring CPR and defibrillation over the next 8 hours. It was observed that after a successful defibrillation the ECG would normalise when the rate was below 100 and begin to have progressively longer QT interval as the rate increased. Given that all treatment goals were being met and arrhythmias were continuing, a trial of intravenous esmolol (ultra-short acting B-blocker) was given. The patients heart rate initially reduced to 60 beats/min and slowly increased to 100 over the next 30 min with no arrhythmias occurring.\n\n【14】When the heart rate returned above 100 beats/min, the ECG again displayed increased QRS duration (>200 ms) and automaticity, provoking ventricular tachycardia which soon deteriorated to VF. An esmolol infusion was recommenced, targeting a heart rate of 80–100 beats/min. The ECG now showed a rate of 98 beats/min with QRS duration of 120 ms. The patient had no further arrhythmias with this therapeutic manoeuvre and was stable on transfer to the tertiary cardiac centre, with a reducing inotrope requirement. Attempts to stop or wean the esmolol infusion resulted in recurrence of tachycardia then VT/VF and the esmolol was continued for 72 hours. The IABP was weaned within 48 hours, and the patient extubated on day 7.\n\n【15】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【16】There was no family history suggesting that the patient had an underlying familial or genetic tendency to VF such as Brugada syndrome, where the use of amitriptyline can block sodium channels I <sub>Na </sub> I <sub>to </sub> and I <sub>Kr </sub> leading to unmasking of Brugada ECG phenotype, or exacerbate a Congenital prolonged QT syndrome. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>It is unlikely that she had undiagnosed critical coronary arterial disease in view of her age and subsequent follow-up. The patient had taken one of the largest overdoses we are aware of, as much as 10 g of amitriptyline, and this was evidenced by retrospective amitriptyline levels from the day of admission being beyond the limits of the assay (>1000 µmols/L), quantifiable by day 4 as 994 µmols/L and normalising to 232 µmols/L by day 10 . Some people with cytochrome p phenotypes can have delayed clearance of amitriptyline, but this is not routinely assessable.\n\n【17】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【18】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【19】Amitriptyline/nortriptyline levels versus days from presentation. The tricyclic levels from the first days of the admission were higher than the upper level of the assay.</u>\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】The most common mode of death in tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdoses that reach hospital is refractory hypotension with progressive cardiac dysfunction due to contractile failure. The mechanisms leading to low cardiac output and hypotension are numerous. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【22】Spontaneous ventricular tachycardias and fibrillation are less common, but dramatically increase the risk of death. Slowed depolarisation and subsequent repolarisation of the cardiac action potential throughout myocardial conducting and contractile tissue leads to a relatively longer refractory period owing to use-dependant sodium channel blockade. 删除9：<u>4–6 </u>Acidosis, hypokalaemia, hypoxaemia, hyperthermia, hypotension and excessive adrenergic stimulation may also predispose to arrhythmias. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Blockade of the hERG human potassium channel by amitriptyline may also cause increased automaticity and arrhythmias in this setting of excessive adrenergic activity. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【23】In animal models, it appears that the combination of increased sinus node rate and prolonged QRS is key to the occurrence of VT/VF here. 删除9：<u>6 9 </u>Models first proposed in the 1970s predicted that block produced by tertiary amine local anaesthetics (like amitriptyline) may be enhanced by depolarisation, and that recovery from depolarisation-induced block is time dependant. As the heart rate increases, the diastolic period is shortened and there is insufficient time for complete drug unbinding between beats. The increasing presence of drug-associated (blocked) sodium channels reduces maximum sodium current and conduction velocity in cardiac muscle, resulting in QRS prolongation, and increases the likelihood of re-entrant type arrhythmias. 删除9：<u>10</u>\n\n【24】Prevention of sinus tachycardia in experimental amitriptyline toxicity by sinus node destruction, beta-blockers, direct vagal stimulation, physostigmine and specific bradycardia agents like zatebradine effectively prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmias, as well as reduce QRS prolongation. 删除9：<u>6 9 11 12</u>\n\n【25】Beta-blockade infusion was chosen in our patient to reduce the heart rate because we observed that the QRS and QT prolongation increased with rate, and arrythmias and triggered automaticity occurred exclusively when the heart rate was >110 and QRS prolonged, and we hoped to prevent the tachycardia and ventricular arrythmias despite the risks of reduced cardiac contractility.\n\n【26】Any potential reduction in contractility or blood pressure could be offset by careful titration of esmolol to a safe rate, the restoration of a perfusing rhythm, and in extremis the use of a cardiac support device such as IABP or ECMO. In this case, we minimised the dose of esmolol by titrating to a pulse range of less than 100 beats/min and more than 80beats/min. The malignant rhythm reappeared once the pulse rate was over 110 beats/min at several different times in her course. It was a successful intervention suggested by the fact that premature cessation of esmolol infusion on two occasions led to tachycardia and recurrence of ventricular tachycardia then fibrillation.\n\n【27】Currently first-line therapy of amitriptyline cardiac toxicity is generous use of IV sodium bicarbonate to provide sodium ions and alkalinisation. 删除9：<u>13–16 </u>Five to 7.5% hypertonic sodium has been shown to have as good or better effect than dilute sodium bicarbonate in reversing hypotension and QRS, and both are more effective than alkalinisation by hyperventilation alone, suggesting that the sodium dose is important. 删除9：<u>17 </u>Intra-lipid infusion (‘lipid rescue’) was recommended by the toxicologist, commenced at the referring hospital and was continued as recommended, with no apparent benefit. Positive anecdotes of successful use of intralipid are not supported by clinical trails and human or animal models so far. 删除9：<u>18–20</u>\n\n【28】There is no consensus over the recommended ‘second line’ therapy of magnesium, lidocaine or phenytoin for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and sodium channel blockers such as flecainide, procaianamide and amiodarone are strongly contra-indicated. 删除9：<u>21–24 </u>There are no trials comparing them, but currently small case series and animal models favour lidocaine. 删除9：<u>5 23 </u>Physostigmine was observed to reduce anticholinergic symptoms, tachycardia and arrhythmias, but avoided due to adverse events. 删除9：<u>25 </u>Long-acting beta-blockers have been used in past decades, with some successful cases but significant concerns about reducing ventricular contractility and worsening shock. 删除9：<u>26–29</u>\n\n【29】The antiarrhythmic mechanism of betablockers is complex and depends on the specific mechanism of the arrhythmia. 删除9：<u>30 </u>In this situation, the ventricular arrhythmias may have been caused by triggered activity due to afterdepolarisations in a situations where the action potential is already prolonged by the rate dependant block, as well as the profound sympathetic stimulation of cardiac arrest.\n\n【30】We propose that in cases of severe amitriptyline toxicity complicated by intractable ventricular tachycardia and arrhythmias unresponsive to the typical first-line and second-line medications, and where all care has been given to controlling homeostasis by optimisation of potassium, magnesium, calcium, pH, oxygenation and perfusing blood pressure, that a titrated short acting beta-blocker infusion can be considered\n\n【31】### Learning points\n\n【32】*   Resistant ventricular arrythmias greatly increase the risk of death in tricyclic antidepressant toxicity and can be difficult to treat.\n\n【33】*   The type of sodium channel blockade caused by tricyclics means that recovery from depolarisation-induced block is time dependant, suggesting that an increased heart rate can lead to greater risk of ventricular arrythmia occurrence.\n\n【34】*   Second line medications to treat VT or VF in TCA toxicity have poor evidence and efficacy, and although extra-corporeal cardiovascular support is an option, it is not always available.\n\n【35】*   In severe amitriptyline toxicity complicated by intractable ventricular arrhythmias unresponsive to the typical first and second-line therapies, and attention to homeostasis, that a titrated short acting beta-blocker infusion can be considered, and may be lifesaving.\n\n【36】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【37】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【38】Consent obtained from next of kin.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:23:40", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:23:55", "cost": 15.317}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:23:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:23:40"}

To rule out intracranial lesions, we performed contrast-enhanced head MRI and performed a lumbar puncture. Head MRI showed no space-occupying lesions, and the sample obtained by lumbar puncture showed negative in CrAg, Indian ink dyeing and fungal culture.

Infiltrate shadows were scarred circularly and faded (A), and two nodules disappeared after the administration of antifungal therapy for 3 months (B).</u>\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】We report a case of asymptomatic PC that presented with mixed infiltrative and nodular shadows in an immunocompromised patient. We can learn three important points.\n\n【32】First, based on imaging findings alone, it is difficult to identify PC as a differential diagnosis. The typical chest imaging findings of PC are most often nodular shadows but may also present as cavitary or infiltrative shadows. 删除9：<u>2 4 </u>In the present case, nodular and infiltrating shadows were mixed, but it was sometimes difficult to distinguish nodular shadows from lung cancer and an infiltrating form of ILD, such as pneumonia or COP. The patient had RA as an underlying disease; therefore, RA-ILD was easily identified. Furthermore, as there was no fever or cough, the likelihood of a respiratory tract infection was not assumed to be high on the list of differential diagnoses.\n\n【33】Second, in this case, PC was diagnosed because fungi were found in the lung tissue and CrAg was positive. Both tissue and culture specimens were obtained using bronchoscopy, which is a less invasive, generalised, and useful test for obtaining both tissue and culture specimens. In a previous report, many cases required video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) to reach the diagnosis of PC. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>When VATS is performed for diagnosis, tissue culture should also be performed to identify the causative organism in case of an infection. Minimally invasive bronchoscopy is the preferred diagnostic method if possible.\n\n【34】Third, there are some specific considerations for immunocompromised hosts. The patient had been receiving methotrexate (8 mg weekly) for 7 years for RA and was immunocompromised. 删除9：<u>6 </u>This is because methotrexate inhibits directly or indirectly the function of nearly every cell type involved in inflammation, including neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, B cells, etc. 删除9：<u>7 </u>On the other hand, we determined that the patient did not develop severe immune deficiency due to the lack of decrease in neutrophil or lymphocyte count in peripheral blood induced by the toxic effect of methotrexate. Opportunistic infections often have a clinical course, with few symptoms or atypical imaging findings. It is difficult to determine a specific disease based on imaging findings alone, and we should strive to confirm the diagnosis more rigorously and sometimes more invasively in immunocompromised patients than in immunocompetent patients.\n\n【35】Finally, we initiated two loading doses of intravenous fosfluconazole 800 mg daily in the present case. The recent guidelines for the treatment of PC in immunocompromised hosts with mild to moderate symptoms recommend oral fluconazole 400 mg daily for 6–12 months. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Fluconazole takes approximately 10 days for serum concentration to stabilise due to its long elimination half-time. Two loading doses of intravenous fosfluconazole can shorten the time to achieve stable plasma concentration from 10 to 3 days. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Rapid achievement of target steady plasma concentration seemed to be beneficial for the patient because the patient had multiple pulmonary lesions, which could be severe.\n\n【36】The report had one limitation. The serum sample at the first visit indicated a higher level of 通用删除7(英):<u>(1,3)</u>-β-D-glucan than the upper limit of the normal. In cryptococcosis, serum 通用删除7(英):<u>(1,3)</u>-β-D-glucan remains at normal levels, despite mycosis. Other serological tests for other mycoses were negative in this case; therefore, we thought that the elevation of 通用删除7(英):<u>(1,3)</u>-β-D-glucan might be false-positive or meaningless data in actual clinical case.\n\n【37】We report a case of asymptomatic PC presenting with mixed infiltrative and nodular shadows in an immunocompromised patient. When an immunocompromised patient presents with abnormal chest shadows, respiratory infections, including PC, should be among the identified diagnoses, even if imaging findings are atypical.\n\n【38】### Learning points\n\n【39】*   Pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) can present with a variety of radiographic findings and is sometimes difficult to distinguish from lung cancer, tuberculosis or interstitial lung diseases.\n\n【40】*   Bronchoscopy is a less invasive, generalised, and useful procedure for obtaining both tissue and culture specimens.\n\n【41】*   When an immunocompromised patient presents with abnormal chest shadows, respiratory infections, including PC, should be among the differential diagnoses, even if the imaging findings are atypical.\n\n【42】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【43】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【44】Obtained.\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Editage  for English editing.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:43:01", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:45:52", "cost": 170.579}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:45:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:43:00"}

The patient was diagnosed with pancreatitis and hepatitis A; and 2 days later, she left the hospital against medical advice. The patient continued with the nausea and vomiting secondary to possible pancreatitis and hepatitis A. At 15 weeks’ gestation, she visited the emergency room of our hospital with severe nausea, vomiting and altered mental status.\n\n【4】The patient had more than 8 weeks of persistent nausea and vomiting, decreased oral intake, and a new onset of somnolence, confusion, and unstable ambulation. In the emergency department, on the physical examination, cardiopulmonary and abdomen were normal. The abdomen was not distended, and the uterus was palpable at the midpoint between the umbilicus and the pubic symphysis. The patient was confused, able to nod to commands, but dysarthric, and unable to ambulate due to imbalance. Laboratory studies revealed total bilirubin of 3.4 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase of 291 U/L, alanine transaminase of 256 U/L and lipase of 984 U/L. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan of the brain were normal.

She was started on thiamine 500 mg intravenously three times a day for 2 days, followed by 250 mg intravenously daily for 5 days in combination with other prenatal vitamins such as folic acid and vitamin B complex. She was discharged to acute inpatient rehabilitation on oral thiamine and multivitamins. At the time of discharge, she was oriented to person, time, place and situation, speech clear and able to perform all her activities of daily living with assistance.\n\n【9】WE is an acute neuropsychiatric emergency resulting from a deficiency of thiamine. In industrialised countries, 90% of the cases of thiamine deficiency are associated with alcohol misuse. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Non-alcoholic causes of WE such as gastrointestinal surgery, starvation and HG are less frequent.\n\n【10】Rane _et al_ described nausea affecting up to 80% of pregnant women; however, HG affects up to 3% of pregnant women. 删除9：<u>2 </u>It may lead to severe nutritional deficiency in the mother and the fetus. In our patient, the combination of increased demand during pregnancy, deficient oral intake secondary to nausea and vomiting, malabsorption during hepatitis A and HG, and the lack of thiamine deficiency prophylaxis were the causes of WE. Green top guideline recommends prophylaxis for WE with 100 mg of parenteral thiamine each day the patient received intravenous dextrose. 删除9：<u>3 </u>During and after previous hospital admission, our patient, with more than 8 weeks of vomiting, did not receive thiamine supplements.\n\n【11】In previous admission, WE was not diagnosed in our patient because altered mental status was not present.

The history of nausea and vomiting related to HG, hepatitis A and pancreatitis sets our patient apart from other patients with concurrent HG and WE. Our patient started with symptoms earlier during pregnancy which lasted for more than 8 weeks. Our patient did not have any pregnancy complications and followed up in the obstetrics clinic at 20 weeks of gestation.

Although significantly more common in patients who undergo laparoscopic surgeries, some patients who undergo open procedures may experience postoperative ipsilateral shoulder pain. This type of pain is caused by the irritation of tissues supplied by the phrenic nerve. To treat shoulder tip pain, which is precipitated by diaphragmatic irritation, the C3, C4 and C5 nerve roots must be blocked, but as this would inhibit phrenic nerve function and cause apnoea, it is not an option. Furthermore, this type of pain is often not responsive to systemic analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【8】To our knowledge, there is no effective established treatment for patients experiencing shoulder pain after an open pancreaticoduodenectomy. Sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) was first reported as a treatment for unilateral facial pain symptom complex in 1908 and has since then been used to treat a number of painful conditions. 删除9：<u>3 </u>This is the first report of a successful treatment of intractable ipsilateral shoulder pain after an open pancreaticoduodenectomy with topical transnasal SPGB using a cotton-tipped applicator. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this report.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A 59-year-old woman with a prior medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas underwent an open pancreaticoduodenectomy, portal lymphadenectomy, retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy and pancreatic ultrasound. The surgery was performed under general and thoracic epidural anaesthesia (catheter inserted at T7–T8 level). There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperative pain was managed using patient controlled-epidural anaesthesia (PCEA) with bupivacaine 0.1% with 2 µg/mL fentanyl with a basal infusion of 8 mL/hour and a 2 mL PCEA dose with a lockout of 12 min. The epidural PCEA provided excellent incisional pain relief; however, the patient experienced left shoulder pain (Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 10/10 for most of the day) that did not respond to acetaminophen 975 mg PO every 6 hours, ketorolac 15 mg IV every 8 hours, lidocaine 5% transdermal patch, hydromorphone 0.5 mg every 4 hours, oxycodone 5 mg PO every 4 hours and oxycodone 10 mg PO every 4 hours.\n\n【11】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【12】On postoperative day 2, the acute pain service was consulted to evaluate the patient’s shoulder pain. The patient reported that she had a remote history of left shoulder pain 10 years prior to admission that resolved with physical therapy and intra-articular steroid injections. She reported that the postsurgical pain she was currently experiencing in her left shoulder was ‘excruciating’ and that it was significantly different from the type of pain she had 10 years ago. She described her current pain as sharp and needle-like sensation inside her shoulder that would randomly get significantly worse throughout the day since the surgery. The pain, when it was at its worst, would last in severity for 30 min.\n\n【13】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【14】The differential diagnoses included pain from surgical positioning, immediate postoperative complications, such as anastomotic leak or subphrenic collections, cardiac complications, pulmonary complications and/or referred pain from manipulation of the pancreas. The patient was afebrile and had no leukocytosis. Chest X-ray findings included: heart and mediastinum of normal size and contour; linear opacity in the left lower lobe likely representing atelectasis; no developing chronic heart failure or pneumonia; osseous structures unremarkable, particularly involving the left shoulder; no acute fracture or dislocation; and unremarkable acromioclavicular joint. This suggested that the source of the pain was not from surgical malposition nor from a pulmonary complication. ECG showed sinus rhythm, heart rate of 79 beats per minute with normal axis, which made the shoulder pain from a cardiac complication less likely. Since there were no signs of systemic infection at that time, which could point towards immediate postoperative complications, the primary surgical team chose not to do a CT scan at this time. The remaining differential diagnosis was referred pain from manipulation of the pancreas.\n\n【15】Treatment\n---------\n\n【16】Based on a recent publication of the SPGB being an effective treatment for post-thoracic shoulder tip pain 4 and our observation of the block being an effective treatment for various headache and neck pain aetiologies in our pain clinic, we offered the SPGB to this patient. On discussion of potential risks and benefits of the procedure, including the option of not proceeding, the patient elected to go ahead and signed a written informed consent.\n\n【17】At the start of the procedure the patient’s left shoulder pain was 5/10 on the NRS. SPGB applicators were created from hollow cotton swabs, intravenous extension tubing with a stop cock, 删除13：<u>3 </u>mL syringes, 5% lidocaine ointment and 4% lidocaine topical solution . The patient was positioned in the supine position with her head off the bed, supported by a pillow, for cervical spine extension (chin-up position) . Haemodynamic monitors consisting of non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry and EKG were applied, and the patient remained haemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. The SPGB applicator dipped into lidocaine ointment was gently inserted into each nostril atraumatically and stopped at the point where gentle resistance gave way at the junction of the turbinates and aperture of the nasopharynx. Lidocaine 4% was dripped drop by drop through the applicators into each nostril until the patient felt the medication in the back of her throat (1 mL into the right nostril and 0.5 mL into the left nostril) . The SPGB applicators were left in place for a total of 15 min while the patient had a small towel covering her eyes for comfort.\n\n【18】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【19】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【20】Creation of the sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) applicator: Supplies (lidocaine 4% topical solution, lidocaine 5% ointment, scissors, hollow cotton-tips, 删除13：<u>3 </u>cc syringes, Anaesthesia IV Set and towel to cover eyes (optional)); Disconnect the ‘Anaesthesia IV Set’ and cut the purple tip with scissors; Disconnect the tip of the ‘Anaesthesia IV Set’ and toss the tip; Connect all the remaining pieces together.</u>\n\n【21】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【22】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【23】The positioning of the sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) applicators in a mannequin model.</u>\n\n【24】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【25】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【26】The sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) applicator on a mannequin model demonstrating that once a patient feels the medication in the back of the throat, the medication has reached the SPGB (marked with the green circle).</u>\n\n【27】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【28】At the end of the procedure, the patient was asked to sit up. She reported that her shoulder pain had entirely resolved, 0/10 on NRS.\n\n【29】During the procedure, the patient reported having some difficulty swallowing because it felt like the back of her throat was numb. This sensation resolves on its own after several minutes. On postoperative day 12, when the patient was being discharged from the hospital, she remained pain free in her shoulder. The patient was followed up 1 month later via a telephone call. At that time, the patient excitedly reported that she has been pain free in her shoulder since the SPGB treatment.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】Open pancreaticoduodenectomy is one of the most complicated surgeries and involves a significant amount of intra-abdominal manipulation. When the head of the pancreas is affected, patients typically perceive pain in the T5–T9 regions; however, when the tail of the pancreas is involved, patients experience referred pain to the left shoulder secondary to the innervation of the C3–C5 dermatomes. 删除9：<u>5 6 </u>As in our patient’s situation described above and in many other pancreaticoduodenectomy surgeries, when the epidural is inserted at the thoracic level, the epidural is unable to relieve a patient of the referred shoulder pain. Systemic medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids, are often trialled with limited effectiveness. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Furthermore, opioids are commonly associated with adverse reactions, such as respiratory depression, sedation, dizziness, gastrointestinal disturbances, tolerance and physical dependence. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【32】When the administration of acetaminophen, ketorolac, lidocaine transdermal patch, oxycodone and hydromorphone did not provide sufficient left shoulder pain relief to our patient, the SPGB, a technique first described by Sluder over a century ago, 删除13：<u>8 </u>was used and found to be highly effective. The precise neurophysiological mechanism that explains the observed results in our patient is unknown; perhaps it will be elucidated with future work.\n\n【33】Since there is only one sphenopalatine ganglion, the commonly accepted SPGB technique is to place local anaesthetic topically by way of both the left and right nasal passages local anesthetic-soaked swabs, contributing to successful transmucosal reach and coverage of the SPG. 删除9：<u>9 </u>However, the sphenopalatine ganglion is a bilateral structure, so, in theory, a block just through the left nasal passage could have also potentially achieved the observed result. There are several commercially available devices available to perform SPGB, but the administration of this block via the assembly of cotton-tip applicators from supplies that are readily available in most medical centres is simple and inexpensive. 删除9：<u>4 9–13 </u>The fascinating aspect of this block is that not only does it treat numerous pain conditions, including headaches of various aetiologies, neck pain, back pain 6 10–13 and now postoperative shoulder pain, but it also, somehow, has a long-term effect. Even after the temporary effects of local anaesthetic wear off, certain pain conditions resolve and never return after this treatment. This interesting phenomenon would benefit from further investigation. In the meantime, we suggest that this technique be considered for patients with postsurgical shoulder tip pain.\n\n【34】### Learning points\n\n【35】*   This is the first report of a successful treatment of intractable ipsilateral shoulder pain after an open pancreaticoduodenectomy with topical transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion block using a cotton-tipped applicator.\n\n【36】*   Although there are several commercially available devices available to perform sphenopalatine ganglion blocks, the sphenopalatine ganglion block can also be effectively performed by quickly and inexpensively creating cotton-tip applicators from supplies that are readily available in most medical centres.\n\n【37】*   The cotton-tip applicators can be created from the combination of hollow cotton swabs, intravenous extension tubing with a stop cock, 删除13：<u>3 </u>mL syringes, 5% lidocaine ointment and 4% lidocaine topical solution.\n\n【38】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【39】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【40】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:53:26", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:53:44", "cost": 17.468}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:29", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:53:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:53:26"}

At the time of her surgery, she had 23 years of jazz dance experience and was running a dance studio, teaching students and organising and performing in musicals. She had bilateral hip pain from 2003 and was diagnosed with acetabular dysplasia. Her pain did not improve despite conservative treatment, and she was diagnosed with bilateral acetabular labral tears. She underwent arthroscopic labral repair of the right hip in 2010 at another hospital due to her reduced dance performance and that of the left side in 2011. However, because of the progressive deformity of her hip joint and the more severe pain she was experiencing, she could no longer perform deep hip flexion movements in jazz dance. She consulted the orthopaedic surgery department of our hospital to discuss a treatment plan, and she was diagnosed with bilateral advanced osteoarthritis, for which the surgeon recommended SBTHA . She was briefed by the surgeon on the risks and other possible complications involved in performing THA. She consented to these in writing and underwent cementless SBTHA at our hospital in 2013 . The operation was performed bilaterally using a transtrochanteric approach. 删除9：<u>13 </u>The cementless titanium alloy stem (neck, 删除13：<u>0 </u>mm; K-MAX Q Hip Stem), AMS HA shell (multihole; outer diameter, 删除13：<u>46 </u>mm), 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine-grafted liners (Aquala) and cobalt–chromium–molybdenum alloy femoral ball (28 mm) used in this study were all obtained from KYOCERA Medical (Japan). The basic dislocation position was forced flexion of the hip joint or combined hip extension and external rotation. The patient’s acceptable hip joint ROMs after SBTHA based on the intraoperative hip angles were 130° of flexion, 25° of extension, 70° of abduction, 30° of right adduction, 20° of left adduction, 90° of external rotation and 30° of internal rotation.\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【15】Preoperative X-ray of the patient’s hips showing bilateral osteoarthritis.

Physical therapy during hospitalisation was performed 5 days a week, once a day, for 60 min. The patient was able to perform daily activities without a cane 21 days postsurgery and subsequently discharged home. Outpatient physical therapy was started 28 days postsurgery and performed once a week for 80 min each time. She hoped to be able to perform sufficient lower extremity flexion in the long sitting position and grand plié in the second and parallel position. We therefore performed physical therapy with the goal of increasing her ROM in hip flexion, abduction and external rotation as well as enabling her to fully support her bodyweight within the ROM of the hip joint.\n\n【21】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【22】Two months after surgery, she started practising steps and turns without hip flexion of greater than 90° under our supervision. She returned to work as a dance instructor 2 months postsurgery. However, her work then consisted mainly of verbal dance lessons and office work. At 7 months postsurgery, the surgeon allowed her to practise dance movements with greater than 90° of hip flexion, but she was anxious about hip dislocation this time. To reduce her anxiety and provide her with a safer hip flexion angle, we used a 3D motion analysis device (UM-CAT II, 删除9：<u>180 </u>Hz; UNIMEC, Japan) for motion guidance. The reflex markers were placed at the anterior superior iliac spine, greater trochanter of the femur, and centre of the anteroposterior diameter on the lateral side of the knee joint. As this device could display data in real time, we could tell her the hip flexion angle required in dancing and daily life activities . Hence, she was able to safely perform the movements she wanted to after surgery . At 8 months postsurgery, she was able to jump on the spot and make soft landing movements . She acquired safe dance movements 8 months postsurgery and returned to full-time work as a jazz dance instructor. Her JHEQ results at 1-year postsurgery showed that she had a high QOL with a hip dissatisfaction score of 3 mm and a total score of 81/84 points bilaterally (mental status, −3 points).

The patient’s hip ROM improved to the intraoperative ROM at 8 months postsurgery. The maximum flexion angles of the hip joint during movements using 3D motion analysis were 100° for squatting down during dancing and 119° for flexion of the lower leg from the long sitting position. Jazz dance is a dance genre that incorporates elements of ballet. Research has shown that the average hip flexion and abduction in the splits position in ballet are 133.2° and 32°, respectively. 删除9：<u>14 </u>The patient was able to achieve a wide ROM in the hip joint because she had a high degree of flexibility in the soft tissues around the hip joint due to her years of dance experience and because she was able to rigorously follow a self-training programme.\n\n【37】Although a wide range of dances are recommended after THA, 删除13：<u>2 </u>many people give up on dance genres that involve high-impact on the hip joint and deep hip flexion, such as jazz dance, after surgery 15 and considerable caution should be exercised when engaging in these activities. 删除9：<u>16 </u>In the present case, dislocation associated with hip flexion was of particular concern. Studies on impingement of the component, one of the causes of THA dislocation, have shown that impingement was present in more than half of dislocated cases. 删除9：<u>17 18 </u>Data have also shown that patients who participate in high-impact activities involving the hips and those who are less active do not differ in the frequency of dislocation. 删除9：<u>19 </u>In the present case, the surgeon asked the patient about the hip angle she needed for dancing before performing the surgery. The surgeon also determined the acceptable range of hip angles during rehabilitation after ensuring that impingement of the component would not occur during surgery. Sharing of this information between the surgeon, therapist, and patient helped reduce her anxiety about dislocation. By using 3D motion analysis to practise movements involving hip flexion of greater than 90°, we were able to safely coach her on dislocation prevention and reduce her anxiety. In addition, she was able to jump vertically and had soft landing movements at 8 months postsurgery. In various movements in ballet, ‘beauty’ (softness), rather than vigour, is emphasised; in such landing movements as the sissonne fermée, it is customary to land softly from a state of plantar flexion of the ankle joint. 删除9：<u>20 </u>Therefore, we considered that the patient’s landing technique was not newly acquired after THA and rather honed through her years of experience in jazz dance. As a result, her JHEQ score at 1-year postsurgery was almost perfect and her hip satisfaction level was high. Seven years have passed since the surgery, and she continues to be active without pain, dislocation, or wear but still needs to be observed.\n\n【38】The results of this case of an instructor with many years of dance experience are not likely to be applicable to all postoperative THA patients who wish to engage in jazz dancing. A patient should have considerable experience in a given high-impact sport before undergoing THA to be able to resume participating in it after surgery. 删除9：<u>21 </u>However, in this case report, we were able to prove the need for patients, surgeons and physical therapists to share information and for medical professionals to consider each patient’s level of sports activity and skills. Our findings also indicate that use of 3D motion analysis helps reduce patients’ anxiety and allows for safer movement instruction.\n\n【39】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【40】When I watch a video of myself dancing 14 years ago, when I started to have hip pain, I can see that I was very flexible at that time. However, I never thought that I would be using a cane after 7 years. I can still vividly recall that the pain in my hip joint was enough to change my life in the blink of an eye. The changes in my life are the way other people look at me and the financial issues. As I walked with a limp, my reputation with the people around me quickly diminished, and eventually I stopped receiving requests for dance work and became poor. It has been 7 years since my surgery, and I still occasionally do choreography that requires a deep hip bend, like crouching on the floor. Sometimes I feel the stiffness in my hip joints, but I enjoy it without straining myself. Now, based on my own experience, I lecture classes on how to use the body in a way that does not strain the joints. I will never forget the joy of being freed from the mental and physical stresses of that time by the surgery. My life is now much happier.\n\n【41】### Learning points\n\n【42】*   Information sharing and collaboration among patients, surgeons, and physical therapists is important to return to more hip-impacting sports.\n\n【43】*   The use of three-dimensional motion analysis is a useful tool in reducing patient anxiety about treatment and ensuring patient recovery after simultaneous bilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA).\n\n【44】*   Patients after THA need to have considerable preoperative experience before they can resume high-impact sports such as jazz dancing.\n\n【45】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【46】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【47】Obtained.\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A part of this report was presented at the 55th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Association of Rehabilitation Medicine, Japan, in 2018.

Our findings also indicate that use of 3D motion analysis helps reduce patients’ anxiety and allows for safer movement instruction.\n\n【39】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【40】When I watch a video of myself dancing 14 years ago, when I started to have hip pain, I can see that I was very flexible at that time. However, I never thought that I would be using a cane after 7 years. I can still vividly recall that the pain in my hip joint was enough to change my life in the blink of an eye. The changes in my life are the way other people look at me and the financial issues. As I walked with a limp, my reputation with the people around me quickly diminished, and eventually I stopped receiving requests for dance work and became poor. It has been 7 years since my surgery, and I still occasionally do choreography that requires a deep hip bend, like crouching on the floor. Sometimes I feel the stiffness in my hip joints, but I enjoy it without straining myself. Now, based on my own experience, I lecture classes on how to use the body in a way that does not strain the joints. I will never forget the joy of being freed from the mental and physical stresses of that time by the surgery. My life is now much happier.\n\n【41】### Learning points\n\n【42】*   Information sharing and collaboration among patients, surgeons, and physical therapists is important to return to more hip-impacting sports.\n\n【43】*   The use of three-dimensional motion analysis is a useful tool in reducing patient anxiety about treatment and ensuring patient recovery after simultaneous bilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA).\n\n【44】*   Patients after THA need to have considerable preoperative experience before they can resume high-impact sports such as jazz dancing.\n\n【45】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【46】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【47】Obtained.\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>A part of this report was presented at the 55th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Association of Rehabilitation Medicine, Japan, in 2018.

Ollivier _et al_ reported that 16.3% of postoperative THA patients participated in dance activities. 删除9：<u>4 </u>However, whether it is safe to dance after THA is a concern for both patients and physical therapists. Many patients who want to return to sports after THA are anxious about such complications as dislocation, wear and loosening. 删除9：<u>4 5 </u>In addition, a higher percentage of respondents report fear and doctor’s recommendation rather than postoperative pain and lack of interest in sports as reasons for not engaging in sports activities. 删除9：<u>4 6 </u>It is, therefore, necessary for patients to collaborate with their surgeon to eliminate their anxiety about dislocation and be reassured that they can perform sports-related movements through rehabilitation aimed at helping them return to their sports after THA.\n\n【8】On the other hand, previous studies comparing simultaneous bilateral THA (SBTHA with staged THA have shown that SBTHA is safer and leads to earlier improvements in hip flexion range of motion (ROM) and daily activities. 删除9：<u>7 8 </u>Furthermore, Yoshii _et al_ found that, compared with unilateral THA, SBTHA resulted in significant improvement in the disease-specific quality of life (QOL) of patients after THA based on the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Hip Disease Evaluation Questionnaire (JHEQ). 删除9：<u>9 </u>Movement analysis data for hip angles less than 90° have been reported for hula dancing and classical ballet, 删除13：<u>10 </u>whereas those for hip angles greater than 90° are lacking.

Simultaneously, we describe movement instruction using a three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis device. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show a patient’s successful return to jazz dance instruction after SBTHA.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images. The CARE checklist was used for this case report. 删除9：<u>12</u>\n\n【12】The patient was a 48-year-old Japanese female jazz dance instructor (height, 156.0 cm; weight, 删除13：<u>53 </u>kg;<mark>删除13：53 kg;</mark>index, 20.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) in 2013. At the time of her surgery, she had 23 years of jazz dance experience and was running a dance studio, teaching students and organising and performing in musicals. She had bilateral hip pain from 2003 and was diagnosed with acetabular dysplasia. Her pain did not improve despite conservative treatment, and she was diagnosed with bilateral acetabular labral tears. She underwent arthroscopic labral repair of the right hip in 2010 at another hospital due to her reduced dance performance and that of the left side in 2011. However, because of the progressive deformity of her hip joint and the more severe pain she was experiencing, she could no longer perform deep hip flexion movements in jazz dance. She consulted the orthopaedic surgery department of our hospital to discuss a treatment plan, and she was diagnosed with bilateral advanced osteoarthritis, for which the surgeon recommended SBTHA . She was briefed by the surgeon on the risks and other possible complications involved in performing THA. She consented to these in writing and underwent cementless SBTHA at our hospital in 2013 . The operation was performed bilaterally using a transtrochanteric approach. 删除9：<u>13 </u>The cementless titanium alloy stem (neck, 删除13：<u>0 </u>mm; K-MAX Q Hip Stem), AMS HA shell (multihole; outer diameter, 删除13：<u>46 </u>mm), 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine-grafted liners (Aquala) and cobalt–chromium–molybdenum alloy femoral ball (28 mm) used in this study were all obtained from KYOCERA Medical (Japan). The basic dislocation position was forced flexion of the hip joint or combined hip extension and external rotation. The patient’s acceptable hip joint ROMs after SBTHA based on the intraoperative hip angles were 130° of flexion, 25° of extension, 70° of abduction, 30° of right adduction, 20° of left adduction, 90° of external rotation and 30° of internal rotation.\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【15】Preoperative X-ray of the patient’s hips showing bilateral osteoarthritis.

Physical therapy during hospitalisation was performed 5 days a week, once a day, for 60 min. The patient was able to perform daily activities without a cane 21 days postsurgery and subsequently discharged home. Outpatient physical therapy was started 28 days postsurgery and performed once a week for 80 min each time. She hoped to be able to perform sufficient lower extremity flexion in the long sitting position and grand plié in the second and parallel position. We therefore performed physical therapy with the goal of increasing her ROM in hip flexion, abduction and external rotation as well as enabling her to fully support her bodyweight within the ROM of the hip joint.\n\n【21】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【22】Two months after surgery, she started practising steps and turns without hip flexion of greater than 90° under our supervision. She returned to work as a dance instructor 2 months postsurgery. However, her work then consisted mainly of verbal dance lessons and office work. At 7 months postsurgery, the surgeon allowed her to practise dance movements with greater than 90° of hip flexion, but she was anxious about hip dislocation this time. To reduce her anxiety and provide her with a safer hip flexion angle, we used a 3D motion analysis device (UM-CAT II, 删除9：<u>180 </u>Hz; UNIMEC, Japan) for motion guidance. The reflex markers were placed at the anterior superior iliac spine, greater trochanter of the femur, and centre of the anteroposterior diameter on the lateral side of the knee joint. As this device could display data in real time, we could tell her the hip flexion angle required in dancing and daily life activities . Hence, she was able to safely perform the movements she wanted to after surgery . At 8 months postsurgery, she was able to jump on the spot and make soft landing movements . She acquired safe dance movements 8 months postsurgery and returned to full-time work as a jazz dance instructor. Her JHEQ results at 1-year postsurgery showed that she had a high QOL with a hip dissatisfaction score of 3 mm and a total score of 81/84 points bilaterally (mental status, −3 points).

The patient’s hip ROM improved to the intraoperative ROM at 8 months postsurgery. The maximum flexion angles of the hip joint during movements using 3D motion analysis were 100° for squatting down during dancing and 119° for flexion of the lower leg from the long sitting position. Jazz dance is a dance genre that incorporates elements of ballet. Research has shown that the average hip flexion and abduction in the splits position in ballet are 133.2° and 32°, respectively. 删除9：<u>14 </u>The patient was able to achieve a wide ROM in the hip joint because she had a high degree of flexibility in the soft tissues around the hip joint due to her years of dance experience and because she was able to rigorously follow a self-training programme.\n\n【37】Although a wide range of dances are recommended after THA, 删除13：<u>2 </u>many people give up on dance genres that involve high-impact on the hip joint and deep hip flexion, such as jazz dance, after surgery 15 and considerable caution should be exercised when engaging in these activities. 删除9：<u>16 </u>In the present case, dislocation associated with hip flexion was of particular concern. Studies on impingement of the component, one of the causes of THA dislocation, have shown that impingement was present in more than half of dislocated cases. 删除9：<u>17 18 </u>Data have also shown that patients who participate in high-impact activities involving the hips and those who are less active do not differ in the frequency of dislocation. 删除9：<u>19 </u>In the present case, the surgeon asked the patient about the hip angle she needed for dancing before performing the surgery. The surgeon also determined the acceptable range of hip angles during rehabilitation after ensuring that impingement of the component would not occur during surgery. Sharing of this information between the surgeon, therapist, and patient helped reduce her anxiety about dislocation. By using 3D motion analysis to practise movements involving hip flexion of greater than 90°, we were able to safely coach her on dislocation prevention and reduce her anxiety. In addition, she was able to jump vertically and had soft landing movements at 8 months postsurgery. In various movements in ballet, ‘beauty’ (softness), rather than vigour, is emphasised; in such landing movements as the sissonne fermée, it is customary to land softly from a state of plantar flexion of the ankle joint. 删除9：<u>20 </u>Therefore, we considered that the patient’s landing technique was not newly acquired after THA and rather honed through her years of experience in jazz dance. As a result, her JHEQ score at 1-year postsurgery was almost perfect and her hip satisfaction level was high. Seven years have passed since the surgery, and she continues to be active without pain, dislocation, or wear but still needs to be observed.\n\n【38】The results of this case of an instructor with many years of dance experience are not likely to be applicable to all postoperative THA patients who wish to engage in jazz dancing. A patient should have considerable experience in a given high-impact sport before undergoing THA to be able to resume participating in it after surgery. 删除9：<u>21 </u>However, in this case report, we were able to prove the need for patients, surgeons and physical therapists to share information and for medical professionals to consider each patient’s level of sports activity and skills. Our findings also indicate that use of 3D motion analysis helps reduce patients’ anxiety and allows for safer movement instruction.\n\n【39】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【40】When I watch a video of myself dancing 14 years ago, when I started to have hip pain, I can see that I was very flexible at that time.

A complete blood examination revealed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 96.6 ×10ˆ9/L, with a differential leucocyte count (DLC) showing 3% neutrophils and 95% lymphocytes. Additional findings included an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 550 U/L (reference range=235–470 U/L). Peripheral blood film analysis revealed markedly elevated WBCs, predominantly composed of immature and mature lymphocytes (95%), along with the presence of Smudge cells. Further investigations, including sonographic imaging, indicated hepatomegaly with hypoechoic space occupying lesions, moderate splenomegaly, and widespread bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.\n\n【4】A bone marrow examination confirmed the infiltration of intermediate-sized tumour cells with monomorphic features, including irregular nuclear contour, hyperchromatic to coarse chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed positivity for CD20, Cyclin D1, CD3, CD5, SOX11, MUM1, and Ki67 proliferation index of 80%. These findings led to a diagnosis of classical variant mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), stage IV, with a high-risk MIPI score of 11.3.\n\n【5】Standard chemotherapy consisting of 6 cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and R-DHAP (rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin) was administered to the patient. Autologous stem cell transplantation was recommended but declined by the patient, who opted for rituximab maintenance therapy instead. However, the patient experienced a relapse after 2 months, presenting with B symptoms, leucocytosis (WBC count=58.8 ×10ˆ9/L, with a DLC showing 82% lymphocytes, 12% neutrophils, 4% monocytes, and 2% eosinophils) and epistaxis. LDH was 892 U/L (reference range=235–470 U/L). Imaging studies, including a contrast-enhanced CT neck with CT angiography, revealed an ill-defined heterogeneously enhancing mass centred in the left maxillary sinus, causing erosion of the medial wall and extending medially into the nasal cavity. The mass resulted in destruction of the superior, middle, and inferior turbinates, involvement of the left ethmoidal sinuses, and deviation of the nasal septum to the right.\n\n【6】A subsequent endoscopic endonasal biopsy confirmed the presence of a reddish fragile mass filling the entire left nasal cavity, which bled on touch. Histopathological examination of multiple punch biopsies revealed infiltration by lymphoid cells positive for CD20, PAX5, CD3, CD5, Cyclin D1, SOX11, and Ki67 proliferation index of 90% on IHC. This confirmed relapse of refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Notably, a rare presentation of a fungating mass (5 cm × 3 cm)  protruding from the left external nare was observed. The patient was then initiated on a therapeutic regimen of bendamustine with rituximab and ibrutinib. After two cycles of treatment, a complete resolution of the protruding mass was achieved. The patient is currently undergoing counselling for autologous transplantation.\n\n【7】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【8】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【9】Fungating mass protruding out of left external nare of patient.</u>\n\n【10】The clinical course of MCL can indeed vary from an indolent (slow-growing) disease to an aggressive and rapidly progressive malignancy. MCL is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, typically stage III or IV, with involvement of multiple lymph nodes and extranodal sites. Extranodal involvement is common in MCL, and various sites can be affected like bone marrow, peripheral blood, gastrointestinal tract, spleen, and Waldeyer’s ring. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【11】A high Ki-67 proliferation index (>30%) in neoplastic cells has been found to be associated with poor survival in patients with MCL. 删除9：<u>2 </u>The MIPI is the first prognostic index specific to MCL patients. MIPI is based on the four independent prognostic factors: age, ECOG performance status, LDH, and WBC counts. Our patient had high-risk MIPI score.

In a study by Bond _et al_ , an inferior median overall survival of 1.3 years was seen in patients with early progression of disease within 6 months after both intensive and less-intensive frontline treatment. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【14】For cases of relapsed MCL, studies have shown that the combination of bendamustine, rituximab, ibrutinib, and venetoclax is well tolerated and achieves a therapeutic response of 80%. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Due to the lack of availability of venetoclax in India, our patient was given a combination of bendamustine, rituximab and ibrutinib and a good response was seen with resolution of the mass.\n\n【15】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【16】The only literate person in the patient’s family was his daughter, on being asked about her father’s disease, she said, “I am currently a pre-medical student and my father developed this disease just when I had started my preparation. Since I’m the only literate person in my family and the sole child of my father, a lot of the responsibility falls on me to talk to the doctors and try to understand his disease, the treatment protocols and the likelihood of his survival. I then have to explain all of this to my mother and entire family which sometimes becomes very hard for me too to take, but I try to be patient with everyone. My studies have taken a huge hit and I only can take out a few hours of focused studying. When the first chemotherapy protocol was completed and the doctor said that my father was now disease-free, it was a very happy moment for our entire family. But then when the disease came back and now my father is again on chemotherapy and is being planned for a transplant soon, I am very worried as to how things are going to work out. We all pray to god for mercy and hope that all treatment is successful and my father returns healthily soon.\n\n【17】### Learning points\n\n【18】*   Isolated fungating nasal mass is an extremely rare presentation of relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.\n\n【19】*   Novel therapeutic agents like ibrutinib are efficient options in relapsed refractory setting.\n\n【20】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【21】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【22】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:27:26", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:27:43", "cost": 17.098}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:27:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:27:26"}

Furthermore, they could be the first evidence of undiagnosed internal cancer, a tumour relapse or failure of treatment. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Even though the primary tumour was being treated in the current case, the rapid dissemination of the tumour indicates the aggressiveness of cancer. Cutaneous metastases are differentiated from primary skin tumours by their clinical presentations and histological features. Unlike primary skin tumours, cutaneous metastases rapidly grow in the dermis with intact overlying epidermis. In most cases, the metastatic deposits show histological features that resemble the underlying primary malignancy, may be more anaplastic and show less differentiation. In our case, histology showed infiltration of fibrocollagenous tissue by nests and sheets of malignant squamous cells in the dermis, exhibiting moderate anisonucleosis, coarse chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli, suggestive of metastatic deposits from SCC of the hypopharynx.\n\n【8】Cutaneous metastasis in hypopharyngeal carcinoma is extremely rare and few cases have been reported so far. Patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma who develop skin metastases often have a poor prognosis and a short lifespan. It may indicate a tumour relapse or treatment failure.

Admission vitals documented a blood pressure of 147/45 mm Hg with a pulse pressure (PP) of 102 mm Hg; otherwise, his initial admission note did not document any abnormal cardiovascular physical examination findings.

Her relatives provided a history of rat poison (rodenticide) intake (approximately half packet, the full packet contains 10 g of zinc phosphide (Zn <sub>3 </sub> P <sub>2 </sub> ); therefore, we estimated that she had ingested approximately 5g a few hours earlier. Immediately after routine basic investigations and stabilisation, gastric lavage was performed. On physical examination, her vital signs were normal, except for tachycardia (pulse rate 130 beats/min). She was able to follow one-step commands. Deep tendon reflexes were vigorous with bilateral extensor plantar responses. Extraocular movements were regular without nystagmus. After 2 days of hospitalisation, she began to exhibit behavioural changes, worsening confusion and disorientation, and over the next few hours, her condition rapidly deteriorated. With these features in mind, central nervous system (CNS) involvement was suspected, and a MRI scan of the brain was performed, which revealed symmetrically distributed diffusion restriction in bilateral periventricular supratentorial white matter with a reversal in apparent diffusion coefficient images. The sulcal spaces were effaced in bilateral cerebral hemispheres signifying brain oedema. However, the remaining MRI sequences 通用删除1(英):<u>(T1, T2, fluid attenuated inversion recovery and susceptibility weighted images)</u> did not reveal any abnormality . This white matter diffusion restriction without any abnormality on other MRI sequences has many differentials like toxic leucoencephalopathy, cranial irradiation, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, antimicrobial medications (eg, metronidazole), environmental toxins and drug abuse. Based on the history and MRI features, a diagnosis of leucoencephalopathy secondary to chemical rodenticide ingestion was made. As there is no specific antidote, the patient was managed conservatively. After a few days, her neurological symptoms gradually resolved, and she was able to perform her daily activities independently 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>. After 3 weeks, a follow-up MRI brain scan showed complete normalisation of MRI abnormalities, and  she remains under follow up.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】MRI of the brain in the axial plane.

Phosphides such as aluminium phosphide and Zn <sub>3 </sub> P <sub>2 </sub> are among the most commonly used in India. When ingested, these phosphides react with gastric acid and form phosphine gas, which is highly lethal. 删除9：<u>1 </u>As these rodenticides are cheap and readily available on the market, ingestion (as a suicide agent) has become a public health problem, especially in rural areas. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Although clinical and laboratory properties of metal phosphide poisoning have been described in the literature, very few clinical-radiological correlations of such cases have been published. Radiographic findings pertaining to pulmonary and abdominal complications have been described in previous reports of Zn <sub>3 </sub> P <sub>2 </sub> poisoning. 删除9：<u>3 </u>In our opinion, awareness of these MRI features would help emergency physicians or toxicologists/radiologists to detect this complication early and plan the appropriate treatment. To evaluate the CNS complications, MRI is the choice of investigation as it can be used to differentiate various types of leucoencephalopathy. It was found that this type of leucoencephalopathy can be treated symptomatically and is usually resolves with time. Here, we have described typical CNS imaging features in a patient with Zn <sub>3 </sub> P <sub>2 </sub> poisoning, which, as far as we know, has not been reported in the literature.\n\n【14】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【15】My daughter took rat poison and because of emotional distress we brought her to the hospital immediately, after which doctors did their best to treat her. Her behaviour changes were a major concern for us, but doctors gave us hope that she would be fine. After a few days of stay in the hospital, our daughter is now fine.\n\n【16】### Learning points\n\n【17】*   There should be clinical and radiological correlation to detect this potentially reversible complication early, which may facilitate management.\n\n【18】*   MRI brain is the choice of investigation in rodenticide poisoning affecting the central nervous system.\n\n【19】*   After rodenicide ingestion, leucoencephalopathy follow-up scans are important to identify the reversal of the abnormalities.\n\n【20】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【21】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【22】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:33:25", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:33:38", "cost": 13.025}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:33:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:33:25"}

Intraoral examination revealed generalised gingival enlargement involving marginal gingiva, attached gingiva and interdental papilla with extension of enlargement in palatal and lingual aspect of maxillary and mandibular arch respectively, bulbous contour, and lobulated appearance in mandibular anterior teeth region with loss of scalloping . On palpation the gingiva was firm, non-tender and leathery in consistency. Palatally, there was a lobulated ovoid out-growth on the mid-palatine raphe region from the enlarged gingiva which was pedunculated, firm and non-tender, interfering with speech and mastication. Maxillary occlusal and panoramic radiographs showed no abnormality. The haemogram was also normal. The pedunculated mass in the midline of the palate extending from the gingiva was excised under local anaesthesia and histologically evaluated, revealing dense fibro-collagenous stroma having chronic inflammatory cell infiltration at places with many small blood vessels, suggestive of fibrous hyperplasia . The histopathological diagnosis was clinically correlated to calcium channel blocker amlodipine and a diagnosis of drug-induced gingival enlargement was made. Following oral prophylaxis and oral hygiene instructions, the patient was referred to a physician who substituted amlodipine with losartan potassium. The patient was unwilling for gingivectomy and was lost to follow-up during the pandemic.\n\n【10】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【11】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【12】Generalised enlargement of the free, attached and interdental gingiva in the maxilla and mandible (A, B) with a pedunculated, lobulated growth in the midline of the hard palate (C).</u>\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【15】H&E stained microsections showing dense fibro-collagenous stroma having chronic inflammatory cell infiltration at places with many small blood vessels, suggestive of fibrous hyperplasia.

Ideally, estimating the lead level in ayurvedic medications would have implicated a cause-effect relation; however, this could not be done due to lack of mass spectrometry.

Her general practitioner (GP) referred her to an ophthalmologist who diagnosed a left abducens paresis and initiated an MRI demonstrating a mass in the left petrous apex. A transnasal endoscopic transsphenoidal biopsy revealed a grade I chondrosarcoma. The patient underwent an endoscopic transsphenoidal anterior petrosectomy approach with complete removal of the tumour. After surgery the squint angle gradually improved to previous levels, so that the patient was able to resume her work.

This triggered the further investigations via GP and ophthalmologist who diagnosed a left abducens paresis, subsequent MRI demonstrating the above-mentioned mass . The clinical examination demonstrated the left abducens paresis with no other cranial nerve involvement. Diplopia was only present with extreme abduction to the left; in daily life, she did not notice any double vision. The Ear, Nose and Throat Examination was unremarkable.

For this reason, reliable imaging techniques are of utmost importance. Usually, CT scans are obtained to assess the bony involvement and to assist planning of the surgical approach. The MRI modality is useful to look at specific tumour characteristics, extension and any signs of infiltration into neighbouring structures or compartments. The distinction between chordoma and chondrosarcoma can be challenging radiologically and histologically, this distinction is however crucial for the management considering the differing treatment strategies of these pathologies. Radiologically chondrosarcoma as well as chordoma demonstrate a T1 hypointensity with T2 hyperintensitiy and variable contrast enhancement, chordoma typically originate from the midline. 删除9：<u>7 </u>A recent Japanese study showed that apparent diffusion coefficient value ≥1750×10 <sup>−6 </sup> mm <sup>2 </sup> /s were predictive for chondrosarcoma. 删除9：<u>8 </u>In our patient, the mass exhibited a high signal intensity on T2 and a hypointensitiy on T1 with little contrast enhancement and restricted diffusion. Due to its paramedian location and lateral extension, our radiologists considered the chondrosarcoma as the working diagnosis.\n\n【22】Histologically, chondrosarcomas are divided into mesenchymal, conventional, dedifferentiated and clear cell subtypes. In the skull base, the WHO grade I–II conventional type chondrosarcomas are predominant. In contrast to the chondroma, the chondrosarcoma displays frank bone invasion. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Chondrosarcomas are positive for S100 staining and most show the IDH1-mutation, importantly they are negative for notochord lineage transcription factor brachyury and for cytokeratin, which clearly differentiates them from chordoma on immunohistochemistry. 删除9：<u>9 </u>In our case, the morphology showed a chondroid tumour with increased cellularity with positive staining for S100 and negativity for brachyury and cytokeratin thus confirming the diagnosis of grade I chondrosarcoma.\n\n【23】Treatment\n---------\n\n【24】After the histological diagnosis was made, an endoscopic transnasal tumour resection under general anaesthesia was performed by multidisciplinary team of otolaryngologists and neurosurgeons. The surgery entailed a creation of a nasoseptal flap for later coverage of the resection site, this was followed by removal of the posterior bony nasal septum and the sphenoidal rostrum with sphenoid sinus floor resection, lateral exposure was achieved by identifying the left vidian nerve and its canal. Subsequent removal of the posterior sphenoid wall revealed the tumour which had moved the cavernous ICA anteriorly. The tumour was removed in a piece meal fashion from medially to laterally up to the horizontal segment of the petrous ICA and posteriorly to the level of the left condyle of the atlas. There was no dural involvement by the tumour, thus complete macroscopic resection could be achieved. The resection site was then obliterated with abdominal fat and covered with the nasoseptal flap.\n\n【25】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【26】There were no postoperative sequelae. The postoperative squint angle gradually reduced to 14 prism dioptries with the left eye abduction improving from 0 to 6 mm. This allowed the patient to return to her normal work. The case was discussed at the sarcoma board which recommended regular 6-monthly MRI as follow-up without any need for adjuvant treatment. One year after surgery, the imaging showed no evidence of recurrence.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】Chondrosarcomas of the skull base are rare malignant tumours difficult to differentiate from chordomas on imaging and histopathology. So immunohistochemistry plays an important role in differentiating low-grade chondrosarcoma from chordoma and other chondromyxoid rich lesions of the central nervous system such as cystic schwannoma with myxoid degeneration and chondromyxoid fibroma. 删除9：<u>10</u>\n\n【29】In addition, resection is a challenge, as the lesion is located in a complex anatomical region of the body. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a skull base chondrosarcoma with an abducens palsy in a patient with a severely impaired contralateral vision. Due to the combination of these two clinical conditions, our patient did not experience any double vision.\n\n【30】Because of its long and tortuous course, localisation and affinity to Dorello’s canal, the abducens nerve is at risk in endonasal endoscopic skull base surgery, also in patients with no prior abducens nerve deficits. Clinical presentation of skull base chondrosarcoma can vary depending on the exact localisation and size of the lesion. Lawrence _et al_ 11 describe a case of a young man with abducens palsy with double vision as primary symptom, they opted for a combined contralateral endoscopic maxillary and endoscopic endonasal transclival approach for gross total resection of a WHO grade I petroclival chondrosarcoma with cavernous sinus involvement and subsequent postoperative radiation therapy. Banaz _et al_ 12 report a case of a middle-aged woman with abducens palsy and headache who had an intermediate grade petroclival chondrosarcoma resected completely through an expanded endoscopic endonasal transclival approach without postoperative radiotherapy. Pamias-Portalatin _et al_ 13 outline a case of a 35-year-old woman with diplopia, headache, hemifacial pain with a WHO grade III petroclival chondrosacroma involving superior clinoid ICA, hypoglossal canal, Meckels cave and cavernous sinus. They achieved a near-total resection with an endoscopic contralateral maxillary approach, with postoperative radiotherapy. Chondrosarcoma rarely may also present with acute intracranial pressure elevation. Laghari _et al_ 14 report of a 28-year-old man with intraventricular haemorrhage due to a petroclival mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.\n\n【31】Because of its rarity, there are no generally accepted treatment guidelines. Carlson _et al_ 6 analysed the data of a retrospective multicentre study including 55 patients with petroclival chondrosarcoma. Overall, 96% underwent surgery, in 27% of those gross total resection was achieved. The majority (64%) of patients were treated with surgery and radiotherapy, in 32% surgery alone was performed. The overall recurrence-free survival after 5 years was 70% for all chondrosarcomas, showing a significant worsening if the tumour size was bigger than 4 cm or if the ICA was encased more than 270° by the tumour. Hasegawa _et al_ 15 investigated upfront postoperative radiotherapy versus watchful waiting through serial MRI in 32 patients who underwent surgical resection of a WHO grade I–II chondrosarcoma in the skull base. They found a better short-term to intermediate-term recurrence control with postoperative radiotherapy. They also pointed out the feasibility of close observation in selected cases, due to good local manageability of recurrence without significant morbidity in the watchful waiting group. Simon _et al_ 16 found no survival benefit comparing skull base chondrosarcoma WHO grade I–II treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy vs surgery alone.\n\n【32】In summary, we report a case of a woman with a petroclival skull base chondrosarcoma WHO grade I presenting with an abducens palsy without noticing double vision due to preexisting amblyopia in the contralateral eye. She underwent an endoscopic endonasal transclival total resection with an uneventful postoperative course. Twelve months after surgery, there was no evidence of recurrence on imaging and she was able to return to work.\n\n【33】### Learning points\n\n【34】*   Even large skull base tumours may induce only discrete symptoms, especially in case of pre-existing cranial nerve damage, or other conditions such as blindness or strabism.\n\n【35】*   Differentiation between chordoma and chondrosarcoma based on imaging alone is very difficult.\n\n【36】*   Endoscopic endonasal removal of midline skull base tumours is an elegant method with little morbidity in experienced hands, preferably performed through a multidisciplinary team in a tertiary referral centre.\n\n【37】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【38】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【39】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:32:01", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:32:20", "cost": 19.088}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:32:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:32:01"}

Thermal burns occur when the skin is exposed to infrared radiation (800–170 000 nm) from an external heat source with a temperature exceeding 44°C. Long-term exposure to heat below the threshold for thermal burns is the primary aetiological factor in EAI. 删除9：<u>1 </u>It can occur at any site, with predominantly asymmetrical distribution depending on the location of the external heat source. The clinical pattern in EAI corresponds with the dermal venous plexus. It initially begins as transient macular erythema in a broad reticulated pattern which blanches easily. With recurrent heat exposure, the erythema becomes non-blanchable and evolves into a dusky hyperpigmentation. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Overlying skin may show focal areas of epidermal atrophy (early stage) or bullae/keratotic plaques (late stage). EAI is characteristically asymptomatic, although some patients may have a slight burning sensation. The hallmark of acute thermal inflammation is the presence of necrosis (epidermal±dermal or subcutaneous tissue depending on the degree on involvement). Histopathological changes in EAI include epidermal atrophy, vasodilatation and dermal pigmentation (melanin and haemosiderin). Focal hyperkeratosis and dyskeratosis along with squamous atypia are noted in later stages. 删除9：<u>1 3 </u>EAI is a clinical diagnosis. Biopsy is warranted to rule out cutaneous malignancy. After the inciting cause is removed, EAI tends to disappear gradually, but sometimes the pigmentation is permanent. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Vasculitis is a close mimic of this condition. EAI usually carries a good prognosis.

On auscultation, wheezing was heard. The doctor suspected bronchial asthma, and performed blood tests and a CT scan to exclude other diseases. Blood tests showed no significant abnormal findings, including tumour markers. The CT scan showed a tumour causing narrowing of the trachea, so the doctor consulted a respiratory physician in the same facility. The situation was considered life-threatening and the patient was intubated using a bronchoscope and placed on a mechanical ventilator. The tumour obstructing the trachea was identified using a bronchoscope . The large tumour had a stalk and bled easily. The next day, the patient became feverish and developed hypoxaemia. Bilateral consolidations of the base of the lungs were observed by chest X-ray. Blood tests showed elevated inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein. The patient was diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and antibiotic treatment by intravenous drip of tazobactam/piperacillin 13.5 g/day was initiated.

Pathological findings showing the epithelial and spindle cell components were decisive in diagnosis. The spindle cell component was greater than 10%, and from this result we diagnosed the tumour as pleomorphic carcinoma, a subtype of sarcomatoid carcinoma.\n\n【29】Treatment\n---------\n\n【30】We continued antibiotic treatment for VAP and performed a tracheostomy 10 days after re-intubation. The tumour was located near the second tracheal cartilage and we made a tracheotomy at the third tracheal cartilage to avoid the tumour. We considered bronchoscopic resection for remaining tracheal tumour, but decided not to do it because the tumour was prone to bleeding and the stem was too large and we understand that bronchoscopic resection of tracheal tumour is at high risk and is generally performed only in the operating room under general anaesthesia for patients in good general condition. Although we considered the option of complete resection of the tumour, we chose RT through the tumour board meeting because surgery after CRT for laryngeal cancer would have entailed an increased risk of complications including necrosis and rupture of previously irradiated structures. RT (IMRT, 删除9：<u>60 </u>Gy/30Fr) was performed and avoided damage of normal tissues around the tumour as much as possible.\n\n【31】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【32】Two months have passed since he received RT and the patient is alive. However, we cannot yet evaluate the outcome of treatment because there was no evaluable lesion. In the future, we will evaluate the outcome based on recurrence and metastasis of the tumour, and survival.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】Tracheal tumours cause varying degrees of dyspnoea depending on tumour size, and are often misdiagnosed as bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 删除9：<u>6 </u>In this case, because the patient received CRT for laryngeal cancer 2 years before this episode, we suspected a metastatic tumour originating from laryngeal cancer. However, the pathological type of the tracheal tumour was different from that of the previous laryngeal cancer. The tracheal tumour was diagnosed as pleomorphic carcinoma, a subtype of sarcomatoid carcinoma. Furthermore, tracheal metastasis of laryngeal cancer is extremely rare, and metastatic tracheal tumours generally originate from breast cancer, colorectal cancer or renal cancer. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Histopathological findings in this case demonstrated the transitional component (the epithelial and mesenchymal component), and we concluded that EMT had developed in this tumour. EMT has been studied extensively relating to mechanisms of cancer metastasis and recurrence. 删除9：<u>8 9 </u>At the transcriptional level, E-cadherin is repressed by a number of E-cadherin transcriptional repressors (EcTRs), including Zeb-1, Zeb-2, Snail/Slug, E12/E47 and Twist. Expression of these EcTRs in tumour epithelial cells is inversely correlated with E-cadherin expression and associated with increased invasiveness/metastasis and poorer clinical prognosis. 删除9：<u>10 </u>The expression of EcTRs results in repression of the epithelial phenotype and promotion of EMT. 删除9：<u>11 </u>EcTRs are present in mesenchyme and repress transcription of E-cadherin and induce to mesenchymal feature. One report studied the relationship between sarcomatoid carcinoma and EMT, and this case showed one of the typical patterns of EMT. 删除9：<u>12 </u>However, no study has found a relationship between tracheal sarcomatoid carcinoma and EMT. It has been reported that sarcomas were seen in just 3.8% of tracheal tumours. 删除9：<u>13 </u>Only three cases of tracheal sarcomatoid carcinoma have been reported. 删除9：<u>2–4 </u>The higher value of Ki-67, the more the cell proliferation and tumour invasion ability. In this case, 22.4% of Ki-67 expression in epithelial component and 24.0% in spindle cell component were low compared with median 62% (range, 20% to 87%) expression in pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma of 17 patients reported in Japan. 删除9：<u>14 </u>Pleomorphic carcinoma is a subtype of sarcomatoid carcinoma, and is defined as an epithelial tumour including more than 10% spindle and/or giant cells. 删除9：<u>15 </u>This case was compatible with the characteristics of pleomorphic carcinoma. Several reports identify complete resection as the first choice for treatment of primary tracheal tumours. 删除9：<u>16 </u>However, as the patient had undergone CRT for laryngeal cancer, we considered surgical resection to have a higher risk of complications including necrosis of the trachea and ruptured suture. We thus selected RT for this patient. However, the effect of RT can be considered to be limited. The Netherlands Cancer Registry reports median survival of 91 months in cases of resection without RT, 删除13：<u>82 </u>months in cases of resection with RT, 删除13：<u>11 </u>months for patients who underwent only RT and 3 months for patients who did not receive either therapy. 删除9：<u>17 </u>We should note that this result included cases of palliative RT, but it is clear that RT is inferior to resection.

It is more common in premature infants but can also be seen in adults with necrotising enterocolitis (ECNA) or non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia. ECNA is a cause of PVG with very few cases described in literature and with high mortality. It is a multifactorial condition and the eliciting factors include infection, ischaemia and protracted ileus. 删除9：<u>1 </u>The radiographical findings are impressive since it is very difficult to suspect it straightforward and diagnosis comes when the presentation is fulminant. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【4】Our case is a 67-year-old male retired painter diagnosed with pT2N0M0 bladder urothelial carcinoma, with a medical history of type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate. Discussion in joint Multidisciplinary Team recommended radical cystectomy with no neoadjuvant chemotherapy. According to the surgeon’s preferences, preoperative bowel preparation, opioid analgesia and prolonged fasting were avoided. Nevertheless, we did not strictly adhere to Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol. The patient underwent open radical cystectomy with cutaneous ureterostomy as planned, received antibiotics on induction, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, meticulous fluid management and no epidural anaesthesia was administered. No intraoperative complications were encountered, with minimal blood loss and no concerns of mesentery/bowel injury. Postoperative intensive care unit admission was not deemed necessary by the operating team. Early nutrition and opioid analgesia were avoided with introduction of parenteral nutrition for the first 72 hours. Minimal surgical drainage was reported. Twelve-hour post procedural clinical review revealed abdominal distention while the patient complained of nausea, suggestive of possible postoperative bowel obstruction, and a nasogastric tube was inserted. Although his symptoms seemed controlled, they persisted until 72 hours postoperative when he became tachypnoic and mildly acidotic (pH 7.3, lactate 2.3 mmol/L). His biochemistry results showed white cell count of 14.200 ×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 46 mg/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 38 mL/min and creatine of 2.2 mg/dL with a baseline of 87 and 1.15, respectively.\n\n【5】Urgent high dependency unit transfer and non-contrast CT scan were arranged. Imaging demonstrated not only a massively air-filled colon but also air in the colonic wall (pneumatosis coli) and PVG extending peripherally to the hepatic branches . On exploratory laparotomy, the ascending colon and approximately 120 cm of terminal ileum appeared necrotic and were removed. Although the typical ‘skip lesions’ of intestinal ischaemia were missing and the mesenteric vessels were patent, the condition was consistent with necrotising enterocolitis. During dissection, the respective mesentery appeared thickened with tense adhesions, but tissue sampling was avoided to minimise iatrogenic damage. Acute sclerosing mesenteritis was suspected as possible cause, nonetheless no histological evidence exists. Pathology report confirmed full thickness intestinal ischaemia scattered through the specimen. The initial operation was straightforward and to our knowledge, no surgical mishap took place which may have caused the above complication. The only compounding factor recognised was the prolonged paralytic ileus which is a common occurrence after major abdominal surgery. Hirobe _et al_ showed that paralytic ileus was one of the most common complications that occurred in 22.2% of the patients post radical cystectomy. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Case demonstrating PVG in X-ray was successfully managed conservatively. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Nevertheless, ultrasonography and CT scan are considered more sensitive in detection of PVG than conventional radiography. 删除9：<u>5</u>\n\n【6】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【7】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【8】Abdominal X-ray showing distended bowel loops  and bilateral single-J ureteric stents appropriately sited through cutaneous ureterostomy.</u>\n\n【9】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【10】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【11】Axial plane of non-contrast CT scan.

In the absence of effective specific treatment, vaccination has become the most effective preventive strategy, and this group of patients was the first to receive a booster dose of the vaccine against COVID-19. However, there is clear evidence that immunosuppressed patients such as kidney transplant recipients have a reduced immune response. Various studies show that kidney transplant recipients, compared with the non-immunocompromised population or compared with dialysis patients, show a lower response rate to two doses of the vaccine. 删除9：<u>3–5</u>\n\n【8】To assess the adaptive immune system after COVID-19 vaccination, the humoral response by antibody detection is being used globally. 删除9：<u>6 7 </u>However, in many cases, this response is truncated or inhibited in patients with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatments. In these cases, the cellular response would give a complete view of the immune response. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Ex vivo cellular response measurement mechanisms are laborious due to the time and cost involved. As an alternative, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) tests have been seen as a useful additional test to observe the presence or absence of response. 删除9：<u>9 10</u>\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A woman in her 50s with end-stage kidney disease after a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis underwent a deceased donor kidney transplant, 删除13：<u>20 </u>years ago. On debut, it presented as advanced chronic renal failure, with the need for dialysis from the beginning and significant chronicity data in the biopsy, for which she only received a cycle of oral corticosteroids with prednisone 1 mg/kg for 4 weeks and a subsequent reduction until it was withdrawn. She had been on haemodialysis for 8 months before transplantation. She received an induction therapy with lymphocyte-depleting antibodies and was maintained on prednisone, ciclosporin and azathioprine. Her immediate postoperative course was uneventful with a serum creatinine of 1 mg/dL upon discharge. Two months after transplant, she presented with cytomegalovirus disease that was treated with intravenous ganciclovir. Six year later, an acute cellular rejection was observed that required treatment with methylprednisolone boluses (total dose of 1500 mg). A second episode of acute cellular rejection was diagnosed 18 months later, which was again treated with methylprednisolone (total dose of 1500 mg). Therefore, maintenance immunosuppression was changed to prednisone (5 mg/day), mycophenolate (1 g/day) and tacrolimus (to maintain levels of 8–10 ng/mL for the first 6 months and 6 ng/mL later). Her serum creatinine returned to its baseline of 1.3 mg/dL.\n\n【11】At 20 years post-transplantation, a kidney biopsy was performed due to elevated serum creatinine up to 1.7 mg/dL, with no evident explanation. The biopsy showed mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy with less than 25% (grade 1 in score). There was no evidence of rejection or disease recurrence. Maintenance immunosuppressants were continued. Subsequently, as remarkable events, the patient presented with recurrent urinary tract infections, a community-acquired pneumonia 22 years after transplantation and a deep vein thrombosis of the lower left limb in the setting of a thrombophilia that required the start of oral anticoagulation 1 year later. Five years earlier, she was diagnosed with a low-grade intraepithelial lesion in the cervix associated with human papillomavirus infection.\n\n【12】The patient continued her regular follow-up without other major events, with stable kidney function and no proteinuria. According to local health policies, she was vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 with the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine by intramuscular injection. The second and third doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were administered 3 weeks and 7 months after the first dose .\n\n【13】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【15】Levels of specific humoral immune response to RBD throughout last year and after infection (levels of specific IgA and IgG in OD ratio; positive >0.8); levels of specific cellular immunity IGRA to RBD (levels in mIU/mL; positive >5)</u>\n\n【16】Three months after the third dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, she presented with mild respiratory symptoms and tested positive with SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was no fever, fatigue, oxygen requirements, myalgia, diarrhoea, loss of taste or loss of smell. These mild respiratory symptoms persisted for less than 48 hours. Since the patient presented with a mild case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, she did not require hospital admission and she was not treated with dexamethasone, monoclonal antibodies or any other medications, nor was any reduction in immunosuppressants necessary.

Last picture was taken 4 weeks after the end of SARS-CoV-2 infection (D, day 360).</u>\n\n【25】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【26】Six months after COVID-19 infection, the patient remains asymptomatic, with stable renal function and receiving maintenance immunosuppression.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】The lower efficacy of the vaccine in kidney transplant recipients is observed in both humoral and cellular responses. 删除9：<u>12 13 </u>Various risk factors have been related to a lower immune response, including older age, the first year of transplant compared with subsequent ones, the use of triple therapy versus double therapy, 删除13：<u>13 </u>and the use of mycophenolate versus mTOR inhibitors, 删除13：<u>14 </u>and the BNT162b2 vaccine instead of the MRNA-1273. 删除9：<u>13 </u>In the case of our patient, the factors that could influence the poor response to vaccination included the use of immunosuppression for more than 20 years with triple therapy including mycophenolate. In favour of the role of immunosuppression in our patient is the fact that throughout her follow-up, she presented with other complications of infectious aetiology.\n\n【29】However, while the evidence indicates that kidney transplant recipients have a reduced response to vaccination, there is a clear improvement in clinical outcomes in terms of reducing complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2, with a lower rate of admission and of mortality compared with the waves prior to vaccination, and even to the waves immediately after the first doses of vaccination.\n\n【30】In our patient, despite three doses of vaccine, no immunity was detected by in vitro methods. However by using DTH, an in vivo method, it was possible to detect a vigorous cellular immune response (CIR) in this patient. Despite being a patient with a high immunosuppressive burden, with infectious complications prior to the SARS-CoV-2, the patient experienced a mild COVID-19 infection. It is possible that this good outcome was possible partly because in vitro methods are not fully representative of immunity in this patient, whereas an in vivo method, like DTH, could reflect better the immune scenario.\n\n【31】Knowledge on the vaccine-induced CIR and humoral immune response (HIR) and on immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines in solid organ transplant recipients is limited. Immunocompromised individuals such as patients after solid organ transplantation are at higher risk of suffering from more severe courses of disease. 删除9：<u>15 </u>Moreover, little is known about the correlation of protection from severe disease and the results of HIR or CIR measurements. This group of immunocompromised patients had been vaccinated using a boosted protocol trying to obtain the maximum titres of neutralising antibodies because HIR to measure antibodies is the more extended method to measure immunogenicity elicited by the COVID-19 vaccines. However, it is well-known that humoral immunity towards other vaccines such as influenza or hepatitis B is decreased in solid organ transplant recipients. 删除9：<u>16–18 </u>Several groups have reported that in transplant recipients immunised with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were only induced in 6%–17% after the first dose, 删除13：<u>19–21 </u>and up to 59% after the second dose, 删除13：<u>4 19 22 23 </u>respectively. For these reasons, it is of main importance to have an easy and informative method to measure CIR in immunocompromised patients that can be used to understand the correlation with the protection from severe disease and to optimise vaccine schedules in this group of patients. Our group has validated the CoviDCELL-DTH test both in immunocompetent individuals and in patients with primary immunodeficiency 24 and in patients with immunosuppression. 删除9：<u>25 </u>This DTH test of measuring the immune response could help us predict the real-life response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in correctly vaccinated transplant recipients. Likewise, we must emphasise that as the pandemic has progressed, seroprevalence surveys estimate that more than one-third, and possibly more than half of the world population, has already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the beginning of 2022. This fact, together with the increasing vaccination coverage in all countries, should remind us of the sometimes forgotten concept of hybrid immunity, both in immunocompromised patients and in healthy individuals.\n\n【32】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【33】The results of the rest of the antibody tests and in vitro cell tests over the months made me uncertain about the possible response I would have to the infection. However, the DTH test produced a certain calm and tranquility, and even happiness, every time it was positive. This gave me confidence in the Immunology team that was doing the follow-up.\n\n【34】### Learning points\n\n【35】*   The study of the cellular immune response complements and sheds light on the adaptive immune response after vaccination against COVID-19.\n\n【36】*   The delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) test to measure immune response could be an early parameter of the immune response after COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n【37】*   The DTH test is less expensive than ex vivo cellular response measurement techniques that are more laborious, time-consuming and expensive.\n\n【38】*   There is some evidence that the hybrid immunity acquired by vaccination, and then by natural infection, might be a more potent defence system in both healthy and immunocompromised patients.\n\n【39】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【40】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【41】Obtained.\n\n【42】### Ethics approval\n\n【43】The protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the hospital (CHUC\\_2021\\_04) and was conducted in accordance with the requirements expressed in law.\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank the immunologist Andres Franco and immunology laboratory technicians of HUC (Tamara M J Placer, Gloria Camacho, María Romera, Montserrat Padilla).</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "删除13：20 ", "content": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】We present a female kidney transplant patient under conventional immunosuppression therapy.

On debut, it presented as advanced chronic renal failure, with the need for dialysis from the beginning and significant chronicity data in the biopsy, for which she only received a cycle of oral corticosteroids with prednisone 1 mg/kg for 4 weeks and a subsequent reduction until it was withdrawn. She had been on haemodialysis for 8 months before transplantation. She received an induction therapy with lymphocyte-depleting antibodies and was maintained on prednisone, ciclosporin and azathioprine. Her immediate postoperative course was uneventful with a serum creatinine of 1 mg/dL upon discharge. Two months after transplant, she presented with cytomegalovirus disease that was treated with intravenous ganciclovir. Six year later, an acute cellular rejection was observed that required treatment with methylprednisolone boluses (total dose of 1500 mg). A second episode of acute cellular rejection was diagnosed 18 months later, which was again treated with methylprednisolone (total dose of 1500 mg). Therefore, maintenance immunosuppression was changed to prednisone (5 mg/day), mycophenolate (1 g/day) and tacrolimus (to maintain levels of 8–10 ng/mL for the first 6 months and 6 ng/mL later). Her serum creatinine returned to its baseline of 1.3 mg/dL.\n\n【11】At 20 years post-transplantation, a kidney biopsy was performed due to elevated serum creatinine up to 1.7 mg/dL, with no evident explanation. The biopsy showed mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy with less than 25% (grade 1 in score). There was no evidence of rejection or disease recurrence. Maintenance immunosuppressants were continued. Subsequently, as remarkable events, the patient presented with recurrent urinary tract infections, a community-acquired pneumonia 22 years after transplantation and a deep vein thrombosis of the lower left limb in the setting of a thrombophilia that required the start of oral anticoagulation 1 year later. Five years earlier, she was diagnosed with a low-grade intraepithelial lesion in the cervix associated with human papillomavirus infection.\n\n【12】The patient continued her regular follow-up without other major events, with stable kidney function and no proteinuria. According to local health policies, she was vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 with the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine by intramuscular injection.

In favour of the role of immunosuppression in our patient is the fact that throughout her follow-up, she presented with other complications of infectious aetiology.\n\n【29】However, while the evidence indicates that kidney transplant recipients have a reduced response to vaccination, there is a clear improvement in clinical outcomes in terms of reducing complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2, with a lower rate of admission and of mortality compared with the waves prior to vaccination, and even to the waves immediately after the first doses of vaccination.\n\n【30】In our patient, despite three doses of vaccine, no immunity was detected by in vitro methods. However by using DTH, an in vivo method, it was possible to detect a vigorous cellular immune response (CIR) in this patient. Despite being a patient with a high immunosuppressive burden, with infectious complications prior to the SARS-CoV-2, the patient experienced a mild COVID-19 infection.

A large population-based study in the UK reported an incidence rate of 0.6 (CI 0.2, 1.3) in this age group. 删除9：<u>1 </u>There are only a few case reports of pregnancies in people living with MND (the majority of these cases were MND presenting for the first time during pregnancy). To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a successful pregnancy managed without any complication in a patient living with MND. We highlight the challenges faced throughout the pregnancy and how these were addressed using a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach. This case report demonstrates the possibility of successful pregnancy in people living with MND and illustrates an approach which may help fellow clinicians support patients in their decision making. Finally, the case also illustrates other important complications of MND and interventions to manage them and that treatment is not always futile. Life events, therefore, need not to be denied to neuromuscular patients.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】### Initial presentation and investigations\n\n【10】A fitness instructor woman in her 20s presented to the ventilation team with a weak cough and difficulty to expectorate thick and sticky phlegm. She was diagnosed with MND 3 months earlier following a review by the neurology team with left arm weakness, gradual left leg weakness and disarticulate speech. She also complained of food ‘going down the wrong way’ and choking spells when drinking liquids. This was followed by gradual exertional dyspnoea, cramps in hands, legs and feet as well as fasciculations. Her medical history was unremarkable and she was not on regular medications. There was no family history of MND.\n\n【11】Examination revealed 1 beat of clonus at both ankles, up-going plantar responses and symmetrical ankle jerks. Neurophysiological studies showed normal nerve conduction studies but widespread evidence of chronic neurogenic changes on needle electromyography. There was active denervation both distally and proximally in her left upper limb and distally in both lower limbs . Her baseline investigations included normal CT of head, chest, abdomen and pelvis as well MRI of head and whole spine. She was commenced on riluzole with regular monitoring of biochemistry including liver function tests.\n\n【12】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【14】Neurophysiological studies</u>\n\n【15】She was reviewed by the speech and language therapist (SALT) in regards to her swallow and was advised to add thickener to her fluids.\n\n【16】### Sleep and ventilation team review\n\n【17】She was referred to the regional sleep and ventilation unit to assess her respiratory muscle function and to exclude sleep disordered breathing. She was managing to sleep well at night and felt refreshed in the mornings. She denied having any morning headaches and was able to lie flat without difficulty. Her investigations (as highlighted in her respiratory muscle testing in tables 2 and 3 ) revealed restrictive spirometry, borderline sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) and cough peak flow with normal capillary blood gases. In this initial assessment, she was provided with information regarding the long-term feeding plan, including percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion. She was referred for initiation of cough assist and an overnight pulse oximetry was arranged; this was found to be normal with no evidence of nocturnal desaturations.\n\n【18】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【19】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 2\n\n【20】Serial pulmonary function tests before and during pregnancy</u>\n\n【21】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【22】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 3\n\n【23】Serial pulmonary function tests after pregnancy</u>\n\n【24】She remained under regular review by the neurology, respiratory and SALT teams for worsening mobility, bulbar function and swallowing. She did not have sleep-related symptoms, although there has been gradual decline in her respiratory muscle testing. She mobilised short distances. She was admitted electively for PEG insertion 1 year following her diagnosis. This was complicated by post procedure pancreatic inflammation, treated by the surgical team with diagnostic laparoscopy, exploratory laparotomy and irrigation of peritoneal cavity. She recovered well from this episode and remained stable for the following 18 months.\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】### Pregnancy and MDT approach to management\n\n【27】Three years following her diagnosis of MND (May 2018), she confirmed a positive pregnancy test to the sleep and ventilation team. This was not a planned pregnancy; however, she wished to continue the pregnancy to term and optimise the chances of a successful outcome. She denied any symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing, was finding her sleep refreshing with no waking headache or any daytime somnolence. Respiratory muscle testing at this stage showed worsening restrictive defect in her spirometry with static SNIP and stable blood gases (investigation 2). Scarcity of evidence in the literature in regards to the safety of pregnancy in MND made it difficult to predict the course of the pregnancy. Nonetheless, the challenges ahead were extensively discussed during consultations and a personalised plan was drawn, including MDT approach to her further management 删除10：<u>( table 4 )</u>. She was monitored closely with a monthly follow-up and regular respiratory muscle testing.\n\n【28】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【29】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 4\n\n【30】Multidisciplinary team approach</u>\n\n【31】There was an appreciable decline in her motor function (especially upper limbs) and was using a wheelchair on regular basis. Her respiratory function, however, improved during pregnancy and remained stable throughout the pregnancy. Following parturition, both her spirometry and SNIP declined again to a new baseline. She was reviewed in the high-risk antenatal anaesthetic clinic given her known progressive MND, risk of diaphragmatic splinting and respiratory compromise with the advancing pregnancy.\n\n【32】Perioperative care plan was then planned following an MDT meeting between the obstetric, anaesthetic and the respiratory consultants. Her detailed plan included:\n\n【33】*   An elective caesarean section at 34 weeks: on balance, it was felt to be the safest time for both mother and baby and carried less risk of decompensation and need for invasive ventilation.\n\n【34】*   Discussion with the intensive care unit and plan for invasive ventilation in the event of respiratory compromise.\n\n【35】*   Management in the maternal high dependency unit (maternal HDU) in the first 24 hours post delivery, with support from ventilation nurse specialists, in case of non-invasive ventilation requirement post partum.\n\n【36】*   Patient and partner were given a guided tour of the maternity unit to inform their expectation and to reduce anxiety.\n\n【37】At this stage, she was rarely mobilising except for limited occasions with support from her partner. She was able to transfer from bed to chair unaided.\n\n【38】### Parturition and postpartum care\n\n【39】She was admitted in October 2018 for an elective caesarean section (C-section) at 34 weeks and 4 days gestation. An arterial line was inserted for blood gases monitoring and a spinal anaesthetic was used, achieving a block to T4. Although non-invasive ventilation was on standby, she did not require any assistance with ventilation and was stable from respiratory point of view throughout the procedure. Initially, her head was elevated to a 15-degree angle, raising to 30 degrees soon after C-section to ensure the local anaesthetic did not distribute caudally. Phenylephrine infusion was used throughout the delivery to prevent hypotension. The C-section was completed without complication. Following delivery she was monitored in the recovery unit and later transferred to the maternity HDU as planned. A healthy baby boy, weighing 2.76 kg was delivered and assessed by the paediatric team; his APGAR score (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration) was 9 at 1 min and 10 at 5 min. No abnormality was detected during examination. The baby was admitted to the transitional care unit for nasogastric feeding and remained stable throughout.\n\n【40】Her stay in maternity HDU was uneventful, and she was stepped down to the ward the following day. She received regular chest physiotherapy given her relatively weak cough. She struggled with mucus clearance 48 hours post partum; this was managed with regular chest physiotherapy, mucolytics (carbocisteine) and saline nebulisers. She did not tolerate a trial of manual insufflation exsufflation and her chest stabilised the following day. She was deemed medically optimised for discharge 5 days post partum but remained in hospital for further 2 days until baby was weaned from nasogastric feeding.\n\n【41】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【42】At the time of writing of this article, mother and baby (2 years and 8 months) remain well. The baby is meeting all his developmental milestones. The patient is under regular review for her MND by the various MDTs and has interval respiratory muscle function tests. She remains stable from respiratory point of view and is not on a ventilator (NIV). She enjoys regular family trips and leads as active a lifestyle as possible with support from her very supportive partner.\n\n【43】Discussion\n----------\n\n【44】Pregnancy in women with MND is rare and presents a theoretical risk to both the mother and child. Previous reports have described women developing signs of the disease during pregnancy or early post partum. Our case is unique in that we describe a female patient with known MND conceiving and delivering a healthy baby 3 years after her diagnosis. Challenges for clinicians arose due to limited data in the literature regarding the effects of MND on the pregnancy, parturition and the newborn in addition to the effects of pregnancy on the course of disease. We are aware of only one previous case report of a planned pregnancy in known amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 删除9：<u>2 </u>A case of a young woman with sporadic ALS who gave birth twice during the course of her disease. The first pregnancy occurred 1 month after diagnosis (conceived before diagnosis was made). This resulted in an uncomplicated delivery. Second pregnancy occurred 2 years after diagnosis, when she was confined to bed due to the severity of her MND. This pregnancy was complicated by progression of dysphagia and cachexia and at 21-week gestation; PEG tube was performed. Emergency C-section was needed at 34-week gestation. The baby girl suffered from intrapartal asphyxia; APGAR score was 7 and increased to 8 after 5 min. She required admission to neonatal ward for oxygen therapy. Two months after delivery, mother was tracheostomised and put on long-term invasive mechanical ventilation. She died 11 months after the second childbirth due to severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage. This case represents very rapid progression of symptoms during and after pregnancy, and the postpartum period was complicated for both mother and child. In contrast, our case’s symptoms stabilised during the gravid period; the parturition was relatively uneventful, and the postpartum period was without any complications for both mother and child.\n\n【45】Our case demonstrated appreciable improvement in the spirometry and SNIP values during pregnancy. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) continued to show sustained improvement until parturition. Following childbirth, the FEV <sub>1 </sub> , FVC and SNIP declined to a new baseline which was sustained for few months post partum. Chemical/hormonal changes and the mechanical effects of the progressive uterine distension lead to changes in respiratory physiology during pregnancy. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Progesterone gradually increases during pregnancy from 25 ng/mL at 6 weeks gestation to a peak of 150 ng/mL at 37 weeks, and it is known to increase the sensitivity of the respiratory centre to carbon dioxide. Similarly, the oestrogen level increases during pregnancy and is responsible for higher number of progesterone receptors within the hypothalamus and medulla. 删除9：<u>3 </u>The progressive uterine distension leads to elevation of the diaphragm which can affect lung volume and chest wall/thoracic configuration. 删除9：<u>4 </u>In most cases, the FVC, FEV <sub>1 </sub> and peak expiratory flow remain unchanged or modestly increase during pregnancy. This could explain the respiratory function test observed in our case.\n\n【46】These cases should remind clinicians looking after younger patients with MND of the importance of early family planning discussion. The patients should be informed of the limited evidence on pregnancy influencing disease progression. In the early stages of MND, there is no evidence in the limited literature of adverse events to mother and baby; however, in the latter stages when respiratory and dietary issues become evident, outcomes to both mother and baby can be catastrophic.\n\n【47】The most important aspect of care for a woman with respiratory muscle weakness secondary to neurological disorder is to carry out an early risk stratification and then to clearly discuss the risks and benefits of each treatment. This will allow the clinician to decide on appropriate and timely investigations (such as respiratory muscle function tests and blood gases) and liaise closely with other colleagues involved in patient’s care. Any investigation and/or treatment needs to be individualised and tailored to the needs of the patient depending on the type of neurological condition and the degree of severity. As our case illustrates, it is also important to optimise the patient’s nutritional demands, general physical health and to coordinate care between all the MDT caring for the patient. Regular monitoring throughout pregnancy, the timing of elective admission for C-section and carefully agreed postpartum care played a significant role in the success of pregnancy and stable postpartum period in our case.\n\n【48】### Learning points\n\n【49】*   Respiratory muscle assessment for people living with motor neuron disease (MND) and the importance of regular monitoring during pregnancy.\n\n【50】*   A multidisciplinary team of physicians and healthcare professionals is essential in positive outcomes for mother and baby in MND pregnancies.\n\n【51】*   MND does not have harmful consequences on fetal development, but respiratory function of the mother should be carefully monitored.\n\n【52】*   In younger patients with new diagnosis of MND, family planning should be discussed early.\n\n【53】*   Careful planning of interventions increases the chances of successful outcome.\n\n【54】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【55】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【56】Consent obtained from next of kin.\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I would like to acknowledge all the healthcare professionals who played a vital role in this successful pregnancy, namely: 1.

Currently, various COVID-19 vaccines are being administered worldwide, which show preventive effects for COVID-19 infection.

Thirty cases of new-onset MCD after COVID-19 vaccination have been reported worldwide, including 16 cases related to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 删除13：<u>5 </u>cases related to the Moderna vaccine, 删除13：<u>5 </u>cases related to the AstraZeneca vaccine, 删除13：<u>2 </u>cases related to the Sinovac vaccine and 2 cases related to the Janssen vaccine. 删除9：<u>5–30 </u>Only two full case reports of new-onset MCD following the Moderna messenger RNA (mRNA)-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been reported. 删除9：<u>12 29 </u>In addition, both reports describe short-term treatment courses.\n\n【9】In this case report, we present a case of new-onset MCD following the first injection of the Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We successfully maintained remission with steroid monotherapy and completely terminated steroids after 1.5 years. We report our findings with pathology and literature review.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】The patient was a man in his 30s with a history of atopic dermatitis and obesity with a body mass index of 31 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . The day after the patient received the first dose of the Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, he experienced low-grade fever and swelling at the site of the injection. The fever and local swelling improved after 1 day, but leg oedema appeared 2 days after vaccination. Over the course of 2 weeks, generalised oedema, palpitations and shortness of breath gradually worsened. He visited a local doctor and was prescribed a diuretic, but the symptoms did not improve. Therefore, 删除13：<u>15 </u>days after the vaccination, the patient was referred to our department and was admitted that day.\n\n【12】On admission, his blood pressure was 142/93 mm Hg and heart rate was 81 beats per minute. His body weight had increased from 90 kg to 101 kg with systemic oedema. Blood tests revealed serum creatinine 0.85 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 17.2 mg/dL, serum albumin 1.5 g/dL, Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 363 mg/dL. In addition, a high degree of proteinuria with urinary protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 13.9 g/g Cr was observed, meeting the diagnostic criteria for nephrotic syndrome. A 24-hour urinary collection revealed proteinuria of 18 346 mg/day, and the selectivity index of urinary protein was 0.094. Antibody screening tests such as antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and antiglomerular basement membrane were all negative. Total haemolytic complement (CH 50) and the serum complement levels of C3 and C4 were within normal range. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E level was markedly elevated at 2620 IU/mL. A PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. However, the SARS-CoV-2 anti-S antibody titre was 452 U/mL using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S RUO (Roche Diagnostics K.K.) and 2650.3 AU/mL using the ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott Japan), which was markedly elevated. CT examination showed normal kidney size and ascites effusion.\n\n【13】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【14】Renal biopsy was performed the day after admission. The histological findings are shown in figure 1 . Twenty-three glomeruli were detected, one exhibited global sclerosis and the others were normal. Immunofluorescence staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, C1q and fibrinogen were all negative. Electron microscopy showed normal thickness of the glomerular basement membrane and diffuse foot process effacement. These pathological findings were compatible with MCD.\n\n【15】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【16】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【17】Renal biopsy findings.

After the remission, time was required to manage the side effects of high-dose steroids (eg, blood glucose control and osteoporosis prevention), and the patient was discharged on day 34 of hospitalisation when the dose was reduced to moderate-dose steroids. Two months after discharge, serum creatinine was 0.62 mg/dL, serum albumin 4.6 g/dL and UPCR was 0.14 g/g Cr. The patient remained in complete remission for more than 1 year and PSL was completely tapered off approximately 1.5 years after the onset. However, 删除13：<u>1 </u>month after completion of PSL treatment, a relapse of nephrotic syndrome was observed, so PSL 20 mg was restarted, and remission induction was achieved quickly. The second vaccination was not administered based on consultation with the patient. We suggested that if the patient wanted to be vaccinated in the future, another type of COVID-19 vaccine, such as inactivated vaccine, could be administered, but the patient did not wish to be vaccinated.\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】This case highlights the risk of new-onset MCD after mRNA vaccine administration. Several case reports in regard to the association of MCD with the Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been published previously. Full case reports of new-onset MCD cases after Moderna mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are few and no reports mention long-term outcomes. In MCD, a state of hyperpermeability of glomerular capillaries occurs, resulting in highly selective proteinuria. Although the exact pathogenesis has not yet been elucidated, injury of podocytes by circulating factors released by T cells is thought to be the main mechanism. 删除9：<u>31 32 </u>This case highlights the rare but potential risk of MCD after mRNA vaccine administration. There are several case reports of new-onset MCD after mRNA vaccination, and the chronological causality is convincing. 删除9：<u>5–30 </u>Although the mechanism is unclear, this case raises the question of whether the mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may lead to rapid development of MCD within a few days following vaccination.\n\n【27】The inevitable question is whether the timing of COVID-19 vaccination and the onset of nephrotic syndrome were too close together. The timing of MCD onset or relapse was reported at a median of 7 days following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 删除9：<u>33 </u>On the other hand, four cases of new-onset MCD within 1–2 days following COVID-19 vaccination have been reported. 删除9：<u>9 14 15 27 </u>Therefore, the COVID-19 vaccine is estimated to have the potential to trigger an immune response that leads to the development of MCD within 2 days. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 anti-S antibody titre was markedly elevated in this case, suggesting hypersensitivity to the mRNA vaccine. The antibody titre, measured using the Roche test after the first vaccination, was reported to be about 100 U/mL in a population without previous infection; the titre was 452 U/mL in this case, more than four times higher. 删除9：<u>34 </u>In comparison, the antibody titre in a previously infected population was reported to be about 10 000 U/mL. 删除9：<u>34 </u>In this case, SARS-CoV-2 anti-S antibody titre is in an intermediate range and previous subclinical infection with SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out completely. This finding may explain the brief time between vaccination and onset of MCD.\n\n【28】In combination with COVID-19 vaccination, atopic disease may have predisposed this patient to developing MCD. Pre-existing atopic dermatitis has been associated with the development of MCD through IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, which could imply that those with atopic dermatitis become more susceptible to potential allergic stimulation such as mRNA vaccination, leading to MCD, than those without atopic dermatitis. Additionally, MCD is frequently observed in patients with bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis, and the relationship between IgE-mediated type I allergy and MCD has been highlighted. 删除9：<u>35–37 </u>In this case, the background disease was atopic dermatitis, and the blood test at the time of admission showed high IgE levels, indicating that the patient was predisposed to hypersensitivity and developing MCD following vaccination. Similarly, Salem _et al_ reported a case of new-onset MCD following the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a 4os woman with asthma. 删除9：<u>11 </u>In this case report, as in the present case, a short period of 5 days was observed between mRNA vaccination and the onset of MCD. Accumulation of cases in the future may suggest an association between atopic disease and MCD after mRNA vaccination.\n\n【29】Steroid sensitivity of new-onset MCD after mRNA vaccination is often good, and there are no case reports of spontaneous remission. Most previously reported cases without underlying disease describe remission induced with steroids alone. 删除9：<u>5–30 </u>In this case, complete remission was quickly achieved with PSL 60 mg/day (1 mg/kg), and the steroid response was particularly good. However, a relapse of the nephrotic syndrome was observed soon after the steroid treatment was terminated, so careful follow-up is necessary. Based on case reports to date, early detection of nephrotic syndrome after COVID-19 vaccination and therapeutic intervention are important factors. Nephrologists and allergy specialists involved in vaccination need to be well informed of the possibility of side effects and ensure that patients receive adequate follow-up after vaccination. COVID-19 vaccine is an effective vaccine that can significantly reduce infection. This case report is not to deny vaccination, but to show the necessity of proceeding with vaccination after being aware of the possible side effects. The limitation in this case is the coincidental temporal association. In other words, we cannot deny the possibility that the vaccination and the onset of MCD were unrelated and occurred by chance. More studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between MCD and mRNA vaccines.\n\n【30】### Learning points\n\n【31】*   Although the causal relationship is uncertain, minimal change disease following mRNA vaccination has been reported.\n\n【32】*   As a possible pathogenic mechanism, the mRNA vaccination may have affected the immune regulatory system, especially the T-cell profile, causing podocyte damage.\n\n【33】*   In addition, the patient had atopic dermatitis as a background disease, and it is thought that the predisposing factor was an atopic disease characterised by a Th2-dominant immune state.\n\n【34】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【35】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【36】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:22:13", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:22:28", "cost": 14.688}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:22:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:22:12"}

Previous studies have reported a few routinising therapies that use stereotyped behaviour associated with FTD to immerse patients in activities of interest, such as hobbies and preferences. Tanabe _et al_ 4 reported that routinising the work that the patient was interested in reduced his/her troubles with others and the long-term care burden of caregivers. Lough and Hodges 5 reported that routinising simple work was effective in improving behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). However, after these reports were published, almost no research on routinising therapy in patients with FTD has been reported in recent years. Moreover, it is unclear whether IADL, which involves complex processes, can be adapted to routinising therapy for patients with FTD.\n\n【8】We present a case study where intervention for routinising IADL was introduced in a patient with FTD, who had never performed any IADL at all while living in a group home. 删除9：<u>6 </u>It is expected that routinising therapy is effective in improving IADL in patients with FTD.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】The patient was a 69-year-old woman. She gave birth to a child at the age of 25 years and was a (full-time) homemaker until she got divorced at the age of 34. She started living alone at the age of 43 after her child entered university. After working for 20 years at a supermarket, the woman retired at the age of 54. Thereafter, she increasingly spent time alone at home during the day. After a few years, she started repeating acts such as trying to take items from convenience stores without paying (shoplifting), and making loud noises when entering or leaving her house, such as knocking or slamming the door, which led to complaints from nearby stores and neighbours. Accordingly, at the age of 57, she underwent psychiatric examination and was diagnosed with FTD. After this diagnosis, she was placed in a group home. The patient has lived in the group home ever since.\n\n【11】The subject did not have any physical function impairment that would inhibit the activities of daily life. In the group home, she used to perform minimum self-care, such as cleaning her room by herself. However, in the group home, she rarely performed the household chores that she used to undertake while living in her house. Previously, she had at times engaged in making seasonal ornaments with the care staff, but she did not continue such activities for long. When in a bad mood, she had altercations with other residents and care staff, and even locked herself in her room at times. There were instances where watching other residents participating in activities with care staff, in which she was not participating, resulted in a bad mood out of jealousy. She used to be angry if she was not the first one allowed to take a bath. The patient would spend most of her time doing nothing, sitting at the same table and in the same chair in the living room, and used to take meals at the same place every day. The burden on the care staff was high since the patient created a commotion if some other resident occupied her usual place.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】The patient was assessed before the intervention and 2 weeks after the intervention administered by the occupational therapist. The scores shown in tables 1 and 2 were recorded using the following assessment tools:\n\n【14】*   Hyogo Activities of Daily Living Scale (HADLS). 7\n\n【15】*   Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH). 8\n\n【16】*   Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD). 9\n\n【17】*   Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). 10\n\n【18】*   Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). 删除9：<u>11\n    </u>\n\n【19】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【20】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【21】Improvement of activities of daily living (HADLS) score after the intervention of the IADL</u>\n\n【22】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【23】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 2\n\n【24】Improvement of BPSD and burden (NPI-NH), QOL (QOL-AD), cognitive function (MMSE), staging of dementia (CDR) score after the intervention of the IADL</u>\n\n【25】HADLS is a comprehensive impairment scale for daily life activities in patients with dementia. NPI-NH is a facility version tool for assessing BPSD, and a version in Japanese is also available. 删除9：<u>12 </u>QOL-AD is a QOL scale specifically designed for patients with dementia, for which a version in Japanese is also available. 删除9：<u>13 </u>All these assessment scales have been confirmed to be reliable and valid.\n\n【26】The patient’s total HADLS score for activities of daily living was 46.8, with a score of 2.7 for subitem ‘clean-up after meals’, which she seldom undertook. The occupational therapist clinically judged that the clean-up after meals can be performed if done together with the care staff. The total NPI-NH score for BPSD was 14, with subitem scores of 4 for agitation, 删除13：<u>3 </u>for apathy, 删除13：<u>3 </u>for disinhibition and 4 for irritability. The level of long-term care burden due to BPSD was assessed as 7 given by the long-term care burden item in NPI-NH. The QOL scores using QOL-AD was 39. Cognitive function score assessed using MMSE was 18. The degree of severity of dementia assessed using CDR was 2 ( tables 1 and 2 ).\n\n【27】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【28】In the guidelines for the treatment of dementia 2017 supervised by the Japanese Society of Neurology, FTD is used as a clinical diagnostic name that encompasses behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia and progressive non-fluent aphasia. 删除9：<u>14 </u>The subject met the diagnostic criteria for bvFTD, that is, the clinical picture with progressive and persistent symptoms including early behavioural disinhibition, early apathy, early loss of empathy and early stereotyped behaviour that meet international consensus criteria for bvFTD by the International Behavioural Variant FTD Criteria Consortium. 删除9：<u>1 </u>However, due to the patient’s financial constraints and barriers to a definitive diagnosis, no formal cognitive screening, diagnostic imaging or pathological examination was performed to examine the diagnosis or stage of disease in detail. As a result, the subject was also diagnosed with FTD since the Japanese guidelines use FTD as a clinical diagnosis that encompasses all three types.\n\n【29】Treatment\n---------\n\n【30】Routinising therapy refers to the method in which the patient is guided to perform activities that the patient is interested in or prefers, by using the easily preserved episodic memory, procedural memory and visuospatial cognitive functions of patients with FTD. 删除9：<u>2–5 14 </u>Such activities are then incorporated into the daily routine by appropriately using the stereotyped behaviour in a positive sense. Using HADLS, the occupational therapist, together with the care staff, extracted the IADL that the patient was undertaking in daily activities at her residence but not doing currently at the group home. The occupational therapist selected the IADL of ‘clean-up after meals’ assuming that the patient would likely be able to complete the task if it was done together with care staff. Next, a positive response was obtained when the patient was asked whether she would like to try ‘clean-up after meals’. In line with the patient’s wish, it was decided that the IADL of ‘clean-up after meals’ would be the task undertaken in the routinising therapy. The occupational therapist instructed the care staff to guide the patient in performing the clean-up after meals more than once per day. Moreover, the care staff was also instructed to say words of appreciation and gratitude every time the patient completed the clean-up after meals. The intervention period was set as 2 weeks, hypothesising that even in a short time routinising the IADL would lead to an improvement in IADL capability.\n\n【31】The care staff guided the patient in performing the household chores every day for 2 weeks, and the patient was able to complete the household chores together with the care staff. On day 1 and day 2, responding to the guidance by the care staff with a smiling face and in good mood, the patient performed the clean-up after meals. On day 3, the patient on her own volition performed the activity of ‘wiping the table’ when she noticed the wiping cloth placed on the table. On day 4 and afterwards, she was able to wash the dishes even more carefully. On day 6 and afterwards, she started looking forward to clean-up after meals as soon as she had finished eating. On day 7 and afterwards, she wanted to wear an apron while performing the household chores. On day 8 and afterwards, the instances in which she conversed the care staff with a smile while performing clean-up after meals also increased.\n\n【32】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【33】After the intervention, the total HADLS score was 44.8, with a score of 0.7 for the subitem ‘clean up after meals’. The total NPI-NH score was 4, with subitem scores of 3 for agitation, 删除13：<u>1 </u>for apathy, 删除13：<u>2 </u>for disinhibition and 2 for irritability. The QOL-AD score was 44. The MMSE score was 18. The CDR score was 2 ( tables 1 and 2 ).\n\n【34】In the follow-up over 1 month after the 2-week intervention, the routine of clean-up after meals was found to be established. Moreover, the patient started to amicably converse even with the residents whom she had previously disliked. Additionally, instances of locking herself up in her room became fewer, and instances of altercations with other residents ceased almost completely.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】In this case study, we referred to the current ADL status and daily living history of the patient having more than three clinical features in formulating the routinising therapy to adapt the stereotyped behaviour to IADL. Moreover, a new finding for us was that focusing on IADL in the intervention enabled the patient to perform it in a short time, improving the IADL capability. Additionally, another point worthy of attention was that the BPSD decreased as the IADL capability improved.\n\n【37】In the Japanese guidelines, non-drug therapies such as care and behaviour therapy considering FTLD symptomatology are recommended as 2C (‘weak recommendation, weak rationale’ based on the combination of recommended grade and evidence level) category. 删除9：<u>14</u>\n\n【38】Disinhibition, stereotyped behaviour and decreased spontaneity are observed as the early-stage symptoms of FTD. However, memory impairment and visuospatial impairment are not noticeable in the early stage. 删除9：<u>4 15 </u>In this case, as the intervention continued, the patient increasingly looked forward to performing the IADL. The point worthy of attention here is that it indicates that for a patient with FTD, it is easier to preserve prospective memory for remembering what to do from now on. In summary, patients with FTD exhibit less memory (functional) impairment compared with patients with Alzheimer dementia and other types of dementia, and this can be considered important in formulating the therapy strategy for treating behaviour impairment associated with FTD. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【39】The long-term care burden of caregivers due to BPSD in patients with FTD has been reported as an issue. 删除9：<u>16–19 </u>In care facilities also, it is necessary to reduce the long-term care burden. It has been reported that introducing routinising therapy inwards has reduced the long-term care burden. 删除9：<u>4 </u>In this case, routinising therapy was administered guaranteeing patient-centred care, by obtaining consent before the IADL intervention that the patient wants to do household chores. Consequently, troubles with others and BPSD such as agitation, apathy, disinhibition and irritability were reduced, resulting in a reduction in long-term care burden. In a systematic review of clinical experiments on non-drug therapies, Shinagawa _et al_ 20 mentioned that based on a study with six patients with FTLD, Ikeda _et al_ from Japan have reported that care using memory function and visuospatial function was effective, leading to sustaining QOL. Merrilees _et al_ 21 reported that there were cases where it was possible to decrease abnormal behaviour and reduce the burden on caregivers, by using the (remaining) preserved functions and past lifestyle of the patient. In this case, also, using the patient’s stereotyped behaviour to adapt to IADL in the routinising therapy improved the QOL of the patient and reduced the long-term care burden of the care staff. These findings corroborate the observations in previous reports.\n\n【40】In this case report, since the investigation was limited to the comparison of before and after the intervention for only one case (patient), it cannot be said that the results apply to every patient with FTD. However, it is especially worth mentioning that incorporating IADL in the activities in routinising therapy improves IADL capability and QOL of the patient, which leads to reducing BPSD and long-term care burden. Incorporating such measures in care for patients with FTD can be considered effective hereafter.\n\n【41】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【42】The patient said, \"I look forward to cleaning up after meals every day. Up until now, no one expected me to clean up after meals or let me do it. I was made to spend my time just sitting in the living room. But I feel a little bit happier now.”\n\n【43】Her care staff said, \"She’s started to clean up after her meals and she’s happier and smiles more every day. And most importantly, she is less angry and verbally abusive. It has made it easier for us to care for her.”\n\n【44】### Learning points\n\n【45】*   Sustaining and improving Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) using the residual (preserved) functions such as memory function in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an important strategy in providing care.\n\n【46】*   Adapting IADL of patients with FTD living in group home to routinising therapy is an effective measure.\n\n【47】*   Using routinising therapy likely improves IADL and quality of life, and consequently, behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and associated long-term care burden also reduce.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "( tables 1 and 2 )", "content": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】We examined whether Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) improves with routinising therapy for a patient with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) living in a group home.

Moreover, it is unclear whether IADL, which involves complex processes, can be adapted to routinising therapy for patients with FTD.\n\n【8】We present a case study where intervention for routinising IADL was introduced in a patient with FTD, who had never performed any IADL at all while living in a group home. 删除9：<u>6 </u>It is expected that routinising therapy is effective in improving IADL in patients with FTD.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】The patient was a 69-year-old woman. She gave birth to a child at the age of 25 years and was a (full-time) homemaker until she got divorced at the age of 34. She started living alone at the age of 43 after her child entered university. After working for 20 years at a supermarket, the woman retired at the age of 54. Thereafter, she increasingly spent time alone at home during the day. After a few years, she started repeating acts such as trying to take items from convenience stores without paying (shoplifting), and making loud noises when entering or leaving her house, such as knocking or slamming the door, which led to complaints from nearby stores and neighbours. Accordingly, at the age of 57, she underwent psychiatric examination and was diagnosed with FTD. After this diagnosis, she was placed in a group home. The patient has lived in the group home ever since.\n\n【11】The subject did not have any physical function impairment that would inhibit the activities of daily life. In the group home, she used to perform minimum self-care, such as cleaning her room by herself. However, in the group home, she rarely performed the household chores that she used to undertake while living in her house. Previously, she had at times engaged in making seasonal ornaments with the care staff, but she did not continue such activities for long. When in a bad mood, she had altercations with other residents and care staff, and even locked herself in her room at times. There were instances where watching other residents participating in activities with care staff, in which she was not participating, resulted in a bad mood out of jealousy. She used to be angry if she was not the first one allowed to take a bath. The patient would spend most of her time doing nothing, sitting at the same table and in the same chair in the living room, and used to take meals at the same place every day. The burden on the care staff was high since the patient created a commotion if some other resident occupied her usual place.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】The patient was assessed before the intervention and 2 weeks after the intervention administered by the occupational therapist.

The degree of severity of dementia assessed using CDR was 2 ( tables 1 and 2 ).\n\n【27】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【28】In the guidelines for the treatment of dementia 2017 supervised by the Japanese Society of Neurology, FTD is used as a clinical diagnostic name that encompasses behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia and progressive non-fluent aphasia. 删除9：<u>14 </u>The subject met the diagnostic criteria for bvFTD, that is, the clinical picture with progressive and persistent symptoms including early behavioural disinhibition, early apathy, early loss of empathy and early stereotyped behaviour that meet international consensus criteria for bvFTD by the International Behavioural Variant FTD Criteria Consortium. 删除9：<u>1 </u>However, due to the patient’s financial constraints and barriers to a definitive diagnosis, no formal cognitive screening, diagnostic imaging or pathological examination was performed to examine the diagnosis or stage of disease in detail. As a result, the subject was also diagnosed with FTD since the Japanese guidelines use FTD as a clinical diagnosis that encompasses all three types.\n\n【29】Treatment\n---------\n\n【30】Routinising therapy refers to the method in which the patient is guided to perform activities that the patient is interested in or prefers, by using the easily preserved episodic memory, procedural memory and visuospatial cognitive functions of patients with FTD. 删除9：<u>2–5 14 </u>Such activities are then incorporated into the daily routine by appropriately using the stereotyped behaviour in a positive sense. Using HADLS, the occupational therapist, together with the care staff, extracted the IADL that the patient was undertaking in daily activities at her residence but not doing currently at the group home. The occupational therapist selected the IADL of ‘clean-up after meals’ assuming that the patient would likely be able to complete the task if it was done together with care staff. Next, a positive response was obtained when the patient was asked whether she would like to try ‘clean-up after meals’. In line with the patient’s wish, it was decided that the IADL of ‘clean-up after meals’ would be the task undertaken in the routinising therapy. The occupational therapist instructed the care staff to guide the patient in performing the clean-up after meals more than once per day. Moreover, the care staff was also instructed to say words of appreciation and gratitude every time the patient completed the clean-up after meals. The intervention period was set as 2 weeks, hypothesising that even in a short time routinising the IADL would lead to an improvement in IADL capability.\n\n【31】The care staff guided the patient in performing the household chores every day for 2 weeks, and the patient was able to complete the household chores together with the care staff. On day 1 and day 2, responding to the guidance by the care staff with a smiling face and in good mood, the patient performed the clean-up after meals. On day 3, the patient on her own volition performed the activity of ‘wiping the table’ when she noticed the wiping cloth placed on the table. On day 4 and afterwards, she was able to wash the dishes even more carefully. On day 6 and afterwards, she started looking forward to clean-up after meals as soon as she had finished eating. On day 7 and afterwards, she wanted to wear an apron while performing the household chores. On day 8 and afterwards, the instances in which she conversed the care staff with a smile while performing clean-up after meals also increased.\n\n【32】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【33】After the intervention, the total HADLS score was 44.8, with a score of 0.7 for the subitem ‘clean up after meals’. The total NPI-NH score was 4, with subitem scores of 3 for agitation, 删除13：<u>1 </u>for apathy, 删除13：<u>2 </u>for disinhibition and 2 for irritability. The QOL-AD score was 44. The MMSE score was 18. The CDR score was 2 ( tables 1 and 2 ).\n\n【34】In the follow-up over 1 month after the 2-week intervention, the routine of clean-up after meals was found to be established. Moreover, the patient started to amicably converse even with the residents whom she had previously disliked. Additionally, instances of locking herself up in her room became fewer, and instances of altercations with other residents ceased almost completely.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】In this case study, we referred to the current ADL status and daily living history of the patient having more than three clinical features in formulating the routinising therapy to adapt the stereotyped behaviour to IADL. Moreover, a new finding for us was that focusing on IADL in the intervention enabled the patient to perform it in a short time, improving the IADL capability. Additionally, another point worthy of attention was that the BPSD decreased as the IADL capability improved.\n\n【37】In the Japanese guidelines, non-drug therapies such as care and behaviour therapy considering FTLD symptomatology are recommended as 2C (‘weak recommendation, weak rationale’ based on the combination of recommended grade and evidence level) category. 删除9：<u>14</u>\n\n【38】Disinhibition, stereotyped behaviour and decreased spontaneity are observed as the early-stage symptoms of FTD. However, memory impairment and visuospatial impairment are not noticeable in the early stage. 删除9：<u>4 15 </u>In this case, as the intervention continued, the patient increasingly looked forward to performing the IADL. The point worthy of attention here is that it indicates that for a patient with FTD, it is easier to preserve prospective memory for remembering what to do from now on. In summary, patients with FTD exhibit less memory (functional) impairment compared with patients with Alzheimer dementia and other types of dementia, and this can be considered important in formulating the therapy strategy for treating behaviour impairment associated with FTD. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【39】The long-term care burden of caregivers due to BPSD in patients with FTD has been reported as an issue. 删除9：<u>16–19 </u>In care facilities also, it is necessary to reduce the long-term care burden. It has been reported that introducing routinising therapy inwards has reduced the long-term care burden. 删除9：<u>4 </u>In this case, routinising therapy was administered guaranteeing patient-centred care, by obtaining consent before the IADL intervention that the patient wants to do household chores. Consequently, troubles with others and BPSD such as agitation, apathy, disinhibition and irritability were reduced, resulting in a reduction in long-term care burden. In a systematic review of clinical experiments on non-drug therapies, Shinagawa _et al_ 20 mentioned that based on a study with six patients with FTLD, Ikeda _et al_ from Japan have reported that care using memory function and visuospatial function was effective, leading to sustaining QOL. Merrilees _et al_ 21 reported that there were cases where it was possible to decrease abnormal behaviour and reduce the burden on caregivers, by using the (remaining) preserved functions and past lifestyle of the patient. In this case, also, using the patient’s stereotyped behaviour to adapt to IADL in the routinising therapy improved the QOL of the patient and reduced the long-term care burden of the care staff. These findings corroborate the observations in previous reports.\n\n【40】In this case report, since the investigation was limited to the comparison of before and after the intervention for only one case (patient), it cannot be said that the results apply to every patient with FTD. However, it is especially worth mentioning that incorporating IADL in the activities in routinising therapy improves IADL capability and QOL of the patient, which leads to reducing BPSD and long-term care burden. Incorporating such measures in care for patients with FTD can be considered effective hereafter.\n\n【41】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【42】The patient said, \"I look forward to cleaning up after meals every day. Up until now, no one expected me to clean up after meals or let me do it. I was made to spend my time just sitting in the living room. But I feel a little bit happier now.”\n\n【43】Her care staff said, \"She’s started to clean up after her meals and she’s happier and smiles more every day.

Consequently, a routine of household chores was established, reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and long-term care burden, and the quality of life (QOL) of the patient improved.

Due to persistent bleeding, a new laparotomy was performed 2 hours after the initial surgery. During the relaparotomy, a severe perforating stab was identified in liver segment 2, and a TachoSil tissue sealant patch was applied, and the venous liver bleeding was stopped. Pringle’s manoeuvre was not necessary. The patient suffered though from diffuse bleeding from multiple surfaces, including bleeding from major abdominal venous collaterals in skin, subcutis and fascia. The patient was acidotic, hypothermic and had severe coagulopathy, and was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) following ‘damage control’ principles. NOAK-TEG was measured to 144, so another three FFP and two thrombocytes were given and low TEG-MA (47.9) and TEG FF-MA (11.6) was corrected with 4 g of fibrinogen. In the ICU, the patient was rewarmed, and the metabolic acidosis was corrected, but the patient continued to be haemodynamically unstable and continued to bleed. Ten hours after the second surgery, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was inserted , and immediately afterwards a relaparotomy was performed in which the bleeding was stopped. Vital signs, bloodparameters, arterial blood gases, drain production and transfusion requirements all improved. In the ICU, the patient developed multiorgan failure, and severe hepatic failure and died 4 days after TIPS insertion and 5 days after the trauma. During the admission, blood investigations showed bilirubin of 39 increasing to 219, albumin of 24 increasing to 34 and an INR of 1.2 increasing to 3.4.\n\n【5】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【6】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【7】(A) Trauma CT of the liver after initial emergency surgery and abdominal packing and (B) reconstructed scan from trauma CT of upper liver, portal vein and collaterals before TIPS.

This is the first case to report TIPS as a tool to stop acute severe traumatic abdominal bleeding in a patient with liver cirrhosis combined with hypothermia, acidosis and severe coagulopathy. TIPS probably has no effect on traumatic arterial or venous bleeding. In our patient, the liver bleeding was stopped by application of a tissue sealant patch, but the major subsequent problem appeared to be diffuse abdominal bleeding and abdominal venous collateral bleeding. TIPS reduced portal pressure in our patient from 28 to 14 mm Hg and based on vital signs, blood parameters, drain production and transfusion requirements was effective to stop the diffuse intra-abdominal and collateral bleeding. Timing of TIPS placement is of utmost importance. Early TIPS placement in highly selected patients may abort the bleeding, reduce the risk for multiorgan failure and death. The decision for TIPS can be made in the operating theatre when the bleeding cannot be controlled. TIPS can be an effective tool in patients with portal hypertension and severe traumatic abdominal bleeding. Post-TIPS hepatic failure is a well-known complication which occurs in 20% of all patients. Trauma patients who are treated with TIPS are at increased risk for hepatic failure, hence we strongly advocate for reversal of TIPS as soon as the bleeding has stopped and the patient is stable. Closure of the TIPS shortly after TIPS placement could have been considered in the present case.\n\n【12】### Learning points\n\n【13】*   Patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension are at increased risk of coagulopathy and major abdominal bleeding.\n\n【14】*   In our case, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) reduced portal pressure in our patient from 28 to 14 mm Hg and was effective to stop the diffuse abdominal and abdominal venous collateral bleeding.\n\n【15】*   TIPS can be an effective tool in patients with portal hypertension and severe traumatic abdominal bleeding, though we strongly advocate for reversal of TIPS as soon as the bleeding has stopped and the patient is stable to reduce the risk for post-TIPS hepatic failure.\n\n【16】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【17】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【18】Consent obtained from next of kin.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:39:37", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:41:36", "cost": 118.279}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:41:36", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:39:37"}

There are a few reports of recurrent cases after en bloc resection; however, the association with the use of denosumab is unknown.

Tumours often occur in the epiphysis and metaphysis of long bones, half of which are located around the knee. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【8】In the distal forearm, the distal radius is the most affected site, accounting for 10% of all GCTB cases, followed by GCTB of the ulna accounting for 3%–6%; however, GCTB of the hand is relatively rare, accounting for 2%–3% of cases. 删除9：<u>2 3</u>\n\n【9】Traditionally, the only treatment option for GCTB was surgery; however, after the approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2013, denosumab has been more actively used as a medication for GCTB. Denosumab binds to and inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand; its ability to reduce the formation and activation of osteoclasts has been effectively used for unresectable GCTB or preoperative downstaging of cases with extraskeletal extension. However, some of the recent evidence suggests that the preoperative use of denosumab is associated with higher postoperative recurrence in cases involving bone curettage; therefore, it should be used with caution. 删除9：<u>4 5 </u>While there is no consensus on how to use denosumab when performing en bloc resection, a few case reports have suggested that it is suitable for clarifying the resection margin, thereby facilitating surgery.\n\n【10】In this study, we report a rare case of GCTB at the distal end of the ulna that developed soft tissue recurrence despite en bloc resection. Furthermore, we review the outcomes of distal ulna GCTB over the past 10 years during the denosumab era. The patient referenced in this case report provided written consent after being informed that all clinical data from the case would be submitted for publication. This study was approved by our institutional review board.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 26-year-old woman presented at our institution after experiencing progressive swelling and pain in the left wrist of her non-dominant hand over the previous 7 months. She had no history of trauma; however, the primary doctor diagnosed it as a postfracture condition. At a local clinic, the patient underwent observation for 3 months and was prescribed painkillers without any rehabilitation or X-ray examination. During our initial examination, we observed that the patient exhibited a limited range of motion (ROM) in the wrist, with 45°, 50°, 90° and 20° of extension, flexion, pronation and supination of the forearm, respectively. She had severe pain on the ulnar side of her wrist joint; however, there was no numbness in her fingers. The blood test findings were normal, and the possibility of metabolic diseases, infection or osteomyelitis was considered to be low.\n\n【13】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【14】Radiography  and MRI revealed an expansive Campanacci grade III osteolytic lesion. T1-weighted images showed low-signal to iso signal intensity, and T2-weighted images revealed heterogeneous high-signal and mixed low-signal areas due to haemosiderin and fibrosis. In addition, gadolinium-based MRI scans showed prominent contrast effect, which is typical of GCTB. Incisional biopsy was performed using local anaesthesia, and a pathological diagnosis of GCTB was made.\n\n【15】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【16】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【17】(A) Subarticular lytic expansile lesion of the distal ulna in the epiphysis and metaphysis showing a ‘soap bubble appearance’.

Denosumab was administered with a 2-week interval between the first and second doses and every 4 weeks thereafter for a total of five doses. After five injections of denosumab, the patient’s wrist pain resolved and the ROM improved to 60° of supination, 60° of dorsal flexion and 70° of volar flexion. X-ray imaging revealed tumour shrinkage and osteosclerosis of the margins .\n\n【20】Surgical resection was performed under general anaesthesia 5 months after the first presentation. En bloc bone resection and ulnar stabilisation were performed using the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon because the original tumour was Campanacci grade III, which has a high reported rate of local recurrence, particularly in areas where it is difficult to perform curettage treatment, such as the distal forearm or finger bones. A portion of the ulna, measuring 7 cm, was resected. The ECU tendon was cut into half at the distal end, passed through a hole at the end of the ulna and fixed to the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon. Subsequently, the extensor retinaculum was partially inverted and sutured to the ECU tendon to stabilise the ulnar bone .\n\n【21】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【22】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【23】(A) Postoperative radiograph of the wrist after the first operation during which a 7 cm resection of the distal end of the ulna was performed.

A review of the literature of the past 10 years since denosumab was first clinically used revealed that there were 19 reports describing 44 cases of Campanacci grade II and III distal ulnar GCTB 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>.\n\n【40】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【41】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【42】Case reports of Campanacci grade II and III distal ulna giant cell tumour of bone in the previous 10 years</u>\n\n【43】In 13 cases, bone curettage was performed in the initial surgery, 删除13：<u>6–11 </u>in which at least three were grade III cases. However, there was local recurrence in all grade III cases, 删除13：<u>7 11 </u>suggesting that en bloc resection is necessary in such conditions. Among the patients who underwent en bloc resection in the first surgery, only one exhibited local recurrence; this was a soft tissue recurrence, as noted in the present case. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Tendons or implants were used for reconstruction in 15 cases (15/35, 42.9%), 删除13：<u>9 13–20 </u>and all these cases exhibited favourable postoperative results. The most common method for stabilisation of the ulnar stump is using the ECU tendon. 删除9：<u>9 13 17 </u>In three studies, prosthetic reconstruction with implant arthroplasty of the distal radioulnar joint was reported, 删除13：<u>14–16 </u>while reconstruction of the distal radioulnar joint using an iliac bone block and screws—a modification of the Sauvé-Kapandji procedure—was reported in two studies. 删除9：<u>18–20 </u>Ferguson _et al_ 13 and Papanastassiou _et al_ 9 reported that reconstruction was not essential based on case comparisons of their own studies. In fact, in more than half of the reviewed cases, no reconstruction was performed, and almost all obtained favourable results (average Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scoring system score: 88.7%, range 30%–100%). Although the indication remains controversial, unlike in cases of trauma, reconstruction of the distal ulnar portion may not be mandatory in cases of slow-growing tumours if the tumour size is relatively small. However, considering that in most cases there was no long-term follow-up, we believe that it is better to consider reconstruction, particularly in younger patients when the disadvantages of reconstruction are not significant. In the present case, we obtained favourable results by resecting 7 cm (distal one-third portion) of the ulna and reconstructing it using the ECU tendon, which is the most common reconstruction method.\n\n【44】Denosumab was used as a preoperative adjuvant in three cases (3/45, 6.7%). 删除9：<u>11 21 22 </u>In all cases, denosumab was used in the same dosage and manner (120 mg every 4 weeks with additional loading doses of 120 mg on days 8 and 15 of the first month) for 3–6 months. In addition, denosumab was used only preoperatively in all three cases. There were no reports of decreased efficacy when used at the time of recurrence, as in this case. McCarthy _et al_ 21 described the effects of a short preoperative course of denosumab on distal forearm GCTB, and all patients experienced some pain relief after initiating denosumab. They suggested that the origin of pain may be multifactorial, including mechanical stress from tumour-related pressure, expansion of the periosteum, loss of structurally significant bone and mechanical failure. In addition, the production of prostaglandins, endothelin and other noxious factors by the tumour itself is known to cause pain. Similar to that report, in our case, short-term preoperative denosumab use resulted in pain alleviation and improvement in ROM of the wrist. Sanchez-Pareja _et al_ 22 reported that a slight tumour enlargement was observed immediately after denosumab use. Although there was some concern regarding sarcomatous changes, they ultimately concluded that the changes were a reactive phenomenon. In our case, osteosclerosis was observed, as reported in other studies, 删除13：<u>21 22 </u>which might have facilitated the removal of the tumour but did not reduce its size.\n\n【45】A recent review of the preoperative use of denosumab in treating GCTB 5 suggests that it should be avoided owing to the risk of tumour cells getting trapped in the sclerotic bone cortex and that bone curettage is the treatment of choice. However, there is no definitive indication regarding its use when en bloc resection is performed. 删除9：<u>4 5 23 </u>In our case, the sclerosis of the mass edges and the degree of swelling that reduced the patient’s pain and ROM restriction proved advantageous and facilitated surgical resection; however, soft tissue recurrence was a disadvantage. It is possible that dormant tumour cells that remained in the soft tissues could have been activated when denosumab was discontinued after the surgery. 删除9：<u>24</u>\n\n【46】Given the effect of denosumab on the tumour, it may be necessary to continue its use as adjuvant therapy even after surgery; however, evidence on the safety of long-term denosumab use in young patients has not been established. 删除9：<u>24 25 </u>Furthermore, a previous report discussed a rare case wherein sarcomatous changes were observed after denosumab use. 删除9：<u>26 </u>Therefore, the effects of long-term use of denosumab in young patients with GCTB require further investigation, and more case studies are necessary. Furthermore, there is no report that denosumab use could contribute to soft tissue recurrence. Tumour recurrence in the soft tissues after en bloc resection itself is rare (1.5%–3.1%). 删除9：<u>27 </u>It is also possible that there are consequences to denosumab discontinuation; nevertheless, details of the pharmacological effects are unknown.\n\n【47】In summary, we report a rare case of distal ulnar GCTB where soft tissue recurrence occurred despite performing en bloc resection. A review of the literature revealed that patients with grade III distal ulnar GCTB require at least en bloc resection; however, reconstruction may not be mandatory in some cases. Preoperative denosumab use alone may be insufficient to achieve acceptable oncological outcomes. It is also possible that denosumab may be less effective at the time of tumour recurrence. The duration and appropriate dose of denosumab should be investigated in future research.\n\n【48】### Learning points\n\n【49】*   This is a rare case of giant cell tumour of bone wherein the patient developed soft tissue recurrence despite undergoing en bloc resection.\n\n【50】*   It is unclear whether the use of denosumab affected the soft tissue recurrence.\n\n【51】*   The therapeutic effect of denosumab at the time of recurrence was possibly poor.\n\n【52】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【53】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【54】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:29:19", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:30:01", "cost": 41.605}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:30:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:29:19"}

On the day of presentation, she had a follow-up visit to obtain duplex ultrasound of her right lower extremity (RLE) as part of the postprocedural protocol, which revealed a non-compressible femoral vein, indicating deep venous thrombosis (DVT). While the ultrasound technician was performing a thorough ultrasound compression test on the proximal femoral vein, common femoral vein and superficial femoral vein, the technician noticed a dislodge of the DVT from the femoral vein, followed by recovery of compressibility of all venous systems . The patient was referred to the emergency department for further evaluation. On arrival, patient was asymptomatic, vital signs were unremarkable and physical examination was unrevealing except for varicose veins and a taped postprocedural site seen on the RLE . CT of the chest with contrast revealed a thrombus involving the right middle lobe pulmonary artery . Transthoracic echocardiogram did not reveal any right ventricular strain. However, brain natriuretic peptide was elevated to 640 pg/mL and high-sensitivity troponin I was mildly elevated to 21 ng/L, indicating submassive PE.

Her medical history included hypertension, asthma and remote postpartum pulmonary embolism. There was a strong family history of atherosclerosis.

Associated clinical features range from chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea to life-threatening anaphylaxis. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>In theory, volume losses and dehydration from iron-induced gastrointestinal (GI) losses can be harmful. Several studies have reported ischaemic events, including venous thromboembolism and stroke, that were attributable to volume contraction. 删除9：<u>3–5 </u>Dehydration increases blood viscosity and is also thought to affect coagulation factors such as von Willebrand factor. 删除9：<u>6 </u>In this report, we describe an unusual case of acute limb ischaemia secondary to acute aortic intraluminal thrombus (ILT) and embolisation which followed a severe GI reaction to IV iron sucrose.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A woman in her 50s presented with microcytic anaemia and iron deficiency (haemoglobin, 删除13：<u>76 </u>g/L (reference range (RR), 115–165); mean corpuscular volume 68.9 fL (RR, 82–99); serum ferritin, 2 µg/L (RR, <23 indicating iron deficiency)). She could not tolerate oral iron due to constipation. Upper and lower endoscopy and small bowel follow-through studies were negative. Screening tests for coeliac disease were negative. The iron deficiency anaemia was attributed to low nutritional iron intake and menstrual blood losses. Medical history included hypertension (treated with felodipine and cilazapril), asthma (treated with inhalers and montelukast) and postpartum pulmonary embolism 21 years earlier treated with heparin followed by 3 months of warfarin, without ongoing anticoagulation or thrombosis recurrence. She had smoked for 20 years but stopped a decade earlier. There was a strong family history of coronary artery disease.\n\n【10】She received her first dose of IV iron sucrose (Venofer), 删除13：<u>500 </u>mg, administered over 4 hours. She received premedication with IV dimenhydrinate (Gravol; 25 mg) and oral dexamethasone (Decadron; 10 mg). Towards the end of the infusion, she developed nausea and six episodes of bilious vomiting, as well as large volume diarrhoea with several episodes of faecal incontinence. She also complained of retrosternal chest pressure, diaphoresis and dramatic pain across her lower back. Physical examination revealed blood pressure 101/67 (reduced from 134/76 earlier in the treatment session), heart rate 110/min (increased from 73/min) and respiratory rate 14/min, without wheezes. She was transferred to the emergency room, where serial ECGs and cardiac enzymes ruled out acute myocardial ischaemia. Three hours later, her truncal pain had subsided, but she developed bilateral lower extremity pain, especially in the right-lower limb. She was monitored overnight, and her vital signs returned to normal. Although the lower-limb pain had not completely resolved by the next morning, she was discharged to home at noon.\n\n【11】Over the next 30 hours, she continued to have fluctuating lower extremity pain, especially in the right leg, with worsening difficulties with walking. She therefore attended a local emergency room, where she was found to have absent right foot pulses, lower extremity pallor and inability to dorsiflex or plantarflex her toes. She was urgently transferred to the nearest vascular surgery centre (the same institution as the clinic where she had received her iron sucrose infusion).\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】Immediately after the IV iron infusion, there was an increase in haemoglobin from 76 to 100 g/L, with a corresponding increase in haematocrit from 0.242 to 0.326, and leucocyte count increase from 5.5 to 10.0×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (RR, 4.0–11.0). The abrupt increase in haemoglobin was believed to be consistent with haemoconcentration, given the marked vomiting, diarrhoea and diaphoresis. Notably, there was a further rise in her leucocyte count to 22.3×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. In contrast, platelets decreased from 354 to 217×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (RR, 150–400) postinfusion.

Thrombus was also noted in branches of the right profunda femoris artery, with thrombotic occlusion of the distal right popliteal artery and tibioperoneal trunk, and no contiguous runoff to the ankle. She was treated with embolectomies and fasciotomies for her acute limb ischaemia. During revascularisation surgery, an unusual mix of white clots with erythematous components was extracted. The pathologist identified platelet-rich thrombus with prominent acute inflammatory infiltrates.\n\n【18】Postoperatively, when the haematologist informed the vascular surgery service about the severe back pain that had accompanied the initial post-IV iron reaction, imaging was repeated to include the thoracic and abdominal aorta. The follow-up CT angiogram of chest and runoff showed atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, with non-occlusive thrombi in the descending thoracic aorta and near-occlusive thrombi in the distal abdominal aorta.\n\n【19】Creatine kinase peaked at 8912 U/L (RR, <168), consistent with ischaemic muscle injury. A consulting neurologist diagnosed right foot drop secondary to ischaemic injury to the common peroneal nerve, and opined that eventual good recovery was possible over the next months.\n\n【20】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【21】Given the acute postiron infusion nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis and truncal pain, and the strong family history of coronary-artery disease, concern for acute coronary syndrome was high. However, serial ECGs and troponins were unremarkable, and the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of acute GI reaction caused by IV iron sucrose infusion. Following readmission for lower-limb ischaemia and the ensuing diagnosis of acute aortic ILT, further laboratory investigations for a chronic hypercoagulability disorder all returned normal or negative .\n\n【22】Treatment\n---------\n\n【23】Unfractionated heparin, administered intraoperatively, was continued postoperatively in therapeutic doses with monitoring by activated partial thromboplastin time, with subsequent transition to warfarin (continued postdischarge). Surgical revascularisation consisted of right popliteal embolectomy, right anterior tibial embolectomy, and right tibial peroneal trunk embolectomy with four-compartment fasciotomies. She completed combined warfarin and antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) for 1 year, followed by dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) for another year, followed by long-term aspirin monotherapy. She also received intermittent transfusion with red cell concentrates (seven units transfused over the subsequent 5 years), under the supervision of a haematologist, to manage her chronic iron deficiency anaemia.\n\n【24】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【25】Following surgery, lower-limb ultrasound demonstrated good flow and excellent ankle and toe pressures bilaterally. Her right limb motor function gradually improved over the next year. At 5 year follow-up with the vascular surgeon, she had improved neuropathic pain, and excellent perfusion, shown by repeat ultrasonography, to her lower extremities. At 7 year follow-up, she reported intermittent neuropathic pain but had healthy flow patterns by ultrasonography and normal ankle-brachial indices bilaterally.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】We describe a rare complication of bilateral lower-limb ischaemia secondary to acute aortic ILT that began after a severe GI reaction (vomiting and diarrhoea) to high-dose (500 mg) iron sucrose infusion in a patient with underlying subclinical aortic atherosclerosis. Our report is novel, as—to the best of our knowledge—occurrence of aortic ILT with resulting acute lower-limb ischaemia postiron infusion has not been reported previously. Parenteral iron sucrose is an effective and increasingly common treatment for iron deficiency, and has a favourable safety profile; for this reason, we feel it is important to highlight this rare and unusual clinical outcome.\n\n【28】Studies of IV iron infusion indicate that serious or severe adverse reactions are relatively uncommon. 删除9：<u>7–12 </u>The majority of such adverse reactions occur during or immediately after the first IV iron infusion. 删除9：<u>13 </u>GI complications of parenteral iron are associated with higher doses, and the high initial iron sucrose dose (500 mg) was likely contributory. 删除9：<u>14 </u>Consistent with the literature, our patient developed the adverse reaction towards the end of the 4 hour infusion, suggesting a dose-dependent GI reaction. In response to this serious adverse event, we (MP and TEW) have altered our haematology practice to start with lower initial doses of iron sucrose (generally, 删除13：<u>200 </u>mg), and if well tolerated, to increase the dose in 100 mg increments on subsequent administrations, to a maximum of 400 mg per dose. This practice is supported by literature, 删除13：<u>14 </u>indicating a high frequency of acute reactions with 500 mg iron sucrose dosing. Also, in the absence of a history of previous postiron infusion reactions, and in light of literature indicating a higher frequency of adverse reactions in patients given premedications, 删除13：<u>15 </u>we now omit routine administration of dimenhydrinate and corticosteroid preiron infusion.\n\n【29】Two randomised trials found that iron sucrose infusion was associated with a higher frequency of usually minor GI reactions compared with alternative formulations. 删除9：<u>8 16 </u>Iron sucrose formulations have higher proportions of labile iron content, which may carry more potential for toxicity from oxidative stress, especially with higher doses. 删除9：<u>16 17</u>\n\n【30】We note that iron deficiency anaemia per se is associated with increased risk of thrombosis, particularly in the setting of thrombocytosis. 删除9：<u>18 19 </u>Iron deficiency is a well-known explanation for reactive thrombocytosis due to diminished inhibition of thrombopoiesis. Our patient’s preinfusion platelet count was 352×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, an upper normal value, which was higher than subsequent platelet counts measured during long-term follow-up when her iron deficiency anaemia had resolved (the mean platelet count of eight serial measurements, obtained 3 to 8 years later, was approximately 250×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). However, many patients (like ours) who develop thrombosis in the setting of iron deficiency anaemia do not necessarily have overt thrombocytosis. 删除9：<u>18 19 </u>As pointed out by Al-Samkari and colleagues, 19 ‘intravenous iron replenishment may have additional advantages in mitigating the thrombogenic potential of iron deficiency’. Moreover, Nashashibi and coworkers 20 have provided laboratory evidence that IV iron therapy lowers coagulability. These investigators evaluated thrombin generation using calibrated automated thrombogram parameters, assessed before and approximately 3 weeks postiron repletion, underscoring the irony of our patient developing a dramatic thrombotic event shortly after receiving parenteral iron replacement.\n\n【31】Available literature on acute ILT and complete aortic thrombosis provides insights into potential mechanisms explaining our patient’s aortic thrombosis and associated embolisation to the distal lower-limb vasculature. A review of acute aortic thrombosis 21 listed two main underlying cardiovascular disorders, namely large-saddle embolus (eg, from a cardiac chamber) to the aortic bifurcation (not seen in our patient) or acute thrombosis within an atherosclerotic aorta , with or without associated aortic aneurysmal changes (not seen in our patient). In the minority of patients with aortic thrombosis who do not evince cardiovascular disease, an acute or chronic hypercoagulability disorder (not seen in our patient) is typically found. 删除9：<u>21–23</u>\n\n【32】Regarding potential proximate triggers of aortic thrombosis in patients with atherosclerosis, a classic 1995 study 23 of 48 patients who presented with acute aortic thrombosis to a single vascular centre over a 19 year period identified in-situ thrombosis in 44 (92%) patients and underlying aortic atherosclerosis in 36 (75%) patients. Of particular significance, several patients with underlying aortic atherosclerosis had aortic thrombosis and acute limb ischaemia attributable to ‘low-flow state caused by … severe volume depletion’. 删除9：<u>23 </u>In our patient, we suggest that the severe vomiting and diarrheal illness precipitated by the iron sucrose infusion, with resulting intravascular volume contraction, helped to trigger acute platelet activation and thrombosis in the presence of endothelial disruption from pre-existing atherosclerotic disease. Our patient clearly developed marked volume depletion, corroborated by the significant haemoconcentration, as reflected by the abrupt increase in her haemoglobin (76 to 100 g/L) and haematocrit (0.242 to 0.326) values. Moreover, her platelet counts decreased abruptly following the iron infusion (352 to 217×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), a phenomenon that appears to have been even more marked (ie, from 352 to approximately 185×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) if one adjusts the platelet counts for the marked changes in haematocrit (as a lower plasma volume secondary to GI fluid losses would help mask true platelet count declines). Indeed, the estimated abrupt 47% drop in platelet count  is consistent with platelet consumption related to platelet deposition on the atherosclerotic aorta. Acute diaphoresis associated with volume contraction and an associated catecholamine response could have contributed to acute platelet activation. 删除9：<u>24 </u>Dexamethasone (premedication) administration and ensuing leucocytosis could also have contributed to the inflammatory thromboses extracted. Another potential contributing factor could have been endothelial injury, with associated adhesion of monocytes, resulting from iron sucrose infusion, as shown in an experimental model. 删除9：<u>25</u>\n\n【33】In summary, we report a patient with moderately severe iron deficiency anaemia who developed acute GI fluid losses (vomiting and diarrhoea) following a relatively high first-dose IV iron sucrose therapy (500 mg), with laboratory evidence of acute haemoconcentration, consumptive thrombocytopenia and leucocytosis. Progressive lower-limb ischaemia over the ensuing hours to a few days led to diagnosis of distal aortic ILT with peripheral embolisation in a patient with subclinical aortic atherosclerosis. Fortunately, emergency embolectomies and fasciotomies salvaged the lower limbs.\n\n【34】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【35】I entered the hospital for a routine iron infusion, my first. Just as the second and final bag was finishing up, I began to feel nauseated, and started to vomit. I also had a lot of diarrhoea. Not long after, I felt a pain in my back. The nurse acted quickly and called for a doctor. I was taken to the emergency department where I stayed overnight. It was in emergency that I kept telling the staff that I believed there could be blood clotting. The pain in my back was better, but I now had some pains in my legs, especially my right one, which at times was so severe that pain medication was not alleviating the pain entirely. The doctors ruled out a heart attack, and I was discharged the next day, even though the pain had not completely gone away. I even had some difficulty walking. Over the subsequent 24 hours, I was unable to sleep, eat or walk. So, that evening, I was brought to the local emergency department. It was frustrating that it took so much time to figure out that there was clotting happening in my legs. I am extremely grateful that the doctor at emergency determined that I had no pulses in my right leg and quickly called a vascular surgeon. I was provided with pain medication and was transported to the emergency room at the same hospital where I had received the iron infusion. I was admitted back into hospital and had surgery at 5 am. I learnt that I would likely lose a toe, a foot or even my leg. My family and I feel very blessed that we had a surgeon that made every effort to save my limbs, and he did. We appreciate how hard the hospital team worked to diagnose my illness and to take care of me. I spent 3 weeks in the hospital and during this time, had many tests and two surgeries. I was surprised to find out how unusual this complication is. It turns out that no one has been able to find a similar case in the medical literature of ‘aortic intraluminal thrombus’ following iron infusion, so this must be a rare side effect indeed.\n\n【36】### Learning points\n\n【37】*   Intravenous iron sucrose, especially in larger doses, can result in acute gastrointestinal toxicity, including large-volume emesis and diarrhoea, due to labile iron content.\n\n【38】*   Rarely, acute intravascular volume depletion can precipitate acute aortic intraluminal thrombus, perhaps as a consequence of acute haemoconcentration and catecholamine release, with acute platelet activation and consumption.\n\n【39】*   Acute limb pain requires careful and repeated clinical assessment, as progressive embolisation may not result in loss of pedal pulses until later in the clinical course.\n\n【40】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【41】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【42】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:54:40", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:55:01", "cost": 21.095}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:55:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:54:40"}

However, ICI therapies, such as pembrolizumab, are associated with significant immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) affecting all organ systems. Cutaneous manifestations are common with clinical presentations including maculopapular rash, psoriasiform rash, bullous dermatitis, lichenoid eruption, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). ICI lichenoid eruptions present later than maculopapular and psoriasiform rashes, most commonly 6–12 weeks after initiation of immunotherapy. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Lichenoid eruptions have been reported in 0.5%–6% of patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Systemic glucocorticoids are the mainstay of therapy for most high-grade IRAEs.

She had active metastatic bladder cancer and developed a rash 92 days after the initiation of immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. Two weeks before admission, the patient’s skin lesions evolved from scattered pruritic macules to diffuse plaques covering all extremities, despite conservative management with topical triamcinolone, oral antihistamines and holding pembrolizumab. She denied constitutional symptoms, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspnoea or chest pain.\n\n【10】On admission, she was afebrile and normotensive with a pulse rate of 74 beats per minute and SpO2 of 95% on room air. A physical examination of the patient revealed cachexia, mild oropharyngeal mucositis, angular cheilitis and a right subclavian port without surrounding erythema or purulence. A focused dermatological examination was significant for diffuse violaceous plaques and erosions with adherent haemorrhagic crusting on her face, bilateral upper and lower extremities, and dorsal surfaces of her hands . Multiple lesions on the upper and lower extremities exhibited purulence. The left lower extremity also had erosions with a negative Nikolsky sign. There were no targetoid or dusky lesions, facial swelling, conjunctivitis or lymphadenopathy. The patient’s laboratory findings were notable for a normal leucocyte count with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein at 39 mm/hour (normal range: 0–29 mm/hour) and 95.9 mg/L (0–8.0 mg/L), respectively. Due to our concern for secondary impetiginisation of the lesions, the patient was started empirically on empiric antibiotic therapy.\n\n【11】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【12】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【13】Violaceous plaques and erosions involving the right hand (top) and right upper extremity (bottom) at the time of admission.</u>\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】We obtained multiple skin biopsies for pathological examination, including perilesional direct immunofluorescence (DIF) and tissue culture.

The clinical presentation was inconsistent with life-threatening drug-related dermatoses, such as SJS or drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms based on the absence of significant truncal involvement, painful or dusky skin lesions, Nikolsky sign, odynophagia, facial swelling, atypical lymphadenopathy, fevers or eosinophilia. Destruction of the basal layer of the epidermis is characteristic of lichenoid interface dermatitis and may result in focal subepidermal clefting. Although subepidermal clefting with eosinophils is characteristic of certain immunobullous disorders, such as bullous pemphigoid, the presence of lichenoid interface dermatitis seen in this case is most consistent with lichenoid drug eruption as DIF was negative for any specific dermatosis, which supports the diagnosis of drug eruption over immunobullous disorder. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【21】Treatment\n---------\n\n【22】The patient was started empirically on intravenous vancomycin and cefepime due to our concern for purulent cellulitis and bacterial superinfection of progressive cutaneous eruptions in an immunocompromised host. Following pathology results demonstrating a lichenoid eruption attributed to immunotherapy, the patient was started on prednisone 1 mg/kg daily with a plan for the continuation of systemic steroids for 4–6 weeks pending clinical improvement to ≤grade 1 symptoms. The patient completed a 7-day course of oral antibiotics for superimposed cellulitis.\n\n【23】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【24】At a follow-up visit with dermatology 1 week after discharge, the patient had clinical improvement of all lesions. Based on recommendations from dermatology and oncology, pembrolizumab was permanently discontinued. One month after hospital discharge, the patient experienced complete resolution of her cutaneous lesions. Due to the progression of metastatic disease and extensive side effects of previously attempted therapies, the patient elected to pursue palliative therapies without further oncological treatment.\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】Lichenoid dermatitis with eosinophils may be seen in a variety of clinical syndromes, including lichenoid drug eruptions. Although subepidermal clefting with eosinophils is characteristic of certain immunobullous disorders (eg, bullous pemphigoid), interface dermatitis, intraepidermal acantholysis and keratinocyte necrosis are most specific for paraneoplastic pemphigus. 删除9：<u>1 </u>The patient was diagnosed with a lichenoid eruption due to ICI toxicity from pembrolizumab and superimposed soft tissue infection.\n\n【27】Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for IRAEs and do not reduce the anti-tumour effects of checkpoint inhibitors. 删除9：<u>3–5 </u>Although the current NCCN guidelines do not explicitly address lichenoid eruptions related to ICI therapy, they recommend treating grades 3–4 bullous dermatitis and other severe IRAEs with prednisone or methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg daily until clinical improvement to ≤grade 1 symptoms. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Additionally, infliximab, rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin are supportive therapies that can be used for clinically refractory disease, but they are not used as first-line therapies.\n\n【28】No studies have shown a consistent correlation between checkpoint inhibitor side effects and anti-tumour effects. The NCCN recommends resuming prior immunotherapy agents in patients with grades 1–2 ICI bullous dermatitis once lesions are mild/localised, requiring only topical steroids (grade 2 disease involves 10%–30% BSA with painful blisters). Further immunotherapy is contraindicated in all grade 4 dermatological toxicity cases, including SJS and TEN. 删除9：<u>5 </u>This patient exhibited grade 3 symptoms (>30% BSA involvement without electrolyte/fluid abnormalities); therefore, resuming pembrolizumab at any dose or transitioning to a different immunotherapy agent would not be recommended due to the concern for life-threatening complications. Accordingly, pembrolizumab was permanently discontinued in this patient.\n\n【29】### Learning points\n\n【30】*   Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) lichenoid eruptions present later than maculopapular and psoriasiform rashes, most commonly 6–12 weeks after initiation of immunotherapy.\n\n【31】*   Immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) include a broad spectrum of cutaneous reactions (eg, maculopapular, psoriasiform, eczematous and lichenoid eruption subtypes). Lichenoid eruptions have been reported in 0.5%–6% of patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies.\n\n【32】*   Steroids are the mainstay of treatment for IRAEs. Individuals with grade 1 ICI bullous dermatitis can receive high-potency topical steroids, whereas individuals with grades 2–4 IRAEs should be treated with systemic steroids.\n\n【33】*   Severe ICI toxicity (grades 3–4) is a contraindication to further immunotherapy; however, little prospective research exists on this subject. Additional trials should be performed to evaluate the risks and benefits of ongoing immunotherapy following severe ICI toxicity, especially in the absence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis.\n\n【34】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【35】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【36】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:43:12", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:45:08", "cost": 116.178}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:45:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:43:12"}

On slit lamp examination, the anterior chamber was quiet  with total cupping in both eyes. The intraocular pressure (IOP) in L/E was 28 mm Hg and 26 mm Hg in the right eye (R/E), which were not controlled despite maximal medical treatment. Needling was performed in the L/E after the gonioscopy affirmed the patency of the ostium. This was done using a slit lamp and no antimetabolite was used. There was no intervention in R/E because there was no perception of light. After 2 weeks of needling, the patient’s IOP kept increasing, necessitating a repeat gonioscopy, which revealed vitreous in the ostium . 删除9：<u>1 </u>After pupillary dilation, zonular dialysis and a localised cataract were observed at the 11 o’clock position , confirming vitreous prolapse from the site of zonular dialysis and its eventual passage into the surgical iridectomy, thereby blocking the internal ostium. The vitreous behind the iris was captured using anterior segment optical coherence tomography in the L/E . 删除9：<u>2 </u>It was assumed that there was prior zonular dialysis with localised cataractous changes prior to the needling, which could have occurred during the initial surgery. During needling, however, the pressure difference between the anterior and posterior segment causes vitreous prolapse from the zonular dialysis area, eventually blocking the internal ostium. Intrableb scarring, fibrosis, encapsulation in the subconjunctival space, or blockage of the internal ostium with iris, are all common causes of postoperative trabeculectomy failure. 删除9：<u>3 </u>None of these events occurred in our case; rather, it was caused by a blockage of the internal ostium with vitreous. The source of this vitreous was a pre-existing zonular dialysis tract that prolapsed vitreous postneedling, blocking the internal ostium and resulting in high IOP. Bleb needling has been reported to be performed successfully up to 30 years after trabeculectomy. 删除9：<u>4 </u>A rare complication of bleb needling is vitreous prolapse through the iridectomy site. 删除9：<u>5 </u>The prolapsed vitreous may be the only cause of high IOP, resulting in trabeculectomy failure.

In our initial examination, she presented with retrograde amnesia to the event, elevated BP (194/108 mm Hg), tachycardia (109 beats per minute) and normal neurological examination. Laboratorial tests showed hyperglycaemia of 428 mg/dL, glycosuria and ketonuria. She had a medical history of hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia and multinodular goitre. Cataract surgery accounted for the only previous surgical procedure. She denied any pharmacological allergies. She had been prescribed glargine and glulisine insulin, but due to non-compliance, her glucose and glycated Hb levels were not controlled.\n\n【4】We ordered a head CT as part of our trauma protocol and found a noticeable hyperdense image in the right lenticular and caudate nuclei, confined to the grey matter, without enhancement after contrast . To the untrained observer, this could be interpreted as a haemorrhage secondary to traumatic brain event. Yet, this finding is compatible with sequelae of severe hyperglycaemic profile. The lesion was found to have around 40–45 Hounsfield units. The most consistent and common imaging features of hyperglycaemic changes are CT hyperdensities or hyperintense basal ganglia signal on MRI T1 weighted images, without surrounding oedema or mass effect. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Haemorrhagic CT lesions following blunt trauma are usually in subdural, subarachnoid or intraparenchymal locations, and less commonly epidural, having Hounsfield units values of around 65–80.

In this case, our patient did not present any movement or neurological disorder prior or after the accident.\n\n【13】The basal ganglia are highly metabolically active, and one should hypothesise other possible non-traumatic oetiologies for CT hyperdensities. Most of these are bilateral and examples are Wilson’s disease, neurodegenerative disease, poisoning, Tay-Sachs disease, drug consumption or ischaemic events. Regarding haemorrhage and tumour, which also present with unilateral abnormality, differentiation can be made as the hyperdense area in hyperglycaemia has lower Hounsfield units values and conforms to the shape of basal ganglia sparing the internal capsule. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【14】Concerning the disappearance of these imaging findings, the cases reported in the literature do not mention a time interval in which it occurs. In our case, the hyperdense lesion evolved to an encephalomalacia area, which can hypothetically be related to a stroke (one of the possible pathophysiological mechanisms previously described). As a principle, follow-up with internal medicine or neurology consultations is advised, and neuropathological processes should be studied accordingly, outside the acute setting.\n\n【15】### Learning points\n\n【16】*   Hyperdense lesions on head CT after trauma are usually a result of intracranial bleeding, namely cerebral contusion, epidural, subdural or subarachnoid haemorrhage.\n\n【17】*   When these are observed in the basal ganglia, intracranial haemorrhage might not be correct diagnosis. Other pathologies, mostly metabolic, such as sustained severe hyperglycaemia, should be ruled out.\n\n【18】*   Basal ganglia CT/MRI hyperdense images with movement disorders (hemiballismus and/or hemichorea) are rare in diabetic patients, but they can be present in those with very poor glycaemic control.\n\n【19】*   We report a case of an asymptomatic diabetic patient with the above-mentioned abnormal CT finding which disappeared in a control CT 18 months afterwards, when glycaemic values were already under control.\n\n【20】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【21】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【22】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:56:37", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:56:53", "cost": 15.682}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:56:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:56:37"}

ICDs predispose the affected region to the development of a variety of other dermatoses (locus minoris resistentiae) or, occasionally, sparing of the region in generalised dermatoses (locus maioris resistentiae). Regional immune impairment is attributed to lymphatic and/or neural damage. Dermatoses developing at such sites range from infectious and inflammatory conditions to various neoplastic disorders and are strictly confined to the ICDs. 删除9：<u>1–3 </u>We present a case of a man in his late 20s who presented with eczematous lesions at the donor and recipient sites following skin grafting as an illustration of Ruocco’s ICD.\n\n【4】A man in his late 20s presented with itchy rashes during the previous week which had developed at the donor and recipient sites (right and left anterior thighs, respectively) of split-thickness skin grafting surgery, which he had undergone 6 months previously for a non-healing burn wound. He did not have any personal or family history of atopy nor had he received any form of treatment prior to our consultation. Clinically, the rashes were conspicuously confined to the graft donor and recipient areas, characterised by erythema, erosions, crusting and scaling suggestive of eczematous dermatitis . Dermoscopy of both sites showed a pinkish background, clustered non-uniform red dots, yellow-orange structureless areas, erosions and scaling , supporting the clinical diagnosis of eczema. 删除9：<u>4 </u>The history, clinical and dermoscopic findings collectively suggested an inflammatory dermatosis (eczematous dermatitis) developing at the sites of locally impaired immunity (Ruocco’s ICDs) due to surgical trauma at the donor site and the skin graft and/or the previous burn at the recipient site.\n\n【5】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【6】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【7】Eczematous dermatitis at the donor (A) and recipient (B) sites 6 months following a split-thickness skin grafting procedure.</u>\n\n【8】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【9】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【10】Dermoscopy of the lesions showing clustered non-uniform red dots (black circles), yellow-orange structureless areas (black stars), erosions  and scales  over a pinkish background (polarised dermoscopy using DermLite DL3, 删除9：<u>3</u>Gen Inc, San Juan Capistrano, California, USA; magnification x10).</u>\n\n【11】Discussion\n----------\n\n【12】Eczematous cutaneous reactions developing at the donor and/or the recipient sites of skin grafting have occasionally been described. 删除9：<u>5–8 </u>Lymphatic obstruction and altered neuromediator pathways due to trauma contribute to the development of ICDs at these sites. Furthermore, split-thickness grafts are different from normal skin in having impaired barrier properties and an absence of adnexal structures, contributing to the development of ICDs, in addition to trauma, at the recipient sites. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Eczema developing at the donor and recipient sites is attributed to impaired barrier properties and altered immune function. As there was no personal or family history of atopy, impaired barrier function and/or the altered local immunological properties possibly facilitated development of eczema due to exogenous factors in our case. Verma _et al_ reported a similar case to ours in a patient with an eczematous reaction at both the donor and recipient sites following split-thickness skin grafting. 删除9：<u>5 </u>They noted that the eczema was more severe at the recipient site than at the donor site, which they attributed to more tissue damage at the recipient site. We also noted a similar difference.\n\n【13】Being functionally and immunologically different from the normal skin, the donor and recipient sites following skin grafting procedures can transform into ICDs, as highlighted in this case. Hence, the need for meticulous postoperative wound management cannot be overemphasised to prevent the possibility of development of ICDs.

Physical examination revealed body temperature of 37.0°C, pulse rate of 89 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 81/52 mm Hg and oxygen saturation of 91% on ambient air. Abdominal examination revealed a positive Murphy’s sign.

Abdominal contrast CT revealed swollen gallbladder with thickened wall, with extended cystic and common bile duct. Small higher density area was noticed in his duodenal papilla. At the early phase, the left hepatic lobe was brighter than the right hepatic lobe . At the portal vein phase, there was thrombosis of the left portal vein . Pylephlebitis due to acute cholecystitis and cholangitis was diagnosed, and empiric antibiotics therapy and emergency endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage were started. Anticoagulant therapy was also started. However, on day 6, the anticoagulant therapy was discontinued because of intestinal bleeding.

While in the emergency department, the patient’s clinical status acutely deteriorated with the development of massive lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, characterised by bright red blood per rectum. The patient was fluid resuscitated and started on vancomycin/cefepime for presumed infectious colitis. The patient continued to endorse abdominal discomfort with haematochezia. Serial complete blood counts (CBCs) revealed a down-trending Hgb to 9 g/dL. Stool testing returned negative for _Clostridium difficile_ , enteric pathogens and ova/cyst/parasites.

There was no clear aetiology or hypotensive period to account for haemorrhagic ischaemic colitis on pathology. The patient’s presenting history was revisited and, on this occasion, he admitted to significant cocaine use just prior to the onset of abdominal pain. Urine toxicology returned positive for cocaine which in part, accounts, for his diaphoresis and markedly dilated pupils on admission. The patient was managed conservatively with fluid support and liquid diet, advancing as tolerated. His postprocedure hospital course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 4 of hospitalisation as his haematochezia resolved and haemoglobin remained stable. He was extensively counselled on continued cocaine use, risk of overdose and death and provided with necessary information on rehabilitation centres.\n\n【13】Cocaine is a highly addictive, powerful stimulant for the nervous system that can be snorted, smoked or injected. In the USA, 删除13：<u>1 </u>in every 5 overdose deaths were related to cocaine use with an estimated 24 486 deaths in 2021. 删除9：<u>1 </u>In 2020, cocaine use was reported by over 5 million Americans, which is almost 2% of the population. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【14】Cocaine toxicity leading to GI injury is of a multifactorial pathophysiology. Cocaine’s direct vasoconstrictive effects via enhancement of a calcium flux across endothelial membranes result in ischaemia/infarction. 删除9：<u>3 </u>The sympathomimetic effects of cocaine via inhibition of presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake result in an accumulation of catecholamines which causes extensive mesenteric vasoconstriction with hypoperfusion and focal ischaemia of the intestines. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Furthermore, cocaine may cause thrombus formation and platelet aggregation via activation of the intravascular thrombosis cascades with additional hypoperfusion. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Notably, the direct prothrombotic effect of cocaine is not typically from the drug itself, but rather from cocaine cut with levamisole resulting in a cocaine/levamisole-induced vasculopathy. 删除9：<u>5 </u>There is an interval time of 1 hour to 2 days from drug use to symptom onset, usually characterised by abdominal pain and bloody stools.\n\n【15】Colonic ischaemia is an uncommon medical condition that carries significant morbidity and high mortality. The incidence of colonic ischaemia is about 22.9/100 000 person-years with notable risk factors including elderly population, mesenteric vascular atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, cardiac disease, shock, long distance running, severe dehydration, hereditary and acquired thrombophilia, and illicit substance abuse. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Affected patients typically present with sharp abdominal pain, that is typically out of proportion to physical signs, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Physical examination findings include abdominal tenderness on palpation, rebound tenderness (Blumberg’s sign), rigidity and guarding. In the late phase, patients can develop bloody diarrhoea, fever and shock.\n\n【16】The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) supplies the bowel from the distal duodenum to the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon. The inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) supplies the large intestine from the distal one-third of the transverse colon to the superior aspect of the rectum. Colonic perfusion can be compromised by changes in systemic circulation or by anatomic or functional change in local vasculature. 删除9：<u>7 </u>The ‘watershed’ areas namely the splenic flexure (Griffiths point) and rectosigmoid junction (Sudek’s point) are prone to ischaemia as the regions between the two major arteries supplying the colon. Watershed areas account for nearly 70% of ischaemic colitis cases given their limited vascular collateralisation. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【17】Intestinal ischaemia occurs when there is at least a 75% reduction of intestinal blood flow for more than 12 hours. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Ischaemic colitis typically requires a low flow state, usually in patients whose vascular bed is already compromised by fixed atherosclerotic obstruction in the branches of the SMA and IMA. Hence, ischaemic colitis is more common in elderly patients with haemorrhagic shock when compared with younger trauma victims with the same degree of shock. Cocaine use would typically increase organ perfusion by increasing the mean arterial pressure and cardiac output, however, taking into account the vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine, it may paradoxically cause ischaemia by triggering mesenteric vasospasm. The pathophysiology of cocaine toxicity leading to ischaemic colonic injury via catecholamine induced mesenteric vasospasm is of a similar pathophysiology as cocaine induced coronary vasospasm causing myocardial infarction. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【18】Mesenteric vasospasm causing hypoperfusion and hypoxia leads to necrosis of the mucosal villi followed by transmural, mural or mucosal infarction. In response to injury, the intestinal walls initially become congested, subsequently appearing edematous, friable and haemorrhagic. As sloughing of infarcted mucosa occurs, there is increasing damage and exposure of bowel capillary vessels which in the late stage of colonic ischaemia presents with rectal bleeding.\n\n【19】The usual differential of rectal bleeding with abdominal pain includes infectious, inflammatory (Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis) or ischaemic. Ischaemic colitis is usually suspected in elderly patients, especially those with underlying cardiovascular disease. Cocaine use is a life-threatening cause of ischaemic colitis and should be included in the differential diagnosis of any patient presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. Patients with cocaine use associated colitis have a significantly higher mortality than patients with ischaemic colitis (26% vs 7.7%). 删除9：<u>10 </u>Cocaine colitis is an easily missed diagnosis and a history of illicit drug use and/or urine toxicology is a vital component of the diagnostic work-up.\n\n【20】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【21】Been doing coke all my life, this time I went heavy. I’ve tried stopping before, but you’d never understand how hard it is.\n\n【22】### Learning points\n\n【23】*   Cocaine colitis is an uncommon and easily missed aetiology of the acute abdomen and requires a high clinical suspicion for diagnosis.\n\n【24】*   Abdominal pain associated with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is an alarm symptom and requires urgent evaluation.\n\n【25】*   The usual differential diagnosis of rectal bleeding includes infectious, inflammatory or ischaemic. Clinicians should be aware of usual aetiologies in at-risk populations and promptly recognise cocaine toxicity as a cause of GI bleeding.\n\n【26】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【27】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【28】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:30:49", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:31:03", "cost": 13.791}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:31:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:30:49"}

Spontaneous bleeding or abnormal hemostasis in the perioperative period is reported to occur in approximately one-third of patients with AL amyloidosis. 删除9：<u>1 </u>The symptoms include purpura, petechial bleeding, bleeding during biopsy, gastrointestinal bleeding and cerebral bleeding. 删除9：<u>1–3 </u>Mechanisms of bleeding tendency have been mentioned to include decreased coagulation factor X activity, fibrinolytic activation, acquired von Willebrand disease, the appearance of inhibitors of fibrin polymerisation, decreased platelet aggregation with abnormal platelet function, vitamin K deficiency with malabsorption in the digestive tract, decreased hepatic synthetic coagulation factors with liver insufficiency and vascular fragility due to the deposition of amyloid protein. 删除9：<u>3–5 </u>The standard treatment approach for AL amyloidosis commonly involves using high-dose melphalan therapy combined with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation to achieve remission. However, symptomatic treatment alone is frequently employed in cases where the applicability of standard treatment is compromised by factors, including performance status, comorbidities or the extent of organ impairment. 删除9：<u>6–9</u>\n\n【8】Diagnosis of AL amyloidosis requires tissue biopsy 6–11 ; however, a bleeding tendency precludes tissue biopsy in some cases, 删除13：<u>3 </u>making the diagnosis difficult. Additionally, when the performance status of patients is impaired due to ageing or comorbidities, systemic therapy cannot be initiated in many cases. Therefore, a treatment that can control bleeding tendencies should be established.\n\n【9】We present the case of a patient with a history of bleeding tendency of unknown origin and report the possibility of tranexamic acid in effectively controlling bleeding tendency due to AL amyloidosis. 删除9：<u>12</u>\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A male patient in his 80s presented with comorbidities, including hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He had no history of bleeding tendency and no family history of coagulopathy. His drug history included oral candesartan cilexetil to treat hypertension. One year prior to hospital admission, he began to experience extensive subcutaneous haemorrhages in the extremities without any specific trigger. Anticoagulation therapy for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was discontinued, and he was placed under observation. One week before admission, his family found him immobile at the entrance of his house. He was taken to a district general hospital; after undergoing physical examination and investigation, a cerebral haemorrhage was diagnosed. Blood tests at the district hospital revealed prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). A CT scan of the head revealed subcortical bleeding in the left frontal lobe , whereas that of the trunk showed haematomas in the bilateral axillae . The severity of subcortical bleeding was determined to be 0 points on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale. The patient was referred to our hospital by the district general hospital to investigate the cause of the bleeding. Physical examination revealed multiple subcutaneous haemorrhages of the extremities, and haematomas of approximately 60 mm in diameter were palpable in the axillae on both sides. Neurological examination revealed no obvious motor or sensory abnormalities.\n\n【12】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【14】A high absorptive zone of approximately 28 mm found in the medial part of the left frontal lobe.</u>\n\n【15】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【16】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【17】A haematoma approximately 60 mm in diameter found in both axillae.</u>\n\n【18】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【19】Blood tests showed no abnormality in platelet count or bleeding time (leucocyte count, 6700/µL; haemoglobin, 11.7 g/dL and platelet count, 205 000/µL). Coagulation tests showed prolonged PT and aPTT (PT, 39.1%; international normalised ratio, 1.80 and aPTT, 68.7 s), and increased fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), thrombin-antithrombin-III complex (TAT) and plasmin-α2-plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC) (fibrinogen, 136.8 mg/dL; FDP, 6.6 µg/mL; TAT, 9.7 ng/mL and PIC, 10.3 µg/mL). The cross-mixing test of PT and aPTT showed a convex pattern on the bottom—suggesting a deficiency of coagulation factors—and measurement of coagulation factor activity showed decreased activity of coagulation factors II, V, IX and X (factor II, 60%; factor V, 32%; factor IX, 14% and factor X: 31%).\n\n【20】Other coagulation-related tests showed decreased plasminogen and antiplasmin activity (plasminogen activity, 12%; antiplasmin, 42%). Protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II and lupus anticoagulant were normal. Biochemical tests showed a decrease in the albumin/globulin ratio (albumin/globulin ratio, 0.44), serum protein electrophoresis showed IgG-λ type M protein and measurement of the free light chain (FLC) ratio showed a decrease in the κ/λ ratio (FLC κ, 31.3 mg/L; FLC λ, 删除13：<u>146 </u>mg/L and FLC κ/λ ratio, 0.21). Since no urinary Bence Jones protein was found, and bone marrow puncture showed an increase of 7.4% in abnormal plasma cells, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance was diagnosed.\n\n【21】We suspected AL amyloidosis as the cause of the bleeding tendency, and although no obvious amyloid deposition was noted in the fat tissue biopsy, biopsies of the duodenum and rectum revealed amyloid deposition . Additionally, the light chain immunostaining results led to the diagnosis of IgG λ type AL amyloidosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the myocardium revealed delayed contrast in the atrial septum, which was suspected to be a complication of cardiac amyloidosis. However, a myocardial biopsy could not be performed owing to the patient’s bleeding tendency. The cardiac function remained preserved, with no concurrent heart failure manifestations.\n\n【22】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【23】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【24】Pathology of the duodenal biopsy duodenal mucosa with apple green birefringence under polarised light microscopy. Left, H&E staining: ×100; right, congo red staining: ×400.</u>\n\n【25】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【26】In this case, amyloidosis was suggested as a differential diagnosis for the unexplained tendency towards bleeding. To assess amyloidosis, measurements were conducted using serum protein electrophoresis and the ratio of FLCs. IgG-λ type M protein was detected through serum protein electrophoresis. Furthermore, the presence of AL amyloidosis was suspected because of the observed increase in the ratio of FLCs. Bone marrow biopsy did not reveal the presence of abnormal plasma cells indicative of multiple myeloma. Although a biopsy of the abdominal wall fat was performed, no evident amyloid deposition was observed. However, amyloid deposition was observed in the tissue biopsies of the duodenum and rectum, leading to the diagnosis of systemic AL amyloidosis based on immunostaining results. Regarding the evaluation of other differential diseases, since the patient had no history of warfarin or heparin use, the differential diagnosis of bleeding tendency with prolonged PT and aPTT included hepatic failure, vitamin K deficiency, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acquired haemophilia. Moreover, coagulation factor deficiency due to hepatic amyloidosis was mentioned as a differential diagnosis; however, liver biopsy was difficult because of bleeding. Contrast-enhanced MRI showed no abnormal liver morphology, signals in the liver parenchyma, or hepatobiliary enzymes; therefore, hepatic amyloidosis was ruled out. Additionally, vitamin K deficiency was ruled out owing to the absence of elevated protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II levels. The patient’s platelet count did not decrease, and the probability of DIC was considered low. Acquired haemophilia was ruled out based on the results of the cross-mixing test. We further suspected the possibility of haemorrhagic symptoms due to AL amyloidosis.\n\n【27】Noting the elevation of PIC—a marker of the fibrinolytic system—and the decrease in plasminogen and antiplasmin activities (PIC, 10.3 µg/mL; plasminogen activity, 12% and antiplasmin, 42%), we suspected that the bleeding symptoms were caused by fibrinolytic activation due to AL amyloidosis.\n\n【28】删除3：<u>Figure 4 outlines this patient’s course from initial presentation to the final diagnosis.</u>\n\n【29】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【30】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【31】Outlines of patient’s course from initial presentation to the final diagnosis.</u>\n\n【32】Treatment\n---------\n\n【33】We considered treating the AL amyloidosis to achieve remission; however, the patient’s performance status was poor. Therefore, we decided that it would be difficult to initiate systemic therapy. Fortunately, no significant bleeding complications were observed until day 19 of hospitalisation; however, considering the reduced activity of coagulation factors, the occurrence of future bleeding was anticipated. Although four units of fresh-frozen plasma were administered on day 19 of hospitalisation to replenish coagulation factors, no improvement was observed in coagulation abnormalities or bleeding tendency. Owing to the elevated PIC and decreased activity of plasminogen and antiplasmin, we suspected fibrinolytic activation associated with AL amyloidosis. On hospitalisation day 21, the patient was started on tranexamic acid at 750 mg/day. Subsequently, bleeding tendency, abnormalities of fibrinolysis and coagulation and coagulation factor activity markedly improved (PT, 75.2%; international normalised ratio, 1.18; aPTT, 32.1 s; fibrinogen, 245.7 mg/dL; FDP, 5.9 µg/mL; TAT, 20.7 ng/mL; PIC, 3.34 µg/mL; plasminogen activity, 43%; antiplasmin, 81%; factor II, 76%; factor V, 66%; factor IX, 79% and factor X, 54%).\n\n【34】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【35】After initiating tranexamic acid therapy, the patient exhibited no bleeding tendency recurrence, such as new subcutaneous bleeding, and was discharged to a nursing facility on hospitalisation day 63. No bleeding symptoms were observed for 19 weeks after discharge from the hospital. Subsequently, the cerebral bleeding that was identified on hospitalisation progressed without the emergence of any new neurological findings until discharge. Additionally, no manifestation of heart failure symptoms was observed until discharge in relation to the suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【36】Discussion\n----------\n\n【37】In previous reports, hyperfibrinolysis, coagulation factor deficiency and platelet dysfunction have been found as possible mechanisms of bleeding tendency due to AL amyloidosis. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Fibrinolytic activation by AL amyloidosis has been proposed to be caused by the production of urokinase-type plasminogen activator by plasma cells, 删除13：<u>13 </u>activation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator on amyloid fibres 14 and degradation of activated factor Xa by plasmin and its degradation products, thereby promoting plasminogen activation. 删除9：<u>15 16</u>\n\n【38】Moreover, it has been reported that factor X may be deficient because of amyloid deposition, resulting in coagulation abnormalities 14 ; however, in this case, factor II, V, IX and X activities decreased. There have been no case reports of multiple reductions in coagulation factor activity and recovery of multiple coagulation factor activity after tranexamic acid administration, therefore highlighting the novelty of our case report. 删除9：<u>17</u>\n\n【39】In this case, fibrinolysis may have been activated by any of the abovementioned mechanisms. Tranexamic acid exerts its antifibrinolytic effect by inhibiting the adsorption of plasminogen to fibrin. 删除9：<u>18 </u>Therefore, it may be an effective option when bleeding symptoms are mainly due to hyperfibrinolysis, as in this patient’s case. Furthermore, the improvement in the activity of multiple coagulation factors was possibly because of the administration of tranexamic acid, and although the mechanism of this improvement is not yet clear from previous reports, this case may help to clarify the pathogenesis of bleeding tendency in AL amyloidosis.\n\n【40】Bleeding symptoms due to AL amyloidosis can be fatal, and invasive procedures are crucial to diagnose the disease; therefore, controlling bleeding symptoms is clinically critical. Furthermore, in cases where fibrinolysis activation due to AL amyloidosis is suspected in the background, prior administration of tranexamic acid may help to control bleeding symptoms and make an earlier diagnosis. Additionally, tranexamic acid can be introduced relatively easily and may be an effective symptomatic treatment in patients who cannot receive curative chemotherapy because of old age or comorbidities that reduce the patient’s performance status. For the same reason, tranexamic acid for bleeding tendency may be an effective option in palliative care at the end of AL amyloidosis.\n\n【41】It should be noted that administering tranexamic acid for fibrinolytic activation due to DIC may exacerbate organ damage and lead to fatal outcomes. 删除9：<u>19 </u>In our case, tranexamic acid was introduced after confirming no decrease in platelet counts suggestive of DIC. Therefore, tranexamic acid is an inexpensive and relatively safe drug that should be actively considered for this indication.\n\n【42】### Learning points\n\n【43】*   Amyloidosis should be considered a differential diagnosis for bleeding tendency of unknown cause.\n\n【44】*   Haemorrhagic symptoms due to immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis can be fatal; therefore, appropriate management is necessary.\n\n【45】*   In AL amyloidosis, the administration of tranexamic acid is an effective treatment when disseminated intravascular coagulation is negative, and some findings suggest fibrinolytic activation.\n\n【46】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【47】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【48】Consent obtained from next of kin.\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank Dr Shiro Miura for his significant contribution to the pathological diagnosis of this case.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:27:18", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:27:35", "cost": 17.432}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:27:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:27:17"}

The biggest problem may arise over the long term, as some patients have had reactions months or years following the procedure (it was 6 years in the case of our patient).\n\n【14】Pigment accumulates in the dermis and spreads across the intracellular space, causing haemorrhage, necrosis and inflammation that results in phagocytosis by skin macrophages.

Recurrent relapses result in increasing disability and, therefore, prompt and aggressive treatment is usually necessary. Pathogenic antibodies to aquaporin 4 (AQP4) are expressed in the majority of patients with NMOSD. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Rarely, AQP4-positive NMOSD can be a paraneoplastic phenomenon, usually driven by a solid tumour, and the timing between diagnosis of the neoplasm and NMOSD is variable. 删除9：<u>1 </u>We present a case of NMOSD, associated with an underlying follicular lymphoma.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A woman in her late 60s reported a 6-week history of progressive bilateral lower limb weakness, paraesthesia and numbness spreading proximally. She also noted a month of abdominal bloating and 1 kg of unintentional weight loss. Examination showed reduced power at hip flexion medical research council muscle power assessment grade 2/5 in the left and 3/5 in the right. Lower limb reflexes were absent and her plantars mute. There was a pinprick sensory level to T4 and impaired proprioception to the ankles. Upper limb and cranial nerve examination was normal. The remainder of her physical examination was normal.\n\n【10】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【11】An MRI of the spine showed longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis extending from C2 to T5, with associated swelling and cord expansion at T2 level . MRI brain was normal. Serum analysis was positive for anti-AQP4 antibodies and hepatitis B core antigen and negative for anti-MOG (Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) antibodies, HIV and syphilis serology. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed normal range white blood cells, lactate, no oligoclonal bands and no elevated immunoglobulins. A diagnosis of NMOSD was made, and as part of her further work up, CT imaging identified extensive para-aortic and pelvic side wall lymphadenopathy, a bulky multifibroid uterus and an adjacent enhancing nodule raising concern of an ovarian lesion. MRI pelvis showed fibroids, with well-visualised and normal appearing ovaries. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan showed an FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose)-avid conglomerate of lymph nodes in the left para-aortic, common iliac, internal iliac, external iliac, right supraclavicular and bilateral subpectoral regions. Subsequent histology of a CT-guided lymph node biopsy identified small to medium-sized lymphoid cells arranged in a vague nodular pattern. Immunohistochemistry showed lymphoid cells positive for CD20, CD79a, CD19, BCL-2, CD10 and BCL-6 and confirmed a low-grade follicular lymphoma. Cyclin-D1 was negative and Ki-67 stained less than 5% of all cells. The patient had a follicular lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI) score of 4 (based on age >60-years old, greater than four nodal sites, haemoglobin of <120 g/L and stage 3 disease).\n\n【12】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【14】(A–C) Sagittal MRI T2 weighted images of upper spine at different stages.

She had a poor clinical response and was transferred to a tertiary neurology centre for a 5-day course of plasma exchange. A repeat MRI spine 3 weeks after plasma exchange showed that the cord lesion had regressed and was visible from C4/5 to T5 , but there was no significant clinical recovery. On discussion between the haematology and neurology teams, it was concluded that the NMOSD was a likely paraneoplastic phenomenon and it was decided to treat the lymphoma, rather than manage her with active observation. Obinutuzumab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (O-CVP) immunochemotherapy was initiated.\n\n【17】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【18】She tolerated two cycles of O-CVP well and repeat neurological assessment performed prior to her third cycle showed an improvement in power (3/5 in hip flexion bilaterally), recovery in hallux proprioception, brisk lower limb reflexes and up-going plantar reflexes. Repeat imaging performed following the patient’s second cycle showed further regression of the longitudinal spinal cord signal change, being barely perceptible on repeat imaging .\n\n【19】During her admission, she received active rehabilitation and following her first cycle of treatment was transferred to an inpatient neurorehabilitation unit for ongoing therapy. Following her third cycle of O-CVP the patient developed neutropenic sepsis requiring an intensive care unit admission, after which no further cycles of treatment were given. A PET-CT scan performed 3 months following cessation of treatment showed a complete metabolic response of her follicular lymphoma and she was subsequently managed with an active observation strategy. Following recovery from neutropenic sepsis, she underwent a further 10 weeks in an inpatient neurorehabilitation unit before being discharged home, with ongoing community rehabilitation.\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are ‘neurological disorders that can affect any part of the nervous system, often presenting with stereotyped clinical manifestations, that occur in association with cancer and have an immune-medicated pathogenesis’. 删除9：<u>2 </u>AQP4 antibodies are defined as a ‘lower risk’ antibody for association with cancer, 删除13：<u>2 </u>and approximately 5% of patients with NMOSD are thought to have an underlying paraneoplastic cause. 删除9：<u>1 3</u>\n\n【22】Unlike some other types of PNS, existing reports of paraneoplastic NMOSD have identified no typical underlying malignancy. A wide range of malignancies have been reported, most commonly solid tumours, including breast and lung. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Patients with paraneoplastic NMOSD tend to be older at presentation (median age of 55 compared with 40) and are more likely to be men than in non-paraneoplastic NMOSD, although the majority in both groups remain women (29.4% vs 6.6%). 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【23】Rarely, paraneoplastic NMOSD has been reported in association with B-cell lymphomas. 删除9：<u>4–6 </u>Of these, there is one AQP-4 positive case described of suspected follicular lymphoma (where identification of the primary site was not possible). 删除9：<u>4 6 </u>In this case, the patient was treated with pulsed methylprednisolone before being commenced on R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy and, after two cycles, there was an improvement in cord inflammation, as shown via MRI, in serum AQP4 levels and in the patient’s symptoms.\n\n【24】Acute treatment of NMOSD involves high-dose steroids, with plasma exchange if required to achieve remission, followed by maintenance immunosuppression with oral immune modulatory agents such as azathioprine or rituximab. As with all paraneoplastic conditions, treatment is tailored to include treatment of the underlying malignancy. Follicular lymphoma treatment depends on the staging and whether the cancer is symptomatic and ranges from active observation to immunochemotherapy induction, followed by subsequent immunotherapy maintenance. Given that our patient had stage 3 follicular lymphoma, with neurological sequelae, treatment was warranted. The FLIPI score is used to guide treatment decisions. The GALLIUM trial, a phase III open-label randomised control trial has shown that in patients with a high risk of premature mortality (FLIPI ≥2), obinutuzumab increases progression-free survival, although with an unclear effect on long-term survival, 删除13：<u>7 </u>and has subsequently been approved by the national institute of clinical excellence (NICE) for treatment in this group.\n\n【25】Our patient met the requirements for treatment with obinutuzumab with chemotherapy. While rituximab has a well-characterised role in NMOSD treatment, the decision was made to treat with O-CVP as we felt that the neurological sequelae would be better controlled with aggressive lymphoma control, and we were reassured by the common target of both monoclonal antibodies (CD20 inhibition). Furthermore, obinutuzumab is a type II CD20 antibody, which differs from rituximab, a type I CD20 antibody, resulting in enhanced antibody-dependent and complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【26】An additional consideration was the site of B-cell activity in NMOSD and whether the drugs can cross the blood–brain barrier. PNS can be the result of epitope expression by the cancer, or by autoantibody production. Unfortunately, we did not have the facilities available to determine which was the mechanism driving anti-AQP4 in our patient. However, regardless of the underlying mechanism, the pathogenesis of NMO is well understood. AQP4 is a water channel highly abundant in the central nervous system, particularly in the end-feet of glial cells bordering the blood–brain barrier. Antibodies to this protein cause blood–brain barrier disruption, inflammation and often damage to the surrounding neurons. It is an ongoing question of research whether anti-AQP4 antibodies are produced intrathecally or within the blood, and studies indicate that blood production is more likely. 删除9：<u>9 </u>This peripheral anti-AQP4 production, together with blood–brain barrier disruption in NMO, suggests that a requirement to cross an intact blood–brain barrier is not required for NMO therapies. Consistent with this, there is evidence that rituximab is not effective at crossing the blood–brain barrier. 删除9：<u>10 </u>There are no studies to date on the ability of obinutuzumab to do so.\n\n【27】In summary, this case of follicular lymphoma associated with AQP-4-positive NMO reinforces the importance of looking for a neoplastic process in patients with NMOSD; particularly those who are older. While prior case reports have demonstrated the use of rituximab in treating patients with this association, we report the efficacy in this case of using an alternative treatment strategy with an obinutuzumab chemotherapy-based regime, in paraneoplastic NMOSD.\n\n【28】### Learning points\n\n【29】*   Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) can rarely be a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome.\n\n【30】*   Although unusual, the underlying cancer responsible can include follicular lymphoma.\n\n【31】*   A high index of suspicion is needed to identify patients with paraneoplastic NMOSD, which is more likely in elderly patients.\n\n【32】*   Treatment of our patient’s NMOSD, by treating the underlying follicular lymphoma with obinutuzumab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone, resulted in a good radiological and neurological outcome.\n\n【33】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【34】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【35】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:27:45", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:28:05", "cost": 20.369}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:28:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:27:45"}

In the USA, this has been achieved through operation Warp speed, a partnership between various governmental/regulatory and private entities, that oversaw the accelerated development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines. 删除9：<u>2 </u>This led to rapid development and subsequent emergency use authorisation (EUA) of the two messanger RNA (mRNA) vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) and one viral vector vaccine (Johnson & Johnson Janssen). 删除9：<u>3–5 </u>Subsequently, Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine received full Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for individuals 16 years of age and older. 删除9：<u>6 </u>The trial data for both mRNA vaccines have shown more than 90% efficacy without significant safety concerns. 删除9：<u>7 8 </u>Our case suggests a possible need for closer monitoring of people receiving COVID 19 mRNA vaccines with underlying autoimmune conditions and/or polyneuropathy\n\n【6】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【7】A middle age male physician and first-line healthcare provider with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, migraine and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) presented with paresthesia and motor weakness in all four extremities. He had been diagnosed with EGPA associated with polyneuropathy 10 years ago. At the time, he had a classic presentation of new-onset asthma, rhinosinusitis, rash and polyneuropathy. Sural nerve biopsy had findings suggestive of vasculitis. He was treated with mycophenolate mofetil for 2 years and glucocorticoids for 3 years. He had been in remission and off any treatment for vasculitis or neuropathy for past 7 years. At baseline, the patient is physically active and did not have any neuropathic symptoms except for mild sensitivity to cold in the left forearm. He was taking linagliptin/metformin XR, losartan, hydrochlorothiazide, rosuvastatin and pregabalin (for migraine prophylaxis).\n\n【8】The day after receiving the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), he developed a severe influenza-like illness with temperature of 101 °F and body aches. On third day, he went to emergency room, where tests for COVID-19 PCR and influenza were negative. He had mild leucocytosis at 10.24×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (3.98×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L to 9.57 k/uL) and the eosinophil count slightly increased to 0.94 k/uL (0.00 k/uL to 0.50 k/uL). The Influenza-like symptoms resolved over the next day. However, on day 5 postvaccination, he noticed symmetric heaviness and tiredness of both forearms. He also had associated clumsiness of both hands with reduced dexterity. The repeat lab tests at his primary care physicians office revealed normalisation of white cell count and eosinophil count. Erythrocyte sedimentaion rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) were normal. Antineutrophil antibody (ANA) and antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) were negative. Over the next week, his symptoms continued to worsen. His exertional capacity had a significant decline. On day 12 postvaccination, he noticed weakness of the left side of body. At this point, he was admitted to the hospital. His neurological examination revealed asymmetric findings. Motor strength of right side was 5-/5 for deltoid and hip muscles (adductors and abductors). Motor strength on left side ranged from 4/5 to 5/5 in deltoid, triceps, hip muscles (flexors, adductors and abductors) and ankle muscles (dorsiflexors and planter flexors). Left pectoral and both ankle reflexes were absent. He also had reduced pin prick sensation in an asymmetric pattern (bilateral anterior thighs and left medial calf). The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratories revealed normal complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, urine analysis, ESR and CRP. ANA and ANCA remained negative. Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 7.8% (6.8% 6 months ago). MRI of lumbar and thoracic spine was unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were normal (red blood cell 0/mm <sup>3 </sup> , white blood cells 0.002×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, protein 31 mg/dL). Details of labs and work up are outlined in ( tables 1 and 2 ). Due to concern for immune-mediated recrudescence of polyneuropathy, the patient was started on pulse dose steroids with solumedrol 1 g/day intravenously for 3 days with some improvement in strength and reappearance of both ankle reflexes. He was discharged on 1 mg/kg prednisone daily to follow-up with neuromuscular specialist for nerve conduction velocity (NCV)/electromyography (EMG) studies. However, 删除13：<u>3 </u>days later, the patient presented to emergency department (ED) again with blurring of vision in both eyes and worsening weakness of left upper and lower extremities. He was evaluated by neurology, which confirmed worsening of strength of his left upper and lower extremity similar to the hospital admission few days ago. Vision in both eyes was noted to be 20/50 (baseline 20/20) without any visual field deficits. MRI of the brain and orbit was unremarkable. Blurring of vision was thought to be secondary to lens oedema due to glucocorticoids and fluctuations in blood sugars. He received another dose of 1 g solumedrol and was discharged to follow-up with outpatient neurologist to get NCV/EMG. He was seen by a retina specialist and eye examination was unremarkable with no evidence of optic neuritis or vasculitis. Over the next couple of days, patient started having significant neuropathic pain in the left arm, forearm and thighs. Follow-up with the neurologist revealed similar asymmetric motor weakness same as the recent ED visit along with new finding of mild left foot drop.\n\n【9】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【10】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【11】Laboratory tests on presentation</u>\n\n【12】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 2\n\n【14】Additional laboratory studies</u>\n\n【15】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【16】*   MRI of the brain, orbits and spine (cervical, thoracic and lumbar) was unremarkable.\n\n【17】*   NCV/EMG was suggestive of mild chronic denervation in the left upper and lower extremities but no acute findings.\n\n【18】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【19】### EGPA relapse\n\n【20】At the time of initial EGPA diagnosis, patients’ neurological symptoms had some similarities with current symptoms, that is, heaviness of both arms with loss of dexterity, followed by motor weakness and pain. However, there were some notable differences such as weakness and paresthesia were symmetric with a monophasic pattern unlike the asymmetry and fluctuations noted at this presentation. Also, left foot drop is a new finding this time. Second, at the time of original diagnosis, patient had associated symptoms of rhinosinusitis over months, new-onset asthma and maculopapular rash on palms, which were not present this time. Given differences in pattern of symptoms, lack of other associated symptoms and unremarkable laboratory studies (normal or near-normal eosinophils, ESR, CRP and negative ANCA), EGPA relapse was deemed unlikely.\n\n【21】### Guillain-Barre syndrome\n\n【22】The patient’s clinical picture that started as paresthesia and progressed to asymmetric patchy motor weakness did not fit Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). CSF studies and MRI of the spinal cord were unremarkable. Moreover, patient responded to steroids.\n\n【23】### Diabetic mononeuropathy multiplex\n\n【24】Mononeuropathy multiplex has been described in the literature as a rare and atypical complication of diabetes. There are a few case reports describing this condition. It is usually seen in patients with mildly elevated HbA1c and has a subacute onset. Electrodiagnostic studies are usually abnormal and suggestive of axonal degeneration. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Rapid onset of symptoms and unremarkable NCV/EMB made diabetic mononeuropathy multiplex less likely.\n\n【25】### Final diagnosis\n\n【26】Given the close temporal relationship after receiving the first dose of COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine and lack of alternative explanation it was concluded that this patient likely had a reaction to Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine leading to recrudescence of underlying asymptomatic polyneuropathy.\n\n【27】Treatment\n---------\n\n【28】Following the pulse dose steroids in hospital, patient remained in 1 mg/kg prednisone daily for 2 weeks. After follow-up with neurologist, prednisone dose was tapered every 5–7 days until a 10 mg/day dose was reached and then slowly tapered off over next 5 months.\n\n【29】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【30】The patient sought opinions from two different referral centres. He was evaluated by a neuromuscular/neuroimmunologist at a national referral centre via telemedicine and was later seen by another neuromuscular specialist at a local referral centre. A repeat NCV/EMG, done 1 week after the first one, revealed similar results without any signs of progression. It was thought that either the injury was not significant enough to show up on NCV/EMG studies or perhaps it was still too early to see the changes. A nerve biopsy was deferred as it was considered low yield and patient had already undergone sural nerve biopsy on left side which was predominantly affected this time also.\n\n【31】Over the next few months, he had slow improvement in his symptoms and started rehabilitation. His vision and neuropathic pain have improved. He was unable to work for first 2 months following which he returned to work with limited duties. Now 9 months since receiving the vaccine, he continues to make slow recovery with rehabilitation and is performing nearly full duties.\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】Vaccines are among the most effective tools in prevention of infectious diseases. On the other hand, vaccines themselves can be associated with various kinds of adverse reactions, including neurological adverse events like GBS, multiple sclerosis, neuritis and small fibre neuropathy. 删除9：<u>7 8 </u>Various pathophysiological theories have been proposed to explain the autoimmune adverse events after receiving vaccines, including molecular mimicry, immune-mediated bystander activation, immune-mediated hypersensitivity to the solvents/adjuvants 10 and inflammatory damage. 删除9：<u>11 </u>However, the rarity of such events and variable latency period makes it extremely difficult to ascertain causality and provide an accurate pathophysiological explanation, 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【34】During this unprecedented time of the COVID-19 pandemic, the development and EUA of the vaccines has brought great hope. There were few significant safety concerns during the trials for the two mRNA vaccines. Higher rate of local reactions was noted with both the mRNA vaccines but were not significant. Incidence of systemic reactions with fatigue, headache and fever (influenza like illness) was also higher in vaccine groups. These were mild with the first dose, but a significant number of participants had more severe systemic reaction after the second dose of both vaccines. There were no significant adverse events, including hypersensitivity reactions with either vaccine. 删除9：<u>12 13 </u>Few cases of Bell’s were reported during the trials, which were considered to be incidental and not related to vaccines. 删除9：<u>14 15 </u>There is lack of safety data in certain populations like pregnant women or immunocompromised patients who were not included in trials. Subgroup data for those with underlying autoimmune conditions who were included in trials are not available. While autoimmune dysregulation is thought to play a role in various complications associated with COVID-19 infection, 删除13：<u>16 </u>there have been no confirmed reports of autoimmune or neurological adverse events with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines so far.\n\n【35】The need and importance of vaccines against COVID-19 to help control the current pandemic and reduce incidence of severe illness cannot be emphasised enough. To date, more than 255 million people have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccines and greater than 218 million people are fully vaccinated in USA. 删除9：<u>17 </u>However, when vaccinating millions of people, emergence of new adverse events not seen during the clinical trials with its fewer patients is not entirely unexpected. Such events require further investigation to determine a relationship to the vaccine versus simply coincidental occurrences. For example, allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and inflammation of the heart (myocarditis and pericarditis) have been found to be adverse events in vaccinated individuals not seen during clinical trials with both the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. 删除9：<u>18–20 </u>Similarly, an increased risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome has been suggested with the use Johnson & Johnson Janssen viral vector vaccine in adult women younger than age 50. 删除9：<u>21</u>\n\n【36】Currently, CDC recommends that people with autoimmune conditions may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series along with an additional dose 28 days after completing an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series. 删除9：<u>22 </u>Additionally, a booster dose is recommended for a subset of high-risk population who have received Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine at least 6 months after completing the series. 删除9：<u>23</u>\n\n【37】Our case may represent an isolated occurrence as an individual’s personal predisposition, medical history, genetics and environmental factors play a role in their susceptibility to autoimmune reactions. While a temporal relationship with receiving the vaccine may indicate an association, it cannot determine causality without any definitive proof of diagnosis, especially when other possible conditions (eg, EGPA, diabetic neuropathy, etc) can also have similar findings. However, this case perhaps suggests a need of closer monitoring of patients with autoimmune conditions and/or neuropathies receiving COVID-19 mRNA vaccines until more data are available. Both CDC and vaccine companies have reporting systems in place for such events, 删除13：<u>24 25 </u>where this case has been reported as well.\n\n【38】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【39】Being a physician, I have been providing care to hospitalised patients with COVID-19 on daily basis. As pandemic was reaching its peak, the capacity of healthcare services was stretched thin. It became more important than ever that healthcare providers remain available and help out despite the risks. Hence, the decision to get the COVID-19 vaccine was quite straightforward. The recurrence of my neuropathies after getting vaccine was unfortunate and brought back some traumatic memories of a very difficult time in the past. Being unable to perform usual daily activities and inability to work when it was most needed (for months) was quite devastating. Such an illness can also take a huge toll on the loved ones providing care to patients. I feel extremely blessed to have a family that have stood by me with such undying love. I am grateful for the care from my physicians. I am also thankful for my employers for their support during this difficult time. Although I hope for a full recovery in the future, the uncertainty regarding health and ability to fully perform my job is nerve wracking. As a physician and a front-line healthcare provider who wishes for this pandemic to be over soon, I certainly believe in the importance and need of vaccines against COVID-19 despite the adverse reaction that I suffered.\n\n【40】### Learning points\n\n【41】*   Vaccines can have unintended direct or indirect effects, which should be monitored closely.\n\n【42】*   Adverse events after vaccinations require extensive investigation to determine any association and causality.\n\n【43】*   Closer monitoring of patients with autoimmune conditions and/or neuropathies may be warranted to rule out any trends until more data are available regarding the use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in this population.\n\n【44】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【45】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【46】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Dr Mathew Feldman for his guidance regarding vaccine related adverse events.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:48:53", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:49:22", "cost": 28.893}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:49:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:48:53"}

Four years prior, he was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. According to his family, he had been ill for 3 days, complaining of nausea, abdominal pain and having diarrhoea. While feeling unwell, had not been using insulin therapy. Since 1 day, he had vomited repeatedly, developed laboured breathing and became increasingly lethargic. He had not experienced fever, coughing or haematemesis, or reported of chest pain or pain when swallowing. He had no other medical history or history of trauma.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】Physical examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale of 13 (E3M6V4). Kussmaul breathing pattern was present with a frequency of 35 bpm. He was tachycardic and had a systolic blood pressure of 79 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of 60 mm Hg. In the chest and neck region, subcutaneous emphysema was felt. Thoracic excursions were symmetric and no tracheal deviation was detected. Breathing sounds were heard bilaterally with inspiratory crepitations on the right lower side of the chest. Heart sounds were normal and no distended jugular veins or Kussmaul’s sign were observed.\n\n【14】Laboratory analysis of his blood showed a glucose of 48 mmol/L (864 mg/dL), Na+ 117 mmol/L, K+ 6.0 mmol/L, Cl− 86 mmol/L, creatinine 196 umol/L, albumin 41.8 g/L, c-reactive protein 296 mg/L, white cell count of 37×10 <sup>9/L </sup> and an arterial blood gas with a pH of 6.84, pO2 of 8.1 kPa (61 mm Hg), pCO2 of 2.2 kPa (17 mm Hg), HCO3− of 2.9 mmol/L and lactate of 1.5 mmol/L. The effective osmolality was calculated to be 282 mOsm/L. The anion gap was 28 mEq/L, providing a delta anion gap/delta HCO3- ratio approximating one. Urine analysis confirmed ketonuria. His ECG showed a sinus tachycardia without ST-segment deviations or T-wave alterations. Respiratory virus PCR testing of COVID-19 and influenza were negative.\n\n【15】A chest X-ray showed subcutaneous emphysema at the upper chest and radiolucent streaks outlining the heart and aortic arch, indicating a pneumomediastinum . Additionally, there were consolidations in the right lower lobe and behind the heart. A CT scan without intravenous contrast material of his chest and neck was made to evaluate the extent of the pneumomediastinum and whether airway or oesophageal injury was present . Pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium were seen without evidence of rib fractures, tracheal or oesophageal injury. Air extended superiorly from between the clavicles to the cranial base and was also visible in the epidural space of the spinal canal. No pneumothorax was present. Aspiration pneumonia was suggested by the combined findings of gastric dilatation, stasis of gastric content in the lower half of the oesophagus and consolidations in the lower lobes of both lungs.\n\n【16】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【17】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【18】Anteroposterior chest X-ray (upper image) with a corresponding coronal CT image (lower left image) and illustration (lower right image).

The DKA may have been precipitated by a (viral) gastroenteritis or respiratory infection and worsened by discontinuation of insulin therapy.\n\n【27】The pneumomediastinum resulted from his laboured breathing, retching and vomiting, increasing alveolar pressure and causing alveolar rupture. Oesophageal rupture was unlikely as the patient did not experience fever, had no history of chest pain or pain when swallowing and had a CT-scan without oesophageal wall thickening, periesophageal fat stranding and effusions. Although the lower posterior mediastinum contained air, we regarded this to be of alveolar origin spreading diffusely into all mediastinal compartments, rather than originating from the oesophageal lumen.\n\n【28】We considered using fluoroscopic oesophagography to rule out oesophageal rupture, but at the time of presentation the fluoroscopy suite and qualified technologist were unavailable. Also, due to his reduced consciousness and gastroparesis, drinking contrast material would have risked further aspiration. CT oesophagography was not performed, as there were no standardised protocols in place.\n\n【29】Treatment\n---------\n\n【30】Treatment of his pneumomediastinum was supportive with antiemetics and close monitoring for complications. The DKA was treated according to national protocols. 删除9：<u>11 </u>We initiated intravenous antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and placed a nasogastric tube to resolve gastric retention. This tube was seen to be positioned correctly on X-ray imaging and no bloody gastric content was aspirated.\n\n【31】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【32】After 2 days of insulin therapy, the blood pH and anion gap had normalised. He remained haemodynamically stable without the use of vasopressors, seemingly confirming the absence of an oesophageal rupture.\n\n【33】Despite high-flow oxygen therapy, blood oxygen levels deteriorated and work of breathing increased. Intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was started. A chest CT with intravenous contrast material was repeated to evaluate the presence of mediastinal abscesses and the extent of the pneumomediastinum. It showed a clear reduction of mediastinal air and subcutaneous emphysema . New consolidations had developed in the apical segments. Our patient was later diagnosed with bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and treated with voriconazole. His stool culture was negative for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens.\n\n【34】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【35】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【36】Axial chest CT images without intravenous contrast from admission (left two images) and with intravenous contrast after 7 days (right two images).

Rarely hypotension is caused by an increased mediastinal pressure compressing the heart and great vessels, known as a ‘tension pneumomediastinum’. 删除9：<u>16 </u>Cardiac tamponade from accumulation of air has also been described. 删除9：<u>18</u>\n\n【50】Different diagnostic modalities were used to evaluate oesophageal rupture in patients with DKA and pneumomediastinum 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>. Among 51 patients, 删除13：<u>33 </u>had chest CT, 删除13：<u>12 </u>had fluoroscopic esophagography and 8 received both. Only six patients had upper endoscopy.\n\n【51】Contrary to fluoroscopic esophagography, CT is readily available in most hospitals and may, in the absence of oesophageal rupture, provide an alternative cause of pneumomediastinum. 删除9：<u>9 </u>CT findings suggestive of oesophageal rupture are wall discontinuity and thickening, increased periesophageal fat stranding, mediastinal and pleural effusions and subdiaphragmatic air. 删除9：<u>19–21 </u>Two retrospective cohort studies showed that in the absence of these findings, chest CT had a 100% negative predictive value for oesophageal rupture. 删除9：<u>22 23 </u>In patients with a negative chest CT, subsequent fluoroscopic esophagography would not show oesophageal contrast extravasation and they were managed without endoscopy or surgery. These findings should be interpreted with caution given the rare outcome, with only 24 out of 206 patients having a surgically, endoscopically or fluoroscopically proven oesophageal perforation. 删除9：<u>22 23</u>\n\n【52】When using chest CT for investigating oesophageal rupture, radiologists often use intravenous contrast material to enhance visualisation of the oesophageal wall, mediastinal and pleural abscesses. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Addition of intravenous contrast did not improve diagnostic performance or interobserver agreement in the aforementioned studies. 删除9：<u>22 23 </u>Our patient received chest CTs with and without intravenous contrast material, providing similar results. However, if no contraindications exist (eg, iodine allergy, renal failure), we suggest adding intravenous contrast material to increase the demarcation of the oesophageal wall and improve the detection of mediastinal pathology. In our institution, we use non-ionic contrast agents (80 mL of iomeron 300 mg/mL) with a 40 s scan delay. Similar CT protocols are used in other institutions. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【53】CT esophagography combines the use of oral contrast with chest CT. 删除9：<u>9 </u>The patient may lie supine while contrast is administered into the upper oesophagus through a tube inserted at the level of the cricopharyngeal sphincter. No fluoroscopy suite is needed. The addition of oral contrast material increases the positive predictive value of chest CT and provides the exact location of the oesophageal defect. 删除9：<u>22</u>\n\n【54】This case report illustrates the diagnostic challenge of investigating the presence of oesophageal rupture in patients with DKA and pneumomediastinum. Although data are limited, we consider chest CT with intravenous contrast as the diagnostic modality of choice. We think that fluoroscopic esophagography is impractical and, in case of a negative CT, of no added value. If doubt remains after negative CT, we recommend CT esophagography. In all cases of suspected oesophageal rupture, we advise that imaging is interpreted by an experienced radiologist, given the rarity of its occurrence.\n\n【55】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【56】The first author translated the patient’s perspective.\n\n【57】I was feeling ill 3 days prior to admission. It was the first time I experienced this kind of weakness. Like my organs were not functioning properly. I was vomiting continuously and was unsure whether to use my insulin. I cannot recall if I used it or not. The last thing I remember is trying to get to my general practitioner. I do not have any recollection of being in the ambulance, emergency department or intensive care unit.\n\n【58】Once I woke up, it was hard to tell my dreams apart from reality. My surroundings felt very surreal. I am glad my friends and family were present the first days after I was off the ventilator. They were the only thing familiar to me in this world of machines. Together with the doctors and nurses, they repeatedly explained to me what had happened. I had been in the intensive care unit for several weeks. I could not believe it at first, but my mother had taken pictures of my time there.\n\n【59】My physical recovery was expeditious. I trained daily with the physiotherapist in the hospital and only stayed shortly at the rehabilitation centre. However, the challenging part was the mental recovery. I would like to advise doctors and nurses in the intensive care unit to take special care of patients the moment they regain consciousness. In my case, the presence of my family members and friends made a huge difference and reduced my anxiety significantly.\n\n【60】My time in the hospital and the recovery afterwards made me more aware of my diabetes. I started to read on nutrition and use my glucose sensor regularly. Previously, I never expected that my diabetes could make me this sick. Sometimes I wonder whether the fungus in my lungs was with me all this time, even before I was put in the intensive care unit.\n\n【61】The patient was asked to comment on his chest computed tomography images showing a pneumomediastinum.\n\n【62】The doctor (SZ) tells me the amount of air in my chest, but outside of my lungs, was visually impressive, but I do not remember having any issues of chest pain, shortness of breath or feeling air bubbles underneath my skin. My mother told me she felt the air bubbles when I was in the intensive care unit. Currently I do not have chest pain or problems when eating or drinking.\n\n【63】### Learning points\n\n【64】*   Pneumomediastinum is an uncommon complication of diabetic ketoacidosis and may occur spontaneously and rarely secondary to oesophageal rupture.\n\n【65】*   Mediastinal air may spread to adjacent tissue, resulting in pneumopericardium, subcutaneous emphysema in the upper chest and neck, and air in the spinal canal.\n\n【66】*   Chest CT is the preferred diagnostic modality for investigating secondary causes of pneumomediastinum, as it is widely available, easy to perform and has a high sensitivity for oesophageal rupture.\n\n【67】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【68】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【69】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We wish to acknowledge the Alrijne Academy for their support of research endeavours by students or early career researchers from the Alrijne Zorggroep.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:25:26", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:26:14", "cost": 47.931}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:26:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:25:25"}

Type IIIb temporomandibular disorder involves anterior dislocation of the articular disk, trismus and difficult intubation. A 68-year-old woman was scheduled for colectomy. The day before surgery, the patient had temporomandibular pain. On examination, the mouth opening was 13 mm. We diagnosed type IIIb temporomandibular disorder. A simple splint was fabricated with gauze and she bit it. The mouth opening was 55 mm on the day of surgery. The pain disappeared, and intubation was uneventful.

Indeed, it is important to evaluate the condition of the oral cavity prior to intubation.\n\n【8】Sufficient mouth opening is required for safe tracheal intubation. Type IIIb temporomandibular disorders may cause trismus, making intubation difficult. As deaths due to trismus after induction of anaesthesia have been already reported, we should develop strategies to manage difficult intubation cases. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Especially, it is safer to perform general anaesthesia after improving trismus.\n\n【9】Colorectal cancer is a slow-growing cancer, but the prognosis worsens if initial treatment is delayed. 删除9：<u>2 </u>It has been reported that it takes approximately 4 months on average for temporomandibular disorders to be completely cured. 删除9：<u>3 </u>It is not realistic to prioritise the treatment of temporomandibular disorders to ensure safe intubation in patients with colon cancer who develop such disorders.\n\n【10】A patient requiring orotracheal intubation needs improvement of a trismus before undergoing surgical procedures to do it safely. The disorder can be managed with simple treatment methods implemented by dental anaesthesiologists in general hospitals without dentistry departments.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 68-year-old woman was diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer, and laparoscopic colectomy was planned for the next day. The day before surgery, she had left temporomandibular joint pain and difficulty in opening her mouth fully. The opening excursion was 13 mm. We confirmed the mouth opening and closing position using radiography (Schuller’s method) . Bone ankyloses were not observed and there was no clicking. When palpated, there was no pain or inflammation around the temporomandibular joint.\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【15】Schuller’s radiographic method (left temporomandibular joint).

The periodontal disease and the deviated occlusal diameter were thought to have caused anterior dislocation of the articular disk. We hypothesised that an overload was subsequently being applied to one of the temporomandibular joints.\n\n【17】We diagnosed the patient with type IIIb temporomandibular disorder. Therefore, a simple splint was created to manage this disorder. As there were no materials for producing a splint in our hospital, gauze was used as a simple splint to raise the bite . The patient was instructed to use the splint at all times, except when eating and drinking.\n\n【18】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【19】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【20】Splint with gauze (jaw model). In this case, a method similar to a pivot splint was used, in which the molars were raised mainly with gauze.</u>\n\n【21】The mouth opening was 55 mm on the day of surgery. The pain disappeared and intubation was not problematic.\n\n【22】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【23】The disorders that could cause sudden trismus are the following: pseudogout, gout, tetanus, mandibular fracture and temporomandibular disorder type IIIb. The patient had no history of pseudogout or gout, no limb spasms, and there was no inflammation around the temporomandibular joint. There were no signs of face traumas, and the fracture could not be confirmed on radiographic findings. The patient had previously been aware of a click when opening the mouth. It was diagnosed that temporomandibular disorder type IIIa was developed to type IIIb.\n\n【24】Treatment\n---------\n\n【25】A makeshift dental splint was fabricated out of gauze and worn by the patient at all times, except when eating and drinking.\n\n【26】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【27】The mouth opening was 55 mm on the day of surgery and the pain had resolved. Tracheal intubation for colectomy was performed safely and without incident.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Here, we present a case, in which a dental anaesthesiologist treated a patient with type IIIb temporomandibular joint disease and trismus 1 day before colectomy using a simple splint.\n\n【30】Treatment of temporomandibular disorder type IIIb includes drug administration, manipulation, mobilisation, splints and surgery. Drug therapy was considered unnecessary because there was no evidence of inflammation. Manipulation and mobilisation were avoided in this case because the patient’s teeth were in poor condition because of periodontal disease. Surgical treatment was avoided because it was very invasive and could have affected the treatment of rectal cancer.\n\n【31】A splint was selected for this case. This treatment was decided based on our previous experience of using a splint for treating a patient with acute temporomandibular disorder type IIIb, wherein improvement was seen in 1 day. The cure was possible in 1 day because it was treated early in the acute phase; especially, it may have taken much time in the chronic phase.\n\n【32】Splints used to treat temporomandibular disorders include stabilisation, repositioning and pivot splints. Stabilisation or pivot splints are used often for type IIIb temporomandibular disorders. In this case, a method similar to a pivot splint was used, in which the molars were raised mainly with gauze. We did not use a stabilisation splint because it covers the front teeth and puts a burden on the front teeth of patients with periodontal disease. Repositioning splints are used to stabilise the jaw after manipulation. The latter is difficult with a gauze splint.\n\n【33】Manipulation is effective in cases of trismus in emergencies, such as after induction of anaesthesia. This method rapidly improves trismus. It is effective for emergency response because the degree of opening is improved after a single procedure. The response to splint treatment is generally slower than the response to manipulation. It cannot be used for emergency locking. However, because it slowly works on the temporomandibular joint, it is less invasive and has fewer complications. If trismus is attributed to temporomandibular disorder type IIIb, muscle relaxants are not effective because the disk limits jaw movement. It is very important to work on creating a space between the mandibular fossa and the condyle and to return the articular disk. Healthcare practitioners involved in airway management may need to learn manipulation which may reduce complications caused by hypoxia.\n\n【34】In this case, we performed gauze splint treatment because of the urgent need for colorectal cancer surgery. The surgery can be performed with spinal or epidural anaesthesia, but it is not always 100% effective compared with general anaesthesia. Therefore, there is a possibility of switching to general anaesthesia during the surgical procedure. Switching to general anaesthesia for management presents a high risk of breathing only with a mask for a long time.\n\n【35】Safe intubation through the nose is also possible in the awake state; however, it might be difficult for an inexperienced surgeon because of increased secretions in the pharynx caused by nasal bleeding and irritation during the insertion of the tracheal tube. Repeated intubation can increase the chance of complications and cause hypoxia. 删除9：<u>4 </u>If the operator is not familiar with these procedures, tracheal intubation should be selected from the beginning.\n\n【36】Anaesthetic management of patients with trismus has been reported to be difficult. 删除9：<u>5–7 </u>Preoperative evaluation and management of trismus are important. Preoperative evaluation can reduce problems related to temporomandibular disorders. 删除9：<u>8 </u>If a dentist had been consulted prior to surgery and trismus was managed/prevented, patient troubles may have been prevented. If a patient can open the mouth before the operation, anaesthesia could be performed more safely than awake nasotracheal intubation and tracheostomy.\n\n【37】In a questionnaire regarding oral injuries, 80.5% of the respondents had experienced dental injuries. 删除9：<u>9 </u>In patients with temporomandibular joint disorders, where intubation is required, precise evaluation of the oral cavity by a dentists is highly advisable. 删除9：<u>10</u>\n\n【38】If a problem occurs in the oral cavity, the initial response can be handled swiftly by a dental anaesthesiologist. Therefore, we suggest that a dental anaesthesiologist should be available in general hospitals without a dentistry department.\n\n【39】### Learning points\n\n【40】*   Difficult intubations can lead to adverse events during surgery and, ultimately, to death.\n\n【41】*   A simple splint was used to manage a type IIIb temporomandibular disorder and allow safe intubation for colectomy.\n\n【42】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【43】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【44】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I would like to thank Ko Ito associate professor Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan to gave me advice on how to treat temporomandibular disorders.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:28:18", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:28:32", "cost": 14.475}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:28:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:28:18"}

The symptomatology of post-COVID-19 syndrome bears significant resemblance to several other postinfectious syndromes such as those that follow Lyme disease, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Zika infection, as well as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), fibromyalgia and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). 删除9：<u>7–19 </u>Currently, not much is known about the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 syndrome, but previous data from other related syndromes suggest immune dysregulation as a central cause that can lead to alteration in brain activity as measured on functional imaging. 删除9：<u>20–22 </u>To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive case report of detailed findings including abnormal PET brain imaging in the evaluation of a patient with post-COVID-19 syndrome at this time point.\n\n【6】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【7】A middle-aged woman with a medical history significant only for hypothyroidism presented to a tertiary medical centre for evaluation of a 9-month history of persistent headache, dyspnoea on exertion, chest pressure, tachycardia, anosmia, parosmia, myalgia, vertigo and fatigue that started after an occupational infection with COVID-19. Shortly following her exposure to COVID-19, which occurred during an occupational exposure in December 2020, she had initial symptoms of fever, dyspnoea, cough, anosmia, fatigue and dysgeusia, as well as rhinorrhoea and left eye pain similar to sinusitis. She was not admitted at this time but was prescribed a 3-week course of dexamethasone. Since that time, her anosmia had continued with the addition of parosmias of burning or foul odour. She continued to experience significant fatigue that ultimately decreased her exercise tolerance and was accompanied by brain fog, chest pressure, dyspnoea on exertion and tachycardia with minimal activity. She noted a decline in cognitive function including short-term memory deficits and an inability to multitask. In January 2021, she awoke with severe dizziness characterised by debilitating vibration sensations and imbalance. She thereafter developed both persistent vestibular dysfunction as well as a persistent headache, which was focused behind her left eye and her left parietal area accompanied by photophobia and phonophobia. She also developed significant pain issues including myalgias in her lower extremities, neck, back and anterior chest wall along with paresthesias in her face, especially on her left side. Additional symptoms through her course included but were not limited to diffuse skin changes, lower extremity oedema, emotional lability/irritability, partial focal seizures, insomnia, palpitations, tinnitus, speech difficulties and salivary gland pain with eating.\n\n【8】Vital signs were normal with a blood pressure of 112/75, oxygen saturation of 98% and pulse of 65, and physical examination was non-contributory except for multiple tender points in the abdomen, anterior chest wall, shoulders and neck.\n\n【9】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【10】Her initial evaluation prior to being seen by our team included laboratory workup that included an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) to 121 mm/hour, positive D-dimer of 1.41 ng/mL (upper limit of normal 0.50) and neutrophilic predominance of 86% on complete blood count (CBC) differential. A brain MRI demonstrated non-specific white matter changes and minimal olfactory enhancement in January 2021, and a fluoroscopic guided lumbar puncture in March 2021 that was negative for infectious causes of her headaches. Two identical gamma restriction bands were observed in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indicative of systemic rather than intracerebral synthesis of gammaglobulins. Videonystagmography testing was abnormal as evidenced by left unilateral weakness and biphasic nystagmus. She additionally had an echocardiogram in July 2021, which was technically limited but reported mild-to-moderate aortic insufficiency and mild aortic sclerosis.

Inflammatory markers were no longer elevated given an ESR of 2 mm/hour and a CRP of <3.0 mg/L. D-dimer was also within normal limits. Endocrine testing including dehydroepiandrosterone, free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels were all normal, though thyroid-stimulating hormone was low at 0.03 mIU/L (lower limit of normal 0.3 mIU/L). Thyroperoxidase antibody was negative at 1.2 IU/mL. An extended autoimmune workup with ANA, CCP, double-stranded DNA, SSA, SSB, Smith, RNP, Scl 70, Jo 1 and rheumatoid factor was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis was negative. Cytokine panel testing showed normal levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Interleukin(IL)-6, interferon beta, IL-10, IL-1 beta, interferon gamma, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), IL-2 receptor alpha soluble, interferon alpha and IL-18 with an elevated level of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 at 228 pg/mL (upper limit of normal 198 pg/mL).\n\n【28】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【29】This patient had a constellation of symptoms that most closely resemble post-COVID-19 syndrome, with features similar to that seen in both ME/CFS and fibromyalgia. It was important to evaluate for potential alternative diagnoses including autoimmune diseases, endocrine disorders and other inflammatory disorders. She had an extensive largely negative workup that is consistent with that expected of the post-COVID-19 syndrome. Importantly, she did show a few markers that could potentially be helpful in the diagnosis of post-COVID-19 syndrome including an elevated MCP-1, blunted vagal response and hypometabolism on brain PET scan.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】PASC is remarkably heterogeneous in its presentation and may be better phenotyped by grouping patients by symptom clusters in order to better target treatment by applying lessons learnt from treating similar medical conditions. A subset of patients with PASC will present with a syndromic constellation of symptoms similar to that seen in other post viral illnesses, ME/CFS, fibromyalgia and POTS. 删除9：<u>1–5 7 </u>These patients are referred to by several terms including ‘long-haulers’ and ‘long COVID-19’ but are perhaps more appropriately described as having post-COVID-19 syndrome. Diagnosis of the post-COVID-19 syndrome is often frustrating for both patients and medical providers as while diagnostic criteria have been proposed, they have not been widely implemented. 删除9：<u>23 </u>Furthermore, these criteria are clinical, and there is no accepted diagnostic testing modality for post-COVID-19 syndrome at this time.\n\n【32】Here we present the case of a middle-aged woman with an occupationally acquired COVID-19 exposure that led to persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis of post-COVID-19 syndrome at 9 months. Salient features of this case include the presence of multiple phenotypes of post-COVID-19 syndrome including fatigue-predominant as well as myalgia-predominant features. We also demonstrate the myriad of symptoms that can be associated with persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms including but not limited to headache, dyspnoea on exertion, tachycardia, myalgia, anosmia/parosmia, vertigo, cognitive dysfunction, emotional lability and fatigue. At this time, existing data suggest that patients with persistent symptomatology, including those with fibromyalgia, ME/CFS and POTS, have a dysregulated immune response that may be responsible for the characteristic syndromic presentations. It is highly likely that this pathophysiology also occurs in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome; indeed, preliminary data from our first 108 patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome does demonstrate an increased incidence of elevation of IL-6. 删除9：<u>24 </u>More recently, data have emerged demonstrating decreases in CD8+ T cells in patients with PASC compared with healthy controls and patients who had COVID-19 but did not develop PASC. 删除9：<u>25 26 </u>Patients with PASC have also demonstrated a significant decrease in T regulatory cells and elevation in the CD14+, CD16+ and CCR5+ monocyte subsets. 删除9：<u>26 </u>Chemokine analysis in patients with PASC was also abnormal with significant elevations in CCL5/RANTES, IL-2, IL-4, CCL3, IL-6, IL-10, interferon gamma and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and significantly lower levels of GM-CSF and CCL4 when compared with healthy controls. 删除9：<u>26 </u>In light of these findings, the elevated MCP-1 observed in our patient may represent one feature of the immune dysregulation seen in PASC.\n\n【33】Studies have demonstrated hypometabolic changes on PET scan as well as altered brain recruitment in response to standard stimuli on functional imaging. 删除9：<u>20–22 </u>Similarly, patients in the early stages of post-COVID-19 syndrome (3–4 weeks after infection) have been demonstrated to have hypometabolic brain PET scans. 删除9：<u>27–29 </u>Review of our patient’s PET scan demonstrates similarities to those presented by Guedj _et al_ 27 but also shows sparing of the gyrus rectus. The significance of this imaging finding will be better demonstrated with larger study cohorts and may indicate a feature of the beginnings of recovery. Demonstrating that these changes are present at 9 months after infection supports the persistence of symptoms and implies that hypometabolic changes on brain PET scan may be a marker of continued post-COVID-19 syndrome and may be useful as a biomarker going forward.\n\n【34】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【35】Backstory: before testing positive for COVID-19 in December 2020, I was a fully employed, healthy woman. I have always been exemplary in my diet, supplement, and exercise regimens – and often got razzed about it! My husband and I live on a farm in a rural area. We have horses and love to trail ride. We have ATVs and a lovely in-ground pool. We also have cattle and goats, and have been active with our family in 4-H. We have always had a garden and beautiful flower beds. I was heavily involved in the loving maintenance required to sustain all of these things—I absolutely love country life.\n\n【36】While at my job, I had several occupational exposures to COVID-19 without a fit-tested N95 mask for PPE.\n\n【37】Within 36 hoursof exposure, I developed a fever of 102 and felt miserable. I tested positive the next morning for COVID-19. My symptoms included lots of upper respiratory drainage with sneezing, headaches, cough, fever, body aches, diarrhea, SOB with exertion, heart palpitations, and extreme fatigue. The Occupational Medicine NP prescribed a Z-Pak and dexamethasone three week taper dose. I expected two weeks off and full recovery, as I have always been very healthy - why wouldn’t I snap back? However, I have been unable to work since.\n\n【38】My initial COVID-19 infection was resolving, but I was still extremely fatigued. Exactly two weeks after testing positive for COVID-19, I began to have strange new symptoms—without any similar history prior to COVID-19. I was dizzy, my head had vibration-like pressure, brain fog, tinnitus, sore joints and muscles, GI upset—I was still so exhausted. I was prescribed Bactrim by my Occupational Medicine NP, guessing it was an inner ear infection—two additional weeks expected for recovery.\n\n【39】I then elected to see my trusted ENT as these new symptoms persisted. Testing was done, I was diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus affecting my vestibular system, tinnitus, and mild-to-moderate unilateral hearing loss. I was given vestibular exercises to do at home, was told 8–12 weeks to recovery if I pushed through the exercises and desensitized my vestibular system. I was given vertigo restrictions by ENT—no driving, swimming, or operating heavy equipment. The vertigo restrictions are still in place nine months later.\n\n【40】Then, days later, came a migraine-like headache behind my left eye and across my left temple and scalp. That evening, I experienced an episode while in bed which started with a feeling of euphoria, followed by twitching in the left arm which migrated to the left side of my face with facial spasms around my left eye and down to my cheek, with residual numbness into the left arm and face which lasted for hours. My left temple has remained so tender that I am unable to sleep on my left side.\n\n【41】The migraine continued, then worsened behind my left eye and left temple, causing me to visit the ER to rule out stroke in January 2021. CT was negative; however, MRI showed some irregularities. Depression set in with a feeling of impending doom, especially at night. Very emotional. Migraines have persisted since January.\n\n【42】Foggy thinking worsened with short-term memory problems, inability to multitask, confusion, difficulty verbalizing appropriately—which led to irritability, more anxiety and depression. My personality is ‘flat’, nothing like my former self. I am still plagued by all of these symptoms.\n\n【43】Neurologist consulted: vertigo, anxiety, hemifacial spasms, and migraine following COVID-19 were diagnosed. Rest and vestibular physical therapy ordered—six months postinfection, full recovery anticipated. Psychologist recommended for anxiety and depression. Weekly psychotherapy by phone starting in early April—very stabilizing but exhausting.\n\n【44】In March, rash broke out on the forehead, cheeks, and nose with sun exposure, again no history of skin problems. Dermatologist seen; told COVID-19 causes rashes, given topical rosacea medication—no results. Rash extended into scalp with hair loss. Topical steroid prescribed, relieved scalp symptoms. Heavy sunscreen and hat required while outside, rash still present.\n\n【45】ENT ordered VNG vestibular testing for my continuing in balance symptoms. Concerning nystagmus found along with other problems. Testing was so tiring and sensitizing, five days complete rest were required afterwards. My brain felt like I had a TBI. ENT corresponded with PCP with grave concerns when testing results were received showing ‘central’ damage.\n\n【46】Heat and cold intolerance developed; heat caused dizziness and profuse sweating, cold causing Raynaud’s in fingers and livedo reticularis on extremities and abdomen.\n\n【47】Neuropathy developed, first in my toes, then fingers—like a bee sting, lasting several minutes to a few hours, onset in the evening. Left facial and scalp numbness has also persisted.\n\n【48】Physical therapist evaluation spawned new recommendation to Neurologist for vision OT and speech therapy. My symptoms were worsening: balance, vision, and speech were all involved. PT worked on inner ear crystals using the canalith repositioning procedure for weeks, imbalance unimproved.\n\n【49】Severe insomnia—everything hurt. Melatonin started by Neurologist recommendation. Complete exhaustion.\n\n【50】Neurologist reassessment with new orders for lumbar puncture and blood testing for multiple disorders, including MS, results largely negative. Orders to continue PT, added vision OT and speech therapy. Trazodone started for insomnia. With worsening symptoms at next neurologist appointment, amitriptyline was started briefly with intolerable side effects, and trazodone was resumed.\n\n【51】Eyes checked by three specialists due to persistent pain behind left eye, difficulty focusing, photophobia, shapes appearing in my visual field. All three specialists concluded there was nothing wrong with my eyes—‘it’s not your eyes causing the problem…’\n\n【52】Weekly PT, plus new vision OT and ST were started. This routine kept me completely exhausted—like I was on a roller coaster. I slept for days after each therapy session, then repeat.\n\n【53】During a PT evaluation of my nystagmus utilizing a head roll maneuver, I had another ‘episode’ which started with a feeling of euphoria/fear, bursting into tears uncontrollably, and my left leg and arm had twitching that ‘marched’ up into my face, around my left eye, down into my cheek, then around the left side of my mouth. This episode was stronger and made me realize that the ‘episodes’ I was experiencing were actually Focal Aware Seizures.\n\n【54】Every body system was negatively affected by June. Then I developed weight gain with generalized edema, and 2+ pitting edema in my left ankle and foot, chest discomfort, frequent heart palpitations, bradycardia, and greater SOB with exertion. My PCP ran testing for ‘everything \\[she\\] could think of’. TSH low normal, thyroid medication dose was increased. A proBNP was elevated to 253 - Entresto started for what appeared to be mild heart failure. Echo showed mild-to-moderate aortic insufficiency. Heart monitor showed bradycardia to 37bpm to tachycardia in the 130s with arrhythmias at rest. PCP discussed my worsening symptoms and my husband asked if she would refer me to a tertiary care center so we could get some answers—she agreed and contacted the referral center immediately. Neurologist consulted and agreed with PCP, stating this center would be their next recommendation.\n\n【55】My husband and I had been raised to believe this particular referral center is the place to go when you really need medical help. We were completely exhausted, confused, and angry after evaluations and testing by a myriad of local doctors, specialists, and therapists—all with largely negative testing results and similar or conflicting phrases. ‘COVID-19 is new, there aren’t any scientific studies yet’ and ‘these symptoms may be COVID-19 related, we just don’t know about COVID-19’. Or, the ‘you should be recovered after \\_\\_\\_ weeks/months’ teamed with ‘you need to completely rest’, or ‘you need to desensitize your vestibular system and stay active to get better’.\n\n【56】I was over six months post COVID-19 infection walking with a Rollater and still unable to drive a car. I had intolerable, worsening symptoms and no answers—my husband and I were both physically and emotionally drained. When the referral center called me, wanting to schedule an appointment - I literally cried! It was three months wait to be seen at their Post COVID-19 Clinic, but they gave me that the hope I desperately needed. All of my local doctors and therapists were eager to get their answers too!\n\n【57】We drove over 600 miles to the Post COVID-19 Clinic. It was definitely worth the drive. The facility was huge and intimidating at first, but everyone we spoke to was extremely helpful and courteous.\n\n【58】I cannot say enough good about my Post COVID-19 physician and his delivery of knowledge on Post COVID-19 Syndrome. For the first time, I was speaking with a doctor who understood what I had been going through and had answers! He thoroughly listened, answered questions and explained what he believed was causing my symptoms and the tests he was ordering to confirm. He and his staff were also very responsive, accommodating our need to see other specialists and having testing completed within as few days as possible. After my testing results were completed, he took the time to thoroughly explain what was found and my final diagnosis, answering all of our questions and laying out the Post COVID-19 Clinic plan of care for patients with Post COVID-19 Syndrome. For the first time since my symptoms began, I had hope!\n\n【59】As with my post COVID-19 physician, the three other specialists I saw, the nurses, and the technicians were all very professional and took time to do their job well and unhurried with excellent communication. Each employee seemed genuinely happy and engaged in their duties, all of which helped me to better tolerate a multitude of tests and appointments.\n\n【60】The patient education delivery was unique, given via Zoom meeting from home. Their Post COVID-19 Syndrome educational Zoom meetings were well-presented, engaging, and enlightening. For the first time, I fully understand why I feel like I do. More importantly, I now have guidance on how I can relieve symptoms by rethinking and differently managing my personal health practices. I will also be given a health coach for six sessions over the next six months to help me institute my new Post COVID-19 Syndrome plan of care.\n\n【61】I cannot discuss what COVID-19 has done to me without mentioning what it has done to my husband. He has been there every step of the way and it has wreaked havoc on his mental and physical health. Without his dedicated support, I am unable to function independently. I cannot imagine being less fortunate and not having a support system with Post COVID-19 Syndrome.\n\n【62】### Learning points\n\n【63】*   The post-COVID-19 syndrome is common, occurring in approximately 10%–30% of patients who have recovered from acute COVID-19 infection.\n\n【64】*   Patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome often have a constellation of symptoms that are life limiting but have a generally negative workup.\n\n【65】*   Diagnosis of post-COVID-19 syndrome requires a high index of clinical suspicion.\n\n【66】*   There are no definitive diagnostic tests for post-COVID-19 syndrome; however, we present the hypometabolic PET scan of the brain, elevated MCP-1 and blunted vagal response as potential supporting tests for the diagnosis of this prevalent condition.\n\n【67】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【68】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【69】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:21:59", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:22:17", "cost": 17.92}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:22:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:21:59"}

It is an aggressive and poorly differentiated variant that predominantly occurs in the larynx. 删除9：<u>1 </u>The incidence of spindle cell carcinoma on the oral cavity is very rare and accounts for less than 1% of all oral cavity tumours. It presents in the sixth and seventh decades of life and is more common in men. It has a unique clinical appearance compared with other SCC. It presents as a polypoid, exophytic or pedunculated mass. It is also known as pseudo carcinoma, polypoid SCC and collusion tumour. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>The spindle cell component arises as an atypical reactive proliferation of the stroma called ‘pseudosarcoma’. 删除9：<u>4 </u>The spindle cells and epithelial cells arise from different stem cells hence the name collision tumour. 删除9：<u>5 </u>The risk factors associated with spindle cell carcinoma formation are smoking, alcohol and previous radiotherapy. Oral and oropharyngeal tumours present as painful or painless masses with dysphagia or bleeding. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Regional metastases can occur in about 25% of cases.\n\n【14】Histologically, it can present as a monophasic spindled, pleomorphic or a biphasic tumour where epithelial changes from dysplasia to invasive carcinoma are admixed with spindle cells. It shows hypercellularity with streaming fascicles of spindle cells in a sarcomatous appearance. Immunohistochemistry is helpful to know the histiogenesis of the spindle cell in this tumour. Epithelial markers that show positivity are keratin and epithelial membrane antigen, while mesenchymal markers include vimentin, desmin and S-100. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【15】Aggressive surgical resection is considered a mainstay of treatment for this tumour. Surgery followed by radiotherapy is considered for the best long-term outcome. Radiotherapy is considered in inoperable cases and positive surgical margins with extensive nodal metastasis. The factors which favour a good prognosis in spindle cell carcinoma are low-stage, small-size, absence of previous radiation, superficial location, polypoid and exophytic growth. A high recurrence rate of 70%–75% has been reported, and hence close follow-up is essential. 删除9：<u>8 </u>There is a noticeable difference in prognosis and overall survival of spindle cell carcinoma compared with SCC.

However, clinicians should be aware of alternative processes that may mimic acute ST elevation myocardial infarction. One such condition is neurogenic stunned myocardium, a phenomenon in which an acute neurological insult leads to myocardial injury and resultant ECG abnormalities. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Once ST elevation myocardial infarction has been excluded, clinicians may be left solving for the underlying cause of the patient presentation. This case highlights an example of neurogenic stunned myocardium, which after exclusion of acute myocardial infarction and further investigation, led to the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of autoimmune limbic encephalitis.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A man in his 60s was found collapsed on the floor at home, awake, but unresponsive by family and brought in by emergency medical services to the hospital emergency department (ED) for evaluation. The field ECG  demonstrated inferior ST segment elevations and Q waves with lateral ST depressions consistent with an acute inferior myocardial infarction. The patient denied any symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath. The patient’s medical history was notable for coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 6 years prior and ischaemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 25%–30%. His medications included aspirin 81 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, carvedilol 12.5 mg two times per day, atorvastatin 40 mg daily and lisinopril 10 mg daily. The patient’s social and family histories were unremarkable. On physical examination, blood pressure was 110/80 mm Hg with a heart rate of 75 beats per minute. The patient was mildly confused, oriented to name and location, but not to date. Cardiopulmonary and neurological exams were otherwise unremarkable.

However, a culprit coronary lesion was not identified. Patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit for further management. After cardiac catheterisation, the initial troponin-I level drawn in the ED resulted, and troponin-I level peaked at 0.095 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL) and declined in a repeat measure 4 hours later before the initiation of any additional intervention. Labs were otherwise notable for a white cell count of 12 ×10⁹/Land sodium of 126 mmol/L. Repeat ECG 30 min after cardiac catheterisation demonstrated resolution of ST segment deviations . Transthoracic echocardiogram findings were unchanged from prior, demonstrating a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%–30% with akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and inferoseptal walls and hypokinesis of the apical myocardium.\n\n【18】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【19】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【20】Second hospital ECG shortly after cardiac catheterisation.

Neurology was consulted given the patient’s initial presentation and concern for seizure-like activity. Initial electroencephalogram demonstrated mild background slowing. While being interviewed by the neurology team, the patient had a witnessed faciobrachial dystonic seizure, which is pathognomonic for LGI-1 autoimmune encephalitis. 删除9：<u>2 </u>MRI brain demonstrated possible T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity of bilateral mesial temporal lobes. Both serum and cerebrospinal fluid were positive for LGI-1 immunoglobulin G. Patient was diagnosed with LGI-1 autoimmune encephalitis.\n\n【22】Treatment\n---------\n\n【23】High-dose steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins and valproic acid were initiated with improvement in seizure activity and mild improvement in cognitive status. Patient was discharged on prednisone 60 mg daily and levetiracetam 1000 mg two times per day with outpatient neurology follow-up.\n\n【24】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【25】One year after discharge, the patient continues to do well without any symptoms or recurrent seizure episodes.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】Central nervous system pathology, namely subarachnoid haemorrhage, but also ischaemic stroke and seizure have previously been associated with abnormal ECG findings that may mimic ischaemia or acute coronary syndrome. There are numerous case reports of patients ultimately diagnosed with subarachnoid haemorrhage whose initial ECG had ST elevations concerning for acute coronary syndrome but with no culprit lesion identified on coronary angiography. 删除9：<u>3 4 </u>Ischaemic stroke has also presented with diffuse ST segment elevations, where subsequent coronary angiography did not demonstrate evidence of obstruction or vasospasm. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Lastly and notably, a similar case in which a patient with multivessel CAD status post CABG and numerous stent placements was found to have inferior ST elevations after a seizure event, and coronary angiography with optical coherence tomography was negative for acute plaque rupture. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【28】The mechanism by which a primary neurological insult leads to cardiac pathology has been hypothesised in the literature. Subarachnoid haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke and seizure have been associated with sympathetic overactivity and ECG changes that can resemble widespread myocardial ischaemia. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Stimulation of various neural areas including the limbic cortex, which is thought to have influence over the autonomic system, has demonstrated similar effects. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Specifically, structures of the limbic system such as the hippocampus and putamen have been implicated by imaging in LGI-1 autoimmune limbic encephalitis. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Interestingly, structural differences in the limbic system also including the hippocampal and putamen regions have been seen in patients with a history of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy when compared with healthy controls. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Thus recognising this connection, it is possible that LGI-1 autoimmune limbic encephalitis and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy share a similar underlying pathogenesis that is driven by sympathetic overactivity leading to transient myocardial injury, as both disease processes affect similar limbic system structures, namely the hippocampus and putamen. This phenomenon is referred to as neurogenic stunned myocardium, which can manifest in the form of left ventricular dysfunction, ECG changes and/or elevation in serum troponin levels. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【29】How sympathetic overactivity ultimately leads to cardiac injury is still under investigation. 删除9：<u>1 </u>One proposed mechanism is that a surge of catecholamines leads to a direct toxic effect on cardiomyocytes on a cellular level through myofibrillar degeneration. The pathophysiology is thought to resemble the mechanism seen in cardiac reperfusion injury. Specifically, norepinephrine has been found to interfere with calcium channels resulting in an influx of calcium ions and induces a release of free radicals, both of which lead to myocardial injury. This leads to disturbances in the cardiac membrane causing ST segment abnormalities that can resemble myocardial ischaemia and infarction. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Other proposed mechanisms of neurogenic stunned myocardium include sympathetically driven coronary vasospasm 1 9 10 and increased myocardial demand leading to ischaemia. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【30】This case presentation is most consistent with a faciobrachial dystonic seizure due to LGI-1 autoimmune encephalitis in a patient with obstructive coronary disease presenting with ECG findings mimicking acute myocardial infarction. While ECG demonstrated findings consistent with an inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), diagnostic workup including coronary angiography did not demonstrate evidence of a culprit lesion. Current literature suggests that central nervous system pathology, especially disease that affects structures of the limbic system such as the hippocampus and putamen, may trigger a pathological level of sympathetic overactivity with toxic effects on myocardial tissue, which can manifest in the form of ischaemic ECG findings. Clinicians should be aware of this relationship and consider neurological workup once acute coronary syndrome has been ruled out.\n\n【31】### Learning points\n\n【32】*   To be able to recognise neurogenic stunned myocardium as a potential mimic of acute myocardial infarction on ECG.\n\n【33】*   To understand the underlying pathophysiology of neurogenic stunned myocardium.\n\n【34】*   To understand the importance of keeping a broad differential and revisiting the history and physical when a unifying diagnosis has not presented itself.\n\n【35】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【36】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【37】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:50:25", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:50:40", "cost": 14.961}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:50:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:50:25"}

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is the most common disease that causes dactylitis due to joint, tendon and soft tissue inflammation. 删除9：<u>1 </u>However, dactylitis can also be a clinical feature in, for example, ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, granulomatous diseases, malignancies and infections. 删除9：<u>2–5</u>\n\n【8】Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a tick-borne disease caused by spirochetes within the _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato ( _B.b_ .s.l.) complex. There are several human pathogenic genospecies within the complex, but Lyme arthritis is most often associated with _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto, _B. afzelii_ with skin lesions and _B. garinii_ and _B. bavariensis_ with neuroborreliosis. 删除9：<u>6 7 </u>LB is endemic in several areas of Europe and the USA. The clinical manifestations of LB are diverse. The most common is erythema migrans (EM) at the tick bite site; however, a rash is not obligatory. 删除9：<u>8 9 </u>Other manifestations that can occur weeks to years after the infective tick bite are neuroborreliosis, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA), lymphocytoma cutis, arthritis, carditis, lymphadenopathy and multiple EM. 删除9：<u>10 11 </u>Diagnosis of LB is based on characteristic clinical signs and symptoms complemented by serological confirmation of infection, once an antibody response has been mounted. 删除9：<u>6 </u>We present a case of a patient initially presumed to be suffering from PsA, but with symptoms worsening during tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor treatment. A reassessment of the diagnosis showed LB with dactylitis, arthritis and ACA. The patient was successfully treated with phenoxymethylpenicillin (PcV).\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】An immunocompetent man in his 70s was seen in a rheumatological outpatient clinic at a Danish regional hospital. He was previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, atrial flutter, chronic obstructive lung disease and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia; all comorbidities were well treated. One year previously, he had been diagnosed with PsA based on dactylitis of the second and third digits of the left hand, onycholysis of the nails and scalp psoriasis. The dactylitis was not painful and he had no systemic symptoms of inflammation such as fever or malaise. Treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate did not have any effect on the dactylitis. Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections for tenosynovitis in the two digits (triamcinolone hexacetonide) did not have any effects on the dactylitis; hence, TNF-α inhibitor treatment(adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks) was initiated. At 3 months’ follow-up, the severity of the dactylitis had worsened, substantially involving all fingers of the left hand. Also, a bluish-red discolouration and induration of the skin were observed on the left upper extremity involving thenar as well as hypothenar and extending proximally and around the elbow. Underlying blood vessels related to the involved fingers were accentuated . The skin lesions were found to be indicative of ACA, and treatment with methotrexate and TNF-α inhibitor was stopped. Since the patient had not responded as expected to the corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, the patients diagnosis was questioned. Therefore, a skin biopsy was performed showing histopathological changes compatible with LB. The patient also had anti- _B.b_ .s.l. IgG antibodies in serum. It was concluded that the patient was not suffering from PsA but LB with manifestations of dactylitis, arthritis and ACA. Treatment with PcV 1.5 million IU three times a day for 10 days was initiated. This treatment was chosen based on recommendations from a specialist in infectious diseases. After 2 weeks, the dactylitis had regressed substantially , and after 6 months, the dactylitis and skin lesions had vanished . However, the patient suffered from sequalae from the left hand in terms of persistently reduced movements in both the second and third digits in both proximal and distal interphalangeal joints, despite occupational therapy. The patient did not recall having been bitten by a tick. He did recall that the first swelling of the fingers emerged weeks after gardening and removal of ivy.\n\n【11】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【12】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【13】Lyme borreliosis with manifestations of dactylitis, arthritis and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans.

No inflammation was present: total leucocyte count was 3.82 (ref. 3.50–8.80×) 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and serum C reactive protein (CRP) level was 5.8 (ref.<6.0) mg/L, serum urate level was 0.31 (ref. 0.23–0.48) mmol/L and negative findings for anticyclic citrullinated peptides, IgM rheumatoid factor and myeloma protein, and there were no antibodies against hepatitis B, hepatitis C virus or parvovirus B19. Immunoglobulins were normal. Interferon gamma release testwas also negative. During the disease course, testing for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antiphospholipids, cryoglobulins and angiotensin-converting enzyme was conducted. All analyses were within the normal range. However, _B.b_ .s.l.-specific IgG antibodies were found using the liaison _Borrelia_ IgM and IgG CLIA assay (Diasorin, Saluggia, Italy).\n\n【22】X-rays of the hands and feet showed normal bone and joints. A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis showed reactive enlarged lymph nodules in the left axil corresponding to the involved left hand. Ultrasound investigations of the fingers showed severe soft-tissue swelling, flexor tenosynovitis and synovitis of all interphalangeal joints. A skin biopsy from the left hand was performed. It was fixated using 4% formaldehyde and stained using H&E. The histopathological investigations showed deep perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells, primarily lymphocytes, and some histiocytes and eosinophils. Also, deep and superficial plasma cells and a mild degree of spongiosis were described. The skin biopsy did not show granulomatous changes. The histopathological findings could be compatible with LB. It was not possible to perform specific PCR for _B.b_ .s.l. as the skin biopsy had been fixated in formaldehyde.\n\n【23】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【24】In this case, LB was initially misdiagnosed as PsA. Other diagnostic considerations for the causes of dactylitis were malignancy including progression in known haematological disease, granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, lymphocytoma cutis and slow-growing infection. Idiopathic lymphoedema and discolouration of the fingers due to microthromboembolic disease were also taken into diagnostic consideration.\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】When the diagnosis LB was confirmed, a specialist in infectious diseases was consulted. Treatment with PcV 1.5 million IU three times a day for 10 days was recommended. We decided to await further improvement without elongation or adjustment of the antibiotic medication as initial treatment was effective. Alongside the medical treatment, in the following 6 months, he also received occupational therapy.\n\n【27】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【28】During follow-up, inflammatory parameters remained within the normal range including CRP repeated monthly. The circumference of the digits was measured using a finger circumference gauge. Before treatment with PcV, after 2 weeks and after 6 months, the circumferences of the second digit were 11.5, 删除13：<u>10,0 </u>and 9.5 cm, respectively. After 6 months, tenosynovitis, arthritis, soft tissue swelling and skin rash had resolved, assessed clinically and by ultrasound. The patient was considered cured of the infection. However, he suffered from sequelae in terms of impaired flexion of the left hand’s second and third digits in the distal and proximal interphalangeal joint despite occupational therapy.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】We report a case of LB initially misdiagnosed as PsA. The symptoms were progressive dactylitis, arthritis and skin rash. There was no history of a tick bite or EM. The clinical manifestations worsened, following treatment with TNF-α inhibitor. LB was diagnosed by typical manifestation of ACA, histopathological changes in a skin biopsy, anti- _B.b_ .s.l. IgG antibodies in serum and effect of treatment. A CT scan confirmed local lymphadenopathy.\n\n【31】PsA is a heterogeneous disease that can be seen with symmetrical or asymmetrical joint involvement. Dactylitis in PsA is reported in 40%–50% of patients and can be either acute with swelling, redness, and pain or chronic with swelling without pain. 删除9：<u>12 </u>TNF-α inhibitors are effective in the treatment of dactylitis. 删除9：<u>13 </u>In our case, dactylitis worsened when treated with an immunosuppressive TNF-α inhibitor, which led us to reassess the diagnosis.\n\n【32】Although dactylitis is a common feature of PsA, it may also be seen as a clinical feature in several other diseases. First, dactylitis may be seen in other rheumatic diseases such as spondyloarthritis and reactive arthritis, 删除13：<u>14–16 </u>and in microcrystalline deposition diseases including gout and calcium hydroxyapatite with calcific tendinitis and deposition of crystals in joints and soft tissue. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Second, dactylitis may be seen in granulomatous diseases like sarcoidosis and tuberculosis 17–19 and in other slow-growing infections, for example, atypical mycobacterium infection 4 and brucellosis. 删除9：<u>20 </u>Third, in case of a more acute disease course, highly virulent pyogenic infections like _Staphylococcus_ and _Streptococcus_ may be considered. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Finally, in children with dactylitis, benign osteoid osteoma, 删除13：<u>21 </u>sickle cell disease and congenital syphilis may be considered. 删除9：<u>5 22</u>\n\n【33】Clinical symptoms in LB are not always specific, and LB can look like several diseases. 删除9：<u>23 </u>It can cause multisystem disease, particularly affecting the skin, musculoskeletal system, nervous system and heart. Lyme arthritis is usually not painful and is not accompanied by fever. It has been shown that 84% of patients have monarthritis and that the knees are affected in up to 98%. 删除9：<u>24 </u>ACA is reported in 1%–3% of LB cases in Europe. 删除9：<u>6 </u>ACA and arthritis are late manifestations of LB and may present months to years after the infectious tick bite. 删除9：<u>6 9</u>\n\n【34】To our knowledge, this is the first case of LB describing asymmetrical dactylitis in a hand. Previously, a case report of LB dactylitis in a toe has been published by _Levy et al_ . 删除9：<u>3 </u>Also, diffuse hand and finger swelling has been reported as a striking feature of Lyme arthritis. 25 _Borrelia_ lymphocytoma cutis is a non-tender bluish-red nodule that may mimic dactylitis if it is located in one digit. 删除9：<u>10 </u>However, it is typically found on the ear lobe, areola mammae or scrotum. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【35】The diagnosis of LB may be challenging and the diagnosis of disseminated infection is often delayed several years because of the similarity of this entity to other diseases. 删除9：<u>26 </u>One of the reasons is that the patients do not always recall a preceding tick bite and dermatological manifestations are not obligatory. Furthermore, once a patient has developed anti- _B.b.s.l._ antibodies, these can persist for years. 27 _B.b.s.l._ \\-specific PCR has a reasonable sensitivity in Lyme arthritis, but with a higher sensitivity in synovial samples than on synovitis fluid (range 40%–96%) but a high specificity (100%). 删除9：<u>6 </u>In our case, it was not possible to confirm the diagnosis from PCR of the skin biopsy as the biopsy had been fixated using formaldehyde, but this could have supported the diagnosis. Culture in skin and synovial tissue/fluid is time-consuming and costly and is not recommended in routine diagnostic testing. 删除9：<u>6 </u>The diagnosis may further be validated by the histopathological pattern in LB, including varying degrees of superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates mixed with plasma cells and eosinophile. Epidermal changes such as spongiosis are seen in some cases. However, the histological features of EM and ACA are not specific. 删除9：<u>9 23</u>\n\n【36】Depending on geographical variations and the clinical manifestations, different treatments regimens for LB are recommended. 删除9：<u>6 9 </u>In Denmark, PcV for 21 days is recommended as first-line antibiotic treatment for Lyme arthritis and ACA, whereas doxycycline and ceftriaxone are alternatives to PcV. 删除9：<u>28 29 </u>However, recommendations for treatment of LB are based on small case series, but there are no randomised controlled trials. European treatment guidelines for LB with arthritis or ACA often recommend doxycycline for 14–28 days as first-line treatment or alternatively amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. 删除9：<u>6 24 30–33 </u>In this case, treatment with PcV for only 10 days was used with success. If treatment with PcV had not been sufficient, extension of treatment for a total of 21 days or change in treatment to doxycycline or ceftriaxone would have been considered. 删除9：<u>33</u>\n\n【37】In conclusion, dactylitis is a common feature of PsA. However, dactylitis may also be seen as a clinical feature in several other diseases such as LB and should be considered both initially and if treatment response is lacking.\n\n【38】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【39】The worst part of the disease was the uncertainty regarding the diagnosis. I often wondered, ‘Why can the doctors not figure out what is wrong with my fingers’. At the same time, I thought, ‘Well, I am not 25 years old anymore, but an elderly man, and I am not as vain as I used to be’. I was really happy when I was sent to the dermatologist and the skin biopsy helped to set the diagnosis, borreliosis. Already after 1 week of penicillin treatment, the swelling of my ‘sausage fingers’ improved. I have to live with a pair of semi-stiff fingers, but I think I will manage it well, even though I have to say good morning to those distorted ‘bandits’ every day.\n\n【40】### Learning points\n\n【41】*   Dactylitis is a common feature of PsA. However, dactylitis may also be seen as a clinical feature in several other diseases such as Lyme borreliosis (LB).\n\n【42】*   LB may occur although a tick bite or a history thereof or an initial erythematous rash is not recalled by the patient.\n\n【43】*   When suspecting an infection, attention to the correct procedure for culture and PCR analysis is important.\n\n【44】*   Other differential diagnoses must be considered when expected treatment response is lacking. It is crucial to re-evaluate the medical history, objective examinations and laboratory tests. In this case, the conclusive clue was hidden in the skin biopsy.\n\n【45】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【46】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【47】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank the patient for participating with his personal experience and letting us write the case report.

Four hours before the onset of symptoms, he had eaten raw horse mackerel and salmon sushi. He had a 26 pack-year smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and hyperuricaemia. He appeared ill, but was conscious with a blood pressure of 200/116 mm Hg and heart rate of 87 beats per minute. He had severe and persistent epigastralgia accompanied with left lumbar back pain, but his abdomen with no signs of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cell count (12.0 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), C reactive protein (0.65 mg/dL) and creatine phosphokinase (306 U/L), but troponin I was negative, lactate (1.4 mmol/L), and d-dimer (0.6 µg/mL) levels were within normal ranges. Electrocardiography revealed no abnormalities.\n\n【4】Initially, gastric anisakiasis was suspected because of the typical acute severe epigastralgia, which occurred within 12 hours of ingesting raw or undercooked seafood infested with nematodes of the genus Anisakis. 删除9：<u>1 </u>However, in this case, he had eaten sushi made with defrosted seafood, which was not a typical cause of gastric anisakiasis because parasitic anisakis is killed by freezing at −20°C. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Although there is a wide range of diseases that can cause abdominal pain in the emergency room, vascular diseases should be suspected, especially when physical examination findings are lacking in patients with acute severe abdominal pain. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Based on these findings, we decided to perform a contrast-enhanced abdominal CT to differentiate vascular diseases. The CT showed a dissection of the coeliac artery trunk and splenic infarction . Therefore, spontaneous isolated coeliac artery dissection (SICAD) was diagnosed. He was admitted into the high care unit and was fasted. Blood pressure-lowering therapy, analgesics, and anticoagulation were started. His abdominal pain was relieved and blood pressure was well controlled on the second day of hospitalisation, and discharged on the 18th day of hospitalisation.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a type II colon tumour of approximately 4 cm diameter, and biopsy examination revealed adenocarcinoma. There was no evident metastasis, and a laparoscopic colon resection was planned. Written consent was obtained to report the case. After inserting an infusion catheter in the epidural space from the T9-T10 interspace, general anaesthesia was administered using propofol, remifentanil, fentanyl and rocuronium. The operation time was 451 min, and the patient was in a head-down position for approximately 6 h.\n\n【4】He complained of left shoulder pain after being awakened. We diagnosed that the pressure of the shoulder pad, holding the position during surgery, caused the postlaparoscopic shoulder pain (PLSP). We produced trigger point injections with 10 mL of 1% xylocaine, but PLSP was not relieved.\n\n【5】On postoperative day 1, the pain was still severe but was relieved when the patient was in a sitting or standing position. X-rays in the supine position show that the drain is in contact with the diaphragm . We diagnosed that the drain under the left diaphragm caused left shoulder pain due to referred pain.

Phrenic innervation (C3-C5) is placed on the central diaphragmatic pleura and the mediastinal pleura, while the supraclavicular nerve (C3-C4) conducts sensory input from the acromium process. Pain occurs in the scapula with stimulating the phrenic nerve.

She has not required any somatostatin analogues (SSAs).\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】DIPNECH is an exceptionally rare condition. The majority of patients are women who have symptoms indicative of airways disease. It also disproportionately affects non-smokers. Reactive hyperplasia of neuroendocrine cells in the lung is known to happen in clinical cases where there is a clear reason to explain localised tissue hypoxia, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis and obstructive airways disease lead to localised hypoxia and thus stimulate the events that lead to the development of reactive neuroendocrine hyperplasia. In DIPNECH however, there is no such evidence of airflow obstruction to explain the histological finding of neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia that defines DIPNECH.\n\n【33】DIPNECH is the precancerous hyperplasia of neuroendocrine cells that has, by definition, not invaded the basement membrane. Much like cervical carcinoma in situ in which the cervical cells have not locally invaded the basement membrane, DIPNECH cells are still only in the hyperplastic phase of their precancerous cycle. 删除9：<u>4 </u>DIPNECH is the precursor of carcinoid tumours and tumourlets. 删除9：<u>1 </u>If the hyperplastic neuroendocrine cells have invaded the interstitium but to a depth less than 5 mm, then it is known as a carcinoid tumourlet. If the lesion has invaded to a depth greater than 5 mm into the interstitium, it is known as carcinoid tumour. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【34】Hypotheses have developed to explain the development of DIPNECH. One hypothesis describes how the release of gastrin-releasing peptide and bombesin stimulate local fibroblasts and smooth muscle cell proliferation, activating local inflammatory processes that lead to bronchoconstriction and thus hypoxia. 删除9：<u>3 </u>This hypoxia stimulates hyperplasia of neuroendocrine cells in the lung parenchyma. Other hypotheses postulate epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression which may stimulate local fibrosis of lung tissue. 删除9：<u>5 </u>There are usually multiple areas affected in the lung rather than a solitary lung lesion. Typically, patients have 10 or more nodules measuring less than 5 mm in size, these are considered tumourlets. 删除9：<u>6 </u>A significant proportion, however, will have 10 or more nodules measuring at least 5 mm in size, these are conventionally considered as carcinoid tumours.\n\n【35】There is no known treatment for DIPNECH and it is considered to be a precancerous condition, thus progression to carcinoid cancer continues to be a risk. Despite this, there is no consensus on the timescale for surveillance nor on the method of surveillance.\n\n【36】A recent study, which conducted long-term imaging follow-up showed a mean time-interval between baseline CT and evidence of metastatic spread of 67 months. The range, however, was large; between 14 and 123 months. In this cohort, 11% of patients diagnosed with DIPNECH progressed to metastatic cancer, which included both lymph node involvement and distant metastasis.\n\n【37】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【38】My breast cancer journey began over 30 years ago, when I had three operations, the last one being a mastectomy, but no further treatment. I subsequently had reconstruction to the left and augmentation to the right breast. The cancer returned several years later. Again I had three operations, resulting in a second mastectomy with dorsal flap reconstruction, followed by chemotherapy. The left implant eventually ruptured, and at that point I had them both removed. I wonder now if that would have had anything to do with the current situation.\n\n【39】### Learning points\n\n【40】*   Consider DIPNECH as a potential differential diagnosis in patients with multiple nodules on CT imaging.\n\n【41】*   The majority of patients with DIPNECH will have long-term disease progression on imaging with 11% of those progressing to metastatic cancer by 63 months or just over 5 years on long-term follow-up.\n\n【42】*   Consider long-term surveillance of more than 5 years in patients diagnosed with DIPNECH to monitor for progression.\n\n【43】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【44】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【45】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Hitesh Mathew for his kind help in obtaining the histology images provided in this case report.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:18:22", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:19:00", "cost": 37.65}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:19:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:18:21"}

Whole exome sequencing confirmed compound heterozygous mutations (c.1781T>A,p.Leu594\\*/c.2888A>G,p.Glu963Gly) in the _CEP290_ gene (12q21.32) without other inherited retinal degeneration (IRD)-associated variants detected.

CLEVER reportedly complicates 1%–5% of RCD, developing at 18–35 years, and is considered a vasoproliferative process secondary to the vascular/dystrophic changes of RCD. 删除9：<u>1–4 </u>CLEVER has been reported in several IRD genotypes (eg, _CEP290, CNGB1, CRB1, CRX, NMNAT1, PRPF8, RHO, RPGR, TULP1_ ) and phenotypes (eg, non-syndromic RCD, LCA and Usher syndrome). 删除9：<u>1 4 5 </u>A clear inheritance pattern for CLEVER is not apparent. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Indeed, the _CEP290_ variants in this case differ from those previously reported, suggesting that CLEVER is not mutation-specific but rather a secondary reactive feature catalysed by retinal degeneration. The mechanism is thought to be focal vascular dilatation and compromise of the blood–retinal barrier in response to physiological stressors (eg, RCD, surgical trauma). 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【11】CLEVER is most frequently binocular (78%) in contrast to isolated Coats disease which is monocular in 75% of cases. 删除9：<u>1 7 </u>It may be noted synchronously with RP diagnosis (33%) or later in the disease course. 删除9：<u>1 </u>The retinal telangiectasias and subretinal exudation are typically inferotemporal. 删除9：<u>1 </u>CLEVER may be detected earlier (ie, presymptomatically) in patients undergoing clinical review for existing conditions (ie, RCD) than in isolated Coats disease, thus, CLEVER may have a more favourable prognosis due to earlier initiation of intervention.

She had been referred with a diagnosis of cystoid macular oedema OD and had received posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone from another eye centre but with no visual improvement. The well-defined circumscribed morphology of the macular lesion raised a strong clinical suspicion of it being a sequela of optic disc pit maculopathy. However, repeated and careful examination of the fundus images, including a 30° image of the optic disc (obtained using the Zeiss 450 plus fundus camera) did not reveal an optic disc pit . Initial spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) through the optic nerve head (ONH) using 48 radii scan (Spectralis by Heidelberg) also failed to reveal the optic pit and depicted only a few cavitations along temporal slope of ONH . Owing to the strong suspicion, a repeat OCT scan, this time in the raster mode with 0.5 mm separation between the scanning lines, was undertaken. It was only after this that a breach in the membrane over ONH was revealed, confirming the presence of occult disc pit .\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Ultra-wide field image of right eye depicting a circumscribed hypopigmented macular lesion extending beyond the inferotemporal arcade with a foveal hyperpigmented scar (A) better appreciated on fundus autofluorescence (B).

I thought it was maybe acid reflux as I have had some episodes of heart burn in the past. I used to have trouble swallowing as well with all of the acid so it made it hard for me to eat. I ended up changing my diet to more fiber and protein and noticed that my heart burn went away! And because of all of that, I’ve lost about 15-pounds in the last couple of months. In addition to all of this, I started noticing some headaches around my temples, but I thought it could have maybe been related to ear infection.\n\n【21】### Learning points\n\n【22】*   Giant cell arteritis is a rare cause of stroke, especially in the vertebrobasilar territory.\n\n【23】*   Vessel wall MRI can help differentiate vasculitis from other causes of intracranial arterial narrowing.\n\n【24】*   Giant cell arteritis should be considered in elderly patients with spontaneous vertebral artery dissection-like presentation.\n\n【25】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【26】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【27】Obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:22:39", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:22:46", "cost": 7.426}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:22:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:22:39"}

She had been treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents including teneligliptin and voglibose at another hospital; however, her DM was not controlled well. Laboratory tests on admission revealed an elevated serum glucose level of 373 mg/dL and haemoglobin A1c level of 9.2%. An ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads V1–V4. Since her Killip classification was class IV, she was intubated with sedation. Coronary angiography revealed significant stenosis of the mid left anterior descending artery, and she subsequently received stent implantation. Her condition became stable after these treatments; however, she still required tube feeding after the withdrawal of intubation because of her poor swallowing function. At 2 weeks after the admission, she vomited several times after the administration of tube feeding. After 2 days, she suddenly experienced epigastric pain, in addition to vomiting. Her vital signs were a heart rate of 110 beats/min and a blood pressure of 118/72 mm Hg. A physical examination showed abdominal distension and epigastric abdominal tenderness without rebound tenderness or guarding. Laboratory findings showed white blood cells of 10 100 /µL, C reactive protein level of 1.00 mg/dL and elevated levels of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase of 222 U/L and alanine aminotransferase of 198 U/L) with normal levels of renal function and electrolytes. Chest radiograph  and enhanced abdominal CT revealed air in the gastric wall with gastric tube and hepatic portal venous gas . No air was detected in other intestinal tracts, and no obvious impairment of arterial flow was noted. As her vital signs were stable without malfunction of other organs, she did not undergo surgery but received conservative treatments with antibiotics and intravenous nutrition. The blood culture was positive for _Bacteroides uniformis_ . A follow-up CT scan performed 2 days later revealed the disappearance of hepatic portal venous gas . She was diagnosed with emphysematous gastritis and received antibiotic therapy for 2 weeks, and her condition finally remained stable.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Chest radiograph showing air in the gastric wall .</u>\n\n【7】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【8】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【9】(A and B) Enhanced abdominal CT revealing air in the gastric wall with gastric tube and hepatic portal venous gas.

A distinguishing factor between these is that with gastric emphysema there is no associated infection as well as patients not presenting with acute abdomen and having an excellent prognosis even with no treatment. 删除9：<u>3 </u>The risk factors for emphysematous gastritis include gastric surgery, corticosteroid uses, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug uses, ingestion of corrosive agents, stress, DM, immunodeficiency, high alcohol consumption, malnutrition and renal failure, whereas gastric emphysema results from air penetrating the wall from non-infectious aetiologies, such as raised intragastric pressures, trauma including gastric wall injury with nasogastric tube, malignancy, inflammation and ischaemia. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Diagrammatic explanations of the mechanism of emphysematous gastritis are shown in figure 3 . Although the exact pathophysiology of emphysematous gastritis remains unclear, it is thought that pre-existing gastric ulcers or ischaemic lesions provide the nidus for bacterial infection, overgrowth and penetration into the gastric wall. The organisms produce gas after the penetration, and finally emphysematous gastritis develops. The differentiation between emphysematous gastritis and gastric emphysema can be challenging but is important as clinical outcomes are totally different and indication for surgical treatment can vary. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Recent studies reported on the successful conservative treatments including fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, bowel rest, fluid hydration and total parenteral nutrition.

Other than COL1A1 and COL1A2, mutations in 20 other genes have been associated with OI phenotypes. Most of these genes are expressed in osteoblasts, and are directly involved in the metabolism of collagen type I. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【8】Mutation in SP7, encoding the osteoblast-specific transcription factor SP7 (also known as osterix), which is essential for bone formation, has been described to cause OI type XII, resulting in bone fragility with recurrent long bone fractures since early childhood, long bone bowing, scoliosis, short stature, early onset hearing impairment and delayed tooth eruption. 删除9：<u>4 </u>However, the exact dental phenotype has not been well described. Here, we report a boy known to have OI type XII, presented with impacted permanent dentition.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】The proband is a 17-year old boy known to have OI type XII due to a homozygous frameshift mutation in SP7 . Parents were healthy, non-consanguineous Chinese couple. He had recurrent long bone fractures since the age of 2 years and was started on intravenous pamidronate infusions since the age of 5 years. With decreased frequency of fractures, bisphosphonate treatment was stopped at 10 years of age. He developed vertebral collapse and another episode of long bone fracture at the age of 13 years, and hence bisphosphonate was reinitiated again with 6-monthly zoledronic acid until 15 years, after the closure of growth plates. He also had repeated orthopaedic surgeries, including left tibia corrective osteotomy and modified Sofield procedures of bilateral tibiae. He was ambulatory with normal development, and he had no hearing issue at the moment. No obvious dental issue was noted until he reached his adolescence, when he reported to have delayed shedding of primary dentitions.\n\n【11】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【12】He was eventually assessed by dental surgeon in our multidisciplinary joint bone clinic at the age of 16 years. The patient had maxillary hypoplasia in both anteroposterior and vertical dimension, resulting in overclosure of the mandible and a pseudo-class III malocclusion, as well as a small face when compared with the cranium . The perimeters of upper and lower dental arch were small, leading to relative macroglossia. Enamel hypoplasia was observed in the primary dentition, while the permanent teeth were not affected. He had retained primary dentition with only six permanent teeth (lower incisors, upper right and lower left first premolar) erupted. The primary dentition was yellowish-brown in colour and severely worn especially at the upper anterior teeth, which further leads to the loss of vertical dimension and overclosure of mandible . Orthopantomogram and cone-beam CT showed poor development of the upper and lower dento-alveoli, which was probably related to multiple unerupted permanent teeth. The roots of the retained primary teeth were partially resorbed, and the pulp chambers of upper and lower right primary teeth were obliterated. The permanent teeth had bulbous crown and short roots. Most of the unerupted permanent teeth positioned cervically to their retained primary predecessors. However, the lower right first molar and all second and third permanent molars were impacted . Lower right wisdom tooth was distally angulated. The lower right second molar was mesially angulated with the crown placed inferiorly to the root of the lower right wisdom tooth. The lower right first molar was further placed apically than the adjacent teeth. The upper right wisdom tooth was mesially angulated and upper right second molar was impacted apically . The lower left wisdom tooth was inverted and horizontally impacted the lower left second molar, it also mesially impacted the upper left wisdom, while the upper left second molar was also impacted on contralateral side.\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【15】Photos showed maxillary hypoplasia in both anteroposterior and vertical dimension, resulting in overclosure of the mandible and a pseudo-class III malocclusion as well as a small face as compared with the cranium.</u>\n\n【16】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【17】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【18】The primary dentition was yellowish-brown in colour and severely worn especially at the upper anterior teeth, which leads to the loss of vertical dimension and overclosure of mandible.</u>\n\n【19】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【20】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【21】Orthopantomogram showed poor development of the upper and lower dento-alveoli with multiple unerupted permanent teeth.

In view of his unpredictable dental eruption pattern, different possible treatment modalities had been considered. One possible treatment option would be selective extraction of primary teeth to facilitate the eruption of the permanent successors. Another option would be surgical exposure of the unerupted permanent teeth with bonding of orthodontic attachments, followed by orthodontic traction to facilitate eruption. If permanent dentition fails to erupt, surgical removal of permanent teeth followed by prosthesis would be considered. He would be reviewed regularly for the treatment progress and the need of combined orthognathic and orthodontic surgery to correct the underlying dentofacial deformity in the future.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】While delayed teeth eruption has been described in OI type XII, impaction of permanent dentition necessitating combined treatment of oral maxillofacial and orthodontic surgery has not been described. This is the first case describing the detailed dental manifestation of patient with OI type XII.\n\n【32】For OI due to mutations in collagen 1, DI is predominantly observed in those with qualitative collagen defects with moderate–severe OI rather than those having quantitative defects with mild OI. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Discolouration of teeth, cervical constriction and pulp obliteration were reported as frequent findings in patients with moderate–severe OI, yet these features vary between different OI populations. 删除9：<u>5–8 </u>DI affects both dentitions, but the primary dentition is usually more severely affected than the permanent dentition, 删除13：<u>9 </u>and this corresponded to our observation in our patient. Other than DI, tooth agenesis is a also common observation in OI and could contribute to mandibular and maxillary dysplasia, which could lead to dental malocclusion. 删除9：<u>10 11 </u>Retained deciduous teeth past the normal range of exfoliation, retention of molar teeth or impaction of permanent teeth has been reported in various OI types, including classical OI due to mutations in collagen type 1, as well as OI type V. 删除9：<u>12 13 </u>However, it has not been reported in OI type XII.\n\n【33】The dentition development involves an orchestrated process with multiple signalling pathways that are also important for skeletal development, 删除13：<u>14 </u>therefore, it is not surprising that genetic defects causing OI would also affect tooth development. However, the exact mechanism by which the variants in SP7 leading to dental impaction remained unknown.\n\n【34】The Sp7/Osx gene is protein coding gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor—osterix, which is expressed primarily by osteoblasts. It promotes the differentiation and maturation of pre-osteoblasts into functional osteoblasts and is crucial for bone formation and bone homeostasis. The clinical phenotypes of individuals with SP7 mutations include recurrent fracture, short stature, early onset hearing loss (secondary to otospongiosis and poor mineralisation of ossicles and petrous temporal bone) and delayed teeth eruption. 删除9：<u>4 </u>The role of Sp7 in tooth development remains unknown. Based on mice model, Sp7 is obligatory for the differentiation of both ameloblasts and odontoblasts but not for the initial tooth morphogenesis. Sp7-null mice exhibited features of craniofacial dysmorphogenesis, completely void of alveolar bone yet normal progression of initial tooth morphogenesis. With reduced proliferative capacity of Sp7-deficient ectomesenchyme, it resulted in small and misshapen teeth with randomly arranged cuboidal pre-odontoblasts and pre-ameloblasts. This implies the role of Sp7 in promoting the functional maturation and polarisation of odontoblasts. 删除9：<u>15</u>\n\n【35】Eruption of permanent teeth involves resorption of the surrounding alveolar bone and the roots of primary teeth. Bisphosphonates, a well-established medical treatment for OI, works by inhibiting osteoclast function and hence it could theoretically cause delayed tooth eruption. This phenomenon has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates. 删除9：<u>16 17 </u>However, there is only limited evidence for similar effects in humans.\n\n【36】In our patient, the tooth eruption was significantly delayed, and the permanent molars are severely impacted in four quadrants. Whether the dental phenotype is solely related to the SP7 mutation, or it was, at least, partially, contributed by prior bisphosphonates use, remained to be elucidated. Bisphosphonates treatment, being an anti-resorptive treatment, has been shown to be associated with delayed dental development and tooth eruption. 删除9：<u>18–20 </u>However, most available evidence came from cross-sectional observational studies with various OI types, the association should be interpreted with caution. It could be possible that, patients with more severe OI types would be more likely to be treated with bisphosphonates when compared with the milder ones, and that these patients with more severe phenotype could be associated with more prominent dental manifestation with delayed dental development. In addition, the so-called ‘delay in tooth eruption’ reported was only around 1 year. This does not explain the clinical phenotype in our case.\n\n【37】As for the treatment, one possible option would be selective extraction of the primary teeth to facilitate the eruption of their permanent successors. However, it would be technically challenging in view of complex impactions and closed apices with low eruption potential. Surgical exposure of unerupted permanent teeth and bonding of orthodontic attachments might be necessary, followed by orthodontic traction to facilitate eruption. Forced eruption of impacted teeth would be needed and the teeth could be treated as abutments for future dental prosthesis. Similar successful orthodontic treatments in patients with different OI types have been reported. 删除9：<u>21 </u>However, the treatment time could be considerably longer, and the goal of tooth movement might not be achieved with the history of bisphosphonates use. 删除9：<u>22 </u>If the eruption of permanent dentition could not be facilitated, surgical removal of permanent teeth followed by prosthesis would be needed. The underlying jaw discrepancy would be ultimately corrected by combined orthognathic/orthodontic treatment approach. This combined therapy for patients with severe malocclusion has been reported to lead to satisfactory aesthetic and functional outcome. 删除9：<u>22</u>\n\n【38】Our case highlighted the importance of multidisciplinary assessment in managing children with OI, and that the complaint of ‘delayed shedding of primary dentitions’ should be taken seriously with proper assessment by dental specialists. However, it could be challenging practically. Clark _et al_ reported the real-life challenges in referring individuals with OI to a tertiary dental clinic for further assessment, with the main barrier being geographic factors and need of extra travel. 删除9：<u>23 </u>In addition, individuals with OI usually have relatively short neck and some extent of immobility, which makes routine dental examination even more challenging. 删除9：<u>5 </u>This underscored the advantage of joint assessment in a combined multidisciplinary clinic with orthopaedic surgeons, paediatric endocrinologist/paediatric bone specialist, geneticist and dental specialists of oral and maxillofacial surgeon and orthodontist. This does not just save patients from another visit to the hospital, but also enhance communication between various disciplines. This also allows concentration of expertise to identify abnormalities and recommend for timely interventions, which, in the long run, would help to optimise the overall health outcomes of these individuals.\n\n【39】In conclusion, we described the detailed dental manifestation of a boy with OI type XII. While delayed teeth eruption has been described in OI type XII, impaction of dentition necessitating combined oral and maxillofacial surgical and orthodontic treatment has not been described. The case highlighted the need of multidisciplinary team assessment in this group of children.\n\n【40】### Learning points\n\n【41】*   This case described the detailed dental manifestation in a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta due to mutation in SP7 gene.\n\n【42】*   Delayed dental eruption in a child with osteogenesis imperfecta would have functional implication in the long run.\n\n【43】*   In managing children with osteogenesis imperfecta presenting with delayed dental eruption, early multidisciplinary team assessment would be beneficial to decide on the most appropriate and personalised treatment plan.\n\n【44】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【45】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【46】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was previously presented as an abstract at the International Conference on Children’s Bone Health (ICCBH) Virtual Forum Meeting on Bone Fragility Disorders in Children, 删除9：<u>18–20 </u>November 2020.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:42:15", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:42:30", "cost": 14.469}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:42:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:42:15"}

One of the pathophysiological features seen in COVID-19 is mucus hypersecretion, 删除13：<u>3 </u>which often leads to copious, thick secretions and mucus plugs. 删除9：<u>4–6 </u>Frequent suctioning and appropriate circuit humidification are, thus, very important in improving ventilation and avoiding deterioration. After over a year into the pandemic, our hospital has experienced multiple airway emergencies relating to ETT obstruction with mucus plugs necessitating reintubation. With this case we want to demonstrate some key learning points.\n\n【6】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【7】A woman in her 50s presented to hospital with a 2-day history of fever and shortness of breath. Her medical history included hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. She was an ex-smoker of 20 pack-years with no evidence of emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obstructive sleep apnoea managed with an overnight home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. After a day of support with CPAP on the medical ward her acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure worsened and she was intubated with an ETT of 7.5 mm internal diameter and transferred to the intensive therapy unit (ITU).\n\n【8】The patient had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with P:F ratio <13.3 kPa and a chest radiograph showed worsening bilateral interstitial infiltrates. She, therefore, remained on mandatory volume controlled ventilation, heavy sedation and a continuous infusion of atracurium for the first ten days. The patient received specific COVID-19 treatment with remdesivir and dexamethasone. During her first 2 weeks in ITU, she was proned seven times in total with initially significant, but gradually decreasing clinical responsiveness to this intervention. The patient was deemed not to be a candidate for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on the basis of premorbid function and a degree of improvement in gas exchange with proning. The patient’s secretion load substantially increased from day 9 when she developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia, and remained moderate even after this superimposed infection resolved by day 14.\n\n【9】During her third week of U admission, the patient showed an improvement in her gas exchange while supine, not needing any paralytic agents. As sedation was weaned, the patient was successfully switched to a spontaneous breathing pressure support mode with a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O. On day 20, however, the patient suddenly became tachypneic, hypoxaemic, tachycardic and hypotensive. Ventilator waveforms revealed severe expiratory airflow obstruction, significant air trapping and ineffective inspiratory efforts.\n\n【10】Investigations and differential diagnosis\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【11】Auscultation revealed air entry bilaterally and no wheezing. Arterial blood gas analysis showed the CO2 to be rising with stable oxygenation as reflected in the ABG in figure 1 , which showed unchanged PaO2. An in-line suction catheter was passed with little difficulty through the ETT and drew back minimal aspirates of sputum. Despite this somewhat reassuring finding, we maintained a suspicion of possible partial airway obstruction, i.e. mucus plugging, tube kinking or tube dislodgement. Chest X-ray revealed no interval change or tube dislodgement  and chest ultrasound did not suggest pneumothorax or lobar collapse. Afterwards, the patient was resedated, paralysed and ventilated with a volume controlled ventilation mode with the following settings: tidal volume (Vt) 420 mL, respiratory rate (RR) 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 8 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O, fraction of inspired oxygen 1.0, flow 60 L/min.\n\n【12】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【14】Arterial blood gas investigations 2 hours apart: before the emergency and during the emergency.

The end tidal CO2 trace and the expiratory flow trace on the ventilator screen persistently showed signs of severe expiratory airflow limitation.\n\n【19】The patient’s intrinsic PEEP (iPEEP) was 14 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O. As we further reduced PEEP from 8 to 5 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O in order to facilitate expiration, the patient showed worsening signs of air trapping, and an increase in iPEEP to 16 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O. Subsequent her blood pressure began to drop. The signs of air trapping and expiratory airflow obstruction remained evident. A diagnosis of bronchospasm seemed unlikely because this patient had equal air entry bilaterally and only a mildly increased Rtot of 15 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O. Therefore, another cause of deterioration was sought. 删除9：<u>7 8</u>\n\n【20】Taking all of this into account, the patient’s RR was reduced from 18 to 12 breaths per minute and her inspiratory to expiratory ratio was reduced from 1:2 to 1:4. This was done to facilitate expiration, CO <sub>2 </sub> clearance and to reduce dynamic hyperinflation with intrathoracic pressures suspected of potentially causing the haemodynamic compromise. However, none of these interventions managed to significantly improve the patient’s condition. Consequently, the decision was made to perform a bronchoscopy to visualise the airway from within.\n\n【21】Bronchoscopy revealed that a layer of pink mucus, which appeared to most of the team as mucosal tissue, had formed along the whole length of the tube. However, the blue line on the lower surface confirmed the scope was still inside the ETT . Despite the confusing lining of the tube, the lumen was patent and provided no resistance for the advancing scope. Approximately 24 cm down the length of the ETT, the scope was met by two mucinous flaps that extended out from the mucinous inner layer of the tube . The smaller immobile first flap and the second free-moving flap were not opposed directly across the diameter of the tube but rather the larger flap was positioned slightly below the smaller one along the length of the tube —similar to the two leaflets of a foramen ovale in an atrial septal defect. Thus, by this mechanism we hypothesise the suction catheters and bronchoscope were able to pass through both mucinous flaps and retract back without disrupting the valvular formations and their obstructive airway effect.\n\n【22】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【23】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【24】Inner layer of the endotracheal tube (note the blue line) on bronchoscopy showing two mucinous flaps 'open' during inspiration.</u>\n\n【25】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【26】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【27】Inner layer of the endotracheal tube (note the blue line) on bronchoscopy showing two mucinous flaps 'closed' during expiration created a ‘'one-way valve’' effect.</u>\n\n【28】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【29】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 5\n\n【30】Endotrachael tube after its removal.

Ventilator settings were adjusted to Vt 420 mL, RR 16, PEEP 8 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O, flow 60 L/min, generating Ppeak of 33 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O and Ppl of 24 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O, Rtot 9 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O/L/s. The patient’s iPEEP was the same as set PEEP. Oxygen requirements gradually came back to previous values and haemodynamic compromise resolved. After a few hours, sedation was gradually reduced and the patient was switched back to spontaneous pressure support ventilation mode. The patient’s ventilator was also changed to one with an active humidifying system connected to a circuit.\n\n【33】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【34】The patient has since progressed in her respiratory function and weaning, and was successfully tracheostomised on day 28 of Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) admission, decannulated on day 63 and discharged from ITU the following day for continued physiotherapy for critical illness polyneuropathy.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】This case report highlights several very importing learning points about the significance of secretion load in COVID-19, the importance of sufficient circuit humidification and a review of the respiratory mechanics seen with dynamic mucinous flaps inside an ETT.\n\n【37】COVID-19 can be a suppurative pathology which tends to form viscous and hard to suction gelatinous secretions and often result in mucohematic plugs. 删除9：<u>9 </u>A case series recently published by Wiles _et al_ described their experience with ETT obstruction among patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. They reported 11 intubated COVID-19 patients experiencing this complication and an overall incidence of 5.6%. 删除9：<u>10 </u>With our clinical case, we wanted to demonstrate that ETT obstruction in patients with COVID-19 is a serious, potentially fatal but avoidable complications that can be treated when recognised promptly. In addition, we would like to further analyse the reasons why mucinous flaps form in the first place and describe the effect they have on respiratory mechanics.\n\n【38】This patient had a high likelihood of developing mucus plugging for several reasons. First, long-term smoking is known to increase inflammation in the airway endothelium causing production of excess mucus. Second, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia tend to develop thick and sticky secretions. They often require thorough pulmonary hygiene including frequent suctioning, mucolytics and bronchodilators. Third, she had recently recovered from a ventilator associated pneumonia and continued to have ongoing moderate secretions, needing regular suctioning and circuit humidification. In our case these fairly nursing-intensive interventions could not always be guaranteed due to a combination of higher demands on staffing levels and an inconsistent skill-mix during the pandemic causing lower than usual nurse-to-patient ratios. However, the most important precipitating factor leading to this airway emergency was a lack of circuit humidification. Two days prior to this particular patient’s airway emergency, she was moved to a different part of the ITU in order to receive dialysis, and her ventilator was changed to an advanced ventilator model that did not have a built-in active humidification system. In lieu of this, a heat and moisture exchange (HME) was attached close to the patient end of the airway circuit. Even though the HME filters were changed daily, we believe this likely caused insufficient humidification contributing to the formation of thick and copious mucus deposits. HME filters are contraindicated in difficult-to-wean patients who have increased amounts of thick secretions and have higher minute volumes. 删除9：<u>11 </u>After this emergency was resolved, the patient was switched back to the original ventilator which had an active pass-over humidification system applied to the circuit and she subsequently didn’t need any further tube changes.\n\n【39】Though humidification is a relatively simple component it had slipped into the cognitive blind spot of the ITU team. While HME filters are a simple and cost effective intervention that is appropriate for the majority of patients needing intermittent mechanical ventilation, there exists a patient population that need more effective humidification measures. Torrego _et al_ describe in depth white and gelatinous secretions observed during bronchoscopy in intubated COVID-19 patients which often results in mucohematic plugs. They go on to suggest that the high incidence of this complication could be explained by the use of closed-circuit suction systems together with the HME instead of heated humidifiers. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【40】With respect to respiratory mechanics, during bronchoscopy, we observed one of the two flaps was static throughout the respiratory cycle serving only to narrow the lumen by a small margin. The second flap, and greater in size, extended out from the inner wall of the tube and was fully mobile throughout the respiratory cycle . With positive pressure ventilation the flap would mobilise downwards towards the distal end of the tube flattening itself against the wall of the tube contributing minimally to the narrowing of the lumen. This explains why there was only a mildly increased resistive component during inspiration. However, in expiration the flap would swing upwards and extend out into the centre of the tube’s lumen creating a near complete seal over the diameter of the tube . It is by this mechanism that we observed how the mucinous flaps created a near perfect one-way valve resulting in severe expiratory airflow limitation with dynamic hyperinflation and increased iPEEP. Similar respiratory mechanics have been observed in other cases of airway obstruction in patients with COVID-19. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【41】It is well known that in spontaneously breathing patients with airflow obstruction, the application of PEEP or increasing the PEEP leads to improvements in work of breathing and reduces dynamic hyperinflation. 删除9：<u>12 </u>In patients who are on controlled ventilation, the evidence suggests that application of low levels of PEEP compared with no PEEP may facilitate expiration by decreasing expiratory resistance and facilitating alveolar emptying. 删除9：<u>12–14 </u>Interestingly, reducing the PEEP in our patient, who was paralysed and ventilated, had a negative effect. The subsequent bronchoscopy findings were key to deriving an explanation for this observation. We hypothesise that the lower PEEP most likely caused the larger second mucinous flap to swing towards the centre of the tube’s lumen more prominently during expiration; thus resulting in the more severe expiratory airflow limitation observed in our case. Therefore, in the context of dynamic airflow obstruction during non-spontaneous ventilation, where reducing PEEP precipitates worsening of the airflow obstruction, a potential diagnosis may well be mucinous flaps causing a dynamic effect.\n\n【42】### Learning points\n\n【43】*   Think about secretion build up in endotracheal tube of intubated patients with obstructed airflow with suppurative pathology.\n\n【44】*   Easy passage of a suction catheter does not rule out partial or dynamic airway obstruction.\n\n【45】*   Crew resource management is important in organising labour intensive (although simple) therapies such as nebulisers and mucolytics.\n\n【46】*   Be mindful of scenarios where heat and moisture exchange is insufficient for the patient’s needs.\n\n【47】*   In the context of airway obstructions during controlled mechanical ventilation, a reduction in positive end expiratory pressure might worsen dynamic hyperinflation and air trapping.\n\n【48】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【49】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【50】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:58:02", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:58:13", "cost": 11.793}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:58:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:58:01"}

When faced with extensive bowel ischaemia, the surgeon is faced with a dilemma of resection of all definitive or suspected gangrenous bowel leading to short-gut syndrome and its sequelae or leaving behind potentially gangrenous bowel with risks of rupture and sepsis. This is especially true when the patient and hospital are in a low-resource setting without access to high technology or expensive treatment modalities. We report a case of acute extensive small bowel strangulation with ischaemia treated by staged surgery using a Bogota bag where there was partial recovery leading to adequate length of bowel and a successful outcome.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A 23-year-old man from a village 15 km away presented to our remote rural secondary level hospital with acute onset of intolerable abdominal pain and vomiting 2 hours prior to presentation in casualty. He was working as a security guard in a large city in south India, 删除13：<u>3500 </u>km away and was at home after being laid off due to COVID-19. He had no history of a similar episode in the past or previous history of abdominal surgery. Physical examination revealed a tense abdomen with palpable bowel loops. At presentation, he was stable with a pulse rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 98% and temperature of 99.2°F.\n\n【10】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【11】White blood count 18.0 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, haemoglobin (Hb) 159 g/L, hematocrit 46% and X-ray abdomen erect revealed multiple air-fluid level. Ultrasound abdomen showed dilated bowel loops with free fluid. Serum creatinine was 1.9 mg/dL.\n\n【12】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【13】The initial presentation and the persistent severe pain with the clinical findings of a tense abdomen with palpable bowel loops and worsening vital signs suggested bowel strangulation or acute ischaemia. There was no external hernia visible and the possibilities included internal hernias, midgut volvulus, superior mesenteric arterial occlusion, intussusception and entrapment in bands and adhesions. Since the hospital had no access to CT or MRI scans, the diagnosis could only be confirmed through an exploratory laparotomy.\n\n【14】Treatment\n---------\n\n【15】The patient was kept fasting, a nasogastric tube was inserted and aspirated, he was started on antibiotics and intravenous fluids, and he was being prepared for surgery after consent, about 4 hours after admission he suddenly became restless and tachypnoeic, and he had an unrecordable blood pressure. He was given 3 L of fluids and started on norepinephrine and taken for emergency surgery with a pulse rate of 160/min.\n\n【16】The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy under general anaesthesia with 3-minute pre-oxygenation followed by lignocaine 60 mg intravenously, ketamine 100 mg intravenously with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intravenously for induction. No anaesthetic gases were used as the patient was having a low blood pressure and was on inotropic support with dopamine at 10 mcg/kg/min. Succinyl choline 100 mg was given for muscle relaxation and rapid sequence intubation was done. One hundred per cent fractional inspired oxygen was given during intubation, entire surgery and immediate postoperative period. Intraoperative non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, ECG, urine output and temperature monitoring were done. Intraoperative findings showed that almost the entire small bowel (20 cm from the duodenojejunal flexure upto 30 cm from the ileocaecal junction) was trapped inside a right PDH . The herniated bowel was reduced and the edge of the mouth of the sac was slit anteriorly between the inferior mesenteric vein and the superior mesenteric artery to prevent re-occurrence. Due to limited space within the sac and the bowel with its mesentery being compressed by the sharp edges of the sac opening, almost all the small bowel within the sac was dusky with no peristalsis and absent mesenteric pulsations. The bowel was observed for 45 min, but there was no change; additional time was taken as the length of ischaemic bowel was extensive. Since resecting the entire unhealthy bowel would leave too little bowel for survival, it was decided to wait for upto 24 hours to see whether some of the bowel would recover.\n\n【17】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【18】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【19】Small bowel being reduced from the right paraduodenal hernia.</u>\n\n【20】Since it was not possible to easily reduce the distended bowel into the abdomen, temporary abdominal closure was done using a ‘Bogota bag’ created using plastic material from a urine drainage bag with the edge of the bag sutured to the linea alba around the wound.

In the initial 12-hour period, the patient showed signs of improvement in blood pressure and urine output. The colour of the bowel and blood gas analysis did not show significant change compared with the preoperative status. Eight litres of crystalloids were given during the 12 hours and dopamine infusion was tapered to 5 mcg/kg/min over this period. Over the following 6 hours, there was no improvement in acidosis, 0.25 L of dark red blood was collected in the abdominal drain, Hb dropped from 130 g/L to 100 g/L and there was a drop in urine output and blood pressure requiring additional crystalloid infusion with one unit of whole blood and increased infusion rate of dopamine. The colour of the bowel observed through the Bogota bag, which had initially showed some improvement, became darker.\n\n【25】In view of the deteriorating condition, it was decided to re-operate 18 hours after the first surgery. When the bowel was exposed and examined, it was found that there was a much clearer demarcation between viable and non-viable bowel and the length of viable bowel was now about 40 cm from duodenojejunal flexure and 60 cm from the ileocaecal junction. Resection and end-to-end hand-sewn anastomosis was done on healthy bowel with bleeding edges using interrupted 3–0 polyglactin sutures. During the initial course of management, antibiotics were started with ceftriaxone and metronidazole and this was changed to piperacillin and tazobactam and finally to meropenem.\n\n【26】The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery, his serum creatinine recovered to 0.7 mg/dL and he was discharged on the 10th postoperative day following the passage of semisolid stools.\n\n【27】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【28】The patient recovered completely and reported passing normal stools with a weight gain of 7 kg—from 44 kg at the time of discharge to 51 kg at 9 months. He was doing well but had not yet found a new job because of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】Internal hernias are a rare and potentially life-threatening condition with an incidence of 0.2%–0.9% among all cases of bowel obstruction. 删除9：<u>1–3 </u>Approximately 53% of reported cases of internal hernias are PDH. PDHs occur due to defects in the reduction and rotation of the developing midgut. In their theories, both Moynihan and Andrews say that PDH is caused by ‘physiological adhesions’ arising during return of the bowel back to the abdomen and fusion of the common dorsal mesentery with the posterior abdominal wall forming fusion folds and fossae. PDH may be associated with malrotation of the gut and is more common in males (M:F=3:1). 删除9：<u>4 </u>Depending on the direction in which the bowel herniates, PDH can be divided into left or right, of which right PDH is rarer than left PDH (right:left=1:3). Right PDHs are more prone to strangulation. 删除9：<u>5 </u>They are caused by herniation of bowel into the fossa of Waldeyer, an opening that lies in the mesocolon with the inferior mesenteric vein to the left posteriorly and the superior mesenteric artery to the right anteriorly . Bowel herniates into the retroperitoneal space and is drawn in by peristalsis. As with all herniae, obstruction and strangulation depend on the size of the opening, amount and type of contents, edge of the sac and elapsed time. In addition, strangulation can also occur in the non-herniated proximal jejunum due to torsion of the bowel as it enters the sac.\n\n【31】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【32】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【33】Anatomy of right paraduodenal hernia, showing bowel entering the fossa of Waldeyer with the superior mesenteric vessels along the medial border of the opening.

This modality was not available at the hospital, the nearest CT machine being 30 km away and the patient not fit for transportation.\n\n【35】Many centres have reported successful management of PDH laparoscopically, 删除13：<u>6 </u>more easily performed for left sided PDH. This option is not possible in an emergency setting with ischaemic bowel.\n\n【36】Any abrupt interruption or diminution of blood flow to the intestine leads to acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI). 删除9：<u>7 </u>Although most cases of AMI are caused by arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis or non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia, a similar pathophysiology occurs during strangulation when mesenteric vessels are occluded by external pressure. The classic picture of AMI involves severe unrelenting abdominal pain with a paucity of abdominal examination findings. Excessive third space fluid loss leads to tachycardia, tachypnoea and circulatory collapse. These findings were found in our case.\n\n【37】Assessment of viability of ischaemic bowel is usually based on intraoperative examination. This could be deceptive as it is possible that some bowel may appear ischaemic due to arterial spasm or venous insufficiency and could resolve over time. When a critical length of bowel is involved, it is important to be sure that potentially viable bowel is not resected. To objectively decide on the length of resection, several innovative technologies have been studied in the past, including pulse oximetry, polarographic measurement of tissue oxygen tension, spectrophotometry, intravital microscopy, Doppler ultrasound, hydrogen gas clearance, radioisotope studies, fluorescence studies, infrared imaging, laser doppler flowmetry, bowel wall contractility measurements, pH measurements, microdialysis and assessment of electrical properties. Although several of these methods have been evaluated, none of them have met the requirements for reliable clinical application. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【38】The Bogota bag was a plastic bag first used by Borraez Goana of Bogota. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Colombia and it has been used successfully for indications such as situations where early reoperation is necessary, to prevent abdominal compartment syndrome, for the treatment of gastroschisis in neonates, 删除13：<u>10 </u>for the treatment of secondary or tertiary peritonitis and for the treatment of missing portions of the abdominal wall. In this case, it was decided to wait for some time to see whether more viable bowel could be salvaged. Since reducing all the bowel without decompression could produce an abdominal compartment syndrome, a Bogota bag was fashioned using plastic material from a sterile urine drainage bag. It was also thought that since the material of the bag was transparent, it would be possible to monitor bowel appearance through the bag. The authors think that this is the first instance of the use of the Bogota bag for a similar situation.\n\n【39】In adult patients with small bowel syndrome, small bowel length of less than 100 cm is highly predictive of permanent intestinal failure. 删除9：<u>11 </u>The presence of terminal ileum and colon in continuity enhances survival probability. The hospital where the patient was treated is a remote rural hospital focused on providing high quality care at low cost to the poor. This patient would not have survived a major bowel loss requiring small bowel transplant or liver transplant. Total parenteral nutrition would also be beyond the scope of treatment as the cost would have been prohibitive.\n\n【40】The splanchnic circulation is governed by intrinsic (metabolic and myogenic) and extrinsic (neural and humoral) regulatory mechanisms. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Adaptive changes in this circulation are based on amount of oxygen delivery to tissue rather than blood flow. An acute decrease in perfusion pressure due to ischaemia is compensated by reduction in arteriolar resistance thereby maintaining splanchnic blood flow. There is significant redundancy built in, requiring only 20% of mesenteric capillaries to remain open to maintain normal oxygen consumption. However, when blood flow decreases below this threshold level, as occurs during bowel strangulation, regulatory mechanisms are overwhelmed, and oxygen debt ensues. When reperfusion occurs, additional cellular injury contributes both to necrosis as well as extent of recovery. When splanchnic blood flow is restored, as occurs when strangulation is relieved, oxygen extraction increases, providing relatively constant oxygen consumption over a wide range of blood flow rates. Tissues that have experienced irreversible damage will necrose and those that were borderline could recover.\n\n【41】As prolonged ischaemia leads to irreversible tissue necrosis, the main goal of treatment is the prompt restoration of intestinal blood flow. A second-look laparotomy (after 24–48 hours) is recommended, because the intraoperative assessment of bowel viability is often inaccurate. The rationale for this second look is based in part on the frequent occurrence of vasospasm after revascularisation. This is especially important when the length of healthy bowel is close to the limits required for nutritional viability. 删除9：<u>12</u>\n\n【42】Guidelines for the management of AMI and a position paper on damage control surgery have been published by the World Society of Emergency Surgery. 删除9：<u>13 14 </u>These include immediate fluid resuscitation with correction of electrolyte abnormalities, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and prompt laparotomy to re-establish blood supply to ischaemic bowel, resection of non-viable bowel and preservation of all viable bowel. There are no laboratory studies that are sufficiently accurate to identify the presence or the absence of ischaemic or necrotic bowel, although elevated I-lactate and D-dimer may assist (Grade 1B recommendation—strong recommendation with moderate quality evidence—applies to most patients in most circumstances without reservation). CT angiography should be performed as soon as possible for any patient with suspicion of AMI (Grade 1A recommendation—applies to most patients in most circumstances without reservation). Damage control surgery (DCS) is an important adjunct for patients who require intestinal resection due to the necessity to reassess bowel viability and in patients with refractory sepsis, planned re-laparotomy is an essential part of AMI management—this is a Grade 1B recommendation. Bowel, which is borderline ischaemic at the initial exploration, will improve after restoration of blood supply and physiological stabilisation. Re-exploration should be accomplished within 48 hours and decisions made regarding anastomosis, stoma, resection and abdominal closure. Since the bowel in these patients is often very swollen and at high risk for anastomotic leak, careful hand sewn techniques are preferable to stapled anastomosis. The open abdomen helps reduce the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome in patients requiring prolonged resuscitation. When the surgeon finds massive necrosis of most of the small bowel, he/she is faced with the philosophical question of whether to do anything. Resection of the entire involved bowel will result in short bowel syndrome with its serious associated consequences such as long-term parenteral nutrition and other advanced modes of treatment, which may not be a preferable state—counselling and consent should be obtained to judge whether palliation is the best treatment—this is a Grade 1C recommendation (strong recommendation but subject to change when higher quality evidence becomes available). All these guidelines were followed in our case except for the omission of CT scanning as it was not available.\n\n【43】After a period of 18 hours, it was deemed that further delay could cause worsening acidosis, sepsis and perforation of the ischaemic bowel. The bowel visible through the Bogota bag had not regained normal colour and had become darker over the last 6 hours of observation. At re-laparotomy, it was found that there was a clear demarcation between viable and non-viable bowel and some more bowel had recovered during the time that had elapsed between surgeries. The total length of viable bowel at the second surgery was 100 cm. Resection of non-viable bowel and end-to-end anastomosis was done with interrupted 3–0 polyglactin sutures with cut surfaces having bleeding edges.\n\n【44】Successful complete recovery of advanced bowel ischaemia due to strangulated internal hernia has been reported using damage control surgery with 24 hours and 48 hours of waiting between the first and second surgery. 删除9：<u>15</u>\n\n【45】From a global health perspective, the ideal treatment method in a low-resource setting should use locally available materials and should be affordable to the poor. The total cost of treatment for this patient was Indian rupees (INR) 30 164 (equivalent to US$399.46 @ INR 75.51=US$1). Since the patient could not pay this amount without selling a vital asset, he paid INR 11000 (US$145.67) and the remaining amount was given as charity.\n\n【46】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【47】I was working as a security guard in a city 3500 km away and had come home for holidays. One morning, I suddenly woke up from my sleep with extreme pain. The pain was so severe that I thought I was going to die. Then I immediately went to the hospital where I was given medication and underwent emergency surgery.

Vocal cord varices present a significant increased risk of haemorrhage, reportedly 10 times greater when compared with non-varix patients. 删除9：<u>1 </u>To our knowledge this is the first report of laryngeal varices secondary to a thyroid goitre.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】An 83-year-old woman with a known retrosternal goitre was referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient department at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, UK with symptoms of globus. She had undergone a thyroidectomy five decades previously for the treatment of a goitre. Recent observational CT imaging was suggestive of laryngeal varices prompting referral to ENT. The patient had no other comorbidities and took no regular medications. The only presenting symptom was that of a sensation of a foreign body in the throat.\n\n【10】Flexible nasendoscopy was performed by a consultant in the ENT department . Examination revealed dilated venous structures bilaterally along the aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, posterior commissure and extending in to the postcricoid region. Vocal cord movement was normal bilaterally and there was no visible mass lesion.\n\n【11】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【12】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【13】Flexible nasendoscopy showing dilated venous structures bilaterally along aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, posterior commissure and extending in to the postcricoid region.

The conclusion of the meeting was that the laryngeal varices were likely secondary to the goitre compressing the pharyngeal venous plexus. Since the patient was asymptomatic, the recommendation was made for conservative management with an interval CT scan in 1 year. If the patient were to develop new or worsening symptoms then a possible therapy might include treatment with radioactive iodine with the intention of reducing the size of the goitre. If the patient were to develop bleeding, then treatment might include examination under anaesthesia and cauterisation of the bleeding blood vessels.\n\n【16】Discussion\n----------\n\n【17】To our knowledge, this is the first report of laryngeal varices secondary to a thyroid goitre.

This case report describes a pregnant woman in her 30s who was hospitalised at 35 weeks gestation with moderate COVID-19 disease. Her condition worsened following delivery, and she required intubation, maximum ventilatory support and ECMO. Because of the severe and irreversible nature of her lung disease, she ultimately underwent bilateral lung transplantation. This case showcases lung transplantation as an alternative life-saving option for patients with severe COVID-19 associated respiratory failure refractory to ECMO and mechanical ventilation.

Options are limited for patients who show no improvement with these measures.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A woman in her 30s, gravida 1, para 0, with a medical history of ulcerative colitis presented in November 2020 at 35 weeks singleton gestation with headache, shortness of breath, cough, fever, chills, nausea and vomiting. She had not been vaccinated for COVID-19 at the time. On admission, her vital signs were notable for tachypnoea with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and hypertension with blood pressure of 157/88 mm Hg. Crackles were noted on examination. A PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 performed on admission was positive. Laboratory values were notable for hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia. There was no transaminitis or thrombocytopenia. Chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly with diffuse interstitial infiltrates. Venous duplex ultrasound showed no evidence of thrombosis in bilateral lower extremities.\n\n【10】Treatment\n---------\n\n【11】The patient had increased work of breathing and was started on supplemental oxygen through nasal cannula. She received a 14-day course of dexamethasone and a 5-day course of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19. Low dose heparin infusion was started for anticoagulation. She required up to 3 L/min of oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations above 95%.\n\n【12】On hospital day (HD) 5, she developed severely elevated blood pressure and was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia with severe features. Figure 1 displays a timeline of the patient’s clinical course. She underwent induction of labour and vaginal delivery of a female neonate on HD 7.

On HD 10, her oxygen saturations dropped to the low 80s and she was started on high-flow nasal cannula 40 L/min with 0.90 fraction of inspired oxygen. This was only able to be weaned to a minimum of 0.75 fraction of inspired oxygen over the next several days. She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics on HD 10 and received convalescent plasma infusions on HD 13 and 15. On HD 16, she became increasingly tachypnoeic, failed non-invasive ventilation and was intubated. Chest X-ray showed evidence of worsening bilateral pneumonia.\n\n【17】Over the next few days, she was intermittently positioned in the prone position in an attempt to improve oxygenation. She required the use of high positive end-expiratory pressures up to 20 mm Hg. With continued difficulties with ventilation and oxygenation despite the use of additional sedation and prone positioning, ECMO was considered. Risk stratification scores for ECMO patient selection predicted her clinical outcome to be poor, leading to initiation of venovenous ECMO on HD 21.

She developed right-sided heart failure and shock liver. She required increasing ECMO flow rates in the setting of worsening lung compliance. On HD 33, she underwent initial evaluation for lung transplantation given the severe and irreversible nature of her lung disease. As part of pretransplant evaluation, SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was repeated and was negative. Pulmonary transplant, cardiothoracic surgery, infectious disease, intensive care, heart failure, psychology and social work teams were involved in the transplant evaluation.\n\n【22】Over the course of the admission, there were multiple instances of initiation of treatment for possible sepsis. This was suspected in the setting of the patient’s respiratory failure with intermittent episodes of hypotension requiring the use of pressors, occasional fevers and increased cardiac output noted on monitoring. CT imaging on HD 35 showed diffuse consolidative groundglass opacities . This was most consistent with COVID-19 associated pneumonia; however, the patient was treated for possible postinfectious organising pneumonia with high dose steroids, with no subsequent improvement. Antibiotics and antifungals initiated for sepsis were all later discontinued after bacterial culture and PCR tests and fungal antigen tests resulted as negative.\n\n【23】The patient was listed for bilateral lung transplantation on HD 47. Severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular volume and pressure overload were noted on echocardiogram on HD 50. On HD 52, she experienced desaturations requiring urgent conversion to venoarterial ECMO.\n\n【24】On HD 57, she underwent bilateral lung transplantation. Intraoperative findings  showed severely reduced lung size with no motion noted on ventilation. The right lung was noted to have ruptured in the central portion, with a large clot filling this space. Significant inflammation and adhesions were noted around the hilum. Histopathological inspection showed diffuse alveolar damage of both lungs, cystic bullous spaces, extensive haemorrhage, prominent follicular hyperplasia in hilar lymph nodes and mucous plugs in bronchial lumens.\n\n【25】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【26】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【27】Gross and pathological findings.

The case presented here showcases lung transplantation as an additional life-saving option for COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory to ECMO and mechanical ventilation. Our patient demonstrated worsening lung compliance, required increasing ECMO flow rates, and had evidence of other organ damage including shock liver and right heart failure. A multidisciplinary selection committee deemed that due to the severity and irreversibility of her disease, she could not be expected to recover and that listing for lung transplantation was appropriate.\n\n【36】In the time since the case described in this report occurred, a second patient with COVID-19 has undergone bilateral lung transplantation at our institution in the immediate postpartum setting. In a literature search of management of COVID-19 associated respiratory failure, few case reports have described the use of lung transplantation. In the largest case series thus far by Bharat _et al_ , 删除13：<u>6 12 </u>patients from various institutions across four countries were identified who underwent bilateral lung transplantation in the setting of COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. Histopathological evaluation of the explanted native lung tissue from these patients showed features of pulmonary fibrosis, which supports the findings of irreversible lung damage. Evidence from these cases suggests a time period of 4–6 weeks as sufficient to exclude the possibility of native lung recovery and supports the consideration of lung transplantation for COVID-19 associated respiratory failure in the absence of other organ system dysfunction.\n\n【37】To consider the option of lung transplantation for future patients with severe COVID-19, a multidisciplinary approach is needed to delineate appropriate candidates, with consideration of the limited availability of donor organs. The median survival of patients who undergo lung transplantation is 6.7 years, 删除13：<u>7 </u>with survival most affected by development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction. Further studies are needed to evaluate the likelihood of transplant rejection, the possibility of recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the allograft and long-term outcomes.\n\n【38】### Learning points\n\n【39】*   Lung transplantation offers an alternative life-saving option for patients with severe COVID-19 associated respiratory failure refractory to established treatments.\n\n【40】*   Pregnant women with COVID-19 may have higher mortality in the postpartum period than during pregnancy and later onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome when related to COVID-19.\n\n【41】*   A multidisciplinary approach for patient selection for lung transplantation should be developed to create a standardised process for patients with COVID-19 who are not responding to other therapies.\n\n【42】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【43】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【44】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Karla Passalacqua, PhD, ELS, Stephanie Stebens, MLIS, AHIP, Shereen Zia, MD.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:50:41", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:51:31", "cost": 50.539}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:51:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:50:41"}

Twenty-8 days after the initiation of antibiotic therapy, black discolouration developed on her tongue . She was diagnosed with antibiotic-induced black hairy tongue based on characteristic visual inspection and advised to practice good oral hygiene. She was reluctant to switch to a different antibiotic since she had a documented cephalosporin allergy. Therefore, we informed her that there was a possibility of improvement without changing antibiotics, and she elected to continue with the current therapy and maintain good oral hygiene. Two weeks after diagnosis, despite the continued antibiotic therapy, the tongue discolouration started resolving and turned brownish .

It can be caused by various factors, such as medications, alcohol and smoking, poor oral hygiene, oral lavage and underlying systemic conditions, such as malignancy. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Several antibiotics, including minocycline, doxycycline, erythromycin, linezolid, amoxicillin-clavulanate, metronidazole and piperacillin–tazobactam, have been reported to cause black hairy tongue. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Although the literature review generally reported an onset period of 14 days, there have been reports of onset periods as long as 7 weeks or 5 months. 删除9：<u>2 </u>The optimal treatment remains unclear. However, the condition can be improved by the discontinuation of the causative agents, if possible, and by maintaining good oral hygiene. In our case, practicing good oral hygiene helped to improve the condition even during antibiotic therapy.\n\n【8】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【9】When the infection subsided, I noticed that my tongue had turned black while washing my face. I was surprised, of course, and I was sad because I thought I was going to die. I consulted a doctor and was relieved to hear that the condition could be improved by cleaning my mouth. I then made a conscious effort to keep my mouth clean. Gradually, the black part of my tongue began to peel off, and now it is almost back to normal.\n\n【10】### Learning points\n\n【11】*   Black hairy tongue is a rare but striking benign condition characterised by defective desquamation and hypertrophy of the tongue filiform papillae, with black tongue discolouration.\n\n【12】*   Several antibiotics have been reported to cause black hairy tongue.\n\n【13】*   Treatment includes discontinuing the causative agents, if possible, and maintaining good oral hygiene.\n\n【14】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【15】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【16】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:58:55", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:59:01", "cost": 6.217}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:59:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:58:55"}

Work-up revealed positive serology for SLE (positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) and antidouble-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies). Her complete blood count, urine analysis and urinary protein-creatinine ratio were within normal limits. She was started on hydroxychloroquine and prednisone 60 mg/day. Weeks later, she presented with worsening of her skin rash that extended to involve her whole body, tingling and numbness of her hands and feet, which was not present at the time of the initial presentation. On clinical examination, she had diffuse hair thinning and arthritis involving her wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints and knees. Her face showed diffuse erythema with nodular lesions on the cheeks and chin. Her trunk and extremities also showed diffuse erythematous nodular skin lesions , and she had diminished sensation in all extremities. Based on her serology and physical findings, she fulfilled the Systemic Lupus International Collaboration Clinics classification criteria for SLE; however, nodular skin lesions were not typical of SLE or worsened on immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, she was referred to the dermatology department for assessment. A skin biopsy was obtained, and pathology revealed diffuse infiltration of the dermis with foamy histiocytes, and Ziehl-Neelsen stain demonstrated acid-fast bacilli within the macrophages . The diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy was confirmed with a skin biopsy, and the rheumatological manifestations and positive serology were attributed to leprosy. Hydroxychloroquine was discontinued, and prednisone was tapered over a period of 6 months. Antimycobacterium therapy with rifampin, dapsone and clofazimine was given for a year. During her follow-up, she had significant improvement in her skin nodules and arthritis.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Erythematous nodular skin lesions involving the face, trunk and extremities.</u>\n\n【7】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【8】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【9】Skin biopsy: (A) demonstrating diffuse infiltrate of foamy histiocytes in the dermis separated from the epidermis by a green zone (H&E stain at 100× magnification), (B) dermis showing foamy histiocytes (H&E at 400× magnification) and (C) Ziehl-Neelsen stain at 400× magnification demonstrating acid-fast bacilli within macrophages, some of which are clumped (globi) (arrow).</u>\n\n【10】Leprosy classically presents with neurological and skin manifestations followed by musculoskeletal involvement as Charcot’s arthropathy and symmetrical polyarthritis. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Other reported manifestations include fever, vasculitis, epididymitis, glomerulonephritis, pericarditis and pleurisy. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Less common, yet clinically diverse presentations of leprosy include haemolytic anaemia, alopecia, photosensitivity, generalised lymphadenopathy, glomerulonephritis, serositis and Raynaud’s phenomenon.

In the context of the spleen, these lesions mean that the patient has no history of malignancy and no symptoms, such as fever, weight loss and upper abdominal discomfort. Unexpected splenic lesions are frequently identified on CT in daily clinical practice. Although most lesions are benign, clinicians should be alert to warning findings as follows: the presence of solid, contrast-enhancing components and ill-defined lesion borders. 删除9：<u>1 </u>These findings suggest the possibility of potentially more relevant diseases, such as malignancy, abscess and sarcoidosis. Alternatively, splenic incidentaloma detected on chest X-ray is rare.

They are a form of non-parasitic primary cysts. They are composed of cystic lesions lined by keratinising and nonkeratinising epithelia, which may be squamous or cuboidal.

Preservation of this nerve from iatrogenic injury is an important consideration; this was widely recorded as a consequence of radical neck dissection (RND). Following the 1950s, the RND was revisited and modified approaches to neck dissection were employed, achieving reduction in overall morbidity, including improved function of the SAN postoperatively. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【8】Iatrogenic damage (75%–90%) is known to be the most common aetiology of SAN injury, which is clinically encountered postoperatively in neck dissections and rarely in lymph node needle biopsies. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>A spectrum of clinical presentations arise from damage to the SAN, commonly known as SAN palsy, which may present as drooping of the shoulder secondary to trapezius paralysis, shoulder weakness (in abduction), winging of the scapula and trapezius muscle atrophy. Anatomical variations of the SAN towards the skull base and its course in the posterior triangle are recognised to be potential causes of increasing rates of iatrogenic damage. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【9】Identification of the SAN has been a challenge for surgeons as great anatomical variation has been described throughout the literature. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the topographical anatomy is of utmost importance in neck dissection in order to avoid debilitating postoperative consequences. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Although selective and modified techniques of neck dissection are now common practice, it has been shown that the incidence of shoulder injury remains high. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【10】We present a case of a patient undergoing parotidectomy with selective neck dissection for a primary parotid squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We aim to discuss the surgical and clinical implications of a dual SAN and its rare relationship to the internal jugular vein (IJV).\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】The male described in this case report, who was in his 80s, was referred to the otolaryngology department with an enlarging left parotid mass. Examination revealed a mobile parotid tumour, no evidence of facial nerve involvement and the remaining head and neck was unremarkable, including skin survey. The patient had a medical history of surgically resected right shin basal cell carcinoma (BCC), hiatus hernia, osteoarthritis and gastritis. There were no known drug allergies. He had good functional capacity and was fully independent with all activities of daily living.\n\n【13】Following clinical review, a neck ultrasound scan and subsequent CT revealed a 15 mm tumour of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland . Initial fine-needle aspiration was suspicious of malignancy and subsequent core biopsy confirmed SCC. There was no evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy or metastatic disease on CT staging. Positron emission tomography (PET) CT was undertaken given the rarity of primary parotid SCC to exclude an alternative primary site; however, the PET CT showed no increased avidity elsewhere in the head and neck. Although the dual SAN was present and visible on the preoperative scans, it was not reported by the radiologists or noted by the parent team.\n\n【14】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【15】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【16】CT scan showing parotid tumour.</u>\n\n【17】The patient subsequently consented for the undertaking of a left superficial parotidectomy and level Ib-III selective neck dissection.

The nerve following the anomalous course was the dominant nerve and the nerve following the usual course was the non-dominant accessory nerve, in terms of size; these definitions will be subsequently used to refer to each nerve.\n\n【22】Following its exit at the jugular foramen, the non-dominant nerve travelled medial to the IJV and then coursed laterally over the vein to run obliquely, inferior and lateral, to reach the deep surface of the SCM. After supplying the muscle at this point, it ran 1–2 cm superior to Erb’s point and crossed into the posterior triangle, embedded in loose connective tissue (the full nerve course was not dissected, as there was no clinical rationale to dissect level V).\n\n【23】The dominant nerve descended on the posterior surface of the IJV traversing through the vein, dividing the IJV into two, to emerge anteriorly at the junction of upper and middle third of the vein . The anomalous course continued inferiorly on the anterior surface of the IJV to level III of the neck, finally coursing inferiorly and laterally  without supplying SCM, into level 5 towards the trapezius muscle; again complete nerve dissection was not justified clinically.\n\n【24】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【25】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【26】SAN traversing IJV.

The patient required input from the physiotherapy team for rehabilitation and movement exercises. Subsequently, the patient made a complete recovery with regard to left shoulder function. On follow-up since the parotidectomy and neck dissection, the patient displayed no signs of local or regional recurrence of cancer.\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】The variations in the anatomy of CN XI have shown to present challenges in the avoidance of iatrogenic damage. Duplication of the SAN is a rare anatomical phenomenon, which has a reported incidence of 1.8%. Ajayi _et al_ , in their study of 56 cadaveric cases, reported two cases in which the SAN was duplicated. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【33】Damage to the SAN is the most common complication of neck dissection and the second most iatrogenically damaged peripheral nerve. 删除9：<u>8 </u>The accessory nerve is unique in that its nerve fibres originate from both the spinal cord and the medulla. In its normal course, the SAN along with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves emerges from the jugular foramen, passes deep to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and courses through or deep to the SCM muscle to innervate the SCM, before traversing the posterior triangle of the neck and terminating at the trapezius muscle, which it also innervates. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【34】There are several anatomical variations of the SAN which have been documented to date. The variation may be in terms of anatomical structure or the course of the nerve in the upper neck. The SAN may be duplicated, it may transverse the IJV ventrally (39.8%), dorsally (57.4%) or through the IJV (2.8%), there may be varying number of branches originating from the SAN. 删除9：<u>9 </u>In historical head and neck anatomy teaching, the SAN is usually described as crossing the IJV ventrally; however, as seen in our case, the SAN can also be seen to traverse the IJV or cross it dorsally. Saman _et al_ , in their cadaveric study of the relationship between the SAN and IJV, showed that the SAN courses anteromedial to the IJV in 87% of cases and exits the jugular foramen laterally to IJV in 67% of cases. Due to the morbidity associated with IJV injury, it is vital that surgeons are aware of the anatomical variations which may be encountered regarding the relationship of the SAN to the IJV. 删除9：<u>10</u>\n\n【35】As described in our case report, two rare variations were encountered in our patient, that is, a dual SAN, with the non-dominant nerve running ventrally to the IJV and the dominant nerve traversing the IJV. A number of variations in the nerve’s relationship to the SCM muscle have also been described. The SAN does not penetrate the SCM in 45.9% of cases and penetrates via branches in 53.1% of cases. 删除9：<u>9 </u>A plethora of literature on the anatomical variations of the SAN exists; however, to our knowledge, there has only been one other report of a duplex SAN, reported in Agha Khan University, Pakistan. Danish _et al_ reported a case of aman in his late 40s with a left buccal SCC, managed with excision and selective neck dissection (SND). During SND, they also reported a duplicated SAN; their patient denied symptoms of shoulder dysfunction postoperatively. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【36】In surgical operations concerning the posterior triangle of the neck, manipulation of the SAN causes postoperative functional morbidity, and this is known as ‘shoulder syndrome’, which describes the symptoms occurring as a result of SAN palsy. This may be in the form of shoulder pain, difficulty elevating the shoulder, scapular winging leading to trapezius muscle atrophy. 删除9：<u>12 </u>The occurrence of the symptoms of SAN palsy have been reported to vary with type of neck dissection being undertaken. The frequency of postoperative morbidity of the SAN in RNDs is 46.7%, 42.5% in selective neck dissections and 25% in modified neck dissections (MNDs). Therefore, although MNDs have significantly lower rates of postoperative morbidity, they have similar regional control rates as seen in the other more radical techniques. 删除9：<u>12</u>\n\n【37】In order to prevent the sequelae of postoperative shoulder dysfunction and iatrogenic damage of the nerve, preservation of the SAN is of utmost importance. To ensure this, detailed knowledge of the anatomical variants of the SAN as well as the course of the nerve in the posterior triangle of the neck is vital. The MND aims to preserve the SAN, in an attempt to prevent the potential functional deformity associated with section or injury of the nerve. Intra-operatively, early identification of the position of the SAN as well as its relationship to the IJV is crucial, to avoid injury to these structures. Intraoperative nerve stimulation should be used frequently in an MND, to ensure the SAN is being stimulated throughout. Erb’s point can often be used as a reliable landmark in identifying the SAN. 删除9：<u>12</u>\n\n【38】In the management of SAN palsy, the most crucial step is recognition of this complication. Electromyography may be of benefit in the early diagnosis of iatrogenic nerve injury, allowing for prompt physiotherapy intervention, although accessibility is highly dependent on local resources. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Simple interventions such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used to aid in the relief of associated pain. In severe cases, where pain is a debilitating issue, management options may include nerve transfer or nerve grafting, and these can give some potential improvement in postoperative disability. 删除9：<u>13</u>\n\n【39】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【40】The preservation of the SAN or avoidance of damage is made technically challenging due to the variations in topographical and surgical anatomy, as well as factoring in the rare anatomical variations such as a duplex SAN and its relationship to the IJV. Damage to the SAN can lead to a number of debilitating postoperative consequences, which may require further management. Therefore, a sound appreciation of the common and rare anatomical variations of the SAN, as well as early identification of the nerve intraoperatively, is of fundamental importance for surgeons in approaching a neck dissection surgery/lymph node biopsy in order to reduce the risks of postoperative functional disability.\n\n【41】### Learning points\n\n【42】*   The identification of the spinal accessory nerve (SAN) in neck dissection is important to avoid iatrogenic damage.\n\n【43】*   A dual SAN is an anatomical anomaly which has a reported incidence of 1.8%.\n\n【44】*   Damage to the SAN during neck dissection surgery leads to debilitating sequelae.\n\n【45】*   It is important to be aware of anatomical variations of the SAN which may be encountered in neck dissection.\n\n【46】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【47】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【48】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:26:25", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:26:47", "cost": 22.253}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:26:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:26:25"}

We describe the case of a young man in his 40s who was referred to our clinic for management of a large orbital mass probably arising out of the ocular surface covering the whole globe . The fungating mass measured 5×5 cm, multilobular with overlying necrotic areas and haemorrhagic points. Reviewing his medical records, it was evident that 3 years ago, he underwent an enucleation procedure, which had to be halted due to intraoperative heart block. His condition at the time was critical, necessitating intensive care and significant resuscitation efforts. Due to the complexity of his case and the challenges associated with administering general anaesthesia, orbital exenteration was deemed unfeasible. Instead, an incision biopsy was performed to confirm the histopathology as invasive SCC . Subsequently, he was referred to a radiation oncologist to initiate definitive radiation therapy. The patient underwent conformal beam radiotherapy, specifically external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), targeting the left orbit. The treatment involved the use of 6 mV photon beams, with a total dose of 30 Gy administered over a span of 2 weeks, consisting of 10 fractions . EBRT was divided into 3 Gy/fraction as phase 1 and boost dose of 10 Gy in five fractions. The patient responded well to radiotherapy with adequate reduction in tumour mass, globe salvage as well as vision salvage .

Among cited infections of the respiratory tract, many of the reports are in patients with manipulation of the urogenital tract, concurrent trauma, intracranial injury, transplant patients or otherwise immunocompromised patients. 删除9：<u>1–6 </u>Outside of the respiratory tract, _M. hominis_ has been implicated in cases of mediastinitis, meningitis, joint infection and endocarditis. 删除9：<u>7–11</u>\n\n【8】_M. hominis_ is a common coloniser of the urogenital tract where it was originally discovered along with other genital mycoplasmas such as _Ureaplasma urealyticum_ . 12 _M. hominis_ can be found in the urogenital tract of up to 53% of sexually active asymptomatic women, with slightly less incidence in men. 删除9：<u>13 </u>While these organisms are thought to be commensal colonisers, they have been implicated in infections of the urogenital tract, pregnancy complications, neonatal infections and infertility. 删除9：<u>14–17</u>\n\n【9】_M. hominis_ may often go under recognised as a cause of infection due to its fastidious growth requirements, difficulty growing and being recognised using standard blood culture methods, or the difficulty to see the colonies it forms on standard cell culture. 删除9：<u>2 3 12 18 </u>While culture remains the gold standard for identification and is important for susceptibility testing, PCR methods have also been used to identify cases.\n\n【10】As mycoplasma species do not have a cell wall, they are inherently resistant to antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis such as beta-lactams, cephalosporins and glycopeptides. _M. hominis_ also demonstrates resistance to commonly used macrolides such as erythromycin but is generally susceptible to fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines, although some resistance to different agents has been noted. 删除9：<u>19–21</u>\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A man in his early 40s presented with 5 days of worsening fever, body aches, sore throat, shortness of breath and productive cough with accompanying pleuritic pain. He was hypotensive and tachycardic. He had increased work of breathing with diminished lung sounds in the right lung field. He had leucocytosis of 13.6/mm <sup>3 </sup> (normal range 4–11/mm <sup>3 </sup> ) and neutrophil count of 12.7/mm <sup>3 </sup> , and procalcitonin was elevated to 9.46 ng/mL (normal range <0.05 ng/mL). Chest radiograph (CXR) and CT imaging of the chest revealed a mass-like 5.2 cm cavitary lesion in right upper lobe, left lower lobe consolidation and small left pleural effusion . SARs CoV-2 testing was negative via nasopharyngeal PCR swab, and there were no sick contacts. He had a history of well-controlled asthma on combination long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch for weight loss 14 years prior, and was on emtricitabine-tenofovir for pre-exposure prophylaxis.\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【15】(A and B) The chest radiograph at time of initial presentation (A) demonstrating the cavitary mass in the right upper lobe measuring about 5.2 cm in diameter, left lower lobe consolidation and small left pleural effusion.

Ammonia level, zinc or selenium were not checked throughout the evaluation.\n\n【18】Nine days following his initial presentation, he was found to be hypotensive with diminished left lung sounds despite lack of symptoms while receiving his daily antibiotic infusion at an outpatient infusion centre. On evaluation in the emergency department with this second presentation, there was a new leucocytosis of 19.5/mm <sup>3 </sup> , and CXR was notable for large left hydropneumothorax with signs of tension .\n\n【19】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【20】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【21】(A–D) Chest radiograph at time of readmission (A and B) demonstrates large left hydropneumothorax with evidence of tension demonstrated by midline shift and also persistence of right upper lobe cavitary lesion.

One noted growth of _M. hominis_ in the thioglycolate broth only and was reported out by the lab 5 days after chest tube placement. Blood cultures remained negative. Fungal cultures, silver stain and cytology performed on pleural fluid also remained negative. Sputum cultures with acid-fast bacilli with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ DNA direct probe PCR were all negative. Serum IgG, IgA and IgM were all within normal limits.\n\n【24】Treatment\n---------\n\n【25】He was initially treated empirically with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. Following improvement during initial presentation, antibiotics were transitioned to intravenous ceftriaxone and oral metronidazole with a plan to complete 4 weeks of this therapy outpatient and repeat imaging towards the end of this course. At initial discharge, he was noted to have cavitary lesions without empyema and did not have any indication for surgical treatment.\n\n【26】Following chest tube placement at second presentation, 删除9：<u>2 </u>L of purulent material were drained. CT imaging at this time again demonstrated mass-like cavitary lesion in right lung in addition to an interval increase is opacities of the left upper and lower lobe, significant bilateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema likely secondary to chest tube placement and mediastinal gas on the right. Antibiotic therapy was broadened to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at this point. Following clinical improvement, he was transitioned to vancomycin and cefepime and later restarted on intravenous ceftriaxone and oral metronidazole. Identification of _M. hominis_ from pleural fluid prompted addition of oral doxycycline 100 mg two times per day to the antibiotic regimen.\n\n【27】Repeat CT imaging 1 week into this hospitalisation showed some improvements in pneumomediastinum, noted stable cavitary areas and raised new concerns for bronchopleural fistula due to subcutaneous gas with possible signs of infection. Thoracic surgery was consulted with consideration of video-assisted thoracoscopic decortication.\n\n【28】Initial findings in the operating room included a large chest wall abscess under serratus anterior muscle, necrosis of serratus and intercostal muscles as well as the overlying fascia, loculated pleural effusions, dense adhesions with thick pleural rind and other purulent material. This was debrided and irrigated extensively before the wound was packed. No clear sign of bronchopulmonary fistula was noted during initial decortication. The patient would require two more trips to the operating room for irrigation, debridement, and finally wound vac placement.\n\n【29】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【30】Due to concern for possible tetracycline resistance and with _M. hominis_ susceptibility testing still pending at an outside lab, the patient was discharged on a 6-week course of oral levofloxacin to cover _M. hominis_ and oral metronidazole for empiric anaerobic coverage. Susceptibility testing at an outside laboratory did demonstrate susceptibility to clindamycin, tetracycline and levofloxacin. Follow-up imaging demonstrated resolution of the hydropneumothorax.\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】We have described a case of _M. hominis_ pneumonia presenting with a cavitary lesion and progressing to empyema and necrotising pneumonia in an immunocompetent adult without clear risk factors. While _M. hominis_ has been noted to cause severe disease with progression to necrotising pneumonia, it has not been associated with cavitary lesions previously. Our case also reinforces challenges noted in similar cases in that empiric antibiotics commonly used to treat pneumonia are ineffective against _M. hominis_ , identification can be difficult as it is a fastidious and slow-growing organism, and recovery can depend on transition to appropriate antibiotic therapy. We feel that the unique aspects of this case add to previously reported cases of _M. hominis_ pneumonia in immunocompetent patients.\n\n【33】Identification of the organism is a crucial step in the clinical course of patients with _M. hominis_ so that appropriate modifications to therapy can be made. _M. hominis_ can be lysed or killed by saline, the wooden shaft of collection swabs or sodium polyanethol sulfonate found in blood culture bottles. 2 12 _M. hominis_ has also been noted to not cause visible change in blood culture bottles or turbidity due to its small size 12 22 and may require subculture for detection as was done in two of the cases reviewed. 删除9：<u>2 6 </u>The colonies that grow on agar are also small with a classically described ‘fried-egg’ appearance due to the clear pinpoint centre and translucent surrounding which can be difficult to identify with the naked eye. 删除9：<u>2 23 </u>Despite this, culture remains the gold standard for identification of _M. hominis_ as it can help guide therapy with susceptibilities, with increasing resistance to antibiotics typically used to treat. Similar to other cases, _M. hominis_ was not identified in our case until 14 days after his initial presentation and 5 days after chest tube placement and drainage of a pulmonary empyema.\n\n【34】PCR methods, usually targeting 16S rRNA, can also be used to identify _M. hominis_ . 删除9：<u>13 </u>In one of the cases reviewed, eubacterial PCR was used to identify the organism, and culture was later used to yield susceptibilities. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Identification with PCR may be less useful to demonstrate clinically significant disease in the urogenital tract as it is a commensal organism commonly found there but could be more useful in extragenital locations.\n\n【35】The biology of _M. hominis_ informs antibiotic treatment and its inherent resistance to numerous classes of antibiotics. As _Mycoplasma_ species lack a cell wall, they are naturally resistant to therapies that target peptidoglycan synthesis such as cephalosporins, beta-lactams and glycopeptides as well as demonstrating resistance to other classes of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides, sulfonamides and trimethoprim. 删除9：<u>22 </u>Unlike _M. pneumoniae_ , _M. hominis_ exhibits resistance to commonly used macrolides such as azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin. 删除9：<u>6 20 21 </u>The most commonly recommended antibiotics for treatment of _M. hominis_ include tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and clindamycin.\n\n【36】Early case reports have expressed concern about increasing resistance to tetracycline in association with the tetracycline-resistant element (tetM). 删除9：<u>19 20 </u>Resistance to tetracycline seems widely variable based on geography with some areas of the USA having tetracycline resistance as high as 50%, and there is susceptibility to doxycycline even in stains resistant to tetracycline. 删除9：<u>12 24 </u>Fluoroquinolones have been cited as better treatment options with lower resistance rates, except in China. Resistance to fluoroquinolones is due to changes in quinolone resistance-determining regions which are coding regions for DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV, the drug targets. 删除9：<u>25 </u>Two studies demonstrating the high rates of fluoroquinolone resistance in China reported 52/57 and 11/13 of _M. hominis_ samples were resistant, with comparisons showing higher resistance to ciprofloxacin over levofloxacin. 删除9：<u>25 26</u>\n\n【37】In Samra _et al_ , looking at rates of resistance in _M. hominis_ samples in Israel found 9/110 resistant to doxycycline with higher resistance to tetracycline, while noting none of the samples had resistance to levofloxacin. 删除9：<u>21 </u>In Krausse _et al_ , 290 _M_ . _hominis_ and _Ureaplasma_ samples collected over a 20-year period in Germany found doxycycline to be most effective against both but noted 10% of _M. hominis_ samples were resistant to doxycycline. Of these samples, 7.9% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and less than 2% were resistant to oxfloxacin. 删除9：<u>27 </u>Finally, in Morris _et al_ , when using international set thresholds by Clinical Laboratory Science Institute, only 1/100 of collected samples from Wales demonstrated resistance to tetracycline, while 0/100 demonstrated levofloxacin resistance. 删除9：<u>21 28 </u>Clindamycin is also commonly used and effective, which may present great option for neonatal or perinatal infections. 删除9：<u>19</u>\n\n【38】Our review of previous case series and case reports of _M. hominis_ pneumonia in immunocompetent patients yielded 14 patients spanning three decades. 删除9：<u>1–6 22 29 30 </u>Among the four patients who died, none of them had modification of therapy, although one patient from Garcia _et al_ withdrew due to worsening of illness and significant comorbidity. 删除9：<u>2 4 30 </u>Two of the earlier cases recovered despite no change in therapy or the inadequate change to erythromycin. 删除9：<u>6 22 </u>Other patients were noted to have significant improvement after identification of _M. hominis_ and transition to a fluoroquinolone and/or tetracycline antibiotic. Common associations or risk factors identified in some of these patients included two patients with pneumonia in the peripartum period 1 29 and five patients who suffered trauma or closed head injury. 删除9：<u>3 4 6 30 </u>Four cases also identified co-infection with another bacterial source. 删除9：<u>1 4 22 30</u>\n\n【39】Many of the other various extragenital infections had found a large proportion of cases involve immunocompromised patients or transplant patients emphasising lower cell-mediated immunity and hypogammaglobulinaemia. 31 _M_ . _hominis_ and _U. urealyticum_ have been implicated as possible aetiology of non-hepatic hyperammonemia which should prompt antibiotic coverage of these organisms in such cases to prevent further complications. 删除9：<u>32 </u>Our patient did not have any immunoglobulin deficiencies identified. _M. hominis_ can also progress to very severe illness such as other reviewed cases in which patients developed empyema requiring drainage with chest tube, but other cases did not describe the extent of surgical intervention required in this case.\n\n【40】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【41】Our patient added with his consent form, ‘Thanks so much again for all you did to help me get better!’\n\n【42】### Learning points\n\n【43】*   This case demonstrates that _Mycoplasma hominis_ can cause severe respiratory infection and cavitary lesion in an immunocompetent adult despite lack of previously identified risk factors.\n\n【44】*   _M. hominis_ should be considered on the differential of patients with treatment resistant pneumonia or other infection especially in patients with trauma, intracranial injury, lung transplant or if immunocompromised.\n\n【45】*   Institutions should consider availability of PCR testing for _M. hominis_ or broader eubacterial PCR testing to help identify offending organisms quickly.\n\n【46】*   Cultures should be collected for further use in monitoring susceptibility patterns with increase in resistance to tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones.\n\n【47】*   We recommend levofloxacin or other fluoroquinolone to most effectively treat, while doxycycline would be a potential alternative.\n\n【48】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【49】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【50】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank our patient for allowing us to present this case.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:25:01", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:25:47", "cost": 45.559}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:25:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:25:01"}

It is a dysplastic, non-functional lung tissue with a separate systemic blood supply. It may share pleura with the normal parenchyma or have its discrete pleural lining, classified into intralobar and extralobar, respectively. 删除9：<u>1 </u>The incidence is estimated to be between 0.15% and 1.8% in newborns. 删除9：<u>2 </u>PS can remain quiescent without a diagnosis, discovered on incidental imaging or complicated by a superimposed infection. The latter is often observed in cases of intralobar PS presenting in the third decade of life. 删除9：<u>2 </u>We present a case of intralobar PS complicated by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A man in his third decade of life without known medical illnesses developed a cough 3 weeks before his initial presentation. The cough was associated with right lower chest pain. There was no haemoptysis, fever, chills, weight loss or loss of appetite. He has no history of tobacco or alcohol consumption. He is incarcerated and has not travelled in the past 4 years. There was no family history of immunodeficiency in first-degree relatives. Clinical examination revealed an afebrile young man with right-sided rhonchi.\n\n【10】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【11】Laboratory investigations revealed no leucocytosis, anaemia or thrombocytopaenia. D-dimer was elevated (516 ng/mL). No abnormalities in electrolyte levels or impaired kidney or liver function. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 resulted as negative. A chest radiograph showed a right lower lobe radiopacity . He was prescribed azithromycin and levofloxacin courses for the concern of community-acquired pneumonia. Although empiric bacterial pneumonia treatment improved the cough for the following 5 months, he relapsed and presented again for medical attention. Sputum analysis did not show micro-organisms on the gram-stain or Gomori methenamine silver stain but identified acid-fast positive bacilli. Empiric _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (MTB) treatment was started, but the regimen was stopped as MTB had not been identified. Further imaging with CT chest  showed right-sided mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, large and irregular consolidation in the right lower lobe with multiple cystic spaces and localised bronchiectasis. Nodules in the right lower and middle lobes were also noted. Notably, the CA 19-9 was elevated at 68 U/mL. The abdominal CT did not show any hepatobiliary or pancreatic masses.\n\n【12】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【14】An anteroposterior (AP) chest radiograph showing radiopacity in the right lower chest zone.</u>\n\n【15】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【16】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【17】(A) A CT chest showed consolidation in the right lower lobe (black arrowhead) with multiple cystic spaces and associated localised bronchiectasis.

(C) Three-dimensional rendering shows a branch of the abdominal aorta (white arrowhead) ascending towards the pulmonary sequestration (white arrow) to provide blood supply.</u>\n\n【18】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【19】Initially, during the patient’s first medical visit, the patient’s symptoms and signs suggested a community-acquired pneumonia which improved with antibiotics but then relapsed. The discovery of acid-fast positive bacilli in the sputum analysis led to an initial presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, this was subsequently ruled out, leaving the aetiology of the nodules and lymphadenopathy unclear. The elevated CA 19-9 level initially raised concerns about pancreatic or biliary tract cancer, but subsequent abdominal CT scans did not reveal any abnormalities. The nodules on chest imaging were concerning for rheumatological diseases, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, a subsequent negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and lack of other systemic features made GPA less likely. Similarly, negative rheumatoid factor, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies antibodies made RA less likely. Lung malignancy was also a consideration given the nodules and infiltrates on chest imaging. However, the patient’s young age, lack of smoking history or weight loss made this differential less likely.\n\n【20】After 3 weeks of incubation of the respiratory sample, microbiological investigations identified MAC growth in the sputum sample, which was confirmed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampling. This led to a diagnosis of MAC pulmonary disease, which was supported by the patient’s clinical history and imaging findings. The preliminary report of the CT chest only identified the bronchiectasis, cysts and nodules. However, 删除13：<u>3 </u>weeks later, radiology provided an official report. They noted a large artery, originating from the proximal abdominal aorta, supplying the large cystic consolidation in the right lower lobe . This confirmed the radiological diagnosis of PS, further complicated by an MAC infection. This was also corroborated by thoracic surgery review of the imaging.\n\n【21】Treatment\n---------\n\n【22】Empiric treatment against non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) with azithromycin, ethambutol and rifabutin was started and maintained after MAC growth was redemonstrated on BAL sampling. He was referred for surgical resection of the right lower lobe.\n\n【23】A successful open right lower lobectomy was performed. Macroscopic examination revealed a 22.0×15.3×5.5 cm lobectomy specimen. There were copious amounts of mucus and dilated airways. The pathologist noted that the parenchyma had multinodular, diffuse consolidations. The pleura was tan-purple, edematous, with diffuse adhesions and focal areas of tan-white discolouration. Histopathological examination  revealed extensive confluent extra-airway noncaseating granulomata with chronic inflammation, numerous giant cells and crystalline inclusions. No organisms were identified on acid-fast or fungal stains of the specimen. After 3 weeks, an intraoperative lavage culture from the right lower lobe further grew MAC. The patient was discharged on the same MAC antimycobacterial regimen.\n\n【24】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【25】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【26】Right lower lobe intralobar sequestration histopathology under H&E stain.

He remained on the anti-NTM therapy for 5 more months with a follow-up CT chest  showed the remainder of the right lung was free of infiltrates or pulmonary nodules.

In a large retrospective study, micro-organisms most commonly implicated include _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Aspergillus species_ . 删除9：<u>3 </u>Other micro-organisms include _Nocardia asteroids_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_ . 删除9：<u>4 5 </u>Only eight cases in combined English and translated literature described MAC complicating a PS, the first of which was described in 1975 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>.\n\n【34】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【35】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【36】All accessible reports of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infecting pulmonary sequestrations published to date</u>\n\n【37】In our case, the diagnosis of MAC infection was established based on radiologic and microbiological criteria. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Although histopathological examination of the resected lung tissue did not reveal acid-fast positive organisms, the growth of MAC in two BAL cultures establishes the infection. The diagnosis is also supported by the presence of granulomas representing chronic inflammation. Mycobacterial infections are classically associated with caseating granulomas, but non-caseating granulomas have also been described. 删除9：<u>7 8</u>\n\n【38】The route through which the PS acquires infectious micro-organisms remains debated within the literature. Although intralobar sequestrations are completely isolated from the rest of the parenchyma, 20% of cases have an aberrant airway connection. 删除9：<u>9 </u>This may have served as the acquisition route and later spread of the MAC infection into the adjacent normal parenchyma. The presence of cysts containing air-fluid levels supports the existence of aberrant airway communication. 删除9：<u>10 </u>Other routes of spread described are through Kohn’s pores, along the pleural lining or by lymphatics. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【39】Another notable finding is the elevation of CA 19-9, which normalised after surgical resection. CA 19-9 is hypersecreted by respiratory epithelium and hypertrophied lung glands with chronic inflammation. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Indeed, elevated CA 19-9 was described in previous cases of PS. 删除9：<u>13–15 </u>NTM lung disease is also associated with increased CA 19-9. Hong _et al_ described 59 cases of NTM, 删除13：<u>11 </u>of which exhibited elevated CA 19-9. 删除9：<u>16 </u>In this case, both PS and MAC infection may have equally contributed to the rise of CA 19-9, with subsequent fall after resection. Further studies remain needed to investigate the utility of this tumour marker as a component of a scoring system to guide MAC duration of therapy.\n\n【40】The patient underwent resection to treat infected PS, and the anti-NTM therapy was continued after resection since MAC had been also found outside the PS. Guidelines and literature remain unclear regarding the duration of MAC infection after resection of the infected tissue. 删除9：<u>6 17</u>\n\n【41】This case illustrates the value of comprehensive and often invasive microbiological testing in patients with pneumonia not responding to empiric treatment, particularly with underlying structural lung disease. Testing for MAC and other NTM is warranted, as cases remain on the rise in the United States, reaching an incidence rate of 47 per 100 000 in 2007. 删除9：<u>18</u>\n\n【42】### Learning points\n\n【43】*   Importance of considering a broad range of differential diagnoses when evaluating patients with chronic respiratory symptoms and imaging findings that are not typical of bacterial pneumonia.\n\n【44】*   While tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease were both plausible diagnoses based on the patient’s presentation, other possibilities, including malignancy and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, needed to be carefully considered and ruled out through a thorough workup.\n\n【45】*   CA 19-9 can be elevated in non-malignant conditions, such as infections and inflammatory conditions. Therefore, it is important to consider the patient’s clinical history and other laboratory and radiological findings before attributing elevated CA 19-9 levels solely to malignancy.\n\n【46】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【47】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【48】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:22:51", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:23:29", "cost": 37.191}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:23:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:22:51"}

Lesions were debrided and microscopy of the corneal scrapings demonstrated intracellular organisms present as multiple spores within microcysts highlighted on Grocott and Giemsa stains confirming microsporidiosis and PCR testing positive.\n\n【37】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【38】This case remained a diagnostic dilemma with a seemingly poor prognosis despite good health and excellent quality of life several months prior. Key aspects to consider were the subacute but progressive nature of the illness and recognising the degree of immunodeficiency in the host.\n\n【39】Differential diagnoses for the myositis included a paraneoplastic, infective or an autoimmune process. Performing MRI and achieving a muscle biopsy with skilled histopathology review was crucial in achieving the correct diagnosis. PET/CT was performed to investigate for occult malignancy, vasculitis or granulomatous disease and was useful in clarifying the extent of infection and providing a baseline for response to treatment.\n\n【40】Refractory hypercalcaemia was unusual aspect of the case. Differentials for PTH-independent hypercalcaemia include malignancy, granulomatous disease, vitamin A or D intoxication and hyperthyroidism. The elevated 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D persisting after cessation of calcitriol was suggestive of a granulomatous process, as can occur with sarcoidosis or atypical infections such as disseminated mycobacterial or fungal infection.\n\n【41】Renal function continued to deteriorate despite euvolaemia, appropriate calcineurin levels and the exclusion of obstruction. Microsporidial infection and refractory hypercalcaemia likely contributed to acute tubular injury and the background changes of severe cortical atrophy provided prognostic value, prompting workup for dialysis.\n\n【42】Severe early morning headaches were suggestive of raised intracranial pressure, although there was no papilloedema on funduscopy and MRI and LP excluded a space occupying lesion or meningitis. The patient suffered from chronic migraines likely exacerbated by keratitis and subsequent albendazole. Infectious keratitis can be bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic in aetiology; however, the characteristic white punctate epithelial infiltrates seen on ocular examination are typical of microsporidia.\n\n【43】Treatment\n---------\n\n【44】Initial treatment included intravenous fluid and analgesia. No antibiotics were administered given clinical stability and zoledronic acid was administered two times for hypercalcaemia without effect. Once muscle biopsy results confirmed microsporidiosis, antifungal treatment with albendazole 400 mg medication taken by mouth two times per day was commenced. Worsening fevers, rigours, myalgia, headaches and vomiting ensued for 5 days with new diarrhoea and anaemia requiring red blood cell transfusion. While the headaches were severe and potentially exacerbated by albendazole, it was continued as was the optimal antifungal agent. The keratitis was debrided and topical ofloxacin and celluvisc applied with a plan for fumagillin if infection reoccured. Immunosuppression was reduced with prednisolone weaned to 7.5 mg daily, mycophenolate 540 mg two times per day and a reduced tacrolimus level target of five to six.\n\n【45】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【46】Clinical improvement was seen after 7 days with defervescence, reduced subcutaneous oedema, myalgia and headaches. CK and calcium normalised and the patient was discharged home.\n\n【47】Significant nausea and diarrhoea prompted an endoscopy 4 weeks later; results were unremarkable and albendazole was continued with a planned duration of 6–12 months. Unless a microsporidial source can be identified and eradicated, ongoing exposure to microsporidium is likely and long-term secondary prophylaxis will be required. A repeat PET/CT scan performed 3 months into treatment showed a near complete metabolic response . Multispecialty outpatient follow-up is arranged and planning for intermittent haemodialysis is underway given the Stage 5 CKD.\n\n【48】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【49】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 6\n\n【50】Repeat fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT to assess treatment response following 90 days of albendazole therapy demonstrates a near complete metabolic response.

The most prominent residual lesions; right tibialis anterior (arrow 1) and medial gastrocnemius (arrow 2), are both less avid than mediastinal blood pool.</u>\n\n【51】Discussion\n----------\n\n【52】While there are no published guidelines for the treatment of microsporidosis, albendazole is effective against most species except _Enterocytozoon bieneusi,_ for which fumagillin is an alternative. Treatment duration is not defined; however, in this case duration will be guided by clinical response, for example, resolving myalgia and keratitis, inflammatory markers and repeat PET imaging. Given severe infection generally occurs in patients infected with HIV with a CD4<100 cells/µL, the disseminated nature of infection reflects profound immunosuppression. In HIV with commencement of antiretroviral therapy, albendazole is recommended for a minimum of 6 months after a CD4>200 cells/µL is achieved.\n\n【53】Reduction in immune suppression is an important factor in the successful treatment of microsporidiosis _._ 8 9 This requires a careful assessment of the risk–benefit balance in patients who require ongoing immunosuppression, such as in transplant recipients _._ When immune reconstitution cannot be achieved, prolonged treatment for months with a consideration for secondary prophylaxis given the risk of a chronic carrier state or reinfection is prudent.\n\n【54】In cases of treatment failure or relapse despite albendazole therapy, fumagillin has been added to the regimen with clinical success. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Minimising soil exposure, eradicating mosquito breeding grounds and preventing house water contamination with mosquito larvae to avoid reinfection is advised; acknowledging the exact mechanism of acquisition is still uncertain. 删除9：<u>10</u>\n\n【55】To our knowledge, there are no documented case reports of hypercalcaemia associated with microsporidiosis. Granulomatous disorders associated with fungal infection can cause hypercalcaemia through excessive 1–25-hydroxyvitamin D production, which is the proposed mechanism in this case.\n\n【56】Given the disseminated nature of infection a multimodal approach with input from nephrology, endocrinology, lung transplant, rheumatology, infectious diseases, neurology, ear, nose and throat and ophthalmology was required. Various species of microsporidium have a predilection for particular infective phenotypes and _A. algerae_ is known to cause keratitis and myositis. 删除9：<u>11 </u>In this case, there was possible central nervous system, vocal cord, parapharyngeal and renal involvement despite the inability to identify the organism in these tissues. The pronounced systemic response with myalgia, headaches and fevers after commencement of albendazole was likely due to widespread microorganism death and lysis of infected myositis.\n\n【57】There are several case reports of fatal microsporidial myositis in immunocompromised hosts over the past two decades and rates are likely higher given the elusive diagnosis. Further research is required to clarify acquisition, identify high-risk patients, outline preventative measures and to raise awareness given the high mortality rates in the expanding immunocompromised population.\n\n【58】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【59】I was frustrated after 3 months of worsening muscle fatigue, pain and myalgia and several different arthritis blood tests and general practitioner visits. One of my regular transplant blood tests revealed I had an acute kidney injury and dangerously high calcium levels. I was off to hospital to further investigate the problems under the renal doctors. I was most concerned about my kidneys and calcium levels at that stage and so were the doctors. We ran through all the same blood tests for arthritis and autoimmune diseases with negative results, something was wrong, and the Doctors and I knew there was a problem but what? So, the barrage of tests began, to the credit of all those involved. My kidneys and calcium levels were stubborn and did not change for 3 weeks, which was making the diagnosis difficult. Then finally, the muscle biopsy returned the answer of microsporidium infection.\n\n【60】By this stage, I was very sick. I was sleeping, fatigued, nauseous and in constant muscle pain. At this stage, even holding a drink was a challenge, not much fun to be around. The debridement of my left eyeball was the last straw as the fungus had infiltrated my cornea, but we had an answer, and this was a positive in myself and my wife’s eyes. We made plans to get home after 1 month in hospital. Then my next challenge.\n\n【61】After being bedridden for a month with a parasitic whole body muscle infection, I had lost 10 kg and a lot of my strength and muscle. I was constantly nauseous and suffering continual bouts of diarrhoea. Just being able to eat has been a challenge but and I am getting better and progressing every day.\n\n【62】I have to thank the persistence and collaborative efforts of the mutidisciplinary team whom diagnosed my problem. This could have definitely been a different story if my symptoms were left unchecked or to a left lesser experienced health system.\n\n【63】### Learning points\n\n【64】*   Microsporidiosis is an emerging infectious disease in the malignancy, autoimmune and transplant population.\n\n【65】*   Infection can be fatal without prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【66】*   Disseminated infection can present with a broad range of manifestations.\n\n【67】*   Hypercalcaemia can be a due to disseminated fungal infection.\n\n【68】*   Tissue samples can provide highly beneficial and unexpected results.\n\n【69】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【70】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【71】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【72】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【73】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to acknowledge the following for their contribution to patient care: The Royal Brisbane & Women’s Hospital Nephrology, Rheumatology, Endocrinology, Infectious Diseases, Neurology, Ear, Nose and Throat and Ophthalmology Units, The Prince Charles Hospital Lung Transplant Unit and Dr Matthew R.

CH can be transient or permanent, depending on the aetiology and duration of hypothyroidism. Thyroidal causes such as agenesis or underdevelopment of the thyroidal gland (thyroid dysgenesis) or insufficient hormone synthesis (thyroid dyshormonogenesis) are the most common causes. Central CH due to absent or insufficient thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion in the pituitary gland is less common. Other causes are TSH receptor insensitivity and transient CH. Without early detection and treatment, neurodevelopment and metabolism are severely hampered. We present a case with CH due to an unusual cause in non-Asian infants, illustrating the importance of a thorough patient history.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】We present a Dutch Caucasian boy who was referred at day 8 of life for abnormal CH screening with a T4 of 72 nmol/L blood (~144 nmol/L serum) with a SD of −0.9 on average in the batch of measurements made that day (reference, >−1.6 SD) and a TSH of 23 mE/L (reference, <7 mE/L). Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful; he was born at 38 weeks and 5 days of gestation with a body weight of 3350 g. The family history revealed no thyroidal problems, and he has a healthy brother. The boy is a peaceful baby and drinks breast milk ad libitum. His body weight decreased until day 6 and started to increase thereafter. Temperature and defecation were unremarkable. Hearing screening was initially insufficient, but normal at a repeat measurement. Except for mild jaundice that did not require phototherapy, physical examination revealed no abnormalities: especially, his pulse rate was normal and thyroidal enlargement was not palpable. Laboratory results showed repeatedly increased TSH concentrations, with free T4 (FT4) in the normal range, also described as hyperthyrotropinemia . Our differential diagnosis was mild dyshormogenesis, partial TSH receptor insensitivity or transient causes of CH. At day 15, we performed a通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>123 </sup></u> I-perchlorate discharge test, which displayed normal通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>123 </sup></u> I uptake; however, after perchlorate administration, the uptake increased instead of decreased, suggesting a highly stimulated thyroid gland despite FT4 in the high-normal range. Ultrasound of the thyroidal gland performed at day 51 showed a normally sized and located thyroid gland without focal abnormalities.\n\n【10】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【11】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【12】Trend in FT4 and TSH from birth onwards, illustrating the effect of maternal seaweed consumption on TSH concentration. FT4, free T4; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone.</u>\n\n【13】At this point, history was repeated, which revealed that the mother consumed seaweed at a daily basis throughout pregnancy and lactation. She consumed a bowl of wakame miso soup daily, hijiki or arame seaweed once a week and nori seaweed once a week. In addition, she used chlorella (algae powder) and ‘sweet iron’ supplements during pregnancy. Her motivation for daily seaweed consumption was the perceived health aspect.\n\n【14】Due to the lack of adequate reference ranges for mother’s milk and the lack of upper levels in urine that can cause hyperthyrotropinemia in the fetus and infant, we decided not to measure iodine concentration in mother’s milk or urine. To exclude other causes of CH, we performed mutation analysis of the THRB gene and a gene panel for thyroidal CH, including the sequencing and copy number variance analysis of the following genes: CDCA8, DUOX1, DUOX2, DUOXA2, FOXE1, GLIS3, GNAS, HOXA3, IYD, JAG1, NKX2-1, PAX8, SLC26A4, SLC5A5, TG, TPO, TPST2 and TSHR. In these genes, no mutations or variations were found.\n\n【15】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【16】Cessation of maternal seaweed consumption was strongly advised. After cessation, TSH concentrations gradually decreased but did not normalise. The FT4 concentrations remained in the normal range. As a result of TSH values being >10 mU/L, the mother was strongly recommended to supplement her infant with levothyroxine to prevent long-term complications. However, so far the mother was reluctant to start supplementation because of normal FT4 concentrations. During follow-up until 9 months of age, his neurodevelopment was normal. We will continue to follow up the thyroid function and development of this boy.\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】This case illustrates the importance of a detailed history including maternal iodine exposure, even in populations without cultural or ethnic background known for high seaweed consumption.\n\n【19】In our case, the excess maternal iodine during pregnancy and lactation due to daily seaweed consumption resulted in congenital transient hypothyroidism.\n\n【20】Direct iodine overload to the neonate can be caused by iodine-containing disinfection agents or contrast medium administration during the perinatal period or can be caused by iodine-rich medication or diet. Maternal exposure to iodine can result in high iodine concentrations in the fetus and newborn due to placental transfer and/or by secretion of iodine in breast milk. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>The thyroid possesses protective mechanisms for excess iodine: the so-called Wolff-Chaikoff effect. In cases of excess iodine, iodine uptake in the thyroid gland is blocked by a decreased activity of the iodine symporter, leading to reduced T4 and increased TSH concentrations. In adults, this blockage lasts on average for 48 hours. 删除9：<u>3 </u>The fetus and neonate are very sensitive to excess iodine because the Wolff-Chaikoff effect is not functional until gestational week 36. The fetus membranes are highly permeable, and the fetus can absorb iodine from the amniotic fluid through the skin or gastrointestinal tract, or iodine is transferred through the placenta. In addition, iodine trapping processes in the thyroid gland are active, and iodine renal clearance is low. 删除9：<u>4 </u>The duration of the blockage of iodine transport into the thyroid gland in neonates can last for weeks to months. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【21】In many East Asian cultures, seaweed soup is considered a healthy staple. Korean mothers are traditionally given large amounts of brown seaweed soup postpartum, up to 4–5 times a day in the first few days after delivery, to promote breast milk supply. The iodine content of seaweed products is highly variable. Especially seaweed types such as kelp, kombu and Sargassum have very high iodine contents and can contain >1000 µg of iodine per gram product. 删除9：<u>5 6 </u>Harvesting, storage and cooking methods can greatly affect iodine content. It was reported that 250 mL of seaweed soup can provide 500–1700 µg of iodine, based on whether the seaweed itself is consumed or not. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【22】The Dutch recommended daily allowance (RDA) for iodine is based on Scandinavian RDAs 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012)</u>. 删除9：<u>8 </u>For pregnant women, the RDA is considered to be 175 µg/day and during lactation to be 200 µg/day. No RDA for infants <6 months was established. An RDA for infants between 80 µg and 110 µg has been proposed by others. 删除9：<u>9 10 </u>The European Food Safety Authority established the tolerable upper limit that is considered safe for adults to be 600 µg/day, and the maximal amount for infants aged <1 year is not established. 删除9：<u>11 </u>The WHO proposed an upper limit for children aged <2 years to be 180 µg/day. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Daily ingestion of iodine-rich seaweed products easily exceeds the daily recommended intake of iodine as in our case. In addition to iodine, seaweed contains several minerals, vitamins, soluble fibres and flavonoids which are considered to have beneficial effects on lifestyle-related diseases, but also contains heavy metals such as arsenic, which can have detrimental health effects. 删除9：<u>13</u>\n\n【23】Published cases of CH due to excess maternal dietary iodine are limited to families with Asian background. In a Korean study, subclinical hypothyroidism in preterm infants was associated with high iodine concentrations in breast milk. These Korean postpartum women traditionally consumed brown seaweed soups, resulting in excess iodine in a third of infants. 删除9：<u>14 </u>In a study in Japan in 34 neonates with abnormal CH screening, 44% were diagnosed with hyperthyrotropinemia, that is, high TSH, caused by excess maternal ingestion of iodine during pregnancy, of which 80% required levothyroxine because of hypothyroxinemia or persistent hyperthyrotropinemia. In addition, it was suggested that hyperthyrotropinemia due to excessive maternal iodide ingestion during pregnancy may be permanent. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Possible risk factors for permanent hyperthyrotropinemia in these infants may be repeated excess iodine due to placental transfer, breast milk and baby food. In these infants, thyroid function may be permanently altered, possibly by an intrauterine iodine imprinting effect. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【24】In Australia, New Zealand, UK and USA, four cases of iodine-induced neonatal hypothyroidism due to maternal seaweed consumption are reported. In all of these four cases, the mothers had an Asian background. 删除9：<u>15–17 </u>All these infants needed treatment with levothyroxine for a duration of 4 months to 2 years.\n\n【25】Whether or not to treat children with (permanent) hyperthyrotropinemia and normal FT4 concentrations is still a controversial subject. Levothyroxine therapy might be considered with persistent TSH concentrations above 10 U/L, mainly because of the potential long-term increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This is mainly investigated in Hashimoto-related hyperthyrotropinemia or other autoimmune diseases. 删除9：<u>18 </u>In mothers with Graves’ disease, neonatal hyperthyrotropinemia is often transient. 删除9：<u>19 </u>After maternal iodine consumption, neonatal thyroid function may be permanently altered, possibly by an intrauterine iodine imprinting effect, resulting in persistent hyperthyrotropinemia (with or without low FT4 concentrations) with potential negative effects on cardiovascular health.\n\n【26】Since TSH was spontaneously decreasing in our case, we decided not to supplement with levothyroxine yet.\n\n【27】This case illustrates the importance of a detailed history including maternal iodine exposure even in populations without cultural/ethnic background known for high seaweed consumption. Maternal seaweed consumption can result in transient or permanent hyperthyrotropinemia in the neonate with risk of neurodevelopmental outcome if untreated.\n\n【28】### Learning points\n\n【29】*   Maternal diet should be included in the history of all neonates referred for screening of abnormal congenital hypothyroidism.\n\n【30】*   Even in families of non-Asian background, high maternal intake of iodine-rich seaweed occurs and can result in transient or permanent hyperthyrotropinemia in the neonate with risk of neurodevelopmental outcome if untreated.\n\n【31】*   Food safety institutes, general healthcare providers, gynaecologists and midwives should advise pregnant and lactating women not to ingest iodine-rich foods on a daily basis because seaweed iodine content is highly variable and easily exceeds recommended daily allowances.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:48:12", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:48:24", "cost": 11.925}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:48:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:48:12"}

Hence, we report the case of a patient with painless thyroiditis whose anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) were negative before SARS-CoV-2 infection became positive after SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A woman in her 50s was referred to our hospital for surgery for papillary thyroid cancer and primary hyperparathyroidism. At the first visit, her thyroid function test results were as follows: free T4, 1.35 ng/dL (normal, 0.9–1.7 ng/dL); free T3, 3.88 pg/mL (normal, 2.3–4.0 pg/mL); and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 0.785 µIU/mL (normal, 0.61–4.23 µIU/mL).

These were all measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLusys; Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan). Results of other biochemical tests were as follows: serum thyroglobulin 25.9 ng/mL (normal, 0–46.05 ng/mL), serum calcium 10.8 mg/dL (normal, 8.2–10.2 mg/dL), serum phosphate 3.0 mg/dL (normal, 2.5–4.5 mg/dL) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) 75 pg/mL (normal, 删除13：<u>15–70 </u>pg/mL). The urinary calcium/creatinine ratio calculated from spot urine was 0.017.\n\n【10】Thyroid ultrasonography showed a solid, hypoechoic 12 mm nodule with slightly irregular borders in the left lobe of the thyroid . An enlarged right lower parathyroid gland was also detected . The estimated thyroid volume was 21.2 mL, and the thyroid gland was homogeneous with normal blood flow.

The thyroid function test on admission revealed elevated free T4 of 2.54 ng/dL and free T3 of 8.96 pg/mL, with a suppressed TSH level of less than 0.005 µIU/mL. TgAb was 111.0 IU/mL and TPOAb was 34.2 IU/mL, while antibodies to the TSH receptor (TRAb) was 1.04 IU/L (normal, 删除9：<u>0–2 </u>IU/L) and thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb) was 103% (normal, 0–120%). TRAb was measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) (ECLusys; Roche Diagnostics) and TSAb was measured using a bioassay enzyme immunoassay (Yamasa; Yamasa Shoyu, Chiba, Japan). Thyroglobulin was 62.0 ng/mL, and serum C reactive protein was less than 0.5 mg/dL (normal, 0–0.5 mg/dL). PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on admission was negative. She had no symptoms such as neck pain, and her vital signs were stable. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody was positive, with a titre of 8.77 U/mL (normal, 0–0.80 U/mL). It was measured by high throughput ECLIA (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S; Roche Diagnostics).\n\n【19】From the time of the first visit to our hospital until admission, she had no other infection aside from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Postpartum thyroiditis is thought to be a variant of painless thyroiditis because it is frequently positive for antithyroid antibodies and shows similar histopathology and clinical manifestations. 删除9：<u>5</u>\n\n【43】Painless thyroiditis is considered to be an immune-mediated disorder, which may be caused by immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs and various cytokines, such as interferon-alpha and interleukin-2. 删除9：<u>5 6 </u>The clinical course of painless thyroiditis is characterised by the destruction of the thyroid gland, resulting in excess thyroid hormones and transient thyrotoxicosis. This thyrotoxicosis improves spontaneously and is often followed by a period of hypothyroidism and full recovery.\n\n【44】Recently, two cases of painless thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis diagnosed after SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported. 删除9：<u>3 4 </u>A man in his 50s admitted to the hospital for treatment of COVID-19 was incidentally found to have thyrotoxicosis in a blood test on admission. TgAb, TPOAb and TRAb were all negative. He had no symptoms suggestive of thyrotoxicosis and no neck pain. Thyroid scintigraphy showed a marked decrease in thyroid gland uptake, and he was diagnosed with painless thyroiditis. On follow-up medical examination, thyroid function normalised without any specific medication. 删除9：<u>3 </u>In the other case, a woman in her 20s was reported to be diagnosed with postpartum thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection. She had a history of painless thyroiditis with a background of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and was infected with SARS-CoV-2 103 days after delivery. Thirty-three days after the SARS-CoV-2 infection, she was diagnosed with postpartum thyroiditis. Her thyroid function was as follows: free T4, 2.0 ng/dL; free T3, 5.44 pg/mL; and TSH, 0.020 µIU/mL. TgAb was positive, while TPOAb and TRAb were negative. No neck pain was found on examination. Her thyroid function normalised 2 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection without treatment. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【45】In addition to painless thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis, Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis have been reported as autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection. 删除9：<u>2 7 </u>SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell through the ACE-2 receptor, 删除13：<u>8 </u>which is expressed in various organs, including thyroid follicular cells and lung cells. 删除9：<u>9 10 </u>The transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is also considered to play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, 删除13：<u>11 </u>and a high expression of TMPRSS2 mRNA has been reported in the thyroid tissue. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 genome and viral proteins such as spike and nucleocapsid proteins have been detected histologically in thyroid follicular cells of patients with COVID-19. 删除9：<u>13 14 </u>SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in immune cell hyperactivity involving Th1/Th17 lymphocytes. 删除9：<u>15 </u>Interestingly, partially similar immune cell activation patterns have been reported in interferon-alpha-induced destructive thyroiditis, including painless thyroiditis. 删除9：<u>15 16</u>\n\n【46】Furthermore, it has been reported that the spike protein and nucleus of SARS-CoV-2 are similar in structure to thyroid peroxidase (TPO). 删除9：<u>17 </u>This means that antibodies produced after SARS-CoV-2 infection may also cross-react against TPO, resulting in autoimmune thyroiditis. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【47】Cristinel _et al_ reported increased TPOAb and TgAb levels in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and a history of chronic hepatitis C 1 month after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 删除9：<u>18</u>\n\n【48】Notably, our case had no history of AITD, and negative TgAb and TPOAb at initial presentation became positive after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although this does not confirm a causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and painless thyroiditis, it is postulated that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have triggered an immune response that led to painless thyroiditis.\n\n【49】There have been many reports of autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection, but painless thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection is less commonly reported than Graves’ disease or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. One possible speculation is that painless thyroiditis may be overlooked because of its mild symptoms. Indeed, our patient and the previously reported case 3 were asymptomatic and were diagnosed incidentally by blood tests.\n\n【50】Although the causal association between COVID-19 and autoimmune thyroiditis is uncertain at the current time, physicians should consider the possibility of autoimmune thyroiditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be sought while taking medical history.\n\n【51】Even though there are several reports exploring COVID-19 and thyroid disease, their pathogeneses remain poorly understood and further research is needed.\n\n【52】### PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE\n\n【53】I was surprised when I was told that my thyroid hormone levels were abnormal during a blood test when I was hospitalised.\n\n【54】But I am thankful that the operation was successful.\n\n【55】### Learning points\n\n【56】*   Although the causal relationship is uncertain, autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported.\n\n【57】*   Painless thyroiditis may be overlooked due to its mild presentation of symptoms.\n\n【58】*   When seeing a patient with autoimmune thyroiditis, previous instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be ascertained while taking medical history.\n\n【59】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【60】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【61】Obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "\n【9】A woman in her 50s was referred to our hospital for surgery for papillary thyroid cancer and primary hyperparathyroidism.

Her thyroid function normalised 2 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection without treatment. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【45】In addition to painless thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis, Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis have been reported as autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection. 删除9：<u>2 7 </u>SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell through the ACE-2 receptor, 删除13：<u>8 </u>which is expressed in various organs, including thyroid follicular cells and lung cells. 删除9：<u>9 10 </u>The transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is also considered to play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, 删除13：<u>11 </u>and a high expression of TMPRSS2 mRNA has been reported in the thyroid tissue. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 genome and viral proteins such as spike and nucleocapsid proteins have been detected histologically in thyroid follicular cells of patients with COVID-19. 删除9：<u>13 14 </u>SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in immune cell hyperactivity involving Th1/Th17 lymphocytes. 删除9：<u>15 </u>Interestingly, partially similar immune cell activation patterns have been reported in interferon-alpha-induced destructive thyroiditis, including painless thyroiditis. 删除9：<u>15 16</u>\n\n【46】Furthermore, it has been reported that the spike protein and nucleus of SARS-CoV-2 are similar in structure to thyroid peroxidase (TPO). 删除9：<u>17 </u>This means that antibodies produced after SARS-CoV-2 infection may also cross-react against TPO, resulting in autoimmune thyroiditis. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【47】Cristinel _et al_ reported increased TPOAb and TgAb levels in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and a history of chronic hepatitis C 1 month after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 删除9：<u>18</u>\n\n【48】Notably, our case had no history of AITD, and negative TgAb and TPOAb at initial presentation became positive after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although this does not confirm a causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and painless thyroiditis, it is postulated that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have triggered an immune response that led to painless thyroiditis.\n\n【49】There have been many reports of autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection, but painless thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection is less commonly reported than Graves’ disease or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. One possible speculation is that painless thyroiditis may be overlooked because of its mild symptoms. Indeed, our patient and the previously reported case 3 were asymptomatic and were diagnosed incidentally by blood tests.\n\n【50】Although the causal association between COVID-19 and autoimmune thyroiditis is uncertain at the current time, physicians should consider the possibility of autoimmune thyroiditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be sought while taking medical history.\n\n【51】Even though there are several reports exploring COVID-19 and thyroid disease, their pathogeneses remain poorly understood and further research is needed.\n\n【52】### PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE\n\n【53】I was surprised when I was told that my thyroid hormone levels were abnormal during a blood test when I was hospitalised.\n\n【54】But I am thankful that the operation was successful.\n\n【55】### Learning points\n\n【56】*   Although the causal relationship is uncertain, autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported.\n\n【57】*   Painless thyroiditis may be overlooked due to its mild presentation of symptoms.\n\n【58】*   When seeing a patient with autoimmune thyroiditis, previous instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be ascertained while taking medical history.\n\n【59】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【60】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【61】Obtained.</u>", "index": 2547, "show": true, "start": 2547, "end": 3414, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false, "comment": " 删除9：0–40   删除9：0–28  删除13：15–70 【18】删除9：0–2 "}], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:08:35", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:09:51", "cost": 76.712}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:27", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:09:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:08:34"}

Infectious causes are common. However, _Mycobacterium avium_ complex (MAC)-induced pericardial effusion is extremely rare with very few cases documented to date. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Furthermore, in the cases which have been documented, MAC-induced pericardial effusion is usually found in immunocompromised male patients. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【9】We present a rare case of MAC-induced pericardial effusion in an immunocompetent woman with no predisposing factors. Her case was even more interesting as she presented in a haemodynamically stable state despite having active tamponade from her large pericardial effusion. We explain the physiology behind her atypical presentation.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A young woman in her mid-40s with a medical history of hypertension presented with 10 days of a non-productive cough, worsening shortness of breath, chest tightness and pleuritic chest pain relieved by sitting up. She reported fevers of up to 103°F. She denied any nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea but did admit to decreased appetite.\n\n【12】On examination, she was ill appearing but in no acute cardiopulmonary distress. Her pulse was regular but tachycardic. She had normal heart sounds with no rubs, murmurs or gallops. She had no jugular venous distension. The pulmonary examination was unremarkable. She had no lymphadenopathy. The remainder of her examination was unremarkable. She was also normotensive, tachycardic up to 138 beats/min, afebrile and not hypoxic when evaluated in the emergency department.\n\n【13】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【14】Initial ECG showed evidence of sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 124 beats/min, low voltage QRS complexes and poor R wave progression. Chest X-ray showed evidence of an enlarged cardiac silhouette . Her complete blood count was significant for haemoglobin was 10.1 g/dL with a platelet count of 515/nL and a normal white cell count of 4.96/nL. Complete metabolic panel showed only mild transaminitis.

However, we argue against this as none of these differentials would explain this patient’s clinical course. The patient’s flow cytometry was negative, cytology was negative, breast biopsy was also negative and the lack of a recurrent nature was not in keeping with a malignant effusion with contamination. TB was ruled out as all her sputum samples were negative for _M. tuberculosis_ (MTB), in addition to the fact that PCR and gene sequencing for MTB were negative on all samples tested . Given the haemorrhagic nature, viral pericarditis was less likely. In addition, testing for common viruses, including coxsackie virus on the pericardial and respiratory samples, was negative. Hence, the large haemorrhagic pericardial effusion, recurrent fevers, inflammation and necrotising granulomas seen on histopathology, growth of MAC in multiple pericardial samples and a positive QuantiFERON-Gold test in the setting of negative PCR for MTB made a localised MAC-induced pericardial effusion the most likely diagnosis in this case.\n\n【27】Treatment\n---------\n\n【28】She underwent emergency pericardiocentesis, during which 1 L of bloody pericardial fluid was drained . There was a concern for possible malignancy or tuberculous pericardial effusion. The patient was isolated, and serial sputum cultures were sent for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining. Immunoglobulin levels were measured and found to be normal. Rheumatological workup 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u> was unremarkable; HIV, and hepatitis C and B were non-reactive.\n\n【29】Repeated echocardiogram and CT of the chest post-pericardiocentesis revealed residual moderate pericardial effusion , multiple small pulmonary nodules and bilateral breast lesions. There was a concern for malignancy. Symptoms persisted despite treatment with colchicine. Though she continued to spike fevers, blood cultures were negative, and serial sputum cultures were negative as well. On day 4 of admission, she underwent a right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure with pericardial window and chest tube insertion.\n\n【30】During the procedure, the pericardium was noted to be tense and thickened posteriorly but not to the degree that warranted excision. A 400 mL of serous fluid was drained. Samples of the pericardium were also sent for microbiology and pathology. Inspection within the pericardial cavity revealed loculated fibrous material, which required blunt dissection to create a continuous cavity.\n\n【31】A decision to perform pericardiectomy, in this case, was not considered. This procedure is associated with a higher mortality and complication rate than a pericardial window and is usually indicated in cases of constrictive pericarditis, which this patient did not have. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Hence, the risk of performing such a procedure greatly outweighed any benefits and was not performed. Furthermore, loculations found on thoracotomy could be removed by simple adhesiolysis through blunt dissection. No tight fibrous bands were found that would have required the removal of the pericardium.\n\n【32】Postoperatively, she did well, and chest X-rays showed no evidence of pneumothorax with minimal drainage from the chest tube. She was started on indomethacin 50 mg orally every 8 hours. Her pericardial drain and pleural chest tubes were removed.\n\n【33】Postoperatively, her fevers and her chest pain resolved. AFB stains were all negative initially, cytology was negative, and viral studies for coxsackie and adenovirus from pericardial fluid were negative. Flow cytometry on pericardial fluid was also negative. Cultures from the pericardial fluid showed no growth initially.\n\n【34】Her initial QuantiFERON-Gold test was positive. However, all sputum cultures were negative for MTB, and PCR/gene sequencing for MTB was negative. Her symptoms resolved with drainage of her pericardial effusion and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) before discharge. Infectious disease specialists involved in the case from the beginning agreed that the patient had a negative PCR for MTB; thus, they effectively ruled out active and latent TB. However, given her initial positive QuantiFERON-Gold test, there was a plan to have it repeated and to closely monitor her in the outpatient setting.\n\n【35】She was discharged to complete an extended course of NSAIDs with plans for follow-up of her breast and pulmonary lesions as well as her pending cultures.\n\n【36】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【37】Her pericardial fluid cultures later grew MAC confirming a diagnosis of a localised MAC-induced haemorrhagic pericarditis complicated by cardiac tamponade. Infectious disease specialists evaluated her in the outpatient setting for latent TB. Her repeat QuantiFERON-Gold test was negative, and the patient’s symptoms had resolved. As such, latent TB was determined to be unlikely and the initial QuantiFERON-Gold test was likely a false positive from her MAC infection at the time.\n\n【38】Infectious disease specialists agreed that since the patient was immunocompetent and was already showing significant clinical resolution with pericardial fluid drainage and NSAIDs alone, it was not worthwhile to subject this patient to the toxic side effects associated with an extended course of anti-mycobacterial medications.\n\n【39】Three months after her discharge, she was feeling better after having some residual chest discomfort. She had a biopsy of her right breast lesion, which was found to be benign. A repeat CT of the chest revealed a stable small 6 mm right upper lobe nodule, resolution of her previous smaller multiple pulmonary nodules and minimal fluid around the pericardium . The patient continues to do well and has had complete resolution of her symptoms and no recurrence of her effusion since being drained.\n\n【40】She has had several repeat CT scans of the chest which have shown resolution of her multiple pulmonary nodules, which were seen on scans during her illness. Her 6 mm right upper lobe nodule is stable in size. Given the fact that she is low risk for lung cancer, close monitoring with serial imaging was the appropriate plan. It is possible that it represents a post-inflammatory change.\n\n【41】The patient was also evaluated by oncology in the outpatient setting, who determined that malignancy was unlikely in this case and did not advise for further oncological workup.\n\n【42】Discussion\n----------\n\n【43】Patients with cardiac tamponade usually present with dyspnoea at rest and/or on exertion, orthopnoea, chest discomfort or pleuritic chest pain. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>Depending on the severity, the patient can also present with lightheadedness and syncope. On examination, the patient may present with the classic Beck’s triad: hypotension, distended neck veins and muffled heart sounds. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Pulsus paradoxus is another common finding. 删除9：<u>1 </u>However, physicians should be very careful to avoid dismissing the diagnosis in the absence of these ‘classic’ clinical findings, as this is not a purely clinical diagnosis.\n\n【44】This case is a primary example of how a patient may present with cardiac tamponade in the absence of typical signs. She had no distended neck veins, her heart sounds were audible and she was normotensive. Her only positive findings were pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea, orthopnoea, fever and sinus tachycardia on examination.\n\n【45】As pressure from the expanding fluid volume builds within the pericardium, the elastic fibrils of the sac stretch to accommodate the change. 删除9：<u>2 </u>When this happens gradually, the volume–pressure relationship is adjusted as extra space for expansion is created by the pericardial stretching over time. As such, a higher volume-to-pressure ratio is needed to impair ventricular filling pressures, thereby causing minimal effects on haemodynamics. 删除9：<u>2 </u>This accommodation will happen until the elastic fibrils reach the threshold of their maximum stretching capacity. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【46】However, if these increases in volume within the pericardial sac happen over a short period of time, even with a much smaller volume of fluid in the sac, there will not be time for fibrils to stretch to accommodate, and so it will take less volume to create enough pressure to overpower the diastolic ventricular filling pressures and impair cardiac output. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Therefore, the patient’s clinical manifestations do not only depend on the amount of fluid present within the pericardial sac but, more so, the rate of fluid accumulation. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>This explains why our patient had over 1 L of fluid in the pericardium and was normotensive and haemodynamically stable on presentation. Had this much fluid built up acutely over a short time, her heart would not have had enough time to adequately compensate, and she would have likely presented with Beck’s triad or in cardiac arrest.\n\n【47】### The unique cause of her pericardial effusion\n\n【48】The patient was found to have MAC-induced haemorrhagic pericardial effusion complicated by cardiac tamponade. This is a rare finding, as MAC-induced pericarditis is usually seen in HIV-infected patients or those with other significant immunocompromised states. Historically, MAC infections in immunocompetent patients manifest as pulmonary infections in older white men with underlying lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, prior TB or bronchiectasis, and a history of alcohol abuse. 删除9：<u>3 5</u>\n\n【49】Our patient did not have any significant evidence of extensive pulmonary disease, and her sputum cultures were consistently negative for MTB. Furthermore, during the VATS procedure, there were no reported granulomas of the epicardium. However, she had multiple fibrous loculations within the pericardial space. This would indicate that her infection was primarily localised to the pericardium.\n\n【50】MAC is often found in tap water, soil, milk, domesticated and wild animals. 删除9：<u>5 6 </u>Like other non-tuberculous mycobacteria, it is non-communicable from person to person. However, it is clinically significant, as it can cause severe disseminated disease, particularly in immunocompromised patients, and has a remarkable propensity to develop resistance to most anti-mycobacterial agents. 删除9：<u>6 7 </u>Table 2 shows a summarised list of other cases of MAC pericarditis in immunocompetent patients. There are very few cases, and like our case, the mechanism by which MAC enters and infects the pericardium remains an intriguing enigma.\n\n【51】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【52】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 2\n\n【53】A list of four other documented cases of MAC-induced/related pericarditis in immune-competent patients and comparing them with this case</u>\n\n【54】### Treatment of MAC-induced pericarditis in an immunocompetent patient\n\n【55】Another interesting part of this case is that this patient’s symptoms resolved without any anti-mycobacterial therapy. She underwent pericardiocentesis, then VATS drainage of her residual effusion, and was treated with a 6-week course of NSAIDs. Her fevers resolved, her cardiopulmonary symptoms resolved and there is no evidence of recurrence of her haemorrhagic effusion after 3 months. This case is one of very few documented where MAC pericarditis resolved with surgical drainage and an extended course of NSAIDs alone .\n\n【56】Like these cases, there was no evidence of disseminated infection. We postulate that since our patient, in addition to the above-stated patients, was immunocompetent, drainage of the effusion was enough to significantly decrease the bacterial load within the pericardial space, allowing the immune system to clear the infection more easily (much like with the drainage of an abscess). In the case described by Shiota, MAC antibody titres were measured post-pericardial drainage, which was noted to decrease gradually despite no anti-mycobacterial agents. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Such a finding supports our argument that in an immunocompetent patient with an absence of disseminated infection, surgical drainage and the use of NSAIDs are sufficient to prevent the recurrence of MAC-induced pericarditis. However, larger studies will be required to validate this argument.\n\n【57】One could argue that since this patient had such a significant illness from the infection, treatment with anti-mycobacterial therapy was warranted. However, as the studies in table 2 prove, this is not needed in every case to resolve the infection. While anti-mycobacterial therapy is an option, it is not the best option in this case. This patient showed clinical resolution of her symptoms even before her cultures were positive for MAC. At that point, her only treatment was surgical drainage and NSAIDs. Anti-mycobacterial treatment of MAC requires a very extended course as MAC is known to be notoriously resistant to anti-mycobacterial agents. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Given the higher dosing and longer treatments required, the side effects are significant. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Since the patient was clinically improving and immunocompetent, the risks of anti-mycobacterial therapy greatly outweighed the benefits. As such, the decision was made to treat conservatively with NSAIDs after the pericardial window.\n\n【58】### Limitations\n\n【59】Some may argue that since MAC was only found in some samples and did not grow on histology samples, positive cultures could have resulted from contamination, given that this organism is ubiquitous in the environment. However, true infection cannot be reasonably excluded in this case for several reasons:\n\n【60】1.  There were three pericardial samples taken on different dates in different sterile environments. The first was in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory from the pericardial tap done by the interventional cardiologist. The second was 2 days later in the operating room where thoracotomy and the pericardial window were done by the cardiothoracic surgeon. The third was taken as a sterile sample from the chest tube drain 2 days postoperatively. Two out of the three samples grew MAC.\n\n【61】2.  This was further supported by four of five sputum samples growing MAC.\n\n【62】3.  The patient had a positive QuantiFERON-Gold test initially. However, PCR and gene testing for MTB on pericardial fluid and sputum samples were negative. According to Harirzadeh _et al,_ PCR is the gold standard for detecting MTB as it is highly sensitive and specific. It can reliably detect MTB in both active and latent TB. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Hence, this initial QuantiFERON-Gold likely represented a false positive. After resolution of her pericarditis with surgical drainage and NSAIDs, a repeated QuantiFERON-Gold test months later was negative, confirming that the patient did not have latent TB. Hence, the false-positive initial QuantiFERON-Gold test was likely from a true underlying MAC infection, as infections with non-tuberculous bacilli such as MAC can cause false-positive QuantiFERON-Gold tests. 10\n\n【63】4.  Lastly, though pericardial tissue cultures did not yield MAC, histopathology did show evidence of inflammatory changes and granuloma formation in attached lymph nodes. This further supported the presence of true infection.\n\n【64】Since anaerobic and aerobic cultures and viral studies were all negative and MTB PCR was negative, a true MAC-induced pericarditis remained the most likely explanation. Hence, we maintain that this patient had a localised infection of the pericardial space from MAC which led to her haemorrhagic pericardial effusion.\n\n【65】To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of MAC-induced pericarditis with associated cardiac tamponade in a young woman with no smoking, alcohol abuse or pulmonary disease history who was successfully treated with surgical drainage and NSAIDs only.\n\n【66】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【67】I was diagnosed with pericarditis 8 months ago. I still cannot believe what happened to me and how critical a situation I was in. I was in a state of denial in the beginning, I thought I was a relatively healthy person who is a non-smoker, non-drinker, who did not have any health issues except for hypertension. When my primary care doctor suggested I go to the emergency room as soon as possible to do EKG I did not realize it was life-threatening. I had fever for almost two weeks and in the later stage shortness of breath with some chest pain. I walked into the emergency room and walked back home after ten days, and that has changed my life forever. I cannot thank enough all the doctors, nurses, and other technicians involved in my treatment.\n\n【68】The emergency pericardiocentesis was done with local anesthesia, so I was watching the whole process and talked to the doctors. That was very scary. Later, VATS \\[video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery\\] surgery was performed with a pericardial window and chest tube on the right side. The ten days in the hospital were very overwhelming as I was the center of attention. The pain was immense but controlled with medications. The doctors explained the whole process and the treatments provided very well. The most difficult stage was coping with all these emotionally and mentally.\n\n【69】A week after I was discharged I was rushed to the ER \\[emergency room\\] due to immense pain in the lower ribs area. I was told the pain was due to the air sacs forming in the lungs area which took a couple of weeks to subside after the continuous breathing exercise. But this led me to be emotionally unstable and depressed. It is great that the pericardial effusion has not relapsed, but I am still concerned. I consider myself extremely lucky that the timing was right for me and I am in a country where the best treatment is available.\n\n【70】Looking back, I think if I had not gone to the doctor that day who knows if I would be alive today or if I was back in my home country, I am sure I would not have received the timely diagnosis and treatment which means I would not have survived. However, I am grateful. I appreciate that I am still breathing and continuing the journey of life. Each medical case is different and if my case could assist doctors, and researchers in understanding and explore in any way I think that’s a good thing. A huge THANK YOU to all the doctors, nurses, and technicians in the hospital where I was treated and across the globe.\n\n【71】### Learning points\n\n【72】*   Cardiac tamponade is not a purely clinical diagnosis as patients can present without the typical hypotension, muffled heart sounds and distended neck veins.\n\n【73】*   As was demonstrated in this case, the rate of pericardial fluid buildup is a more important contributing factor to the patient’s clinical presentation than the size of the effusion itself.\n\n【74】*   _Mycobacterium avium_ complex (MAC) is a non-tuberculous _Mycobacterium_ that has the potential to cause severe disseminated infections and localised infection of the pericardium.\n\n【75】*   MAC is non-communicable from person to person and does not require airborne isolation.\n\n【76】*   Like other non-tuberculous mycobacteria, MAC has a high resistance to anti-mycobacterials, and treatment of localised infections to the pericardium does not always warrant anti-mycobacterial therapy.\n\n【77】*   In MAC-associated pericarditis with effusion, patients who are immunocompetent and without any signs of disseminated infection can be successfully treated with pericardial fluid drainage and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone without the need for anti-mycobacterial agents.\n\n【78】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【79】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【80】Obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:51:36", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:51:59", "cost": 22.411}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:26", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:51:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:51:36"}

On slit lamp examination, pupillary ruff hypertrophy was present in both eyes but much more severe in the L/E than in the R/E . We also observed that hypertrophied pigment clumps were detached from the pupillary border and deposited at various levels on the anterior surface of the iris . On gonioscopy, we noticed detached pigment deposits in angle in the L/E  with open angles in three quadrants in both eyes. The R/E angle was normal . Optic disc evaluation showed 0.9 and 0.6 cup to disc ratio (CDR) in the L/E and R/E, respectively. The patient had increased IOP, CDR and advanced glaucoma only in the L/E. This was an unusual presentation of unilateral advanced glaucoma with pupillary ruff hypertrophy and pigment deposits on the iris surface and angle. We further investigated the patient and did anterior segment-optical coherence tomography to rule out the cystic nature of pigment deposits, which revealed multiple solid lesions in the L/E  but only a single deposit on the iris surface in the R/E . Retinal nerve fibre layer optical coherence tomography (RNFL-OCT) was done which revealed severe thinning in the L/E but normal RNFL thickness in the R/E . Earlier we made a differential diagnosis of combined mechanism glaucoma as per the study by Sihota _et al_ 1 in the L/E but R/E still had normal RNFL and non-glaucomatous cupping. We believe that the rise in IOP and development of glaucoma in the L/E, in this case, was due to multiple pigment deposits in angle and came with another differential diagnosis of ‘pupillary ruff hypertrophy with secondary open-angle glaucoma’.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】(A) Clinical photo of the right eye (R/E) showing mild pupillary ruff hypertrophy.

Here, we present a case with a metastatic urothelial carcinoma who received nivolumab and palliative radiotherapy to a residual tumour in the vagina and to a large metastatic visceral lymph node. The treatment resulted in a rapid and virtually complete response for the time being in all metastases and in the large parailiac tumour mass. Follow up continues. The presented case demonstrates that the combinatory treatment with radiotherapy and immunotherapy can result in an exceptional response for the benefit of the patient with urothelial cancer. To our knowledge, this is one of the largest metastatic masses to disappear with a combination of immuno-oncologic (nivolumab) and radiation therapies.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   Urological cancer\n*   Radiotherapy\n*   Urology\n*   Chemotherapy\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Binding of PD-L1 on tumour cells to the PD-1 receptor on T cells results in T-cell exhaustion and abnormal inactivation of T-cell-mediated antitumour immunity. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Checkpoint targeting cancer immunotherapies rely on monoclonal antibodies that block the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 and thereby reinvigorate the antitumour immunity. 删除9：<u>9 10 </u>Nivolumab (OPDIVO) is a human IgG4 antibody, which by binding to PD-1 restores the antitumour activity of T cells. Nivolumab was approved for second-line treatment after platinum-based chemotherapy in metastatic UC by FDA and European Medicine Agency (EMA) after the CheckMate 275 multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial. 删除9：<u>11 </u>The median overall survival was reported to be 5.95 months in a subgroup, where <1% of tumour cells expressed PD-L1 and 11.3 months in a subgroup where the expression was ≥1% (investigated with Dako PD-L1 immunohistochemical 28-8 pharmDx kit). The median overall survival in the overall treated population was 8.74 months, which surpasses the 6.98 months of pooled median overall survival observed with single-drug chemotherapies. 删除9：<u>12</u>\n\n【9】Radiation therapy leads to tumour cell death and subsequent release of cytokines and other tumour-associated neoantigens. Antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), process the neoantigens into peptides and display them on their cell surfaces in complex with the major histocompatibility class II molecules. DC-mediated presentation of the antigens to cytotoxic T cells results in T-cell priming and subsequent activation of T-cell dependent tumour elimination mechanisms. 删除9：<u>13 </u>The current understanding is that cancer immunotherapy can further enhance this effect by inhibiting the PD-L1-mediated inactivation of T cells. 删除9：<u>9 14</u>\n\n【10】Deep and long-lasting responses to immunotherapy scheduled soon after or simultaneously with radiotherapy have been reported in patients with advanced UC. Magalhães and colleagues reported in 2021 a case of unresectable oligometastatic UC that was treated with radiotherapy with a total dose of 56 Gy to pelvic lesion leading to lesion stabilisation at size 50×31 mm. 删除9：<u>15 </u>Due to renal impairment, the patient was considered ineligible for chemotherapy and thus atezolizumab was initiated as the first-line therapy in April 2018. After four cycles of treatment, CT scan showed a complete response. The treatment was later terminated due to impaired renal function, yet the complete response maintained for several years. Excellent response to combination therapy was also observed in a patient with UC with metastases in the breast, thoracic wall and para-aortic lymph nodes. 删除9：<u>16 </u>The patient received pembrolizumab as a second-line therapy after GC, together with stereotactic radiotherapy with a total dose of 30 Gy in three fractions to the breast and thoracic wall metastases. Intriguingly, the combination of radiotherapy and four cycles of pembrolizumab led to complete response in all disease sites. 删除9：<u>16</u>\n\n【11】Here, we present a case of a woman with a widespread metastatic UC, who after failed GC treatment received nivolumab and palliative radiotherapy to a residual tumour in the vagina and to a large metastatic visceral lymph node. CT imaging revealed a complete response to the treatment and radiographic finding was in line with excellent symptom relief. The opioids were no longer needed, and the patient was able get back to work and return to her old lifestyle with hiking and other outdoor activities.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】In the spring 4 years ago, a non-smoking woman in her 50s came to the emergency room suffering from macroscopic haematuria and flank pain. The patient was examined with CT imaging, which identified a putative tumour in the bladder and bilateral hydronephrosis. Transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) was performed, and the left ureter was stented. Nephrostomy was placed on the right kidney, as the ureteric orifice could not be identified. Pathological assessment of the tumour demonstrated a high-grade muscle invasive UC. The patient received reduced neoadjuvant doses of GC due to declined glomerular filtration rate. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> (dose reduction 30%) on days 1, 删除13：<u>8, 15 </u>and cisplatin 70 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> (dose reduction 30%) on day 2 was administered every 4 weeks for three full cycles. A robotic-assisted laparoscopic cystectomy, with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy, resection of the uterus, ovaries and the top of vagina, was performed together with Bricker ileal conduit diversion.\n\n【14】In the beginning of the following year, we observed new metastases in the lungs and a large residual tumour contacting the vagina. The administration of GC was reinitiated with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> (dose reduction 30%–40%) on days 1, 删除13：<u>8, 15 </u>and cisplatin 70 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> (dose reduction 30%–35%) on day 2 every 4 weeks for three cycles. The third cycle was stopped on day 2 due to symptomatic disease progression. The tumour continued to grow through the vaginal wall and resulted in vaginal bleeding. Consequently, the patient received palliative radiotherapy of 30 Gy to the vaginal tumour and the bleeding stopped. Six months later, nivolumab was initiated with a fixed dose of 240 mg once every 2 weeks and it was later on administered with approved dosing schedules 240 mg once every 2 weeks or 480 mg once every 4 weeks. A CT scan was performed 6 months after the treatment initiation, which revealed that the metastases in the lungs as well as the residual tumour contacting the vagina had responded well to the treatment. However, an additional metastasis in the lymph node next to the right iliac veins had substantially grown (7.7×6.2 cm) irrespective of the immuno-oncologic (IO) treatment. This resulted in increased pain in the groin area and in the lower limb. In the beginning of next year, the patient received palliative radiotherapy of 12 Gy to the parailiac metastasis simultaneously to the ongoing nivolumab treatment.

Practically the entire tumour mass had disappeared, and the overall condition of the patient had markedly improved. In the following CT scan performed 3 months later, the complete response was maintained for time being and the requirement for pain medication had ended. Furthermore, the physical condition of the patient had considerably improved allowing her to return to predisease exercise scheme and back to her old job. After 9 months of complete response, the nivolumab treatment was discontinued. We propose that the exceptional response was achieved by combining PD-1-targeting antibody therapy and radiotherapy.\n\n【20】For further understanding of the clinical behaviour of the tumour and to contemplate on the mechanisms behind the observed excellent response, we performed retrospective immunohistochemical analyses on the primary tumour samples. The expression of PD-1 was assessed with monoclonal mouse anti-human PD-1 clone NAT105 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and PD-L1 with a monoclonal rabbit anti-human PD-L1 clone E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts, USA). Interestingly, PD-1 and PD-L1 protein expression was detected in the primary tumour excised from the bladder , indicating that the cancer-associated immune evasion mechanisms were activated in the primary tumour. Although focusing only on the primary tumour, these results are in line with previous findings, where strong expression of PD-L1 in bladder tumours has been shown to positively correlate with good response to combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors and radiotherapy. 删除9：<u>14</u>\n\n【21】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【22】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【23】Histological analysis of the primary tumour in the bladder.

Retreatment with nivolumab resulted in a partial response as the para-aortic lymph node metastasis was found diminished. In the following CT scan, mildly symptomatic peribronchial consolidates were detected in both lungs. The radiological finding suited primarily to Grade 2 (Common Terminology Criteraia for Adverse Events, CTCAE, grading scale) IO pneumonitis. Due to the observations, nivolumab treatment was ceased, and the patient was treated with per oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg. By the end of last year, the peribronchial consolidates had markedly diminished and the patient reported no lung-related symptoms. The treatment with nivolumab was yet again reinitiated.\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】Variable cisplatin combinations are the golden standard for the first-line treatment of metastatic or inoperable UC. 删除9：<u>2 </u>However, the treatment strategy presents a considerable challenge, since approximately 40% of the patients are not applicable for the treatment due to poor performance status, decreased renal function and platinum-related serious adverse effects. 删除9：<u>17 </u>Today, several immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, avelumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic UC. From the used antibodies, atezolizumab and pembrolizumab are an alternative first-line therapy option for cisplatin unfit PD-L1 positive patients. 删除9：<u>18 </u>Nivolumab is used in the second line after platinum-based treatment by EMA’s acceptance in Europe. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【27】Roughly 20% of the patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors will respond to treatment. 删除9：<u>19 </u>There have been several studies indicating that irradiation can increase the effectivity of immunotherapies in BC. 删除9：<u>20 </u>Currently, there are several ongoing phase II and III studies trying to increase the treatment response rates by combining chemotherapy or radiotherapy to immuno-oncology-based treatments. 删除9：<u>21</u>\n\n【28】Combined immunotherapy and radiotherapy are thought to enhance the cancer treatment responses by radiotherapy-induced release of circulating tumour neoantigens consequently leading to more effective activation of tumour-specific cytotoxic T cells that have the ability to elicit their effects also at distant tumour sites. 删除9：<u>17 </u>Previous studies and case reports have demonstrated that combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy can in some cases also result in a strong and universal abscopal-like treatment response outside the radiation target site. 删除9：<u>9 17 </u>Here, we report a case, where a patient with aggressive metastatic UC achieved a complete response after immune-oncological treatment and palliative radiotherapy. We found that PD-L1, an inhibitory checkpoint protein, was highly expressed in the primary tumour.\n\n【29】Previous studies have hypothesised that immunotherapy might also enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy. In IMvigor130 trial, they compared atezolizumab with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy versus atezolizumab alone. 删除9：<u>22 </u>The KEYNOTE 361 compared pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy. 删除9：<u>23 </u>In the third study (DANUBE), Powles and colleagues compared combination of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor tremelimumab and durvalumab versus chemotherapy versus durvalumab. 删除9：<u>24 </u>The results from these three large phase III studies unfortunately failed to show overall survival benefit of combining IO therapy to platinum-based chemotherapy over chemotherapy only. 删除9：<u>22–24 </u>Thereby, modern immunotherapies are valuable addition to the repertoire of cancer treatments but at least thus far, they cannot fully replace chemotherapy in metastatic UC.\n\n【30】Currently, the optimal treatment sequence after complete or long-lasting partial response is not known. The initial studies investigating the immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of metastatic UC were designed to continue the treatment until progression or serious adverse effects were detected, or up to 24 months. 删除9：<u>11 25 </u>Several currently ongoing studies are aiming to identify the optimal time to cease the treatment. 删除9：<u>26 </u>In a retrospective study, retreatment of once ceased immunotherapy with nivolumab in non-small cell lung cancer appeared to be beneficial. 删除9：<u>27 </u>After a robust complete response to immunotherapy, the treatment is often paused and reinitiated if signs of disease progression are observed during follow-up. In the presented case, new long-lasting response was achieved with nivolumab retreatment, suggesting that reinitiation of the treatment might be beneficial also when treating patients with UC.\n\n【31】Our case is a presentation of metastatic UC with an exceptional response in large metastases to the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Our patient also benefited from the retreatment with nivolumab after cancer relapse. Together with the ongoing clinical trials, this case provides evidence that the combinatory treatment strategy is beneficial even for patients with metastatic and platinum pretreated UC.\n\n【32】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【33】Translated from Finnish to English according to patient’s briefing by the authors.\n\n【34】“The time in chemotherapy was challenging. The infusion time was long and the reaction in my body lasted for several days with different kinds of adverse effects. During the immunotherapy, the infusion time was considerably shorter, and I experienced the treatment to be gentler than chemotherapy. I experienced only mild tiredness for few days after the treatment, which helped the return to normal everyday life. The most unpleasant symptoms were localised to oral mucosa. For me personally, the most important thing is of course that the treatment has helped me. However, I consider this case report to be also highly significant, because if it can help even one patient to get this treatment and have a good response, it has all been worth it.”\n\n【35】### Learning points\n\n【36】*   Immunotherapy is a viable treatment option after failed cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.\n\n【37】*   Radiotherapy enhances the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic bladder cancer.\n\n【38】*   A subset of patients with urothelial cancer will likely benefit from retreatment with nivolumab after once ceased treatment.\n\n【39】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【40】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【41】Obtained.\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr Minna Jääskeläinen from the Department of Oncology, Lapland Central Hospital is acknowledged for the exceptional comments and oncological treatment of the patient.

An abdominal CT scan with contrast is given to confirm the diagnosis by determining a reduction in the angle between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, with compression of the third duodenal portion.

She reported that in adolescence she had suffered from eating disorders with anorexia and bulimia.\n\n【12】Deep palpation showed that the patient’s abdomen was tense with an upper part guarding and marked epigastric regional pain; no abdominal organ enlargement was found. A tympanitic sound to percussion was found in all quadrants together with normal bowel peristalsis.\n\n【13】Blood chemistry did not show any changes other than a mild increase in indirect bilirubin values related to Gilbert’s syndrome. A urine test showed a urinary tract infection which was treated with specific antibiotic therapy.\n\n【14】At admission, the patient’s weight was 45 kg with a body mass index (BMI) of 14.69 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . The patient reported a weight loss of 6 kg in the previous 3 months linked to the severe post-prandial epigastric pain.\n\n【15】Abdominal ultrasonography, influenced by considerable gastrointestinal meteorism, showed two cystic formations in the right ovary, which was previously known. Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography showed the presence of a small infiltrating endometriotic outbreak isolated at the right sacral uterine ligament level.

At the 1-year follow-up, as a result of the weight gain and psychological support, the patient showed a significant reduction in her symptoms.\n\n【37】Discussion\n----------\n\n【38】Chronic recurrent abdominal pain without signs of inflammation or organ impairment can be difficult to treat. This case shows a rare cause of abdominal pain, particularly affecting women who undergo rapid weight loss, triggering a vicious circle leading to the onset of SMAS or Wilkie’s syndrome. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【39】An accurate medical history and subsequent radiological investigation are important to obtain an early diagnosis and to reduce inappropriate treatments or invasive tests. A medical approach is usually the first therapeutic option.\n\n【40】In this case, the patient’s anxiety-depressive syndrome and her past history of anorexia nervosa 6 misled the diagnostic process, with the weight loss initially being attributed to these disorders.\n\n【41】The diagnosis of SMAS could be suggested by abdominal ultrasonography, taking into consideration the possible negative influence that bloating and abdominal pain may have on the measurement of the aorto–mesenteric angle. Therefore, the gold standard for the measurement of this angle is a contrast-enhanced CT scan.\n\n【42】At the 1-year follow-up, our approach with only oral nutritional supplements and psychological support resulted in pain reduction and increased weight.\n\n【43】Wan _et al_ 7 have recently reported the use of enteral nutrition in 26 patients with SMAS as an effective option in the relief of symptoms, leading to an increase in weight.\n\n【44】It has been reported that conservative treatment is successful only in patients with a short history of SMAS and a minor degree of duodenal stenosis. In our case, despite the significant stenosis, the nutritional support restored part of the retroperitoneal fat, widening the angle between the two vessels, which resolved the compression, reduced the stomach dilation and relieved the symptoms. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【45】### Learning points\n\n【46】*   The signs and symptoms of SMAS are usually non-specific and can easily lead to misdiagnosis.\n\n【47】*   SMAS should be suspected in patients with rapid and significant weight loss and chronic abdominal pain not explained by other causes.\n\n【48】*   This clinical case is intended to be an example of a condition to consider in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain.\n\n【49】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【50】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【51】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:26:19", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:27:02", "cost": 42.985}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:26", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:27:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:26:19"}

Since there are no reports of proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) dislocation caused by EDS, little is known about the long-term course of this disease. A woman in her 40s presented with a posterolaterally depressed tibial condyle and severe valgus deformity caused by a long-standing PTFJ dislocation due to EDS. Considering the pathology, posterolateral open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (PLOWHTO) and medial closed-wedge distal femoral osteotomy were performed according to the deformity analysis. A favourable short-term clinical outcome was obtained and the PTFJ dislocation was reduced over time. Although PLOWHTO has several pitfalls, it is a logical and useful surgical technique that can help treat posterolateral dysplasia of the tibial plateau concomitant with severe valgus deformity, regardless of joint laxity, if performed with attention to pitfalls.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   Orthopaedics\n*   Knee laxity\n*   Knee injuries\n*   Orthopaedic and trauma surgery\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Although various types of joint dislocations have been reported, 删除13：<u>1–3 </u>there are no previous reports on proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) dislocations caused by EDS.

Her left knee pain gradually worsened with time after undergoing a lateral meniscectomy 10 years ago.

The target mechanical axis was planned as the postoperative WBL ratio passed through 50% from the medial edge of the tibial plateau. Accordingly, the correction angle was planned to be 6° by medial closed-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (MCWDFO) and 8° by posterolateral open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (PLOWHTO). The posterior opening distance was calculated to be 8 mm based on a 3-dimensional printed model (ZimmerBiomet G.K. Tokyo, Japan) . Although the standard value of the tibial posterior slope is 6° when the posterior cortex is used as a reference line, 删除13：<u>7 </u>the target slope was planned to be around 10° to prevent further hyperextension of the knee.\n\n【27】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【28】### Treatment\n\n【29】The patient was placed in a supine position under general anaesthesia. No tourniquet was used throughout the whole arthroscopy and femoral, fibular and tibial osteotomy procedures. After arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for a flap tear of the posterior segment of the lateral meniscus, a biplanar MCWDFO was performed using a subvastus approach according to the procedure described by Nakamura _et al_ . 删除9：<u>8 </u>The osteotomized site was fixed with an MCWDFO-specific locking plate (TriS Medial DFO Plate, Olympus Terumo Biomaterials, Tokyo, Japan). The peroneal nerve was then released through a posterolateral longitudinal skin incision, separate from the incision for the tibial osteotomy, to prevent peroneal nerve palsy by posterolateral opening. The posterolateral incision provided working space for subsequent fibular osteotomy with safe and sufficient retraction of the released nerve. Segmental fibular osteotomy was performed through the same incision immediately below the fibular head .\n\n【30】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【31】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【32】The peroneal nerve neurolysis and fibula osteotomy of the left knee.

The tibialis anterior and posterior soft tissues were subperiosteally released. Two Kirschner wires (2.0 mm diameter) were inserted 40 mm distal to the lateral proximal tibial plateau to 15 mm distal to the medial proximal tibial joint surface. A hinge point was set at approximately 5 mm before the medial tibial cortex. Since PLOWHTO is likely to be unstable following a hinge fracture, the medial plate (TomoFix small version, DePuy Synthes, Bettlach, Switzerland) was temporarily fixed with two Kirschner wires before tibial osteotomy . For the medial plating, the anteromedial arthroscopic portal was extended distally by 3 cm and the plate was subcutaneously installed.\n\n【34】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【35】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【36】Medial plating before posterolateral opening.

The removed fibula was crushed and used as a gap filler, and two bone-substitute wedges made of beta-tricalcium phosphate (OSferion60 Marvelous; Olympus Terumo Biomaterials, Tokyo, Japan) were inserted between the lateral cortices . Lateral fixation was then performed using an locking compression plate (LCP) proximal lateral tibial plate (DePuy Synthes, Bettlach, Switzerland), and medial plate fixation was completed using locking screws . Range of motion exercises were initiated on the first day after surgery, and full weight-bearing was allowed at 6 weeks.\n\n【38】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【39】Postoperative radiography of the entire leg revealed an anatomically corrected WBL (51%). mLDFA and mMPTA were corrected to 91° from 85° and 92° from 100°, respectively. The 3-dimensional CT demonstrated that the lateral tibial posterior slope angle decreased from 17° to 11° after surgery . Both coronal and sagittal alignments were maintained for 2 years after surgery , and the PTFJ dislocation was reduced over time .\n\n【40】At 2 years of follow-up, the patient reported no complaints and showed significant improvement in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. The score exceeded the minimal clinically important difference 12 except for the symptom subscale 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>.\n\n【41】Discussion\n----------\n\n【42】Although there have been reports of dislocation of the hip, patella, shoulder, elbow joints, etc, in patients with EDS, 删除13：<u>1–3 </u>a case of dislocation of the PTFJ associated with EDS has never been reported. Traumatic PTFJ dislocation in adulthood, although rare, 删除13：<u>13 </u>provides little useful information about the effects of PTFJ dislocation in skeletally immature knees on bony growth and/or bony deformities. From the present case, we found that the dislocation of the fibula, which acts as a supporting strut for the posterolateral part of the tibial condyle, 删除13：<u>14 15 </u>caused dysplasia of the posterolateral tibia, resulting in valgus knee alignment. It is possible that excessive lateral compartment loading exerted a compression force on the distal lateral femur, which also induced a valgus deformity of the distal femur.\n\n【43】In comparison with other syndromic dysplasias of the knee joint such as Blount disease, Turner syndrome or Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, the skin and blood vessels of EDS patients should be treated with special care because of the fragility of the systemic connective tissue. Gentle retraction and careful haemostasis during surgery could be crucial to a successful osteotomy. The use of separate incisions—an anterolateral incision for the tibial osteotomy and a posterolateral incision for the fibular osteotomy/peroneal nerve release—may enhance security. To control bleeding, we used a non-tourniquet procedure under strict blood pressure control (< 100 mm Hg) to ensure that any vascular injury could be detected during surgery, thus mitigating the risk of postoperative haemorrhagic swelling.\n\n【44】For patients with Blount disease or Turner syndrome, with severe varus of the knees with a single deformity centre around the medial tibial condyle, surgical correction with a large opening at one time should be avoided. An inverted V-shaped high tibial osteotomy, 删除13：<u>16 </u>which can reduce the opening distance, or gradual correction using the hemicallotasis method, 删除13：<u>17 </u>are possible options. For severe and complicated valgus deformity due to Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, two-step correction 18 may be the most reliable procedure. In the current case with EDS, the posterolateral opening distance was decreased by performing an MCWDFO according to the deformity analysis, reducing the risk of complications such as skin laceration, peroneal nerve palsy and/or delayed union.\n\n【45】The efficacy of TKA as a treatment for knee OA and joint instability associated with EDS has been reported previously. 删除9：<u>19 </u>However, it has also been reported that postoperative instability can necessitate revision surgery in some cases. 删除9：<u>20 21 </u>Since the valgus deformity was localised to the proximal tibia in this case, extra-articular osteotomy was a more logical and solution-oriented approach to the problems of joint laxity and deformity correction.\n\n【46】Considering the pathology, the correction osteotomy should be targeted for anatomical alignment. Therefore, we planned 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the posterolateral opening osteotomy of the tibia and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the medial closing osteotomy of the distal femur. Although MCWDFO can be performed in the usual manner, PLOWHTO has several pitfalls.\n\n【47】The important points to be considered when using this technique are as follows: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> peroneal nerve neurolysis is necessary; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> fibula osteotomy is performed just below the fibular head and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the posterolateral gap is opened after temporary plate fixation of the anteromedial site. Mechanical stretching of the nerve is likely to contribute to nerve injury or ischaemia, 删除13：<u>22 23 </u>resulting in peroneal nerve palsy. Prior to fibula osteotomy, peroneal nerve neurolysis creates a working space for the osteotomy by retracting the peroneal nerve. Fibular osteotomy before PLOWTHO must be performed just below the fibular head because the crural interosseous membrane stabilises the positional relationship between the tibia and fibula . The crural interosseous membrane makes it challenging to open the gap if fibular osteotomy is performed at the midportion of the fibula . In medial OWHTO, the PTFJ stabilises the osteotomy site, even if a type I hinge fracture occurs . 删除9：<u>24 </u>In addition, in hybrid closed-wedge HTO, the medial collateral ligament acts as a tension band, leading to medial stability . 删除9：<u>25 </u>However, in PLOWHTO, there is no stabilising effect on the anteromedial aspect of the osteotomy site, which leads to instability following a hinge fracture . Therefore, temporary anteromedial plate fixation was necessary before opening the posterolateral gap . Attention to these critical factors can help reduce the risks of intraoperative and postoperative complications.\n\n【48】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【49】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 6\n\n【50】The role of the crural interosseous membrane and the stabilizing effect of each osteotomy.

The figures were drawn by the first author (anonymised for the blinded review).</u>\n\n【51】Although this is a report of a single rare case and its short-term outcome, PLOWHTO can be applied to cases of tibial plateau fractures with lateral tibial dysplasia. However, it remains unknown whether patients need to undergo additional surgery in the long term. Segmental osteotomy of the fibula might cause deformity of the tibia in the long term owing to the lack of support of the fibula. As segmental osteotomy of the fibula can shorten the course of the peroneal nerve, we performed segmental osteotomy in this case. Although the short-term clinical outcomes were favourable, further follow-up is required.\n\n【52】In conclusion, we performed a novel osteotomy adapted to the patient’s pathology and deformity in a young patient with genu valgum due to EDS, which led to good short-term outcomes. PLOWHTO is considered a valuable surgical technique when performed with attention to pitfalls.\n\n【53】### Learning points\n\n【54】*   Proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome causes dysplasia of the posterolateral tibia, resulting in a severe valgus-aligned knee.\n\n【55】*   Depending on the patient’s condition and deformity, extra-articular osteotomy may be helpful in certain cases.\n\n【56】*   In posterolateral open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (PLOWHTO), peroneal nerve neurolysis is necessary to avoid peroneal nerve palsy.\n\n【57】*   PLOWHTO requires fibula osteotomy just below the fibula head to eliminate the effect of crural interosseous membrane stability.\n\n【58】*   In PLOWHTO, anteromedial temporary fixation provides a medial stabilising effect.\n\n【59】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【60】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【61】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Hiroyuki Tsuchiya, MD, PhD, Atsushi Okawa, MD, PhD, Hideyuki Koga, MD, PhD for continuous support, Kaori Matsumoto for shooting photos and Editage.  for English-language editing.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:20:34", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:20:55", "cost": 21.018}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:26", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:20:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:20:33"}

Microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (MLB) identified a 3 cm posterior laryngeal cleft (LC) with a pit connecting the trachea to oesophagus at the midpoint between the distal cleft and carina (tracheo-oesophageal fistula, TOF).

Her parents noticed that these behaviours would often be triggered when she was introduced to a new place or left alone in her room. She also had insomnia. During examination, the child appeared distracted and could not form meaningful eye contact. She was crying as she was entering the consultation room. She repeatedly placed her palms over her mouth, sometimes licking her palms . There was also an increasing frequency of hitting one hand with another palm of her hand. She was not able to verbalise any comprehensible words. Antenatally, her conception was unexpected, as her mother had earlier performed bilateral tubal ligation after her fifth delivery. There was evidence of intrauterine growth retardation, but she was born at term via elective caesarean section, weighing only 2 kg. She then developed severe neonatal jaundice and received phototherapy. She developed epilepsy when she was three year-old, which was controlled with syrup epilim 200 mg twice a day. Her last seizure was one year before the psychiatric contact. She had hypothyroidism when she was four year-old, controlled with oral L-thyroxine 25 mcg once a day. There were gross motor, fine motor, and social communication development delays. There is no family history of neurodevelopmental problems. Following psychiatric assessment, the child was diagnosed with intellectual disability (ID) with autistic features. This diagnosis was based on the marked social communication deficits and stereotypical patterns of behaviours that were similar to stimming in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) developed recently. She was prescribed oral risperidone 0.5 mg at night, with which her sleep and disruptive behaviours improved.\n\n【4】删除11：<u>Video 1 Repetitive behaviours of the child in the clinic.</u>\n\n【5】A child with GDD may also be diagnosed with ASD.

Neurological examination at ICU admission revealed tetrapyramidal syndrome and comatose state requiring mechanical ventilation. Brain MRI revealed bilateral T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery(FLAIR) hyperintense signal involving temporal and occipital lobes consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) . Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appeared cloudy with high protein level (2.18 g/L), without meningitis. Blood tests revealed hepatitis (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) 108 UI/L and serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) 118 UI/L) and microcytic regenerative anaemia at 68 g/dL. Basophilic stippling in the erythroblasts were found on the peripheral red blood smear . After ruling out the usual causes of PRES (eg, hypertension, autoimmune disorders and drugs) and considering the combination of these clinical and biological data, lead levels were measured at day 10 following ICU admission and were elevated in blood, CSF, urine and liver biopsy, respectively, at 797.9 µg/L (n<85), 24.0 µg/L (n<10), 172.0 µg/L (n<30) and 151.3 µg/g (n<3.1).

Its occurrence in the oral cavity is rare.

Microscopically it mimics some malignant vascular tumours and it is necessary to differentiate it from other malignant vascular lesions. We report a case of SCH in anterior mandibular region of a young male in his 20s. Although it is a benign lesion, the reported case displayed extensive areas of muscle infiltration and necrosis. After studying the radiographic findings and considering the absence of cellular atypia, a final diagnosis of SCH was made.

Lesion was extending to the right side with multiple tortuous vascular channels, suggestive of a vascular malformation. MRI (T2-weighted sequences) revealed mildly hyperintense lesion, which led to scalloping and thinning of outer cortex of mandible. The appearance was suggestive of a soft tissue tumour, possibly of vascular origin .

The overlying mucosa was excised. The borders of the lesion were demarcated in a meticulous manner by dissecting around the lesion followed by its complete removal. As the posterior margin was not easily discernible, the periosteum attached to the lesion was removed in this region.\n\n【24】Since the recurrence rate of head and neck SCH is low as compared with cutaneous SCH, 删除13：<u>5 6 </u>surgical excision was performed, which is considered as the standard treatment. Follow-up at 8 months revealed no recurrence of the lesion.\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】Oral pathologists may be unfamiliar with the histopathological features of SCH in view of the rarity of its occurrence in the oral cavity. SCH is a slow growing tumour; presenting as dermal or subcutaneous nodules and mainly affects the distal extremities. Superficial lesions appear bluish while the deeper lesions appear skin coloured due to the difference in the thickness of skin cover over the lesion. SCH mostly occur in middle-aged patients but may appear at any age 1 4 7 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>\n\n【27】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【28】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【29】Review of literature showing spindle cell haemangioma of oral cavity since 1995–2021</u>\n\n【30】Clinically, it presents as solitary or multiple subcutaneous nodules, so it could be considered in the differential diagnosis of benign soft tissue tumours. Published literature suggests that majority of cases occur in adult population. The mean age of occurrence is in the fourth decade with two cases reported from a younger population. 删除9：<u>5 8 </u>Male to female ratio was 1.2:1. The maximum reported size of the lesion was 3 cm and the longest duration of lesion existence prior to its diagnosis was reported as 5 years. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Approximately 10% of cases were associated with some inherited syndromes. Cai _et al_ reported a case of SCH of lower lip in a 34 years female associated with Maffucci syndrome. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【31】Microscopically, it presents as well-circumscribed mass surrounded by fibrous connective tissue showing a range of cellularity, imparting it a lobular architecture. 删除9：<u>10 </u>Variably sized blood vessels along with solid cellular areas are recognised as characteristic features. Solid cellular areas consist of spindle shaped cells with plump vesicular to hyperchromatic nuclei with some regions also showing epithelioid shaped endothelial cells. Vascular cavernous spaces are lined by endothelial cells and also contain erythrocytes. 删除9：<u>1 11 </u>Similar features were found in our case. Additionally, there was evidence of muscle and adipose tissue infiltration with a few areas of necrosis and the lesion lacked a definite capsule. However, prominent cytological atypia and mitotic figures were absent. It is necessary to differentiate SCH from other vascular tumours such as Kaposi sarcoma and angiosarcoma because the latter are malignant lesions. 删除9：<u>7 </u>In SCH, the presence of phleboliths in cavernous vessels and plump endothelial cells can differentiate it histologically from Kaposi’s sarcoma. Slit-spaces can be seen in Kaposi’s sarcoma, but it is not a prominent feature of SCH. Ancillary methods like immunohistochemistry are very useful to differentiate SCH from Kaposi’s sarcoma. Human herpesvirus 8 positivity is found in Kaposi’s sarcoma but is absent in SCH. Histologically, a lack of infiltrative growth pattern, significant nuclear atypia, high mitotic rate and atypical mitotic figures differentiate SCH from angiosarcoma. 删除9：<u>12 </u>On immunohistochemical analysis, CD31 and CD34 markers are helpful to deduce the origin of tumour cells in SCH. Along with these, IHC positivity for factor VIII and SMA is also present in SCH and can help in its diagnosis. 删除9：<u>4 7 13</u>\n\n【32】Clinical and radiological characterisation of vascular anomalies of the head and neck is necessary for guiding the appropriate treatment. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for the management of head and neck vascular anomalies. Spectral and colour Doppler ultrasonography and dynamic time resolved MR angiography are helpful to differentiate high and low flow vascular anomalies. Embolisation and sclerotherapy are the primary treatment options for these vascular lesions. 删除9：<u>14 </u>Nair _et al_ described a simplified algorithm for effective management of vascular lesions requiring surgery. 删除9：<u>15</u>\n\n【33】SCH is a rare benign vascular tumour of oral cavity and histologically it mimics some malignant vascular tumours. Therefore, it is essential to recognise this entity to avoid misdiagnosis and to differentiate it from other malignant vascular lesions.\n\n【34】### Learning points\n\n【35】*   Spindle cell haemangioma (SCH) is a rare slow growing benign vascular tumour.\n\n【36】*   Present report is the eleventh case of SCH reported in oral cavity.\n\n【37】*   Histopathologically, it mimics some malignant vascular tumours, which need to be carefully excluded to avoid misdiagnosis.\n\n【38】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【39】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【40】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:24:24", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:25:00", "cost": 36.123}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:26", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:25:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:24:24"}

He had travelled to Southeast Asia 4 months prior to presentation, but the onset of symptoms preceded this trip. The patient denied unsafe sexual practices, use of recreational drugs, over-the-counter medication and insect or tick bites. Physical examination revealed cervical lymphadenopathy with no axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Respiratory and abdominal examination was normal. Laboratory investigations revealed a mixed cholestatic and hepatitic liver function test profile (alanine aminotransferase 64 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 275 IU/L). Full blood count, blood film and lactate dehydrogenase were normal. Extended bacterial, viral screen, serology for auto-immune hepatitis and vasculitis was negative. Sputum microscopy for acid fast bacilli was negative. Serum immunoglobulin subclass-4 (IgG4) was elevated at 14.95 g/L (0.04–0.86 g/L) and the ACE was marginally elevated at 73 U/L (8–65 U/L). CT suggested diffuse infiltration of the liver with widespread lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and diffuse swelling of the pancreas. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed and demonstrated metabolically active lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm with multi-system inflammatory infiltrative involvement of pancreas, kidneys, spleen, prostate and intra-scrotal epididymis .\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Positron emission tomography scan demonstrating metabolically active lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm with multi-system inflammatory infiltrative involvement of pancreas, kidneys, spleen, prostate and intra-scrotal epididymis.</u>\n\n【7】The patient’s presentation, clinical assessment and initial investigations led to a differential diagnosis of lymphoma, TB, sarcoidosis and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Fine needle aspirate of the lymph node showed reactive changes with a lymphoplasmocytic infiltrate, but no granulomas or IgG4-positive cells. Liver biopsy revealed a single discrete granuloma, lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates and several IgG4-positive cells .

The case was discussed extensively in multi-disciplinary team meeting and based on significantly raised IgG4 levels, pancreatitis and multi-system involvement it was agreed to treat this as IgG4-RD, while maintaining a suspicion of sarcoidosis. Steroid therapy would be beneficial even if this was sarcoidosis. Excision lymph node biopsy was planned if there was no response to treatment. Six weeks after treatment with prednisolone 40 mg once a day, there was dramatic improvement in symptoms, normalisation of liver function tests and a fall in serum IgG4 level to 4.69 g/L. Repeat PET scan showed total resolution in multi-system inflammation . The patient is currently well after completing the steroid course and is currently not on any treatment. A repeat PET scan 1-year post diagnosis did not show any activity.\n\n【12】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【14】Positron emission tomography scan showed total resolution in multi-system inflammation.</u>\n\n【15】Our case demonstrates the complexities involved in the diagnosis and management of multi-system inflammation and the importance of multidisciplinary approach. This case was particularly challenging due to history of latent tuberculosis, lymphadenopathy with night sweats and weight loss. These findings raised possibility of lymphoma and TB and the diagnosis had to be carefully teased out for the correct management. IgG4-RD is a rare entity with varied manifestations, presenting a diagnostic challenge. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical, radiological and histological features. 删除9：<u>2 </u>IgG4 levels lack sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and monitoring this condition. Accurate diagnosis is important as IgG4-RD can mimic a malignant process. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Steroids are the mainstay of treatment. Long-term immunosuppression is not recommended at diagnosis and should be considered if there is insufficient response to steroids or relapse following withdrawal of steroid treatment. Azathioprine, mycophenalate, mercaptopurine and rituximab have been used as steroid sparing agents. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【16】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【17】For 3 years prior to diagnosis—I was under immense pressure at work and was being bullied for a prolonged period. During this time, all lifestyle factors remained constant except work stress.\n\n【18】Three months into my travel, I started to notice a few symptoms. At first, this was mainly tiredness, light cold and flu symptoms, which later led to feelings of nausea, particularly when I drank alcohol. For context, I would drink the equivalent of five pints—either every week or bi-monthly. As my travels continued, existing symptoms grew in severity and new symptoms like lower back pain, stomach pain, and issues passing urine, which I suspect were kidney pain as well as muscle stiffness and night sweats appeared. The night sweats were intense. Each night, I was waking up in what I can only describe as a soaking bed and was hot to the touch. All symptoms shifted from a mild/moderate state back in spring, to severe during summer. It got so bad that I lost all my appetite. For a period of around 6–8 weeks, I dropped from 75 kg to around 50 kg where the only food groups I could stomach could be a couple of pieces of fruit and some light proteins.\n\n【19】I saw a doctor who ran blood and a series of tests and concluded that I had rheumatoid arthritis and recommended I fly home as soon as possible. When I got home after my travels—the symptoms continued, and I admitted myself to emergency department at my local hospital. At first, they thought I had pancreatitis and gave a slightly patronising spiel in the emergency department that I was drinking too much. I appreciate the basic tests that were run; the results would point the medical professionals in that direction.\n\n【20】I challenged this and was referred to gastroenterology team and ran them through everything, step by step and in detail. They agreed that I needed more tests such as blood cultures, MRIs, PET, ultrasound, X-rays and biopsies—the works. It was then concluded that I had IGG-4. Without the patience to listen, the robustness of other types of tests and removing medical bias, I wouldn’t be here without those doctors. They’re a shining example of best practice within the trust and I hope anyone reading this takes inspiration from these wonderful doctors. They treated me with respect during such a turbulent time of my life and I’m eternally grateful.\n\n【21】### Learning points\n\n【22】*   IgG4 related disease is a rare and complex disease that can mimic malignancy and presents significant diagnostic challenges.\n\n【23】*   Multidisciplinary approach is paramount to diagnosis and management.\n\n【24】*   Steroids are the mainstay of treatment.\n\n【25】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【26】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【27】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:32:24", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:32:39", "cost": 14.185}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:26", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:32:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:32:24"}

The mother was in her early 20s, gravida 2 para 1, with no significant medical history. She did not have any risk factors for infection. There was no family history of convulsions or epilepsy. The parents are not consanguineous. She was seen in the antenatal clinic 1 day before the delivery with no maternal or fetal concerns. Antenatal workup was remarkable for the third-trimester ultrasound at 27+6 weeks showing the following: ‘prominent fetal cerebral ventricles, still within normal values, for follow-up’. Otherwise, her baby was growing normally with normal amniotic fluid and Doppler indices. She had no further imaging or special follow-up under the fetal medicine unit. On the delivery day, she was admitted electively for caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. She had uneventful delivery and perinatal course.\n\n【4】The infant was born cyanosed, non-vigorous with a weak cry and moderate respiratory distress. He required continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 30%. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively.\n\n【5】He was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) as a case of transient tachypnea of the newborn. On admission, he was found to have mild tachypnea with some dysmorphic features including prominent occiput, hypertelorism, clenched hands, micrognathia, high-arched palate and short prominent chest bones, clenched fists with overlapping fingers and rocker bottom feet. Regarding his respiratory support, he was weaned from CPAP to a nasal cannula with an oxygen flow of 3 L/min. X-ray showed cardiomegaly with changes impressive of respiratory distress syndrome. Ultrasounds of the skull and abdomen were done to rule out congenital anomalies. Ultrasound skull showed capacious ventricles with irregular ependymal wall and choroid plexuses. MRI was recommended to rule out disorders of migration. Ultrasound of the abdomen was unremarkable.\n\n【6】On the second day of life, the infant was found to be jittery with increased tone. In addition, he was found to have a soft systolic murmur. Echocardiography showed a large 8.6 mm II atrial septal defect with a left-to-right shunt, mild tricuspid regurgitation and small 2.2 mm patent ductus arteriosus, with mainly left-to-right shunt and signs of persistent pulmonary hypertension. Microarray and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis were ordered as workup features of trisomy 18.\n\n【7】On the third day of life, the baby was found to have abnormal multifocal movements with lip-smacking 删除10：<u>( video 1 )</u>. He was loaded with phenobarbitone 20 mg/kg once. Cerebral function monitoring showed abnormal seizures activity . The neurology team pointed out that the baby has dysmorphic features and suspected migration disorder findings on ultrasound, which put the infant at risk of refractory seizures. They decided to load the infant with levetiracetam 40 mg/kg, followed by a maintenance dose of 30 mg/kg/day every 12 hours. He continued to have seizures on levetiracetam and was given phenobarbitone 10 mg/kg. However, he continued to seize and was intubated for refractory seizures. On reassessment, he was found to have brisk reflexes and bilateral clonus. The neurology team recommended starting a midazolam drip besides levetiracetam maintenance of 30 mg/kg/day and phenobarbitone maintenance of 5 mg/kg/day after loading. Two hours of electroencephalography (EEG) was done while the patient was on a midazolam drip of 3 μg/kg/min. It showed abundant multifocal epileptic activities. Midazolam drip was increased to reach 15 μg/kg/min which decreased >50% of seizure activity. In addition, a levetiracetam maintenance dose was given during the EEG recording. Considering the worsening of the patient’s clinical condition, a blood culture was taken and he was started on ampicillin and amikacin. In addition, he was covered with the following antimicrobials for possible central nervous infection: benzylpenicillin (meningitic dose), gentamicin and acyclovir.\n\n【8】删除11：<u>Video 1</u>\n\n【9】Disclaimer: this video summarises a scientific article published by BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ).

Repeated chest X-rays showed normal cardiac and thymic shadows. Repeated echocardiography was grossly normal, apart from an aneurysmal septum. The patient failed the hearing screening test. Metabolic workup showed a slightly elevated ammonia level of 104 and a normal lactate level. Toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV, herpes simplex and HIV (TORCH) screen were remarkable for CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) positive results. Genetic workup (DNA banking, FISH and microarray) came out normal and excluded trisomy 18 abnormality. Genome-wide oligonucleotide array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) analysis was performed with the use of the Human Genome CGH Microarray kit (OGT). The array contains ~1 80 000 DNA oligonucleotide probes spaced approximately 30–37 kb apart genome-wide. The probe sequences and locations are from the human genome build (GRCh37). It yielded a normal hybridisation pattern for the genomic DNA obtained from the patient’s peripheral blood sample. The aCGH analysis did not identify any DNA copy number changes of known clinical significance in the patient. FISH analysis of a minimum of 200 interphase nuclei per probe for rapid detection of the copy number of chromosomes 18 was performed. The hybridisation signal pattern observed was normal, according to the performance standard. Whole exome sequencing was requested and it came back negative. The patient was extubated after 8 days of intubation. Antimicrobials were stopped after negative cultures and PCR. The patient was shifted from oral feeding to nasogastric tube feeding considering his frequent seizure activity and unsafe oral trial as per the assessment of the speech-language pathology team, with a plan of gastrostomy tube insertion for long-term feeding. The family refused gastrostomy tube insertion and the patient was kept on nasogastric tube feeding.\n\n【24】At 2 months of age, the patient was stepped down from NICU to the neurology floor after stabilising his condition on oral phenobarbitone 27 mg every 12 hours, oral topiramate 20 mg every 12 hours and oral levetiracetam 120 mg every 12 hours, for continuity of care and parental education. On the neurology floor, the patient was stable having seizures daily almost 3–40 episodes that last for seconds. Seizures were occasionally associated with desaturation that requires blow-by oxygen. The patient was discharged home after 12 days on oral phenobarbitone 30 mg every 12 hours, oral topiramate 25 mg every 12 hours and the same dose of oral levetiracetam 120 mg every 12 hours, rescue medications with neurology follow-up.\n\n【25】In summary, this is a case of a term male baby with an uneventful antenatal course, apart from prominent fetal cerebral ventricles, still within normal values. Postnatally, he was found to have dysmorphic features, upper motor neuron signs, multifocal abnormal movements and refractory to multiple different ALDs. Workup came remarkably for severe brain malformation and LIS, CMV IgG positive and elevated ammonia of 104. Seizures were stabilised at the frequency of daily 3–40 episodes of few seconds duration, on three ALDs, phenobarbitone, topiramate and levetiracetam.\n\n【26】The neonatal period has a considerably higher incidence of seizures than any other time of life and the term infant is at the highest risk of seizures. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Neonatal seizures occur in approximately 1–5 per 1000 live births in the USA and neonatal seizure is the most common neurological emergency. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>The fact that neonatal seizures can be extremely difficult to control with the currently available AEDs and can lead to long-term neurologic complications has been repeatedly highlighted in the literature. 删除9：<u>1 4 </u>This is because the neonatal brain has increased excitability, decreased efficacy of neuroinhibitory mechanisms and enhanced potential for the inflammatory response to seizures. 删除9：<u>1 5 </u>Symptomatic neonatal seizures are most commonly caused by hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, which can result from birth asphyxia or respiratory distress. The next most common aetiologies include cerebrovascular disorders, infectious entities and cortical malformations. Malformations of cortical development that are frequently present with early-life seizures include LIS, polymicrogyria, focal cortical dysplasia and tuberous sclerosis. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Conventional, prolonged, continuous video EEG is the gold standard for detecting seizures. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【27】In terms of management, it has been shown that phenobarbital and phenytoin control seizures only in less than 50% of EEG-confirmed neonatal seizures. 删除9：<u>1 </u>On the other hand, Sirsi _et al_ suggested that midazolam may be considered a safe and effective ALD in refractory neonatal seizures of diverse aetiologies. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Similarly, Sheth _et al_ suggested that because more than one-third of all neonatal seizures are refractory to high-dose phenobarbital and phenytoin, midazolam administered by continuous intravenous infusion may be a valuable adjunctive therapy. 删除9：<u>7 </u>In addition, Maytal _et al_ concluded that lorazepam may be effective in the treatment of neonatal seizures refractory to phenobarbital. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【28】Newer anticonvulsant medications such as topiramate and levetiracetam have been reported to improve acute neonatal seizures. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Barr _et al_ reported a case in which the new ALD lamotrigine induced rapid and sustained control of seizures of a newborn infant who had seizures of unknown aetiology, refractory to phenobarbitone, phenytoin, midazolam, clonazepam and vigabatrin. 删除9：<u>9 </u>In addition, topiramate has been recommended as a useful choice in refractory neonatal seizures due to its efficacy for both seizure control and neuroprotection. 删除9：<u>10 </u>Lidocaine can be effective in refractory neonatal seizures. However, it has limited use because of potential cardiac toxicity. 删除9：<u>1 </u>In general, Maartens _et al_ suggested that the number of ALDs probably reflects increased seizure burden and poor outcomes. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Di Rosa _et al_ reported three newborns with neonatal seizures refractory to first-line and second-line ALDs and failed therapy with levetiracetam, phenobarbital and midazolam. They were successfully treated with intravenous hydrocortisone. Modulation of brain inflammation triggered during prolonged epileptic activity has been thought to potentially explain the beneficial effects of anti-inflammatory treatment. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【29】LIS is a malformation of cortical development with broad gyri, shallow sulci and thickened cortex characterised by developmental delays and seizures. The recent advancement in molecular genetics has led to the identification of 31 LIS-associated genes with an overall diagnostic yield of over 80%. 删除9：<u>11 12 </u>It can be graded clinically and radiologically as mild (subcortical band heterotopia), moderate (pachygyria) and severe (agyria). Treatment is symptomatic and supportive aiming to improve the caloric intake of nutrients and achieve steady weight gain and the use of anticonvulsants to prevent or control seizures. A genetic referral is recommended. 删除9：<u>13</u>\n\n【30】### Learning points\n\n【31】*   Concerning antenatal findings, such as prominent cerebral ventricles in this infant, should be followed up appropriately with repeated studies and specialised care input from fetal medicine unit.

Stellate ganglion phototherapy (SGP), a non-invasive procedure for modification of the sympathetic nervous system, is an effective treatment for refractory ventricular tachycardia (RVT). However, there are limited data on the efficacy of SGP for RVT in patients with CS.

The patient was administered prednisolone for the management of CS, which subsequently led to an increase in anti-tachycardia pacing for ventricular tachycardias. We introduced SGP to suppress RVT and anti-tachycardia pacing decreased from 371 to 25 events. Thus, SGP could be a feasible option for the management of RVT in patients with CS.\n\n【3】删除12：<u>*   arrhythmias\n*   pacing and electrophysiology\n*   anaesthesia\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【4】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Subsequently, the frequency of anti-tachycardia pacing therapy decreased from 371 to 25 times. Consequently, palpitations and general malaise improved. The patient was discharged on day 49 without any symptoms .\n\n【32】Two episodes of anti-tachycardia pacing recurred after the discontinuation of SGP following discharge. Hence, SGP was re-initiated two or three times a week. No further episodes of ICD shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing occurred. Thus, sotalol was discontinued, and amiodarone was reduced to 100 mg/day. Hereafter, the initiation of immunosuppressive drugs is considered for the basic treatment of CS.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】This is the first report describing a case of RVT in a patient with CS who was successfully treated with modification of the sympathetic nervous system using SGP.\n\n【35】Corticosteroid therapy and catheter ablation have been reported to have beneficial effects on ventricular arrhythmias in patients with CS, but their limitations have also been discussed. 删除9：<u>3 4 </u>The disease process in CS is considered to be a combination of active phase inflammation and chronic phase fibrosis. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Triggered activity or abnormal automaticity associated with disease inflammation in the active phase may lead to ventricular arrhythmia. 删除9：<u>4 14 </u>Therefore, corticosteroid therapy has been reported to have a beneficial effect on ventricular arrhythmias by suppressing disease inflammation in patients with CS. 删除9：<u>3 4 </u>However, corticosteroid was also reported to increase the burden of ventricular arrhythmias, 删除13：<u>15–17 </u>and this mechanism is poorly understood. In contrast, during the chronic phase, it is likely that macro re-entry circuits around cardiac scarring cause VT. 删除9：<u>5 6 </u>Cardiac scarring has been reported to extend not only to the endocardium, including the left and right ventricles, but also to the epicardium, 删除13：<u>1 4 </u>which may be challenging to ablate in ill-equipped facilities.\n\n【36】Ventricular arrhythmogenesis is often associated with the sympathetic nervous system. 删除9：<u>7 </u>SGP, a neuromodulation therapy that non-invasively suppresses sympathetic neurological activity, is reported to be effective for RVT. 删除9：<u>11 12 </u>The stellate ganglion, which is the therapeutic target of neuromodulation therapies, is located in the intervertebral space between the C7 and T1 vertebral bodies. 删除9：<u>18 </u>It is irradiated through the skin surface using a phototherapy treatment device: Super Lizer, (Tokyo Iken Co), which uses linearly polarised near-infrared light with high magnetic permeability. 删除9：<u>11 </u>The wavelength band is 600–1600 nm, which allows the non-invasive penetration of light into the tissues to inhibit sympathetic neurological activity without any other nerve blockades. 删除9：<u>11 </u>Although SGP has been shown to have an antiarrhythmic effect on RVT in dilated cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cardiomyopathy, 删除13：<u>11 12 </u>limited data are available regarding patients with CS.\n\n【37】In the present case of CS, ventricular arrhythmias increased immediately after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy, the standard therapy for CS. Therefore, steroid treatment is potentially a significant cause of ventricular arrhythmias. Catheter ablation of the endocardium did not suppress RVT, which suggests that the critical conduction pathway of VT extended to the epicardial muscle. Due to certain technical difficulties in treatment, additional ablation was not performed. Despite such a challenging case, successful non-invasive treatment of RVT was achieved with bilateral SGP.\n\n【38】In conclusion, we present a case of RVT in a patient with CS who was successfully treated by SGP, which is a non-invasive modification therapy of the sympathetic nervous system. SGP could be a key therapeutic option for the management of RVTs in patients with CS. Nevertheless, further studies are required to clarify these effects.\n\n【39】### Learning points\n\n【40】*   Corticosteroids and catheter ablation may not always be sufficiently effective for managing ventricular tachycardia in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis.\n\n【41】*   Neuromodulation therapies via the stellate ganglion can be effective for the treatment of refractory ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【42】*   Stellate ganglion phototherapy, a non-invasive neuromodulation therapy that suppresses sympathetic neurological activity, could be a key therapeutic option in the management of refractory ventricular tachycardia in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis.\n\n【43】删除8：<u>### Supplemental material\n\n【44】\\[bcr-2022-249183supp001.pdf\\]</u>\n删除8：<u>### Supplemental material\n\n【45】\\[bcr-2022-249183supp002.pdf\\]</u>\n删除8：<u>### Supplemental material\n\n【46】\\[bcr-2022-249183supp003.pdf\\]</u>\n删除8：<u>### Supplemental material\n\n【47】\\[bcr-2022-249183supp004.pdf\\]</u>\n\n【48】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【49】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【50】Obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:52:28", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:53:23", "cost": 55.025}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:26", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:53:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:52:28"}

Many can impact the neuromuscular system. 删除9：<u>1–4 </u>Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication with a variety of associated side effects. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Neuromyopathy is a rare adverse effect of this agent characterised by significant proximal and distal weakness, distal sensory loss and diminished muscle stretch reflexes. 删除9：<u>6–8 </u>The lower extremities are more commonly affected than the upper ones. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Amiodarone is thought to interact with lipid membranes, resulting in complexes resistant to lysosomal digestion. 删除9：<u>3 </u>This leads to cellular vacuoles filled with debris, ultimately cumulating in pathology. We present an 87-year-old woman with bilateral leg pain and weakness in the context of amiodarone therapy. Specifically, we wish to highlight the importance of medication side effects in the geriatric population. Medication side effects can present typically or atypically in this population and rare adverse effects can be more prevalent due to the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of an ageing body.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】This patient was admitted to the Acute Geriatric Unit (AGU) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, for the assessment and management of subacute bilateral leg pain and weakness, which cumulated in complete loss of independent ambulation. Her past medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation, right frontal cerebrovascular cortical infarction, subcortical lacunar infarctions and well-controlled diabetes mellitus type 2 (haemoglobin A1c was 7.5% within 1 month of presentation). Her atrial fibrillation was initially rate-controlled with a combination of verapamil, metoprolol and digoxin. Prior to AGU admission, these medications were discontinued due to an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response as well as adverse drug reactions and perceived risk with continued use. Subsequently amiodarone was started for rhythm-control with a 200 mg by mouth three times a day dose for 14 days, and then followed by 200 mg by mouth daily. The patient was also anticoagulated with apixaban for her atrial fibrillation.\n\n【10】Shortly after initiation of amiodarone she developed bilateral leg weakness and pain. This pain was progressive and migratory though it was limited to her lower extremities. There were no bowel or bladder complaints. Prior to the initiation of amiodarone, the patient was able to ambulate independently and without a gait aid. When admitted to the AGU, she was a two-person assist for transfers from sit-to-stand and could not ambulate. This was after approximately 2 months of amiodarone therapy.\n\n【11】On physical examination, hip flexor and extensor strength were 2/5 bilaterally while knee flexor and extensor strength were 4/5 and 3/5, respectively. Ankle dorsiflexor and plantarflexor strength were 5/5 bilaterally. Patellar and ankle deep tendon reflexes were absent bilaterally. Vibration sensation was absent to the waist at all levels including the great toe, medial malleolus, knee and pelvis. Pinprick sensation was impaired to the mid-distal level bilaterally. Proprioception was intact in the lower extremities.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】Laboratory investigations showed unremarkable haematology and routine biochemistry. Creatine kinase and C-reactive protein levels were normal. CT of the lumbar spine showed no lytic lesions, but severe bone demineralisation. MRI of the lumbar spine showed scoliosis with degenerative disc disease and mild central canal stenosis at L1/L2 and L2/L3. Severe central canal stenosis was seen at L3/L4 and L4/L5. The Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service performed electromyography and nerve conduction studies. Only the left lower extremity was tested because EMG and nerve conduction studies were terminated prematurely due to bleeding in the context of anticoagulation. Her studies showed no response on superficial peroneal and sural sensory testing, severely reduced amplitude but normal conduction velocity of the extensor digitorum brevis, slightly reduced amplitude of the tibialis anterior and borderline normal amplitude but reduced conduction velocity on tibial motor testing. The overall impression was that the patient had an axonal length-dependent polyneuropathy of the left lower extremity, sensory greater than motor, and this was graded as severe. There was evidence of myopathic changes to the left iliopsoas muscle without frank denervation.\n\n【14】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【15】The opinion of the Attending Medical Team and Neuromuscular Service was that the patient possibly had an amiodarone-induced neuromyopathy. A muscle biopsy was discussed with the patient but after weighing the risks and benefits of the procedure (especially in the context of anticoagulation), it was not pursued. The Attending Medical Team decided that the risk of bleeding outweighed pursuing the procedure, and stroke risk was too high to interrupt anticoagulation. Even though a muscle biopsy was not performed, the clinical history, physical examination and electromyography/nerve conduction studies supported a neuromyopathic process affecting the lower extremities of the patient. Although MRI of the lumbar spine showed central canal stenosis, it is unlikely that clinical findings were due to spinal stenosis. Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis can show spontaneous improvement in pain and health-related quality of life, however acutely losing and/or regaining the ability to walk rarely occurs. 删除9：<u>9 </u>The possibility of diabetic neuropathy causing this weakness and pain was discussed. The physical examination did not completely fit with a stocking and glove pattern of diabetic neuropathy. Moreover, electromyography/nerve conduction studies were not typical of diabetic neuropathy. Medication review confirmed that this patient was not on metformin or statin therapy at the time of symptom presentation. Moreover, this patient had not been on metformin or statin therapy for at least 6 months prior to symptom presentation. This patient’s diabetes mellitus type 2 was managed with insulin therapy and sitagliptin. Sitagliptin has not been widely associated with neuromyopathy. On examination, there was no upper extremity weakness to support a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica or polymyositis. Lastly, a vitamin B12 level checked in May 2019 was well above normal range for geriatric patients. Based on the timeline of leg weakness and pain in the context of amiodarone therapy initiation, an amiodarone-induced neuromyopathy was the leading diagnosis.\n\n【16】Treatment\n---------\n\n【17】On admission to the AGU, amiodarone was discontinued and rate control with a beta-blocker was initiated successfully. With active rehabilitation including strength training, balance exercises, targeted physiotherapy and functional optimisation by occupational therapists, the patient slowly started to regain lower extremity function. Amiodarone was started in April 2019 and discontinued in June 2019. From June until October 2019, inpatient rehabilitation continued.\n\n【18】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【19】By the end of October 2019, the patient, using a four-wheel walker gait aid, was independent with transfers and ambulation. She was discharged home at her pre-amiodarone level of mobility and functional abilities. Follow-up with the patient in March 2020 showed no recurrence of leg weakness or pain.\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】Geriatric patients usually have multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy and complex presentations. Emphasis is placed on generating a broad list of differential diagnoses and then systemically narrowing this list down through clinical reasoning and investigation. We have provided rationale and evidence that the lower extremity neuromyopathy seen in our patient was not due to other underlying medication side effects (such as metformin or statin therapy). Clinical history and examination findings did not support neuromyopathy secondary to diabetes mellitus type 2, spinal stenosis or polymyalgia rheumatica/polymyositis. Common vitamin deficiencies such as vitamin B12 deficiency, were also excluded.\n\n【22】Neuromyopathy is a known but rare complication of amiodarone. It is not as frequently found when compared with other neuromyopathy-causing medications, such as statins. 删除9：<u>10 </u>Unusual features in this study were the normal creatine kinase levels and short duration of amiodarone therapy. While supportive if elevated, normal creatine kinase levels do not rule out a myopathic process. In amiodarone neuromuscular toxicity, creatine kinase levels may not correlate with the degree of myopathy. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Furthermore, symptoms of neuromyopathy can develop anywhere from a few months to years of amiodarone therapy. 删除9：<u>11 </u>The short duration of amiodarone therapy does not exclude an amiodarone-induced neuromyopathy. Optimally, a muscle biopsy would have been obtained to confirm causal relationship between amiodarone and lower extremity neuromyopathy in this patient. The Attending Medical Team could not justify subjecting this patient to an invasive and risky procedure when they were already confident that amiodarone was the cause of neuromyopathy. Not only was this leading diagnosis supported by specialists on the Neuromuscular Service, but the timeline of clinical recovery also fit that of an amiodarone-induced neuromyopathy.\n\n【23】The patient returned to her pre-amiodarone mobility and functional abilities. In general, muscle strength gradually improves after amiodarone is discontinued. It can take up to 6 months for full strength to return. 删除9：<u>8 </u>This is consistent with the clinical timeline seen in our patient. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of an amiodarone-induced neuromyopathy was delayed until June 2019. Although a rare complication of amiodarone, this syndrome should be considered in patients with compatible symptomatology.\n\n【24】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【25】I felt a variety of emotions during my hospitalisation for leg weakness and pain. Initially, I was angry that I had lost the ability to walk and that this had happened rather suddenly. I felt as if my independence had been taken from me. I was angry with the amiodarone medication itself, as well as with the initial care team that prescribed this medication. Specifically, I was not educated around the indications, risks and benefits of amiodarone and therefore was not aware of neuromyopathy as a potential side effect. Although, this rare side effect may not have been discussed in the initial medication counselling, however even a preliminary risk/benefit discussion would have eased my anger after encountering an adverse medication event. In addition, my family members raised concerns over potential medication side effects when my walking ability was lost. At times, these family members felt like they were not being heard early in the clinical presentation.\n\n【26】Throughout rehabilitation, I experienced points of encouragement and discouragement however as pain slowly started to improve, my outlook brightened. I was able to form a good alliance with the medical and rehabilitation teams and was grateful to the Acute Geriatric Unit and the fine job that was done regarding management.\n\n【27】### Learning points\n\n【28】*   Amiodarone has many side effects, including neuromyopathy, which can present as leg weakness and/or pain.\n\n【29】*   Amiodarone-induced neuromyopathy can develop anywhere from a few months to years of amiodarone therapy.\n\n【30】*   A normal creatine kinase does not exclude amiodarone-induced myopathy.\n\n【31】*   After amiodarone is stopped, muscle strength slowly returns and can take up to 6 months for full strength to return.\n\n【32】*   Geriatric patients metabolise medications in different ways. Adverse effects should be considered in patients with compatible symptomatology.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank the patient for sharing their clinical case; informed consent to share this case was obtained.

Such adapters are commonly used during the airway procedures where the adapter allows access of a bronchoscope to the airway while maintaining ventilation and oxygenation without disconnection from the ventilator circuit. We report a rare case where a fragment from an airway swivel adapter dislodged into the patient’s airway during an endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS).\n\n【4】A woman in her 50s presented for an urgent EBUS to investigate the cause of a large left hilar mass causing extrinsic compression of the left main bronchus. To facilitate the procedure, a double swivel elbow adapter with port, manufactured by Southern Cross Medical, New South Wales, Australia, was attached distally to the patient’s ETT and proximally to the ventilation circuit. The connector port has a fenestrated plastic membrane (inner diameter 12.8 mm) that allows the passage of the bronchoscope, without compromising the air seal for ventilation . As the Fujifilm EB530 ultrasound bronchoscope (outer diameter 6.7 mm) was passed through the swivel adapter, a fragment of the plastic membrane dislodged into the patient’s trachea. Fortunately, the AFB was visualised in the distal trachea, approximately 22 mm proximal to the carina  and the bronchoscopist was able to retrieve the fragment without incident 删除10：<u>( video 1 )</u>.\n\n【5】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【6】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【7】Defect in the airway swivel adapter after removal of the endobronchial ultrasound.</u>\n\n【8】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【9】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【10】Airway foreign body in the distal trachea.</u>\n\n【11】删除11：<u>Video 1 Bronchoscopic removal of the airway foreign body.</u>\n\n【12】Fragmentation of the plastic membrane may be explained by the factors related to the swivel connector itself, the bronchoscope or the proceduralist. A defect in the dual-axis swivel adapter may be due to an isolated manufacturing defect in the plastic membrane, or that the integrity of the membrane was compromised by incorrect storage or handling. In the present case, we postulate that the reason for the defect in the dual-axis swivel adapter was because the EBUS had a larger outer diameter compared with a standard bronchoscope, so it is likely that the rotational and linear forces of the EBUS damaged the membrane. The proceduralist’s level of experience may also have played a role in the amount of stress placed on the plastic membrane during the EBUS insertion.\n\n【13】Although early recognition of the AFB and an appropriate response by the bronchoscopist ensured a good outcome for this patient, the potential consequences of the fragmented swivel connector were serious. In retrieving the AFB, the procedure duration was extended and further instrumentation within the airway was required, both of which increased the risk of airway trauma, hypoxia and respiratory compromise. Furthermore, the incomplete plastic membrane caused leakage from the circuit, thus reducing the ventilation volumes and ventilation pressures being delivered to the patient, placing them at risk of hypoventilation. Had the AFB lodged more distally in the airway and remained unnoticed, it could have precipitated the development of a pneumonia, lung abscess or systemic inflammatory response. It also had the potential to obstruct the distal airways during the bronchoscopy. This case serves as a reminder to thoroughly check airway equipment for defects before and after use. Appropriate airway instrumentation checks may mitigate the risk of unnoticed AFBs.\n\n【14】This adverse event did not result in patient harm, however, open disclosure was made to the patient following the national open disclosure framework, 删除13：<u>6 </u>which included 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> an apology and expression of regret, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> a factual explanation of what happened, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> an opportunity for the patient to relate their experience, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> a discussion of the potential consequences of the adverse event and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> an explanation of the steps taken to manage the adverse event and prevent recurrence.\n\n【15】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【16】The patient respectfully declined to comment.\n\n【17】### Learning points\n\n【18】*   Formal airway equipment checks before and after bronchoscopy is paramount.\n\n【19】*   Instrumentation checks before and after bronchoscopy may reduce the risk of unnoticed airway foreign bodies (AFBs).\n\n【20】*   AFBs should be considered in patients who have undergone bronchoscopy and who display new-onset respiratory symptoms.\n\n【21】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【22】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【23】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:51:33", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:52:03", "cost": 29.632}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:26", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:52:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:51:33"}

Epidermal features included basal layer pigmentation, mild acanthosis and hyperkeratosis. There was no evidence of necrosis, mitosis or atypia. After clinical and histopathological correlation, a final diagnosis of smooth muscle hamartoma was considered and tablet nifedipine was prescribed to the patient for pain relief (symptomatic management) as the patient denied surgical or laser intervention.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Multiple clustered skin coloured to hyperpigmented nodules and nodulo-plaques arranged in segmental distribution over the left side of mid-back.</u>\n\n【7】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【8】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【9】Dermosocpy (using Dermlite DL3 10×) shows a pseudo-pigment network (arrow), milia-like cysts (star) and light brown structureless areas (circle).</u>\n\n【10】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【11】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【12】Histopathological examination (10×) reveals a proliferation of haphazard interlacing fascicles of mature smooth muscle cells with a central cigar-shaped nucleus and fibrillar and eosinophilic cytoplasm (arrow).

We present a case of vaping-related pneumothorax and make recommendations for structured reporting of this emerging cause for pneumothorax. A normal-weight 34-year-old male presented to our emergency department with dyspnoea and back pain increasing over 24 hours. Chest X-ray showed a large right-sided pneumothorax. Three years ago, he had quit smoking cigarettes and switched to vaping. CT scan revealed bullae, and the patient received apical lung resection. Histology revealed mild alveolitis. Vaping is an emerging cause of lung injury. This report demonstrates a potential association between vaping and pneumothorax. However, structured reporting and future research are needed to establish a definitive (or causal) relationship between vaping and pneumothorax.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   pneumomediastinum\n*   pneumothorax\n*   drug misuse (including addiction)\n*   tobacco-related disease\n*   cardiothoracic surgery\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Increased marketing of these devices has been paralleled by reports of e-cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI), 删除13：<u>1 </u>life-threatening bronchiolitis (similar to bronchiolitis obliterans or ‘popcorn lung’), 删除13：<u>2 </u>persistent severe fixed airway obstruction 3 and asthma. 删除9：<u>4 </u>The first regular publication of a case of a vaping-related primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) was published online in September 2019 from Harvard Medical School. 删除9：<u>5 </u>A case of vaping-related secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) that was experienced shortly after treatment for vaping-induced pneumonitis was reported in November 2019 from Corpus Christi Medical Center in Texas, USA. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Before and after these two publications, several conference abstracts of cases of vaping-related pneumothorax have been published.\n\n【8】PSP is a well-known disorder in young otherwise healthy adults that is associated with numerous risk factors. These risk factors include being underweight, lean habitus, scuba diving, high altitude, flying, smoking and, more specifically, smoking cannabis.\n\n【9】Risk factors like being underweight or atmospheric pressure changes generally are accepted as contributing to or causing pneumothorax. However, it is still a matter of debate whether other factors such as smoking cannabis predispose individuals to or otherwise contribute to PSP. One reason for this continuing debate is missing information from case reports and case series. 删除9：<u>7 8</u>\n\n【10】As this report is now the seventh regular publication about pneumothorax in association with vaping, it is worthwhile considering the information that should be included for such cases and for reviews.\n\n【11】In this study, we used the CARE checklist to report a case of a patient presenting with a pneumothorax associated with vaping without the patient ever consuming cannabis. As we expect further cases to be reported for pneumothorax in relation to vaping, we report our case together with recommendations for standardised reporting of this relationship. In the absence of standardised reporting, drawing a causal link between vaping and PSP will be difficult if not impossible. 删除9：<u>9 10</u>\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】In October 2019, a 34-four-year-old white male presented to his general practitioner with a 1-day history of back pain, shortness of breath, tightness in his chest, burning pain in his right chest, retrosternal pain and feeling dizzy. Symptoms started after minor exertion during the afternoon on the day before presentation.\n\n【14】### Medical history\n\n【15】No specific health problems occurred during adolescence. His previous medical history was otherwise unremarkable apart from a few rib fractures on his right side sustained through a cycling accident 3 years ago. There was no family history of lung disease. As a trained nurse, the patient worked in outpatient palliative care and devoted his free time to strength training and competitive sports. Due to his occupation, he had regular health checks, all negative for infectious diseases. He had no recent sports trauma to his chest. Despite being an active and internationally successful athlete, he smoked 20 cigarettes per day from the age of 21 years to the age of 31 years. Three years ago, he quit smoking by switching to vaping nicotine. He never smoked or vaped cannabis. He reported a pattern of regular deep and slow inhalation with the vaping device throughout the day similar to smoking a pack of cigarettes.\n\n【16】### Clinical findings\n\n【17】On physical examination, we saw an athletic male with normal body mass index (BMI 23.6, 删除13：<u>184 </u>cm body height and 80 kg body weight). There were no signs of chronic lung disease such as finger clubbing, chronic cough, wheezing or sputum production. Neurology examination was unremarkable. During the patient’s initial visit to his general practitioner, vitals included a heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 143/91 mm Hg, peripheral oxygen saturation without air supply of 98% and a respiratory frequency of 15 per minute. His ECG demonstrated signs suggestive of myocarditis. The patient arrived at our emergency department 2 hours later with normal peripheral oxygen saturation of 98%, but increasing tachypnoea with 24 breaths per minute. His heart rate and blood pressure remained normal, and there was no enlarged jugular vein pulse or cyanosis. Respiratory frequency returned to normal rates with 3 L of nasal air flow supply. ECG demonstrated again changes in V3–V5 suggestive of myocarditis . His skin was dry and warm on palpation with a temperature of 36.8°C, and his tongue was of healthy appearance. His heart sounds were regular on auscultation and breathing sounds were absent on the right side of his chest. Percussion revealed tympanitic chest sounds on the right. The patient complained of acute pain in his chest.\n\n【18】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【19】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【20】ECG on admission demonstrating ST-elevation in V3–V5 (40 Hz, 删除13：<u>50 </u>mm/s, 删除13：<u>10 </u>mm/mV).</u>\n\n【21】### Diagnostic assessment and therapeutic intervention\n\n【22】His chest X-ray demonstrated a large (according to Collins formula 11 ) right-sided pneumothorax  and a small right-sided pleural effusion. Immediate insertion of a right-sided chest tube led to pain relief and normalisation of the ECG.\n\n【23】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【24】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【25】Posteroanterior chest X-ray in inspiration on presentation, demonstrating a large right-sided pneumothorax.</u>\n\n【26】Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were discussed with the patient, and a decision was made for a CT thorax scan. The CT scan demonstrated a bilateral inflated lung, the inserted chest tube on the right side, apical bleps of approximately 0.5–1.0 cm in diameter and a small stripe of remaining apical pneumothorax. Blood tests did not reveal any inflammation or other abnormal findings. After successful removal of the chest tube, the patient was discharged and returned for follow-up examination 1 week later in our outpatient department. During the visit, the patient stated his desire to proceed with bullae resection. Being active in martial arts and internationally successful, he feared of another episode of a pneumothorax leading to a further delay in his training.\n\n【27】The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) resection of the apical bullae and partial apical pleurectomy. Intraoperatively, the apical bullae and a minor clear fluid collection could be demonstrated with no other visible lung pathology. The resection specimen revealed the site of ruptured bullae. The patient made an uneventful recovery. Perioperatively, the patient received routine tyloxapol inhalations four times daily. Standard analgesia contained oral metamizole, ibuprofen and oxycodone/naloxone.\n\n【28】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【29】After uneventful recovery and chest tube removal, the patient was discharged and re-evaluated 10 days later in the outpatient clinic. The patient reported normal breathing and no need for analgesia. He returned to work 4 weeks after discharge from our care and gradually resumed sports activities 6 weeks after surgery. The patient did not stop using his vaping device during treatment and continued use at follow-up. We invited the patient to review his histology slides under a twin microscope and counselled him regarding chronic health effects of smoking and vaping. He was asked to self-assess his vaping habits with the _Self-Report Habit Index_ (SRHI, German version). While he reported being a frequent vaper, his SRHI score (0.83) suggested only a modest level of habitual use.\n\n【30】### Histology\n\n【31】The histology of this resection specimen revealed a subpleural bulla with typical histopathology of a pneumothorax with bulla rupture and small resorbed micro-bleeding. The surrounding lung tissue was characterised by a loss of lung parenchyma and by destruction of alveoli so that there was permanent dilation of airspaces. Large dilated airspaces—bulging from beneath the pleura—were clearly visible. There was also residual lung tissue with mild macrophagocytic alveolitis and signs of mild, chronic, fibrosing inflammation. Hyperdistention of alveolar ducts associated with rupture of alveolar septa was also seen. The specimen did not reveal lipid-laden macrophages.\n\n【32】### Vaping device used\n\n【33】The basic _anatomy_ of vaping devices can be found in vaping-related internet content. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Our patient used an atomiser-type _Vapefly Brunhilde MTL RTA 8_ _mL_ (MTL—mouth to lung, RTA—rebuildable tank atomiser). The coil used was a _Geek Vape Stainless Steel 316_ _L_ , 删除13：<u>15 </u>wraps with 1.08 Ω, used with 20 W. Wicking for the coil was _Wic ‘N’ Vape Cotton Bacon Prime_ . The Mod (battery carrier) was a _VooPoo Drag 2 Box Mod_ . The vaping device was used with the following e-liquid: _Dampfplanet Liquidbase VG50/PG50_ (VG—vegetable glycerin, PG—propylene glycol) _with Dampfplanet nicotine shot 20 mg/mL_ without flavour. The e-liquid was mixed with nicotine to achieve a concentration of 6 mg/mL. The patient stated that he uses his vaping device on a daily basis and consumes approximately 16 mL of e-liquid per day.\n\n【34】### Analysis of previous case reports and recommendations for reporting\n\n【35】We analysed six previously published case reports and case series 5 6 13–16 and several conference abstracts 17–25 of pneumothorax in association with vaping. We only analysed reports in English. Information on patient demographics, medical conditions, presenting symptoms, diagnostic findings and outcomes was examined. Results are reported in table 1 . Given the relative paucity of data on the relationship between vaping and pneumothorax, we used a tabular evaluation of existing case reports and conference papers. This method has been previously used by DeVito _et al_ . 删除9：<u>26 </u>In their review, the authors aimed to elucidate the impact of nicotine exposure from vaping devices on addiction and psychiatric symptoms and produced a qualitative table to depict standardised information. Here, we present a similar qualitative table that provides standardised information relevant to the aims of the current case report.\n\n【36】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【37】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【38】EVALI-associated pneumothorax in relation to demography, complications and treatment</u>\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】We presented a case of a young, healthy athlete who reported daily nicotine vaping and experienced an episode of spontaneous pneumothorax. This pneumothorax likely was a secondary spontaneous pneumothorax based on the presence of emphysematous bullae observed via his CT scan and histology slides. By analysing previous pneumothorax cases with vaping-related lung injury, we found two distinct types of pneumothorax presentation. Sixty per cent of reports analysed through table 1 demonstrated pneumothorax together with the truly horrifying changes of the lung parenchyma on CT scans that marked the EVALI outbreak in the USA with ground glass opacities (GGO), ‘crazy paving patterns’, absurdly large bullae in young people, bronchiectasis and volume loss (ie, the GGO group). 删除9：<u>27 </u>In contrast, our patient was an athlete presenting with pneumothorax secondary to emphysema due to smoking and vaping nicotine without major structural changes of the lung parenchyma. The last seven cases in table 1 share similar clinical presentation and outcome including our case (ie, the non-GGO group). Chest X-rays and CT thorax scans of these patients did not show any major parenchymal changes together with a pneumothorax. There was no statistically significant age difference between the GGO and the non-GGO groups (27.1 vs 21.4 years, p=0.16). BMI, nutritional status or body habitus of the patients rarely were reported, so we could not examine differences based on these factors. All patients in the non-GGO group were male, their previous medical history was unremarkable and they had no current infection or infectious diseases. Interestingly, although information on vaping duration was not included in seven cases reports, the numbers extracted give the impression that the duration of vaping in the GGO group was rather short compared with the more uncomplicated pneumothorax in the non-GGO group (10.8 vs 21.8 months, p=0.31). The relatively short vaping duration observed in the GGO group is consistent with the presentation of EVALI cases observed during the 2019 outbreak in the USA.\n\n【41】Despite pneumothorax being a major complication of vaping and despite a strong association between smoking cannabis and pneumothorax as well as between vaping and use of cannabis in vaping products, information on cannabis use and toxicology proof was not available for all cases reviewed. In addition, information used to classify pneumothorax (PSP or SSP) like the presence of coughing or thoracic strain was not provided in several reports. Therefore, we reclassified the pneumothoraces into PSP and SSP according to an accepted definition and according to the information given in the reports. 删除9：<u>28 </u>Only two of the pneumothoraces in the non-GGO group might be regarded as vaping-related primary spontaneous pneumothoraces. Interestingly, none of the patients in the non-GGO group developed bilateral pneumothorax, whereas 5 of 11 patients in the GGO group developed bilateral pneumothorax. In 7 of 11 cases in the GGO group, pneumothorax developed with a latency of 4–18 days after presentation. Furthermore, 删除13：<u>4 </u>of 11 patients in the GGO-pneumothorax group needed ECMO support. None of the patients similar to our patient (non-GGO group) developed respiratory failure. In both groups, recurrent pneumothoraces and bronchial fistula occurred. Interestingly, Gonsalves and colleagues reported recurrent pneumothorax after PSP in three out of three EVALI cases. 删除9：<u>29 </u>Here, we found recurrent pneumothorax after PSP and after SSP in both the GGO and non-GGO groups. In five of the cases reviewed in table 1 , no information on pneumothorax management could be retrieved.\n\n【42】删除4：<u>Table 2 is a checklist-type table that we created based on previous reviews of EVALI cases and our own experience that may be used to encourage standardised reporting of vaping-related pneumothorax. 29–33</u>\n\n【43】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【44】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 2\n\n【45】Checklist for reporting of vaping-related pneumothorax</u>\n\n【46】Our patient also presented with rather rare ECG changes suggestive of myocarditis. There are few reports of such ECG changes with a right-sided pneumothorax. 删除9：<u>34 </u>ECG changes resolved quickly after chest tube insertion on the day of admission. Management with VATS resection of the right lung apex was successful, and the patient restarted training in martial arts 6 weeks after the operation. Histology of the lung specimen revealed typical pathology of nicotine smoking-related pneumothorax. No specific investigations are known for pathology specimens from vaping-associated pneumothorax.\n\n【47】The patient demonstrated in-depth knowledge of his vaping device and reported that it helped him to quit smoking 3 years ago. Prior to switching to vaping, the patient smoked approximately 20 cigarettes per day for a period of 10 years despite being a successful athlete. The patient reported his athletic ability increased after switching to vaping. The patient was well aware that, in the long term, there might be significant changes to his fitness due to structural changes in his lungs and vessels. The patient clearly understood that vaping nicotine might help quit smoking nicotine but might not lead to a decreased spectrum of related illnesses.\n\n【48】As was the case with smoking, it likely will be decades after the introduction of e-cigarettes until the full picture regarding associations between vaping and diseases emerges. The current report is only the seventh case report to highlight vaping-related pneumothorax. However, pneumothorax in young adults has been strongly associated with cigarette smoking and cannabis use; case–control studies have established both as significant risk factors for pneumothorax. 删除9：<u>35 </u>Yet, evidence of a causal relationship is lacking. Moreover, whole case series of vaping-related lung injury have been published without any patient experiencing a pneumothorax. 删除9：<u>32 36 </u>Compared with this report, Jonas _et al_ identified 8 patients with pneumothorax among 216 published cases with vaping-associated lung injury. 删除9：<u>31 </u>In 2019, research has, for the first time, tried to identify cannabinoids in lung tissue of young adults with pneumothorax. 删除9：<u>7 </u>While this is an important step in understanding the relationship between cannabis use and pneumothorax, evidence of cannabinoids in lung tissue does not provide proof of a pathology mechanism. Similarly, it might be difficult to establish a causal relationship between vaping and pneumothorax. However, if such a relationship exists, we expect to see a rise in cases of pneumothorax that accompanies the increased popularity of vaping. Building on the evidence of a cannabis–pneumothorax association, we provided recommendations through table 2 about reporting vaping-associated pneumothorax. As no systematic pathology examination of lung tissue from patients with vaping-associated pneumothorax exists today, there should be an international agreement on what to look for in such specimens.\n\n【49】The mechanism of developing a pneumothorax with vaping is likely to be complex. A factor that has long been suspected of contributing to pneumothorax is inhalation technique. Of note, inhalation technique is one of the main differences between smoking tobacco cigarettes, smoking cannabis and vaping. The importance of researching variation in inhalation technique is underscored by the results of a study on ‘dripping and e-cigarettes’ from Yale University School of Medicine. 删除9：<u>37 </u>Dr Krishnan-Sarin and colleagues describe that, among 1080 (main sample n=7045) students from eight Connecticut high schools, 删除13：<u>282 </u>students (mean age, 16.4 years) used dripping. Dripping is a technique where e-liquids are vaporised directly via application to the atomiser coil to produce a stronger flavour, thicker cloud of vapour and a ‘stronger throat hit’. Dripping can lead to inhalation of higher temperature vapour and exposure to non-nicotinic toxic byproducts such as volatile aldehydes (formaldehyde) in toxic concentrations. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to ask patients about inhalation technique to understand the development of vaping-associated pneumothorax.\n\n【50】A major criticism in reporting of cannabis-related and smoking-related pneumothorax has been the absence of standardised information about smoking habits in case reports and cohort studies. 删除9：<u>31 32 38 39 </u>Recognising similar problems in addiction research, the European Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) recommended the use of standard questionnaires in 2002. 删除9：<u>40 </u>The EMCDDA questionnaire has been used in a large Danish cohort study to establish cannabis as a risk factor for PSP, 删除13：<u>35 </u>but the EMCDDA questionnaire has not yet been updated to include assessments of e-cigarette use. Until psychometrically sound measures of e-cigarette use are included in large, standardised surveys like the EMCDDA, it is critical to source reliable and valid measures of e-cigarette use and related behaviours elsewhere. In this study, we used the SRHI, a recently validated measure of habitual e-cigarette use. 删除9：<u>41 </u>To increase the scientific rigour and interpretability of findings related to e-cigarette use, the use of validated measures like the SRHI is strongly recommended.\n\n【51】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【52】People are likely to think about lifestyle factors contributing to a dramatic episode of illness and hospitalisation while recovering. After reading a lot and asking myself questions, it is still difficult for me to decide whether there is an association between my vaping and experiencing an episode of recurrent pneumothorax. If there is, how are we going to find out the most important contributing factors? There are a wide variety of flavours, mixing ratios of VG and PG and nicotine concentrations in the e-liquid. Moreover, there are different metals used for the coils, energy settings and inhalation techniques. These multiple factors might render it impossible to estimate any correlation between vaping and pneumothorax. Generally, I am very grateful for having my vaping devices as it helped me quit smoking. Currently in my opinion, smoking is still much more harmful than vaping. Taking my occupation as a palliative care nurse into account, this episode with a pneumothorax sharpened my existing views of risks of daily life. One should live the life he wants to live and should enjoy what he wants to enjoy. To know about risks is absolutely worthwhile for making informed decisions, but quality of life is very individual and important too.\n\n【53】### Learning points\n\n【54】*   Vaping nicotine may cause pneumothorax.\n\n【55】*   For patients with pneumothorax and a background of vaping, ask about inhalation technique and e-liquids used.\n\n【56】*   Ask for vaping habits using, for example, the Self-Habit Reporting Index.\n\n【57】*   Counsel for vaping-related health effects.\n\n【58】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【59】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【60】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:25:59", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:27:40", "cost": 101.508}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:26", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:27:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:25:59"}

We studied a spinal GCT case that had expanded to the thoracic spinal canal and mediastinum and was successfully treated by surgical decompression and denosumab. A woman in her 30s presented with weakness in both the lower extremities. MRI revealed a large tumour in the posterior mediastinum expanding from the thoracic vertebrae (T3–6), which compressed the spinal cord. The patient underwent urgent spinal decompression with instrumentation and her tissue was sent for a pathology study. Histologically and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of GCT. Since it was an unresectable tumour, this patient was treated with denosumab. Her neurological problem resolved after 6 months of treatment. After 4 years of follow-up, the patient displayed no further progression and no side effects from long-term denosumab usage.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   Spinal cord\n*   Orthopaedic and trauma surgery\n*   Surgical oncology\n*   Neurosurgery\n*   Orthopaedics\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

To reduce the likelihood of unfavourable outcomes, denosumab has been approved to treat patients with unresectable spinal GCT or when resection is likely to result in morbidity. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Even surgical resection of spinal GCT combined with denosumab administration does not guarantee excellent clinical outcomes and radiological findings. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【9】In general, 删除13：<u>120 </u>mg of denosumab injected subcutaneously every 4 weeks with additional loading doses given on day 8 and 15 during the first month of therapy is prescribed for GCT. 删除9：<u>5 6 </u>This regimen leads to elimination of tumours and consistent suppression of bone resorption. However, there is no standardised denosumab dosage and treatment duration.

The patient was treated with surgical decompression without tumour resection and long-term denosumab administration with the final result being full neurologic recovery.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A woman in her 30s presented with atraumatic weakness in both her legs for 1 week and had difficulty urinating for 3 days. This patient was referred to our hospital 6 years ago. The patient provided a 10-year history of spinal surgery with instrumentation after a fall from height caused a vertebral compression fracture without neurological deficit. The patient had no other medical problems and her family history was unremarkable. On examination, she presented an old midline surgical scar and mild tenderness on her back. A neurological examination showed signs of near paraplegia (Frankel grade C) in all lower extremity muscles, positive Babinski sign and ankle/knee hyperreflexia.\n\n【13】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【14】A plain radiographic examination of the thoracic spine showed a large soft tissue mass in the posterior mediastinal region (20.3×18.7 cm) and previous posterior instrumentation from T3–7, which was related to a history of vertebral fracture around 10 years ago . The images also revealed right lateral displacement of the heart, mediastinal structure and trachea due to the pressure effect from the mass. Blood for complete blood count, biochemistry and tumour markers were normal except for hyperkalemia and leukocytosis. An MRI of the thoracic spine showed a large heterogeneous enhancing soft tissue mass at the posterior mediastinal region with bilateral paravertebral extension predominately on the left side with a size of about 18.4×18.0×10.4 cm. This mass protruded from the T4 vertebra, leading to a pressure effect of thecal sac at lower T3 to upper T5 vertebrae and total obliteration of the spinal canal, which is suggestive of myelopathy at the T3–5 vertebral level . This mass also involved the left lateral chest wall with multiple left posterior ribs erosion. The rest of her spine MRI showed no other abnormalities. A CT scan also demonstrated a large extrapulmonary mass with internal calcification at the posterior mediastinum extending to the bilateral paravertebral area . Last, a whole-body bone scan showed no evidence of bony metastasis.\n\n【15】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【16】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【17】Plain radiography of the thoracic spine showed a large soft tissue mass at posterior mediastinal region.

Due to an incomplete cord compression condition, our surgical plan was urgent decompression via laminectomy. However, we were unable to remove the tumour due to abundant fibrosis from a previous spinal surgery. Therefore, we only carried out partial laminectomy of T3 and T6 with posterior instrumentation T2 to T8 and transpedicular biopsy at T4. A histological examination showed low-grade spindle cells with giant cells, which were unlikely to be malignant. Due to a low tissue sample yield for further investigation, we had to re-do tissue biopsy. Finally, both histological and immunohistochemistry tests 删除10：<u>( online supplemental file 1 )</u> confirmed diagnosis of GCT of the bone with an absence of a mitotic figure . Furthermore, the MIB-1 labelling index (Ki-67) was examined and determined to be in the range of 0.5%–1%.\n删除8：<u>### Supplemental material\n\n【26】\\[bcr-2022-248837supp001.pdf\\]</u>\n\n【27】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【28】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【29】Histological examination (H&E, 删除13：<u>400</u>x) of (A) first-time tissue biopsy and (B) second-time tissue biopsy.</u>\n\n【30】Treatment\n---------\n\n【31】In general, the standard treatment for GCT of the bone is wide-margin surgical excision. However, after discussions with the cardiothoracic surgeon about mediastinal mass, our group agreed that this is an unresectable GCT. We provided information on available treatment options for unresectable tumours. The patient voluntarily agreed to receive denosumab, and the consent form was obtained. The patient received a subcutaneous injection of denosumab (120 mg) on day 0, 删除13：<u>7, 14, 28 </u>and every 4 weeks for 12 months thereafter. This was followed by denosumab administered every 8 weeks for 10 months. After this, the patient received denosumab every 12 weeks for 28 months, and this treatment is still ongoing. The patient is also on an oral daily supplement containing calcium and vitamin D.\n\n【32】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【33】In a 2-month follow-up, the patient showed neurological improvement as she was able to ambulate with a walker. Six months later, the patient was able to walk without gait aid and had full neurological recovery. A CT scan done at the 7-month follow-up did not show any significant reduction in tumour mass. After 4 years of follow-ups, both CT and MRI imaging showed no significant reduction in tumour size in the mediastinum, but there was a slight decrease in primary tumour mass . Currently, the patient has not developed any further neurological problems and displayed no side effects from long-term denosumab usage.\n\n【34】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【35】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 5\n\n【36】The thoracic spine anteroposterior (AP) view images (A) after a 4 year follow-up showed a large mass in the chest wall without significant reduction in tumour size. However, in MRI of the thoracic spine demonstrated slightly decreased tumour mass in the spinal canal. (B) MRI T2-weighted showed mass without significant reduction in size in the mediastinum. (C) Axial T2-weighted image at T4 also showed a mass with a less occupied spinal canal.</u>\n\n【37】Discussion\n----------\n\n【38】In this case, the patient had a large unresectable spinal GCT expanding into the posterior mediastinum that involved the thoracic spinal canal with cord compression, resulting in paraplegia. The patient was treated with standalone denosumab after spinal decompression with posterior instrumentation and without any attempt of tumour resection. The neurological status gradually improved and fully resolved within 6 months of denosumab administration. The interesting point is that this patient had an adequate clinical response but not radiological outcomes. The improved clinical conditions could be the result of urgent decompression and altered loading of the spinal column following posterior instrumentation. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Although, repeated biopsy for evaluating histological response was not performed after denosumab administration. The neurological condition of the patient remained stable without any side effects from denosumab usage over 4 years of follow-up.\n\n【39】GCT of the spine is usually located in the vertebral body from where it continues to extend to other parts of the spine, including the lamina, spinous process, and even the paravertebral area. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Patients with spinal GCT usually present back pain at the site of tumour or neurological deficit before definite diagnosis. 删除9：<u>11 </u>As in this case, the tumour destroyed all spinal columns of thoracic vertebrae and invaded the vital adjacent structures (not only the spinal cord and nerve roots but also the intramediastinal organs). The surgical removal of the tumour by total en bloc spondylectomy is an effective method against spinal GCT. This method also leads to improvement in neurological function in patients with complete paralysis before surgery. 删除9：<u>12 </u>However, not all patients were suitable to undergo an extensive invasive surgical procedure.\n\n【40】This tumour was defined as an unresectable lesion as it was too large to achieve a wide surgical margin in a difficult anatomical location, leading to potentially severe morbidity and mortality after surgical resection. Therefore, systemic treatment is advised to reduce severity of the disease and stop tumour progression. One of the effective systemic treatment options is denosumab. A previous study reported that 96% of patients with unresectable lesions showed no signs of further progression after denosumab was given every 4 weeks with a median follow-up of 13 months. 删除9：<u>13</u>\n\n【41】Denosumab is a fully humanised monoclonal antibody for the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, which inhibits osteoclastic activity. 删除9：<u>13 </u>For treatment of GCT of the bone, denosumab causes new bone formation and downgrades a high-grade lesion to a lesser grade by increasing the rim of ossified bone on the periphery. 删除9：<u>14 15 </u>A formed osseous rim helps decrease the possibility of injury to adjacent neurovascular structures, facilitates ease of surgical resection and prevents tumour contamination. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Moreover, there have been reports of successful use of denosumab in recurrent, metastatic and unresectable lesions, especially in spinal GCT. 删除9：<u>5 15 </u>To date, there is still no standard optimal dose and duration of denosumab use in treating spinal GCT. Various doses and durations in previous studies are shown in table 1 . The efficacy of long-term treatment and whether GCT remains sensitive with denosumab is still unclear. Interestingly, our case demonstrated disease control after denosumab injection, with a reduced interval from weekly to every 3 months for more than 50 months. However, a previous study reported complications, including osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral fracture, skin rash and hypophosphatemia following long-term denosumab use with a median time of 54 months for unresectable GCT. 删除9：<u>16 </u>There were no complications or instances of denosumab toxicity in our patient. This implies that our denosumab regimen is able to control spinal GCT in patients who cannot have the entire tumour removed.\n\n【42】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【43】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【44】Dose and duration of denosumab for treating spinal GCT</u>\n\n【45】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【46】I remember that I felt hopeless when I could not move my legs.

He remained in an euthyroid state with 15–20 mg/day of methimazole. Since the disease onset, he had been reporting discomfort during swallowing owing to the enlarged goitre. Ultrasonography of the thyroid performed 6 months earlier showed a highly diffused goitre with a heterogeneous echogenic pattern (40 mm width, 删除13：<u>40 </u>mm thickness, 删除13：<u>60 </u>mm height in the right lobe and 35 mm width, 删除13：<u>40 </u>mm thickness, and 60 mm height in the left lobe). No apparent tracheal stenosis was noted. Furthermore, with the increase in duration of physical education after entering the high school, the boy became aware of dyspnoea during exercise. The CT scan of the neck showed that the minimum tracheal diameter was 3 mm , indicating severe tracheal stenosis. Therefore, total thyroidectomy (thyroid weight: 300 g) was performed with an oral tracheal intubation under conscious control. Histopathological examination revealed no neoplastic lesion. The tracheal stenosis did not improve immediately after thyroidectomy; therefore, intraoperative tracheostomy was performed.

It is the most common prion disease and accounts for approximately 90% of all prion disease cases. 删除9：<u>1 </u>It mostly presents with rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia and myoclonus. The clinical course differs according to subtype of CJD, that is, sporadic, iatrogenic, familial and variant. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>The sporadic form of CJD (sCJD) is the most common form of CJD and in most cases patients die within months. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Currently, routine diagnostic investigations include brain MRI, electroencephalography (EEG) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses. 删除9：<u>5 6 </u>Typical brain MRI findings for sCJD are high signal in specific regions: putamen or caudate, or high signal in at least two cortical regions (temporal, parietal, occipital). Characteristic EEG findings for sCJD are periodic biphasic and triphasic sharp wave complexes. In CSF analyses, typical abnormalities include positive 14-3-3 protein, high total tau protein (t-tau), high ratio between phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and t-tau, high S100 protein and high neuron-specific enolase (NSE). The real-time quaking-induced conversion test in CSF is a relatively new diagnostic test which is highly sensitive and specific for sCJD. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Yet, postmortem brain autopsy remains the standard for definite confirmation of CJD. Postmortem brain autopsy can provide further classification of the molecular subtype of sCJD. 8 9 sCJD can have an asymptomatic incubation period lasting for decades, 删除13：<u>3 </u>but little is known about this long disease-free period before symptom onset.\n\n【8】Here, we describe a participant from the population-based Rotterdam Study who developed sCJD. The study has a longitudinal design including multiple visits at the research centre with extensive investigations, which provides us a unique opportunity to detail the preclinical phase of sCJD. In this article, we describe the clinical history of this patient, retrieved from both the Rotterdam Study and the National Prion Disease Registry.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】Our case was a 76-year-old woman with a medical history of hyperthyroidism, varices, recurrent urinary tract infections, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, cholecystectomy and uterus extirpation. She was married and had worked as nurse. With regard to the patient’s participation in the population-based follow-up study, the Rotterdam Study, our case entered this study in 1991, and participated up to the fifth examination in November 2010.\n\n【11】From May 2010, she started to develop symptoms of forgetfulness, dizziness, steerlessness in the right leg, and a heavy feeling in the head and eyes. Over a period of a few months, there was fast progression and she had difficulties with her balance and walked unstable. She also had an increased fall tendency. Besides, she had a feeling of pressure in the left ear, visual problems and sometimes diplopia. The patient was seen by an ophthalmologist and an otorhinolaryngologist, both specialists found no abnormalities. Regarding the typical symptoms for sCJD, over a period of months, she had progressive cognitive decline, cerebellar signs, pyramidal signs and extrapyramidal signs. The patient was registered at the Dutch National Prion Disease Registry in March 2011, where according to protocol an in-depth study was conducted on the medical history. There was no iatrogenic history explaining the CJD. During the extensive interview of the family, no evidence for a positive family history emerged.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】### Research visit examinations\n\n【14】During the fourth examination of Rotterdam Study in May 2004, at age 70 years, cognitive tests were performed and showed no abnormalities, with scores for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 30 out of 30 and good scores for the other cognitive tests, as described in table 1 . Furthermore, routine locomotor symptom screening showed no abnormalities. During the fifth examination round in November 2010, at age 77 years, the participant reported that she suffered from cognitive complaints and cognitive testing showed abnormalities. The MMSE score was 22 out of 30 and compared with the previous examinations she had lower scores on the Word fluency task, Purdue Pegboard Test, words learning test and Stroop test. Detailed information on the results of the cognitive tests is described in table 1 . Based on the presence of subjective cognitive complaints, the presence of objective cognitive impairment, and the absence of dementia, she was classified in the Rotterdam Study as having mild cognitive impairment. 删除9：<u>10 </u>During locomotor symptom screening we found no dysarthria, no tremor, no abnormalities during finger tapping, normotonic arms and legs, and no dysmetria. At the standing and gait examinations, she was able to stand stable on two legs, but not in tandem position. She was able to walk independently, though with a slight unstable gait pattern. A non-contrast brain MRI was performed (in November 2010) as part of the research protocol and was compared with the brain MRI from other Rotterdam Study participants aged 70–96 years (median age of 77 years). This revealed that she had a smaller volume of the right and left hippocampus, right thalamus, left amygdala and brainstem. She had a larger volume of CSF, right and left nucleus accumbens, and right putamen than expected for her age. There were no changes on the brain MRI at the basal ganglia, as verified a posteriori by the CJD expert centre at the University of Edinburgh.\n\n【15】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【16】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【17】Results of the cognitive tests before and at diagnosis of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease case</u>\n\n【18】### Clinical investigations\n\n【19】Brain MRI which was performed in October 2010—around 4 weeks before the brain MRI in the Rotterdam Study research centre—showed intracerebral multiple white matter hyperintensities, which were confluent periventricular. These white matter hyperintensities were most likely of vascular origin. Also, slightly wider peripheral and central CSF spaces were seen on brain MRI. The MRI did not show high signal in putamen or caudate. MRI images are shown in figure 1 . Furthermore, an EEG, which was performed in March 2011, showed sufficient fast activity and showed occipital rhythm and diffuse rhythm. Diffuse slow activity was frequently seen as well. The EEG did not show sharp wave complexes. Analysis of the CSF, performed in March 2011, showed a weakly positive 14-3-3 protein, elevated t-tau (4800 ng/L, normal <350), with normal p-tau (72 ng/L, normal <85), elevated S100 protein (8.2 µg/L, normal <3.9) and elevated NSE (20.8 µg/L, normal <17.5). The MMSE score at that time was still 25 out of 30. The patient was heterozygous for codon 129 from the prion protein gene (PRNP; genotype MV) and for the apolipoprotein E gene (genotype epsilon 2/epsilon 3).\n\n【20】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【21】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【22】Axial brain MRI images showing multiple white matter hyperintensities; left: fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain MRI sequence; right: diffusion-weighted imaging brain MRI sequence.</u>\n\n【23】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【24】Several differential diagnoses were considered and evaluated.

The patient died in June 2011, 删除13：<u>3 </u>months after the diagnosis sCJD was clinically suspected. Postmortem brain autopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Pathological investigation showed widespread spongiosis and gliosis. Prion protein immunohistochemistry showed synaptic staining, mainly in the deeper layers with most spongiosis, plaque-like deposits and compact deposits. In the cerebellar cortex spongiosis and frequent periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive plaques (kuru-type plaques) and deposits were seen, as shown in figure 2 . The cerebellar grey matter also showed some PAS-positive plaques. Other parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, basal nuclei, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and brain stem, showed spongiosis and some PAS-positivity. PRNP gene analysis revealed no mutations. Based on the pathological alterations, the final histopathological diagnosis was sCJD type MV2K. 删除9：<u>8 9 12</u>\n\n【30】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【31】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【32】Microscopic pathology demonstrating kuru-type plaques in the cerebellum.</u>\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】sCJD is the most common form of CJD. 删除9：<u>4 </u>We report the first case diagnosed with sCJD who was enrolled in a population-based cohort study and was classified as having mild cognitive impairment during the diagnostic workup for sCJD.\n\n【35】sCJD is a fatal neurological disease with a large variety in symptom onset and progression. Rapid progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia is often the first clinical manifestation of sCJD. We describe the first case diagnosed with sCJD in the population-based Rotterdam Study and for whom prospective epidemiological data is available. During the patient’s last visit at our research centre, she had subjective cognitive complaints and, based on cognitive examinations, she also had objective cognitive impairment. Therefore, she was classified within the study as having mild cognitive impairment. At the same time, the patient was suffering from several other neurological symptoms and was referred to the neurology clinic for diagnostic workup. Given that sCJD is a progressive disease in which symptoms are known to progress rapidly, the cognitive decline observed during her final visit to our research centre was not unexpected. However, since she did not yet fulfil the criteria for dementia, she was classified as having mild cognitive impairment. This was beyond our expectations, as the visit at our research centre was during the early clinical stage of sCJD, that is, 删除13：<u>4 </u>months before diagnosis of sCJD. This shows that the symptom onset of cognitive impairment in our sCJD case was subtle. 删除9：<u>13 </u>Moreover, the MMSE score a few months before death showed subtle cognitive impairment. The recognition of sCJD is often a diagnostic challenge.\n\n【36】sCJD cases with the molecular subtype MV2K have a long clinical course and usually present with early-onset ataxia. This was seen in our case as well, as dominant symptoms were the difficulties with balance and unstable walking. Further, in cases with this molecular subtype, sharp wave complexes on EEG are infrequently seen, as was the case in our patient. It is of interest that the patient had a late symptom onset. The age of onset of the cognitive problems in our case was 76 years, which is higher than the mean age of onset for sCJD. 删除9：<u>9 14 </u>The mean age of onset in the Netherlands is 66 years. 删除9：<u>15 </u>In sCJD cases with the molecular subtype MV2K, the median age of onset is known to be 65 years (range 36–83 years). 删除9：<u>9 16 </u>Our case can be considered as a relatively late-onset case of sCJD. A possible explanation for the late onset of mild cognitive impairment symptoms is that our case was high-functioning before symptom onset, which could have provided cognitive protection.\n\n【37】In conclusion, we describe the first case diagnosed with sCJD who during diagnostic workup for sCJD was classified as having mild cognitive impairment in a population-based cohort study.\n\n【38】### Learning points\n\n【39】*   The sporadic form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is the most common prion disease, which is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease caused by accumulation of abnormally folded prion protein.\n\n【40】*   As the symptom onset of sCJD can be subtle, the diagnosis of sCJD can be a diagnostic challenge, especially in the early clinical stage of the disease.\n\n【41】*   In sCJD cases with the molecular subtype MV2K, the median age of onset is 65 years with a large range of age of onset.

She had developed a biphasic wheeze by 6 weeks of age and was given multiple diagnoses by different clinicians, including new-born wheeze and chest infection. There was no familial history of atopy or asthma. It was not until her second attendance at the emergency department that a thorough examination was conducted by a paediatrician who associated the haemangioma on her upper back with her respiratory symptoms.\n\n【17】Infantile haemangiomas (IHs) are one of the most common benign vascular tumours of infancy affecting up to 10% of children. 删除9：<u>1 </u>They usually develop in the head and neck region as cutaneous haemangiomas but can manifest as a paediatric upper airway infantile haemangioma (UAIH), typically in the subglottic region. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Our case is particularly noteworthy as the cutaneous involvement was found on the patient’s upper back. IH occurring outside of the face is rare (<19%) in the context of UAIH, and the back specifically is yet more uncommon. 删除9：<u>3 </u>For example, only one case in a 15-patient series by Marianowski _et al_ was found to involve the patient’s back 4 and similarly 2 patients in the 38-patient series by Uthurriagua _et al_ . 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【18】Due to the rarity of the UAIH, it has been difficult to draw conclusions between cutaneous haemangiomas and synchronous lesions in the upper airway. However, when there is an association between cutaneous haemangioma and UAIH, the suspicion is almost always raised with cutaneous lesions in the classical ‘beard’ distribution or with PHACES syndrome. The most high-risk skin patterns for UAIH are large segmental mandibular IH, as well as segmental IH of the lower lip and neck. 删除9：<u>3 </u>This case is a clear demonstration that UAIH can occur alongside non-segmental cutaneous involvement in an atypical distribution, in this case, the patient’s upper back.\n\n【19】Despite the rarity of the disease, it is important for clinicians to recognise the association between cutaneous haemangiomas and UAIH as untreated mortality rates approach 50%. 删除9：<u>2 </u>There are multiple treatment options for IH; propranolol (beta blocker) is now widely accepted as first-line treatment with research supporting its overall efficacy and safety. 删除9：<u>5</u>\n\n【20】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【21】We noticed our daughter developed a slight wheeze, at first we thought she had just caught a common cold; however, it turns out this was the first symptom of our daughter’s condition. Over the course of the 2 weeks leading up to our daughter’s diagnosis the wheeze gradually got worse and began to sound like a honking noise. Our daughter’s behaviour also changed drastically during that 2 week period, she went from being a content happy baby to screaming most of the day unless she was asleep. She was visibly working hard to breathe and became increasingly lethargic as a result. 5 days prior to her admission into PICU she also halved her daily milk intake, she went from taking 6 oz bottles to only taking 1 oz at a time. During this period, our daughter’s visible haemangioma on her back also grew significantly as I began to notice I could now feel it through her clothes as it became increasingly raised. As a mother I knew something wasn’t right and thankfully I persisted with seeking medical help until our daughter was finally diagnosed a full 2 weeks after her wheeze first appeared. We are so grateful that our daughter is recovering so well.\n\n【22】### Learning points\n\n【23】*   While clinicians must be able to recognise the high-risk ‘beard’ distribution of cutaneous haemangioma with upper airway infantile haemangioma (UAIH), our case demonstrates this can occur when the cutaneous distribution is not classical.\n\n【24】*   The presence of stridor and/or respiratory distress in infants with any form of cutaneous haemangioma should prompt clinicians to consider UAIH.\n\n【25】*   In these cases, swift referral to an otolaryngologist and initiation of propranolol under close observation is crucial and can be life-saving.\n\n【26】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【27】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【28】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:10:36", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:11:46", "cost": 70.256}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:26", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:11:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:10:36"}

They advised us that she was unlikely to survive a general anaesthetic. This was discussed fully with the patient who did not want to risk a general anaesthetic, due to the low probability of survival, before she has had the chance to see her family. She was therefore admitted to the ward with an Aspen collar for her C4-5 fracture and epidural for pain relief from her ribs.

In Japan, the number of super-old patients—age >90 years—with hip fractures has increased drastically over time. Available strategies for anaesthetic management for hip fracture surgery include general anaesthesia, neuraxial anaesthesia and peripheral nerve block. However, general and neuraxial anaesthesia are often avoided for various reasons, particularly in elderly patients. In recent years, peripheral nerve block has proven effective in various surgical procedures. Additionally, dexmedetomidine exhibits neuroprotective effects and has been used safely in super-old patients. Herein, we demonstrate successful anaesthetic management with peripheral nerve block under dexmedetomidine sedation for open reduction and internal fixation of a femoral neck fracture in a 97-year-old patient.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   sedation\n*   orthopaedic and trauma surgery\n*   anaesthesia\n*   global health\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

NA includes spinal anaesthesia (SA) and epidural anaesthesia. GA and NA are often avoided in the elderly population for various reasons. Herein, we report successful anaesthetic management using femoral nerve block (FNB) and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block (LFCNB) under dexmedetomidine (DEX) sedation for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a femoral neck fracture in a 97-year-old patient. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s family for the publication of this report.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A 97-year-old woman (body mass index (BMI), 14.8 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ; weight, 31.6 kg (measured later); height, 删除13：<u>146 </u>cm) visited a local hospital with the chief complaint of right hip pain with an unknown history of present illness. After detailed physical and radiographic examinations, she was diagnosed with Garden type Ⅱ of an intracapsular fracture of the right femoral neck . She was referred to our hospital for further surgical treatment. She had a history of severe mitral regurgitation, mild dementia and chronic constipation. Her current pharmacotherapy includes three constipation medications and verapamil. Unfortunately, further internal medicine information was unavailable. ECG, performed at our emergency department, showed sinus rhythm.\n\n【10】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【11】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【12】Initial plain radiograph of fracture; Garden type Ⅱ of intracapsular fracture of the right femoral neck.</u>\n\n【13】The orthopaedic surgeons decided on a less invasive ORIF using cannulated cancellous screws (CCS) because of the minimal displacement of the fracture and advanced age of the patient.\n\n【14】We selected FNB and LFCNB under DEX sedation as the anaesthesia method because the planned ORIF required only a small incision. Additionally, to prevent intraoperative or postoperative complications, including hypotension, postoperative delirium (PD) and respiratory failure, and due to suspicion of fused vertebrae for vertebral fracture, GA and NA were avoided.\n\n【15】During the operation, the patient’s blood pressure was monitored non-invasively, along with electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and continual skin temperature monitoring. To assess respiratory depression associated with sedation, nasal capnography—handmade with a suction catheter—was used to monitor end-tidal carbon dioxide and respiratory rate. Sedation level was assessed using the Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale. Her weight, which was not known, was estimated to be 40 kg based on her small frame, and we administered anaesthesia accordingly.\n\n【16】First, we performed a continuous infusion of DEX intravenously, at a high rate of 80 µg/h for 5 min, for sedation and administered 50 µg fentanyl to induce analgesia simultaneously. Thereafter, the DEX dosage was decreased to 28 µg/h at a lower rate. Because SpO <sub>2 </sub> was decreased to 90% for sedation, we initiated oxygen administration via a face mask at 3 L/min; however, the sedation level was maintained at 3. PNB was performed using a linear ultrasound probe (HFL50, SonoSite, Bothell, Washington, USA) and a 5-cm, 22-gauge needle (Stimuplex Ultra.360, B-Braun, Tochigi, Japan). The femoral nerve was located using a peripheral nerve stimulator plus an ultrasonic echo device. A 16-mL dose of ropivacaine (0.375%) was injected around the femoral nerve, and LFCNB was achieved with a 4-mL dose of ropivacaine (0.375%). After including adequate local anaesthesia, surgery was initiated. At the beginning of the surgery, the surgeons infiltrated 10 mL of 0.5% xylocaine with epinephrine into the skin incision for haemostasis. The patient showed signs of distress during the insertion of CCS into the femoral head , following which an additional 50 µg fentanyl was administered. For postoperative analgesia, we administered 600 mg acetaminophen at the end of the surgery. The duration of the surgery was 9 min and that of anaesthesia was 42 min.

The next day, rehabilitation was initiated and training for standing was possible. Eventually, she was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital on postoperative day 15.\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】Hip fracture incidence rates increase exponentially with age. In Japan, from 2009 to 2014, this trend was prominently seen in the 90–94 year age group in women and the 85–89 year age group in men. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Therefore, hip fractures in super-old patients are expected to increase in the future. However, whether anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in the elderly is best performed under GA or RA, including PNB or NA, remains debatable. The case of a 72-year-old patient who underwent ORIF with PNB has been reported 4 ; however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report of anaesthetic management in a 97-year-old patient. In this case, PNB under DEX sedation for ORIF was selected in a super-old patient.\n\n【27】The first reason to avoid GA and NA is hypotension. Intraoperative hypotension occurs commonly during hip fracture surgery, especially in elderly patients with a higher number of comorbidities. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Internationally, the 30-day mortality rate after hip fracture surgery is 6%–8%; intraoperative hypotension is associated with increased 30-day mortality. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Although GA or SA is usually selected for hip fracture ORIF, the incidence of intraoperative absolute hypotension (lowest systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) is high in both GA and SA (49.2% and 28.2%, respectively). 删除9：<u>5 </u>In recent years, PNB has proven to be effective in various orthopaedic procedures. Intraoperative blood pressure is higher during PNB than that during GA 6 or SA, 删除13：<u>7 8 </u>and PNB provides a more stable haemodynamic state. Owing to a history of severe mitral regurgitation and the potential for hypovolaemia, our patient’s intraoperative haemodynamics were closely monitored. In fact, we believe that the patient’s haemodynamics remained stable during the surgery because we selected PNB for anaesthetic management.\n\n【28】Additionally, intraoperative hypotension is associated with PD. 删除9：<u>9 </u>PD occurs in 12%–51% of elderly patients following orthopaedic surgical treatment. 删除9：<u>10 </u>PD is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, such as high mortality rates, extended hospitalisation or further cognitive decline. 删除9：<u>9 10 </u>Risk factors for PD include those that are patient-related and those that are adjusted in-hospital; thus, they are potentially prevented. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Examples of the former include advanced age, low BMI, preoperative cognitive decline, polypharmacy (over three medications) and a high American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score. In contrast, the risk factors for the latter include intraoperative blood pressure (mean arterial pressure) control, blood transfusion and postoperative pain management. Our patient had a BMI of 14.8 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> and an ASA score of 3. In short, avoiding intraoperative hypotension was important to ensure a good prognosis because our patient had an advanced age, low BMI, preoperative cognitive decline, polypharmacy and a high ASA score. Fortunately, our patient was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital without any problems.\n\n【29】We avoided GA and NA for several other reasons. We aimed to prevent the risk of postoperative respiratory failure, which occurs more significantly in the setting of GA. 删除9：<u>11 </u>As the patient was 97 years old, poor outcomes were likely in case of respiratory failure after surgery. Moreover, as compared with SA, patients who underwent hip fracture surgery with GA have a higher risk of 30-day complications, such as the need for blood transfusion and risk of deep vein thrombosis. 删除9：<u>12 </u>In contrast, we also wanted to avoid NA as it can be difficult to achieve because of the bent or fused spine of an elderly patient. Postoperatively, our patient was found to have a history of compression fracture of the third lumbar vertebra. Furthermore, as our patient had a history of mild dementia and experienced severe pain on movement, we judged that it would have been difficult for her to maintain the lateral position during NA. Lastly, had our elderly patient been on antithrombotic drugs for any indication, NA may also have been contraindicated. 删除9：<u>13</u>\n\n【30】Intraoperative sedation is an important component of RA techniques and surgical procedures. We selected DEX as a supplement of the PNB and surgery because DEX is a selective α2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a large number of advantages, including fast-onset sedation with minimal respiratory depression, mild analgesic properties and the ability to improve postoperative recognition. 删除9：<u>14 </u>In our patient, we assessed the level of sedation using the OAA/S score, a subjective assessment carried out intermittently depending on the patient’s response to either verbal or physical stimuli. 删除9：<u>15 </u>We believe that the combination of fentanyl bolus was a contributing factor for the decrease in oxygen saturation after the initiation of DEX. Since then, the patient had mild-to-moderate sedation levels and did not require manual ventilatory assistance. Despite the combination of PNB and a continuous infusion of DEX, the patient showed signs of distress while inserting CCS into the femoral head. This could be because the short time between the PNB and the initiation of surgery may have resulted in inadequate analgesia to the femoral head. However, PNB is considered to have been effective, as the patient did not require any analgesics for at least 12 hours after surgery. Moreover, DEX exhibits neuroprotective effects and decreases the incidence of PD, 删除13：<u>16 </u>leading to shorter hospital stays. 删除9：<u>17 18 </u>Furthermore, in elderly patients, intraoperative DEX use can remarkably improve the first night sleep quality after surgery, resulting in PD prevention. 删除9：<u>19 </u>DEX has been used safely not only in our patient but also in another super-old patient. 删除9：<u>20 </u>Briefly, DEX can be a useful anaesthetic adjuvant for a wide range of clinical applications due to its safety and effectiveness.\n\n【31】In summary, we achieved successful anaesthetic management with PNB and DEX in a 97-year-old patient for femoral neck fracture fixation. Because the incidence of hip fractures is expected to increase in the future, we believe that PNB is an effective method to anaesthetise super-old patients instead of GA or NA. Additionally, DEX has many advantages, including good sedation, analgesia and neuroprotective effects with minimal respiratory depression. In this case, our results suggest that anaesthesia using PNB under DEX sedation can contribute to the safety and effectiveness of hip fracture surgery in super-old patients.\n\n【32】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【33】This was by far the best possible result to finish the surgery avoiding general anaesthesia and neuraxial anaesthesia. Thank you very much.\n\n【34】### Learning points\n\n【35】*   Hip fracture is a common injury and a growing healthcare challenge in an ageing society.\n\n【36】*   Available methods for anaesthetic management for hip fracture surgery include general anaesthesia, neuraxial anaesthesia and peripheral nerve block.\n\n【37】*   Peripheral nerve block appears to be an effective method to anesthetise super-old patients and may be used to replace general and neuraxial anaesthesia.\n\n【38】*   As seen in our case, anaesthetic management using peripheral nerve block with dexmedetomidine sedation could contribute to the safety of hip fracture surgery in super-old patients.\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Dr Jun Nakanishi (Department of Orthopedics, Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital) for useful discussions.

Any chance at rescue therapy should be immediately assessed and offered if possible. Endovascular catheter-directed treatment is preferred to systemic thrombolysis, but there is uncertainty as to the acceptable treatment time window. This case report highlights the clues at presentation which indicates renal infarction so clinicians may better recognise this syndrome. It also demonstrated that some patients still benefit from delayed intervention. Paradoxical embolism is also a very rare cause of renal infarction which was worth considering if a primary cardiac source cannot be found.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A 62-year-old man presented with acute onset severe abdominal pain which woke him from sleep. The pain was constant, predominantly in the left flank and radiated to the groin, and was associated with nausea, vomiting and diaphoresis. He initially believed it was similar to the renal colic he experienced 5 years ago, where a 4 mm vesicoureteric calculus was found. His medical history included type 2 diabetes and overweight (body mass index 27.3 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), and chronic kidney disease with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 78 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . He had recently undergone elective sinus and nasal surgery (open septorhinoplasty, right functional endoscopic sinus surgery and bilateral turbinoplasty) 3 days prior to presentation and was discharged on a 5-day course of oral cephalexin and celecoxib. His regular medication included metformin, and he was a non-smoker who was independent with his activities of daily living.\n\n【10】He presented to hospital 3 hours after the onset of pain with a regular heart rate of 66 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. The admission ECG confirmed a sinus rhythm. Abdominal and rectal examination did not define any focal areas of tenderness or guarding. A non-contrast CT scan of his kidney, ureter and bladder did not show ureteric calculi or hydronephrosis. Several surgical consults were undertaken but the differential diagnosis remained broad, and he was initially managed with intravenous fluids and opioid analgesia. However, his abdominal pain evolved to involve both flanks and he was oligoanuric. The urinalysis was bland (leucocytes, 7×10 <sup>6 </sup> /L; erythrocytes, 4×10 <sup>6 </sup> /L), but the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was significantly elevated at 0.99 g/mmol (normal,<0.03 g/mmol).\n\n【11】Within hours of presentation, there was a surge in the systolic blood pressure with spikes up to 175 mm Hg despite adequate analgesia. His heart rate remained normal in the first 24 hours, but steadily increased thereafter, with sinus tachycardia on telemetry. Blood leucocyte count was elevated at presentation, and after a 24-hour delay, the C reactive protein also increased dramatically. An evolving acute kidney injury (AKI) was evident. These observations are summarised in figure 1 . Renal doppler ultrasound noted a loss of perfusion bilaterally, and the serum lactate dehydrogenase was significantly elevated at 2601 U/L (normal, <250 U/L). A CT thoracic and abdominal angiogram was eventually performed 81 hours after the onset of pain. A brief episode of atrial fibrillation was detected immediately after the procedure, which spontaneously reverted after 4 hours.\n\n【12】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【14】Graphs of haemodynamic and blood parameters prior to initiation of dialysis.

Paradoxical embolism was deemed the most likely cause of renal infarction, given the recent hospitalisation and surgery as a provoking factor for venous thromboembolism, and the concurrent pulmonary embolism. Other causes were considered but investigations for thrombophilia and autoimmune disease were unremarkable. No monoclonal proteins were detected in serum or urine. Malignancy was not detected on imaging to suggest a paraneoplastic syndrome.\n\n【22】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【23】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【24】A previous ECG-gated CT coronary angiogram demonstrated a 2 mm patent foramen ovale (black arrow), with iodinated contrast leak through the defect.

After a period of heparinisation, the patient transitioned to warfarin anticoagulation. He was able to cease haemodialysis 30 days after initiation, having recorded a stable predialysis creatinine around 320 µmol/L. After another 4 months follow-up, he maintained a stable creatinine of 280 µmol/L with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 20 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> and a urine protein-to-creatine ratio of 0.07 g/mmol. Repeat renal ultrasound noted some areas of cortical atrophy consistent with patchy cortical necrosis but arterial doppler interrogation showed normal resistive indices and intrarenal waveforms bilaterally, without evidence of renal artery stenosis or residual thromboembolism. He maintains sinus rhythm, and PFO closure by a percutaneous transcatheter technique is under consideration by his cardiologist and haematologist.\n\n【38】Discussion\n----------\n\n【39】Renal infarction is a rare diagnosis which can present as an undifferentiated acute abdomen or mimic renal colic. Even with surgical consultation, the diagnosis was delayed in our patient. In a case series of 94 patients, the average time to diagnose renal infarction was 5 days. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Furthermore, extrarenal infarction only occurs in 10%–16% of cases. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>The preferred initial diagnostic test for flank pain is a non-contrast CT as it is the gold standard for the diagnosis of renal (ureteric) calculi, which is much more common than renal infarction. In our patient, his history of ureteric calculus and initial presentation with unilateral flank pain prompted a consideration of recurrent calculus. However, as shown in this case, a non-contrast CT aimed at detecting urolithiasis or hydronephrosis does not detect perfusion abnormalities, and renal infarction can be missed due to a false reassurance of the apparently normal non-contrast CT. Ultrasound as the initial scan may have been appropriate to exclude a postrenal cause of AKI but it does not localise the level of obstruction, and doppler interrogation is not routinely performed. A contrast-enhanced CT is the imaging method of choice if renal infarction is clinically suspected.\n\n【40】Clinicians need a high index of suspicion to diagnose renal artery occlusion so that reperfusion therapy can be attempted in a timely manner. The clinical features which suggested renal infarction included abdominal/flank pain, reduced urine output and markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Another clue is the acute surge in blood pressure which is most likely driven by activation of the renin-angiotensin system from renal ischaemia. In unilateral renal artery occlusion, increased renin-angiotensin driven hypertension results in pressure natriuresis in the contralateral kidney, which partially attenuates the progression of hypertension despite high levels of renin. With bilateral renal artery occlusion, this pressure natriuresis is lost, leading to rapid sodium and volume retention, and progressive hypertension. The hypertension may be difficult to control without fluid offloading, and in the case of bilateral renal infarction with anuria, acute dialysis and ultrafiltration can be effective in controlling the hypertension. The delayed rise in heart rate may be due to the sympatho-adrenergic activation, oxidative stress, and a proinflammatory state corresponding with the significant elevation in blood leucocyte count and C reactive protein seen in many cases of renal infarction. 删除9：<u>1 </u>In our case, the finding of AKI was an initial deterrent for contrast imaging after the impaired perfusion was initially identified on doppler ultrasound. However, the CT angiogram was the most sensitive and specific investigation for diagnosis of renal artery occlusion.\n\n【41】The most common cause of renal infarction is cardiac thromboembolism, mostly as a consequence of atrial fibrillation. Other causes include a de novo thrombosis due to thrombophilia or renal artery trauma, but around 30% are idiopathic and 16% are bilateral. 删除9：<u>1–3 </u>However, we suspect our patient had paradoxical embolism because of the concurrent pulmonary embolism and presence of a PFO, even though lower limb deep vein thrombosis was not found. His recent surgery was considered the provoking factor for the thromboembolic event. It was also possible that a left atrial appendage thrombus could have been missed despite excellent views on transthoracic echocardiography. However, a left atrium source of thrombus did not explain the pulmonary embolism. The patient was in sinus rhythm on admission and throughout most of the monitoring period, except for a brief episode of atrial fibrillation lasting 4 hours occurring immediately after his CT angiogram (81 hours after pain onset), which we believe was triggered by acute illness (renal failure, pulmonary embolism, hypoxia, pain, iodinated contrast). In all ECG and telemetry recordings before and after this brief episode, he remained in sinus rhythm (up to 4 months follow-up).\n\n【42】Case reports of bilateral renal infarction from paradoxical emboli are rare. 删除9：<u>4–7 </u>Carey _et al_ reported a patient with bilateral renal artery occlusion in the setting of a deep vein thrombosis and PFO who remained dialysis dependent. 删除9：<u>4 </u>In the case by Herbaut _et al_ , the infarcted kidney was not salvageable after a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Our patient was fortunate to have salvaged enough kidney to cease dialysis. Only one other case by Goueffic _et al_ reported a similar situation, where a patient with bilateral renal infarct following paradoxical embolism recovered enough renal function to cease dialysis after successful endovascular treatment. 删除9：<u>7 </u>In the longer term, it is unclear if closure of the PFO is recommended as studies have mostly been for secondary stroke prevention. In a meta-analysis of randomised trials by Shah _et al_ in 2018, PFO closure compared with medical therapy alone reduced the rate of recurrent stroke from 5.1% to 1.8%. 删除9：<u>8 </u>In an observational study of patients with paradoxical embolism and PFO, the average annual recurrence of transient ischaemic attacks and peripheral embolism despite PFO closure was 2.5% and 0.9%, respectively. 删除9：<u>9 </u>While there are many reported case studies of PFO closure after non-cerebral paradoxical embolism in the literature, it is difficult to conclusively demonstrate a benefit in the absence of randomised trials. However, given the catastrophic embolism in our patient and the indirect evidence for preventing peripheral embolism, percutaneous transcatheter PFO closure is under consideration for our patient.\n\n【43】Bilateral renal artery occlusion can lead to permanent kidney failure. Open surgical thrombo-embolectomy has largely been replaced by percutaneous endovascular treatment as it is associated with lower morbidity, mortality and recovery time. To our knowledge, surgery has not been first-line treatment for renal artery thromboembolism since the 1980s, and it is not superior to endovascular treatment for the salvage of renal function. 删除9：<u>10 </u>The window for reperfusion with intra-arterial thrombolysis and thromboaspiration has traditionally been considered to be small. Previous case reports of successful catheter-directed thromboaspiration after an acute renal artery occlusion had usually performed them within 12–24 hours from the onset of pain. 删除9：<u>7 11–14 </u>However, these procedures are not commonly performed due to the uncommon occurrence of renal artery occlusion, so there is insufficient data to adequately define the treatment time window. Our case demonstrated a benefit of endovascular reperfusion even after a significant delay of 88 hours from the onset of pain. The success rate of endovascular treatment is unknown due to selection bias, publication bias and heterogeneity between cases. In a case series, 删除13：<u>33 </u>of 94 patients with acute renal infarction underwent interventional angiography following initial CT diagnosis, but only five patients were deemed suitable for curative treatment. Of these, four patients demonstrated improved renal function while one patient with bilateral involvement failed treatment and remained dialysis dependent. 删除9：<u>1 </u>However, the timing of the procedures relative to the onset of symptoms was not reported.\n\n【44】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【45】Hi, I’m \\[anonymised\\], the Drs at \\[anonymised\\] have requested me to write a few lines about what happened to me and how I lost my kidney function pretty much overnight.\n\n【46】After much procrastination I decided to have a septoplasty and rhinoplasty operation. The operation was a success but 2 days later, I started having severe abdominal cramps and pain, and ended up in hospital. With all the pain meds the hospital was giving me, I was still in a lot of pain. The surgical team did several scans and tests but couldn’t find the cause of the pain. I was becoming increasingly ill, the hospital at \\[anonymised\\] decided to transfer me to \\[anonymised\\].\n\n【47】My condition was rapidly deteriorating, and the Drs couldn’t find the cause, but they knew my kidneys were failing. Mind you, before my septoplasty op I had perfectly healthy kidneys. And I thought I was going to die and finally the Drs decided to do a CT angiogram of my arteries and it was then that they discovered that my arteries were blocked with blood clots, and it was preventing the blood supply to my kidneys. It took 4 days approximately to find the cause for my kidney failure, but after the Drs realised the issue, they did everything within their power and knowledge to treat me, and so the journey to recovery began.\n\n【48】Having said all of the above and being very grateful to the Drs/nurses and the entire staff who looked after me so well, it is my faith to believe that God helped me recover, my family and friends prayed very hard for my recovery, and I like to acknowledge that as well.\n\n【49】So that’s my story in a nutshell.\n\n【50】### Learning points\n\n【51】*   Isolated thromboembolic renal infarction can occur without overt extrarenal infarcts, presumably due to the relatively high blood flow rate through the kidneys. Renal infarction should be suspected in patients with acute abdominal pain, oliguria or acute kidney injury (AKI), and a significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase.\n\n【52】*   An early hypertensive response and neutrophilic leucocytosis, combined with a slightly delayed but robust elevation in C reactive protein are additional clues of renal infarction.\n\n【53】*   CT angiography (or magnetic resonance angiography) is necessary to detect renal thromboembolism in patients with suspected renal infarction.

Such incidents are characterised by a small punctiform entry wound and the normal colour of skin. The internal damage caused by these injuries can be severely devastating in nature. These injuries required emergent surgical debridement and irrigation. Postoperatively intensive physiotherapy is required for the successful return of hand function. The final functional outcome depends on the initial latency to treatment, nature of injected material, location and volume of injection and postoperative physiotherapy.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   trauma\n*   plastic and reconstructive surgery\n*   physiotherapy (rehabilitation)\n*   accidents\n*   injuries\n*   radiology\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2019-231112\n\n【3】Statistics from Altmetric.com\n-----------------------------</u>\n\n【4】删除12：<u>*   trauma\n*   plastic and reconstructive surgery\n*   physiotherapy (rehabilitation)\n*   accidents\n*   injuries\n*   radiology\n</u>\nBackground\n----------\n\n【5】High-pressure injuries (HPIs) are very rare entities affecting the hands. These injuries are caused by the guns ejecting high-pressure jet streams emitting streams at pressure exceeding thousands of pounds force per square inch (psi). The incidence of these injuries is one in every 600 hand traumas. On an average, only one to four HPIs to hand are treated by even high-volume centres in an entire year. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【6】Paint, solvents, automotive grease and diesel oil include the most commonly injected materials in HPIs. This high pressure leads to diffusion of injected material into the tendon sheath, along neurovascular bundles and fascial planes. Thus closed and poorly distensible compartment-like digital and palmar tissues are badly affected. Overall deleterious effect is due to the raised pressure in the closed compartment, direct toxic effect of the chemical injected, mechanical impact of injury and secondary infections. 删除9：<u>2–4</u>\n\n【7】These injuries are mostly underestimated because of small entry wound and initial benign look on inspection. Further, they occur accidentally during the leakage of pipes or during cleaning of the apparatus. The whole incident is over in a fraction of a second, that its severity is overlooked. 删除9：<u>4 5</u>\n\n【8】This article reports a case of a high-pressure chemical injection Injury to the hand with extensive internal damage of soft tissue in comparison with the punctiform external wounds, its management and an early return of the hand function.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A 42-year-old right-handed industrial worker was brought to the trauma centre 3 hours after sustaining an injury to his left hand from the high-pressure chemical jet that he was operating. The nozzle of the chemical pipe line accidentally opened and momentarily came into contact with the palm of left hand. The chemical that he was handling was ferric oxide. The pressure in the pipeline was around 4000 psi. There was minimal bleeding at the scene. On arrival in the trauma centre, he complained of severe pain and swelling in the hand, exacerbated by any active movement. He had one 1 cm entry wound marks on his left palm in the thenar region about 5 cm distal to the distal wrist crease. The entry wound and adjacent skin over the palm was very tender. There were no exit wounds visible. There was obvious swelling in the hand when compared with the opposite hand. Radial and ulnar pulses were palpable. The capillary refill time was delayed in the index and middle finger and normal in the rest of fingers. His vital signs were within normal limits. Sensory function of the hand was intact. Motor function was present, but he experienced severe hand and forearm pain on active and passive flexion and extension of left hand fingers and wrist. The range of finger movements was restricted .\n\n【11】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【12】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【13】A small punctiform entry wound in the thenar aspect with no exit wound.</u>\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the left forearm, elbow and hand confirmed the presence of subcutaneous emphysema extending from palmar region till midforearm.

If the patient presents late, several days after the initial injury, then one must also be suspicious for flexor tenosynovitis or an infections of the digits and hand.\n\n【21】Treatment\n---------\n\n【22】He was initially treated with intravenous augmentin (amoxicillin and clavulinic acid) 1.2 g intravenous and tetanus toxoid 0.5 mL intramuscularly. He had ongoing pain that was treated with analgesics. He underwent an emergency surgical exploration of left forearm and hand. First, the entry wound was extended proximally to the hand and forearm. A fasciotomy was performed in the dorsum of hand in the second and forth metacarpal spaces. The wound revealed a large amount of dark brown colour dye (ferric oxide) in the palm and distal flexor compartment. The material had penetrated and coated every distinguishable local anatomical structure. The anterior compartment muscles were soft. Neurovascular structures were identified and were intact. Thorough irrigation of the hand and anterior compartment with normal saline was performed and the wounds were left open and dressed .\n\n【23】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【24】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【25】Debridement of necrotic tissue and the presence of chemical agent (ferric oxide) in the palm.</u>\n\n【26】Postoperatively, he was treated with intravenous augmentin and adequate analgesia was given. After 2 days, a second debridement was performed. More of chemical could be removed and the stained tissues assessed for viability. Thorough irrigation was done. Again, after two more days, the wounds were explored. Further debridement of non-viable tissue followed by copious irrigation was done. Almost all of the contaminant chemical was now flushed out. The wounds were loosely approximated with interrupted non-absorbable sutures.\n\n【27】Postoperatively, splintage was provided to the upper extremity in the functional position. The patient was continued on intravenous augmentin for the next 24 hours. Adequate analgesia and elevation of the hand was ensured. Patient remained afebrile for 24 hours and was discharged home on oral augmentin and paracetamol for pain. After 10 days, all wounds healed. Supervised physiotherapy was started.\n\n【28】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【29】After 4 months on serial follow-ups, the surgical scar had healed well and he had normal motor and sensory functions of the left hand and forearm. He had recovered complete active and passive range of motion of fingers and wrist. He had a normal sensory function but the maximum grip strength had diminished slightly .\n\n【30】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【31】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【32】Normal motor and sensory function 4 months post operation.</u>\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】Rees in the year 1937 first described the high-pressure jet injury with diesel fuel. In 60% of cases, the non-dominant hand is involved. Index finger is involved in nearly 50% of such injuries, followed by the thumb. In 10% of cases, the palm and other regions are involved. 删除9：<u>1 6</u>\n\n【35】Paints, solvents, automotive grease and diesel oil include the most commonly injected materials. Diffusion of high kinetic energy in a closed anatomical compartment results in a devastating soft tissue and vascular injuries. If the operating temperature of the injected solvent is very high then it accentuates the injury by burning the underlying soft tissues and skin. These substances produce chemical irritation, acute and chronic inflammatory reactions with draining sinuses and fibrosis. Most devastating of all the chemicals is the paint solvent, which can result in amputation in 60%–80% of cases. 删除9：<u>4 5</u>\n\n【36】Various mechanisms that are responsible for these injuries these includes:\n\n【37】1.  Pressure—a pressure of 7 bar in enough for skin penetration. As the pressure increases, direct contact with skin is not required for infiltration into the subcutaneous tissues. The injected fluid preferentially follows the path of least resistance along the neurovascular bundle and fascial planes. The ultimate consequence is traumatic dissection of tissue, compression of neurovascular bundles, vascular spasm, tissue ischaemia and oedema. A compartment syndrome may develop.\n\n【38】2.  Chemical nature of substance—some chemicals have cytolytic properties which can result in intense inflammatory response, tissue destruction and necrosis. Consequently, a severe fibrosis may set in and can lead to impairment of hand function.\n\n【39】3.  Infection—it can happen primarily during the HPI but secondary infections are more common which may be due to ischaemia and necrosis. 删除9：<u>1 3 7 8\n    </u>\n\n【40】Initially, the patient may present with very minimal complaint, mostly with a small punctiform skin wound. Pain and swelling may develop after several hours. Sensory and motor impairment may be discovered later on. On an average, a patient seeks medical advice only after 9 hour of injury. The instantaneous nature of the event and Initial benign appearance of the injury may result in delays in seeking treatment. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【41】Radiological investigations are mandatory to know the extent of damage and involvement. Subcutaneous and soft tissue emphysema can be appreciated and its extent gives a good indication of the spread of the substance. Since there is involvement of fascial planes, the radiography must include proximal and distal regions for evaluating the extent of involvement. Imaging should be repeated after every surgical debridement.\n\n【42】If vascular compromise is suspected then urgent angiography should be performed for the evaluation of vascular injury site and extent. According to few authors, presence of distal pulse does not exclude an arterial injury and preoperative angiography should be performed. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【43】HPIs are surgical emergencies and patients need an immediate consultation and intervention. An early debridement must be performed in order to decrease the morbidity. Sooner the surgical intervention lowers the morbidity. Initial management include quick brief into history including the type of chemical, distance of jet from the skin surface and time of injury. High suspicious of extensive internal injury should be kept in the mind. Careful neurovascular examination followed by the radiological evaluation of site of injury and adjacent regions should be done. Tetanus prophylaxis, broad spectrum antibiotics and adequate analgesics should be given. Splinting and limb elevation should be done and urgent surgical decompression and debridement and copious irrigation should be done under adequate anaesthesia. Multiple episode of debridement and irrigation may be required over the time. Postoperatively aggressive physiotherapy should be done.\n\n【44】The final hand function depends on various factors which include nature of injected substance, pressure at which it is injected, volume of injected substance and the site of injury. Solvent and paints have extensive cytolytic property. Moreover solvents have lower viscosity, and hence their spread and diffusion is very quick across tissue planes. Higher the pressure, more the volume of jet injected and therefore, more devastating the injury. The fingertip has smaller expansion capacity compared with the palm and hence a faster development of compartment syndrome. 删除9：<u>4 7 9 10</u>\n\n【45】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【46】It was just like another day of work for me but I never realised that a little mistake will put me into a massive trouble for next few months. While working with high-pressure chemical injecting device, in a fraction of second it came into contact with my left hand. After the incident, I had a look at my hand and I realised there was a small wound in my hand and minimal to no bleeding. I could feel the pain and the difficulty in the hand movement. It became difficult for me to continue with the work. At that point I contacted few of my colleagues. They advised me to visit the local practitioner for the first aid since it was just a punctiform wound. But pain was increasing in intensity. I rushed to the emergency and trauma centre. Their team of doctors examined me and quickly got the investigations done. They showed me the X-rays and informed me regarding the severity and seriousness of injury. I was shocked to see the amount of chemical which had entered through that trivial-looking wound. The doctors advised me for an emergency surgery in order to save my hand. I consulted my family and gave consent for the surgery. A team of doctors operated on my left upper limb. After the first surgery, they informed me how much of chemical was present and they tried their best to remove as much as chemical as possible. One day later, dressing was opened to assess the wound and doctors decided to go in for a surgery again to remove the dead tissues and chemicals which were remaining. After 48 hours, I was again in the operation theatre. This time doctors had removed almost all of the chemicals and dead tissues. After that they used to assess and dress the wound everyday for the next 5 days and later on alternate day for the next 10 days. There was a sigh of relief once all of my wounds were healed. The next big thing on my mind was to regain the functionality. My treating doctors in consultation with the physiotherapist put me on a strict physiotherapy protocol. Initially it was very painful, even at the slightest of the movement. But my doctors and physiotherapist motivated me and I followed the physiotherapy protocol religiously. I could see the movements of my hand returning and it improved as days passed by. After 4 months of physiotherapy, I was able to move my fingers and hand comfortably. I returned to my work and daily routine. It was a great relief for my wife and family members . The doctors and my family supported me really well to bring me to a normal life. I realised how important it is to follow the precautions while working with these kinds of instruments. A moment of carelessness can lead to a very severe physical and mental trauma. It’s better to be safe than to feel sorry in the end.\n\n【47】### Learning points\n\n【48】*   high-pressure injuries (HPIs) are rare industrial injuries, which if not addressed early and aggressively can lead to high degree of morbidity.\n\n【49】*   Initial presentation of HPI can be very mystifying and can baffle the treating surgeon.\n\n【50】*   Early, aggressive and serial debridements and fasciotomy should be done for their early management\n\n【51】*   For an early return of function, an aggressive supervised physiotherapy protocol should be followed.\n\n【52】*   There should be regular workshops and awareness campaign on the regular basis for the industrial workers on the proper handling of high-pressure injection devices while operating and in case of some event, a quick referral to the competent centre.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:55:03", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:55:31", "cost": 27.623}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:26", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:55:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:55:03"}

He was ventilated for a total of 8 days.\n\n【11】Analysis of the ascitic fluid showed a lymphocytic effusion, primarily T cells (chyle).\n\n【12】He was initially started on total parenteral nutrition. A hydrolysed preterm formula was introduced on day 4. This was subsequently switched to a formula low in long-chain triglycerides, which was steadily increased, with an interruption for a contrast study due to bilious aspirates.\n\n【13】The baby’s weight fell by 17% in the first fortnight with significant resolution of ascites over the 3 weeks before he was discharged to his local neonatal unit.\n\n【14】The cause of his chylous ascites remains unknown. All investigations, including karyotype, cranial ultrasounds and abdominal ultrasound, were normal. Echocardiogram on day 1 of life showed a structurally normal, but slightly hypertrophied, heart with a patent ductus arteriosus and patent foramen ovale. The baby is now well and thriving.\n\n【15】Congenital chylous ascites (CCA) is the accumulation of chyle (lymphatic fluid rich in triglycerides, particularly chylomicrons) in the peritoneal cavity in infants under 3 months. Diagnosis is made from analysis of the fluid. CCA is very rare, particularly as an isolated finding. Due to its rarity, there is no reported incidence or established gold standard management.\n\n【16】Chylous ascites can be secondary to many pathologies, particularly malignancies, trauma and surgical damage to the lymphatic system. CCA results from abnormalities of the abdominal lymphatic system. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Obstructed lymphatic flow at lymphaticovenous and lympholymphatic channels raises intralacteal pressure causing subsequent extravasation 2 while maldevelopment of the vessels may cause idiopathic ‘leaky lymphatics’. 删除9：<u>1–4</u>\n\n【17】Initial treatment is conservative, with avoidance of long-chain triglycerides. This may mean keeping the baby nil by mouth with total parenteral nutrition or using formulas low in long-chain fatty acids. This aims to slow lymphatic flow and reduce intestinal secretions. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Paracentesis can alleviate abdominal pressure and respiratory distress; however, drainage of large volumes of fluid should be done cautiously due to the resultant protein loss.\n\n【18】Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, has been used to reduce lymphatic excretion of chyle. It is postulated to work through a reduction of splanchnic blood flow, intestinal motility and fat absorption. 删除9：<u>5 6</u>\n\n【19】If a prolonged period of conservative measures is unsuccessful, surgery is sometimes required to identify and ligate a site of lymphatic leak.\n\n【20】Consequences of significant chyle leak into the peritoneum include malnutrition and immune deficiency, secondary to protein and lymphocyte loss. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【21】In summary, this is a case of severe, isolated, CCA requiring premature delivery of the baby with paracentesis during the caesarean section.

Congenital chylous ascites is especially rare meaning that there is no universal approach to management.\n\n【24】*   The underlying pathology is usually an abnormality of the abdominal lymphatic system—structural or functional—including raised intralacteal pressure due to obstructed drainage.\n\n【25】*   Management aims to reduce lymphatic leak.

Although CCB-induced gingival enlargement is a known adverse effect, it is rarely or never caused by some CCBs. In this paper, we report the case of a late 80’s female patient with hypertension who experienced amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement. The patient’s antihypertensive medication was changed from amlodipine to another CCB of the same class, benidipine, which has not been reported to cause gingival enlargement. The patient also received periodontal therapy. A significant improvement in gingival enlargement was noted, and blood pressure control was maintained. This case indicates that it might be beneficial for patients with hypertension presenting CCB-induced gingival enlargement to switch from the CCB that caused gingival enlargement to another CCB with little to no risk.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   Hypertension\n*   Dentistry and oral medicine\n*   Cardiovascular system\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

The patient had been diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 77 and had begun antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine (5 mg/day). Two clinical blood pressure measurements were taken at the first visit, which were 154/83 and 137/74 mm Hg. The patient did not have a history of smoking.\n\n【16】Gingival enlargement, which the patient was unaware of, was observed in the mandibular anterior teeth gingiva and maxillary edentulous areas at the first visit . Periodontal examination (54-site measurements of nine teeth) was performed, including probing pocket depth (PPD), which involves measuring the depth of the spaces between the teeth and gingiva as indicative of periodontitis progression; bleeding on probing (BOP), which detects inflammation in the periodontal pocket; sites of suppuration and O’Leary’s plaque control record (PCR) to examine oral hygiene.\n\n【17】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【18】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【19】Intraoral photograph at first diagnosis (A, B).

(B) The vertical dimension of the lower face was reduced due to incompatible dentures.</u>\n\n【20】At baseline, the results of the periodontal examination showed an average PPD of 7.3 mm. The PPD of 98.1% of the sites was 4 mm or more, and BOP was observed in 100% of the sites. The patient routinely performed oral hygiene using only a toothbrush for 1 min after breakfast and before sleeping. Abundant plaque accumulation (PCR, 100%), inflammation of the periodontal tissues and calculus were observed at the first visit. The vertical dimension of the lower face was reduced due to incompatible dentures and pathological tooth migration caused by the periodontitis progression . Radiographic examination revealed moderate horizontal alveolar bone resorption, widening of the periodontal ligament of the upper teeth and localised severe vertical alveolar bone resorption on the mandibular right premolar and molar. Based on these clinical findings, severe generalised chronic periodontitis (stage IV grade B, classification in 2018) 12 and drug-induced gingival enlargement 4 were diagnosed.\n\n【21】Treatment\n---------\n\n【22】At the beginning of the initial treatment, we presented a list of CCBs that were previously reported to cause gingival enlargement and their incidence 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u> to her physician to determine the possibility of replacing amlodipine. After the consultation, amlodipine was replaced with another dihydropyridine CCB (benidipine 8 mg/day), which has not been previously reported to be associated with gingival enlargement. Subsequently, the clinical blood pressure was well controlled at 127/73 mm Hg.\n\n【23】Initial periodontal therapy included oral hygiene instruction using a toothbrush and an interdental brush, scaling of supragingival calculus and extraction of seven teeth (13, 删除13：<u>27, 42, 44, 45, 46 </u>and 47, using the Two-Digit World Dental Federation Notation tooth numbering system) because of the loss of supporting bone and disturbed masticatory function. Then, complete and partial denture fabrication for the upper and lower arches, respectively, and scaling root planing under local anaesthesia were performed. As a result, gingival enlargement improved, and 6 months after replacing amlodipine, an open flap debridement was performed as a preprosthetic procedure at the lower left canine and premolar where PPD of 4 mm or more persisted. Then, prosthodontic treatment with maxillary full dentures and mandibular partial dentures and crowns was performed after re-evaluation at 4 months after the flap operation, and supportive periodontal therapy (regular maintenance) was initiated.\n\n【24】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【25】During the initial periodontal treatment, gingival proliferative findings showed a tendency to improve 3 months after amlodipine replacement. Moreover, in the edentulous area of the maxilla, the proliferative findings were reversed 4 months after amlodipine replacement. The clinical parameters at the regular maintenance visit, 删除13：<u>14 </u>months after the start of benidipine treatment, remained improvement and were as follows: the average PPD was 2.8 mm, sites with 4 mm or more were 8.3%, and the rate of sites with BOP was 25.0% . Furthermore, no recurrence of gingival enlargement was observed for 2 years up to the point that the patient stopped coming to our clinic due to ambulatory issues.\n\n【26】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【27】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【28】Intraoral photograph after periodontal therapy following the switch from amlodipine to benidipine (A, B).

(B) Prosthodontic treatment performed with maxillary full dentures and mandibular partial dentures.</u>\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】CCB-induced gingival enlargement was first reported for nifedipine in 1984, 删除13：<u>13 </u>and the first case of amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement was reported in 1993. 删除9：<u>14 </u>Other case reports have also associated other CCBs with gingival enlargement. 删除9：<u>5–11 </u>According to previously reported cases of CCB-induced gingival enlargement, the prevalence rates associated with amlodipine, nifedipine, felodipine, nicardipine, manidipine, nisoldipine, diltiazem and verapamil were 1.1%–5.1%, 2.9%–7.6%, 3.2%, 0.5%, 1.8%, 1.1%, 2.2%–4.1% and 2.0%, respectively. 删除9：<u>6–10 </u>Nitrendipine and cilnidipine have also been reported to cause gingival enlargement, 删除13：<u>5 11 </u>but to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on their incidence. In 2021, a study on the Turkish population reported that 1 of 14 subjects taking benidipine had early mild overgrowth, and 2 of 15 subjects taking lercanidipine presented moderate overgrowth. 删除9：<u>15</u>\n\n【31】Gingival proliferation caused by phenytoin is clearly the most fibrotic, while lesions caused by cyclosporine are highly inflammatory and show little fibrosis. 删除9：<u>16 </u>In contrast, lesions caused by nifedipine are of mixed type 16 and might be relatively difficult to diagnose. However, as the Turkish study showed high incidence rates for several drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers that had not been previously reported, to be associated with gingival overgrowth, grades 1 and 2 of the classification of gingival overgrowth 17 used in this study might include gingival swelling due to gingivitis. In addition, gingival enlargement has not been reported in any CCB other than the above, suggesting that the incidence is rare.\n\n【32】Discontinuation of CCBs or switching to another drug often results in the improvement of gingival enlargement, and thus, drug dosage reduction or discontinuation is the initial treatment approach. However, it may be difficult to replace CCBs that cause gingival enlargement with other antihypertensive drugs in patients with severe hypertension or polypharmacy. Westbrook _et al_ evaluated the effect of switching to dihydropyridine derivatives, which are associated with a lower incidence of gingival enlargement, on nifedipine-induced gingival enlargement. Patients with nifedipine-induced gingival enlargement were divided into the following two groups: those receiving continuous nifedipine (six patients) and those receiving nifedipine-equivalent isradipine (five patients), and clinical findings were evaluated after 8 and 12 weeks. Three out of five patients in the isradipine group had clinically reduced gingival enlargement, whereas four out of six patients in the nifedipine group reported increased gingival enlargement. 删除9：<u>18</u>\n\n【33】The mechanisms of pathogenesis of CCB-induced gingival enlargements remain unclear. Calcium (Ca) channels are classified into the following types: the neural type (N-type), which exists in the nerve terminal, the long-lasting type (L-type) characterised by a slow rate of inactivation and the transient type (T-type) characterised by a rapid rate of inactivation. 删除9：<u>3 </u>These Ca channel subtypes exhibit various physiological functions due to differences in the electro-physiological properties and mode of in vivo distribution. It is noteworthy that CCBs that act only on L-type Ca channels, such as nifedipine and amlodipine, 删除13：<u>3 </u>tend to induce gingival enlargements 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>. On the contrary, benidipine, which acts on L-/T-/N-type Ca channels, cilnidipine, which acts on L-/N-type Ca channels and azelnidipine, which acts on L-/T-type Ca channels, 删除13：<u>3 </u>have rarely or never been reported to cause gingival enlargements. These findings suggest that the subtype and α <sub>1 </sub> subunits (Cav1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, Cav2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and Cav3.1, 3.2, 3.3) of Ca channels 19 on which the CCB acts may be related to the onset and incidence of gingival enlargements. Therefore, we focused on CCBs other than L-type CCBs, which have not yet been reported, and on those with a low incidence of gingival enlargement.\n\n【34】Previously, we reported a case of gingival enlargement in a patient with severe hypertension whose gingival enlargement improved after initial periodontal therapy following a change from L-type CCB (nifedipine, 删除13：<u>40 </u>mg/day), which caused gingival enlargement, to L-/T-type CCB (azelnidipine, 删除13：<u>16 </u>mg/day), which has not been reported to be associated with gingival enlargement. 删除9：<u>20 </u>In the present case, change from a dihydropyridine class L-type CCB (amlodipine), which caused gingival enlargement, to another CCB of the same class L-/R-/T-type CCB (benidipine), for which no association with severe enlargement was reported, along with initial periodontal therapy, significantly improved gingival enlargement. Periodontal variables, particularly dental plaque and gingival inflammation, are also important risk factors for CCB-induced gingival enlargement. 删除9：<u>21 </u>Therefore, removal of bacterial factors by initial periodontal therapy, such as oral cleaning, scaling and scaling root planing is effective. Interestingly, even in the edentulous area of the maxilla, which is less susceptible to dental plaque, the gingival enlargement findings disappeared after this drug change. The involvement of lymphocytes expressing delayed rectifier K <sup>+ </sup> channels (Kv1.3) has also been demonstrated in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. It has been reported that benidipine effectively suppresses lymphocytes Kv1.3. 删除9：<u>22 </u>Thus, benidipine may contribute to the improvement of inflammation. Therefore, benidipine itself may have contributed to the improvement of inflammation and to the improvement of gingival enlargement in edentulous areas. Future studies are expected in this regard.\n\n【35】Based on these findings, for gingival enlargement caused by CCBs, a change from CCBs to other antihypertensive agents should be considered prior to periodontal treatment. In particular, for those with reduced hand dexterity in oral cleaning and reduced awareness of plaque control (eg, the elderly), changing medications may be a useful option for treating gingival enlargement. In addition, for patients who have difficulty changing from one CCB to another antihypertensive drug, for example, those who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure or those who take multiple drugs, changing to another CCB that is less likely to cause gingival enlargement is recommended. Benidipine could also be a candidate as the CCB after a drug change. Furthermore, oral examination of gingival enlargement and regular dental examinations are recommended for patients taking CCBs. Although improvement was observed in this patient, it is unclear and controversial whether switching CCBs will improve other cases of CCB-induced gingival enlargement. Therefore, further investigation and case reports about CCB-induced gingival enlargements are needed.\n\n【36】### Learning points\n\n【37】*   Oral examination of gingival enlargement and regular dental examinations are recommended for patients taking calcium channel blockers (CCBs).\n\n【38】*   Most CCBs that have been reported to be associated with gingival enlargement are long lasting-type CCBs.\n\n【39】*   It is recommended for patients with CCB-induced gingival enlargement to switch from CCBs to other types of antihypertensive drugs or to a different CCB that has little to low incidence of gingival enlargement prior to periodontal therapy.\n\n【40】*   For those with reduced hand dexterity in oral cleaning and reduced awareness of plaque control (eg, the elderly), changing medications may be a useful option for treating gingival enlargement.\n\n【41】*   In particular, if it is difficult to change to another CCB, such as for patients who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure or who are taking multiple medications, it may be advisable to change to another CCB of the same class that has not been reported to cause gingival enlargement.\n\n【42】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【43】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【44】Consent obtained from next of kin.\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to express their sincere thanks to Dr Koide M, who is with the Division of Hard Tissue Research, Institute for Oral Science, Matsumoto Dental University, Japan, for critical reading of the manuscript and fruitful discussion.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:30:03", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:30:23", "cost": 20.177}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:26", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:30:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:30:03"}

The dental surgeon observed the coagulation profile and found an increased prothrombin time (PT) of 16.7 s (range 9–14 s) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 44.2 s (range 27–39 s). Both PT and APTT were performed on STA R Max3 (Diagnostica Stago France) automated coagulation analyser using citrate vials \\[BD Vacutainer plastic citrate tubes of 2.7 mL (0.109 M, 3.2% buffered sodium citrate)\\] with STA-NeoPTimal reagent for PT and STA -Cephascreen for APTT. Suspecting a clotting abnormality, the patient was referred to a specialised coagulation laboratory for further evaluation. There was neither a previous bleeding episode nor any bleeding disorder in his family. Complete blood count showed haemoglobin of 18.7 g/L, haematocrit of 56.3%, red blood cell (RBC) count of 6.75×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, white cell of 10.8×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and platelet count of 375×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. The haematocrit and RBC counts were elevated for age and gender. On further enquiry, the patient’s personal history was significant for chronic cigarette smoking for the last 8 years. The laboratory specialist suspected secondary polycythaemia (smokers’ polycythaemia) behind the abnormal results. The blood sample in the blue top tube confirmed high haematocrit . To maintain an anticoagulant to plasma ratio of 1:9, 0.1 mL of the citrate was removed from the vial and a blood sample was collected afresh in the modified vial. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Repeat tests were within normal limits. The latest results were communicated to the patient and the surgeon. The preanalytical variable of high haematocrit resulted in erroneous clotting results, thereby causing a delay in surgical extraction of the affected tooth.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Two blue-top vials are depicted. The vial on the left shows the index case with high haematocrit while the vial on the right is from a patient with normal haematocrit (kept for comparison).</u>\n\n【7】Despite advances in laboratory instrumentation incorrect or inappropriate test results are occasionally reported to clinicians, most often due to circumstances beyond the control of the laboratories performing the tests. 删除9：<u>2 </u>The term ‘preanalytical phase’ includes all aspects of medical laboratory diagnostic procedure that occurs before the analytical phase. Preanalytical variables can arise at any point before sample testing, including sample collection, handling, transportation, processing and storage. Due to this, it is the most vulnerable part of the total testing process, where most laboratory errors occur. 删除9：<u>3 </u>However, not all factitious test results and laboratory errors necessarily transcribe into significant harm for the patient. Nonetheless, the consequences of incorrect test results might still be clinically worthwhile and lead to several unwanted clinical outcomes or adverse economic consequences, especially in resource-constraint settings. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Blood samples with high haematocrits like those seen in neonates, severe dehydration, burn patients, polycythaemia vera, smokers, high altitude residents may result in factitiously elevated clotting times. This happens as excess citrate in the sample relative to plasma binds to the calcium that is added to the clotting assay via the testing reagent. Calcium, an essential requirement for the clotting process is thus unavailable, hence clotting times are spuriously prolonged. Laboratories may create vacuum tubes with a reduced volume of the anticoagulant to overcome the issue of a high haematocrit. Alternatively, the appropriate citrate may be removed and the tube recapped as was done in this case. 删除9：<u>5 </u>The method used for adjusting citrate concentrations needs to be validated by each laboratory before use.

Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy characterised by proximal muscle weakness, various cutaneous manifestations and molecular evidence of muscle inflammation. Inflammatory arthritis, Raynaud’s phenomenon and the presence of autoantibodies are also common, as was the case with our patient. Several studies have shown that the risk of cancer is greater in patients with dermatomyositis than in those with polymyositis, and the diagnosis of malignancy peaks within the first year after the diagnosis of the myopathy. The exact mechanism of the association between malignancy and inflammatory myopathy, namely dermatomyositis, remains poorly understood. 删除9：<u>3 4 </u>Some studies suggest that this link might be explained by the observation of the expression of common autoantigens between neoplastic cells and damaged muscle tissue in patients with dermatomyositis.\n\n【8】Several types of cancer have been associated with inflammatory myopathy, namely ovarian, cervical, lung, breast, pancreatic, colorectal, gastric, 删除13：<u>5 </u>nasopharyngeal carcinoma 6–8 and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Also, common cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma have been reported in 13 cases to date. 删除9：<u>9 </u>More rarely, laryngeal neoplasia has been described as presenting as polymyositis 10 and dermatomyositis. 删除9：<u>11 </u>The presence of malignancy does not appear to affect the severity of distribution or duration of the weakness, but cancer-associated myositis responds more poorly to treatment compared with myositis in the absence of malignancy. 删除9：<u>12 13</u>\n\n【9】To our knowledge, this is the first case of dermatomyositis associated with vocal fold carcinoma.

The patient denied any recent trauma or neck manipulation. Neurological and ophthalmological examinations were unremarkable. Notably, the patient had no family history, medical history or clinical signs of connective tissue disease, such as joint hypermobility, easy bruising or poor wound healing that might suggest underlying vulnerability to vascular dissection. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (104 mm/hour) and C reactive protein (19.6 mg/L) were markedly elevated. CT angiogram showed tortuosity and ectasia of the cervical internal carotid arteries with septa suggestive of past dissections . Brain MRI was unremarkable. A few months earlier the patient had suffered acute renal failure and was found to have obstructive uropathy due to retroperitoneal fibrosis. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed hypermetabolic soft tissue thickening along the aorta and iliac arteries . MRI showed slight bilateral lacrimal gland enlargement . Serum IgG4 concentration was twice the upper limit of normal. There was no cryoglobulinemia, leucopenia or eosinophilia, and tests for autoantibodies were negative. Biopsy of the retroperitoneal tissue was not pursued as it was considered unsafe. Even in the absence of histopathology, the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) based on the recently revised criteria. 删除9：<u>1 </u>The patient was treated with prednisone for IgG4-RD and aspirin for the carotid dissection with normalisation of the IgG4 levels and no further episodes of vision loss. IgG4-RD is a systemic inflammatory disorder characterised by matted infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and fibrosis in multiple tissues. 删除9：<u>2 </u>The most frequent neurological manifestation is hypertrophic pachymeningitis, and the most common carotid-associated pathology is atherosclerosis, but arteritis is described in up to 30% of patients. We cannot be certain that there had not been prior dissections, but in the absence of a history of trauma, clinical signs of connective tissue disease, evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia in other vessels or other identifiable risk factors for carotid dissection, we suggest that the patient’s arterial dissections are likely a manifestation of IgG4-RD with vasculitis presenting as amaurosis fugax. 删除9：<u>3 4 </u>IgG4-RD is an increasingly recognised disorder with cerebrovascular consequences and thus should be considered among the causes of vasculitis.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Multiplanar reconstruction image of the CT angiogram with coronal (A, B) and axial views at the corresponding dashed lines (C, D, respectively).

He went on to have a CT of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis which confirmed the pulmonary metastases seen on the chest radiograph, and additionally showed splenic deposits, left axillary and hilar lymphadenopathy, but no primary was identified.

A full skin examination seemed warranted. Examination of the back revealed three large plasters, under which three suspicious lesions were identified. The largest was a 6×4 cm diameter fungating, skin-coloured, ulcerated plaque on the left upper back, just medial to the scapula . Of note, there were ill-defined mid-dark brown areas  suggestive of a pigment network. In addition, there were two 2×1.5 cm ulcers with a raised edge on the left lower back and right shoulder. On specific questioning, he described the largest lesion starting as a small brown mark that grew rapidly to its present size over approximately 1 year. It was extremely uncomfortable and he was keen to have it removed, despite declining all other medical therapy. He admitted he was an avid sun worshipper and had never used any sun protection all his life.\n\n【8】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【9】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【10】Fungating erythematous 6×4 cm plaque with irregular foci of mid-dark brown pigmentation, medial to the left scapula.</u>\n\n【11】The lesions were excised and a biopsy taken from the most accessible lymph node in the left axilla.

The patient had a supracondylar knee fracture 4 months ago, and underwent open reduction, internal fixation with condylar screw and plate. Over the past weeks, the patient presented with signs of knee arthroplasty infection, including knee pain, oedema, effusion and increased local temperature. In spite of catecholaminergic therapy, antibiotic therapy (vancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam), fluid resuscitation and intubation, the patient deteriorated and developed multiorgan failure requiring renal replacement therapy. _Staphylococcus aureus_ was isolated from his blood cultures and synovial fluid from an arthrocentesis of the knee joint. The patient underwent surgical removal of the knee prosthesis. However, over the following days, chest Computed Tomography (CT) revealed new multifocal bilateral infiltrates; the patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia from multidrug-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , which was treated with intravenous administration of colistin for 10 days. Repeat chest CT showed development of new extensive bilateral pulmonary nodular infiltrates.\n\n【4】Galactomannan test was positive and PCR in bronchoalveolar lavage detected aspergillosis, so the patient was treated with voriconazole. After 3 weeks, the patient was weaned off of ventilator support to tracheostomy. The patient suddenly developed respiratory distress with severe hypoxaemia and consequent respiratory and cardiac arrest. A video bronchoscopy with disposable bronchoscope (Ambu) revealed large blood clots at the end of the tracheal cannula in the tracheobronchial tree, which could not be removed with flexible instruments. We, therefore, introduced a rigid bronchoscope (Efer Dumon) through the tracheal stoma, because the patient had a marked trisma, and we could not insert it through the mouth. After the removal with forceps of some parts of the clot that occluded the distal portion of the tracheal cannula, we were able to remove a large clot with rigid alligator forceps . In the meantime, the patient underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and after 20 min he returned to spontaneous circulation. The bleeding source was identifiable from the lateral segment of the right lower bronchus, and a Fogarty balloon was inserted for the control of endobronchial bleeding. A part of clot was sent to our laboratory department and was confirmed as an _Aspergillus_ infection. Pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis represents an extensive involvement of the whole tracheobronchial tree, with membranous sloughs containing _Aspergillus_ overlying the mucosa. It generally presents as intraluminal, circumferential pseudomembrane and exudate with only superficial mucosal invasion or as mucus plugs, which may result in airway occlusion, or tracheal bronchooesophageal fatal haemorrhage from bronchoarterial fistula. 删除9：<u>1–3 </u>The patient died after 8 weeks from admission to ICU due to complications related to sepsis.\n\n【5】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【6】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【7】Blood clot removed using rigid bronchoscopy, showing a ‘coral shape’ representing the tracheobronchial tree.</u>\n\n【8】### Learning points\n\n【9】*   In patients receiving prolonged antibacterial treatment, aspergillosis and its complications should be always ruled out.\n\n【10】*   In case of obstruction of the airway, pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis with extensive involvement of the whole tracheobronchial tree should always be taken into consideration.\n\n【11】*   Pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis is a very serious condition, with high mortality and mobility.\n\n【12】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【13】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【14】Obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:46:40", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:47:02", "cost": 22.117}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:25", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:47:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:46:39"}

Safely securing a difficult airway not only requires a high degree of skill, but it often demands a significant amount of time and resources. In procedures requiring lung isolation and single-lung ventilation (SLV), such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), the difficult airway presents a special challenge. SLV is typically accomplished by endobronchial intubation using a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT), or by bronchial blocker (BB) placement through a single-lumen endotracheal tube (SLT). During VATS procedures, a DLT is the preferred method of lung isolation; however, DLT placement can be particularly difficult in the patient with a history of difficult laryngoscopy. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【8】Using video laryngoscopy (VL) for glottic visualisation, we report rapid and safe placement of a 39 French left-sided DLT in a patient with a known history of difficult laryngoscopy using a novel articulating introducer called the Total Control Introducer (TCI); TTCmed.com, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA).\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A 67-year-old man with adenocarcinoma of the right upper lobe presented for VATS and right upper lobectomy. Medical history was remarkable for heavy tobacco use. Airway exam revealed a Mallampati II airway, a thyromental distance >3 cm, adequate mouth opening and normal neck extension. Of note, the patient was taken to the operating room two times on the same day: the first time electively and the second time emergently.\n\n【11】During the elective case, the patient was connected to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors and was preoxygenated with 100% oxygen via face mask connected to a closed circuit. Induction of anaesthesia consisted of intravenous midazolam, fentanyl, lidocaine, propofol and rocuronium. After induction, an oropharyngeal airway was placed, and bag-mask ventilation (BMV) was initiated to deliver oxygen and isoflurane until achieving a train-of-four ratio of 0/4 twitches. The first attempt at laryngoscopy was performed with a Macintosh 3.5 blade and resulted in a Cormack-Lehane (CL) grade IV view. The second attempt at laryngoscopy was performed with a Miller 2 blade yielding a CL Grade III view. At this point, a 39 French left-sided DLT was placed blindly by the attending anaesthesiologist. Correct placement was confirmed via auscultation, capnography and fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB). After the procedure, the patient was successfully extubated and transported to the intensive care unit.\n\n【12】Later that day, the patient returned emergently to the operating room for evacuation of a haemothorax with the on-call anaesthesia team. With the recent history of difficult laryngoscopy, the on-call team decided to manage the patient’s airway with VL and a TCI for left sided DLT placement. After monitor placement and preoxygenation as above, the patient was induced with lidocaine, fentanyl, propofol and rocuronium. After induction of anaesthesia, an oropharyngeal airway was placed, and BMV was initiated to deliver oxygen and isoflurane until a train-of-four ratio of 0/4 twitches was achieved. Laryngoscopy was performed using video laryngoscope (Glidescope; Verathon; Bothel, Washington, USA) with a hyperangulated Macintosh four blade yielding a 100% percentage of glottic opening score. A TCI was guided alongside the laryngoscope under direct visualisation until the tip was visible in the VL field of view. Under indirect visualisation, the tip of the TCI was dynamically navigated through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The TCI handle was removed leaving only the TCI shaft in place. Through the bronchial lumen, a 39 French left-sided DLT was then passed over the TCI through the glottic opening and into the trachea. The TCI shaft was removed and the DLT was gently guided into the left main bronchus. Correct placement was confirmed via auscultation, capnography and FOB. At the end of the procedure, the patient was extubated and returned to the intensive care unit.\n\n【13】Treatment\n---------\n\n【14】See body of text for airway management.\n\n【15】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【16】At the end of the procedure, the patient was extubated and was safely returned to the intensive care unit. The patient had no further complications during his hospital stay and did not require any additional operative management.\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】A DLT is the preferred method for lung isolation during VATS for multiple reasons.

Safely securing a difficult airway not only requires a high degree of skill, but it often demands a significant amount of time and resources. In procedures requiring lung isolation and single-lung ventilation (SLV), such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), the difficult airway presents a special challenge. SLV is typically accomplished by endobronchial intubation using a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT), or by bronchial blocker (BB) placement through a single-lumen endotracheal tube (SLT). During VATS procedures, a DLT is the preferred method of lung isolation; however, DLT placement can be particularly difficult in the patient with a history of difficult laryngoscopy. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【8】Using video laryngoscopy (VL) for glottic visualisation, we report rapid and safe placement of a 39 French left-sided DLT in a patient with a known history of difficult laryngoscopy using a novel articulating introducer called the Total Control Introducer (TCI); TTCmed.com, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA).\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A 67-year-old man with adenocarcinoma of the right upper lobe presented for VATS and right upper lobectomy. Medical history was remarkable for heavy tobacco use. Airway exam revealed a Mallampati II airway, a thyromental distance >3 cm, adequate mouth opening and normal neck extension. Of note, the patient was taken to the operating room two times on the same day: the first time electively and the second time emergently.\n\n【11】During the elective case, the patient was connected to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors and was preoxygenated with 100% oxygen via face mask connected to a closed circuit. Induction of anaesthesia consisted of intravenous midazolam, fentanyl, lidocaine, propofol and rocuronium. After induction, an oropharyngeal airway was placed, and bag-mask ventilation (BMV) was initiated to deliver oxygen and isoflurane until achieving a train-of-four ratio of 0/4 twitches. The first attempt at laryngoscopy was performed with a Macintosh 3.5 blade and resulted in a Cormack-Lehane (CL) grade IV view. The second attempt at laryngoscopy was performed with a Miller 2 blade yielding a CL Grade III view. At this point, a 39 French left-sided DLT was placed blindly by the attending anaesthesiologist. Correct placement was confirmed via auscultation, capnography and fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB). After the procedure, the patient was successfully extubated and transported to the intensive care unit.\n\n【12】Later that day, the patient returned emergently to the operating room for evacuation of a haemothorax with the on-call anaesthesia team. With the recent history of difficult laryngoscopy, the on-call team decided to manage the patient’s airway with VL and a TCI for left sided DLT placement. After monitor placement and preoxygenation as above, the patient was induced with lidocaine, fentanyl, propofol and rocuronium. After induction of anaesthesia, an oropharyngeal airway was placed, and BMV was initiated to deliver oxygen and isoflurane until a train-of-four ratio of 0/4 twitches was achieved. Laryngoscopy was performed using video laryngoscope (Glidescope; Verathon; Bothel, Washington, USA) with a hyperangulated Macintosh four blade yielding a 100% percentage of glottic opening score. A TCI was guided alongside the laryngoscope under direct visualisation until the tip was visible in the VL field of view. Under indirect visualisation, the tip of the TCI was dynamically navigated through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The TCI handle was removed leaving only the TCI shaft in place. Through the bronchial lumen, a 39 French left-sided DLT was then passed over the TCI through the glottic opening and into the trachea. The TCI shaft was removed and the DLT was gently guided into the left main bronchus. Correct placement was confirmed via auscultation, capnography and FOB. At the end of the procedure, the patient was extubated and returned to the intensive care unit.\n\n【13】Treatment\n---------\n\n【14】See body of text for airway management.\n\n【15】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【16】At the end of the procedure, the patient was extubated and was safely returned to the intensive care unit. The patient had no further complications during his hospital stay and did not require any additional operative management.\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】A DLT is the preferred method for lung isolation during VATS for multiple reasons.

Later that afternoon, a red streak extending from the initial inflammatory papule gradually toward the dorsum of the right hand, wrist and forearm  appeared, prompting a visit to our clinic on the same day. The linear eruption was itchy but painless. He was receiving no medication, and his medical history was unremarkable. On examination, he was in excellent, general condition; he had no fever or lymphadenopathy. The tenderness was limited to the papule. Based on the patient’s history and physical examination findings, superficial lymphangitis resulting from an arthropod bite was clinically diagnosed. He was treated with a topical steroid, but the rash deteriorated by the follow-up examination on the next day . Oral antihistamine was added to the treatment. The rash and other symptoms improved significantly by day 3 after the initial visit  and resolved by day 4.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】(A) Painful, erythematous papule on the right index finger suggestive of an arthropod bite.

He was the eighth of ten siblings and had a remarkable family history for heart diseases: his mother, oldest brother and seventh oldest sister had died of heart failure. Physical examination revealed a mild peripheral oedema without any murmur or crackles. He denied any muscle pain. An ECG revealed a sinus rhythm with low voltage complexes and a pseudoinfarct pattern. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly without pleural effusion. His echocardiogram indicated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 42%, thickening of the ventricular walls and an impaired diastolic function. Laboratory findings showed an elevation of creatine kinase (CK) of 823 U/L (normal, 删除9：<u>59–248 </u>U/L), CK-MB of 9.5 ng/mL (normal, <5.2 ng/mL), troponin I of 55.4 pg/mL (normal, <34.2 pg/mL) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of 1162 pg/mL (normal, <125 pg/mL). Of note, his CK level 1 year prior to this visit had also been elevated (402 U/L). Further investigation of electrophoresis of CK isoenzyme revealed a macro-CK type 1 . Coronary angiography showed no significant stenoses in the coronary vessels. Blood and urinary immunoelectrophoresis analyses and a serum nephelometric assay of the light chain were all negative. However, <sup>99m </sup> Tc-pyrophosphate (PYP) scintigraphy demonstrated diffuse intense <sup>99m </sup> Tc-PYP uptake in the heart.

They are known for their good prognostic factors as they typically present with smaller lesions, are of lower nuclear grade and have lower risk of recurrence and metastasis. Peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignant ascites are uncommon in RCC. They might be attributed to direct tumour extension or metastasis via haematogenous spread or tumour seeding from prior surgical resection. 删除9：<u>1–3</u>\n\n【8】We report a case of symptomatic malignant ascites with evident peritoneal nodules diagnosed 5 months following a laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for a Bosniak IV malignant cystic renal mass, later identified as pT2, Fuhrman grade 2, type 1 papillary RCC (pRCC).\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A 69-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of worsening generalised abdominal pain, abdominal distension and loss of appetite. His clinical examination indicated the presence of ascites associated with generalised mild abdominal tenderness. He was haemodynamically stable with no evidence of systemic infection. There were no features suggestive of peritonism.\n\n【11】This presentation occurred 5 months following a laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy for an 80 mm contrast-enhancing, Bosniak IV left lower pole cystic renal mass. The procedure was performed via a transperitoneal approach, with care taken to avoid spillage by first aspirating the cystic content, which was sent for cytological analysis. Gauze was then used over the ruptured portion of the cyst to further minimise spillage during dissection until the specimen was bagged and delivered through a separate left abdominal incision. The renal bed was then irrigated with distilled water. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged the following day.\n\n【12】Histopathology of the specimen showed a pT2 Nx type 1 pRCC, nuclear grade 2, with the greatest tumour dimension of 80 mm . Necrotic features were evident. Negative surgical margin was achieved, and all tumours were shown to be confined within the renal capsule without lymphovascular invasion. There was no evidence of rhabdoid or sarcomatoid differentiation. The cytology from the aspirated cystic content showed no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【15】(A–B) Histopathology sections with H&E stain showing invasive carcinoma of predominantly papillary architecture (×200).

Repeat ultrasound (US) prior to discharge from inpatient services showed marked interval reduction of the ascites volume.\n\n【28】He was subsequently reviewed by the Medical Oncology team, which commenced on 20 mg daily dose of cabozantinib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. He initially reported good improvement in his abdominal pain symptoms within 1 month of therapy commencement. This improvement was further supported by a repeat staging CT of the brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis, showing stable peritoneal and pulmonary nodules and resolution of ascites and pleural effusion. There was no evidence of other metastatic foci on CT and whole-body bone scan.\n\n【29】Shortly following a trial of higher dosage, the patient developed multiple symptoms, including chest pain, abdominal pain, heartburn and swelling on his hands and feet, prompting subsequent decision for dose reduction. He subsequently developed recurrence of malignant ascites, occurring 5 months after his presentation to the emergency department, which was managed with regular paracentesis due to reaccumulation.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】RCCs are the most frequently encountered primary malignancy of the kidney. They refer to a group of cancers originating from the renal epithelial cells, which may arise either sporadically or as a familial disease. They can be categorised into different histological subtypes, with clear cell RCC (ccRCC) as the most common, followed by pRCC, chromophobe, oncocytoma, collecting duct and not otherwise specified (NOS). 删除9：<u>4 </u>Most RCC cases are diagnosed incidentally as either solid or cystic mass through radiological imaging modalities, such as US, CT or MRI. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Despite mostly present in the form of solid mass, approximately 1%–14% may have cystic components. More commonly known as cRCC, they are the leading cause of malignant cystic lesions in the kidney. 删除9：<u>5–7 </u>They can manifest as intrinsic unilocular cysts, intrinsic multilocular cysts, cysts with necrotic features and unilocular cysts originating from existing mural tumours. 删除9：<u>6 7 </u>Most of the different RCC histological subtypes can present as these complex cysts. but among which ccRCCs and pRCCs are the two most common. 删除9：<u>8–10</u>\n\n【32】cRCCs are known to confer good prognosis, especially following surgical resection, as they typically present with smaller tumour size and of lower stage and grade. 删除9：<u>8–11 </u>Winters _et al_ demonstrated these through a retrospective study comparing 678 cRCCs with 46 677 solid ccRCCs, where cRCCs were reported to be significantly smaller (mean size of 38 mm for cRCC vs 45 mm for solid ccRCC, p<0.001), of lower stage (pT1a 66% for cRCC vs 55% for solid ccRCC, p<0.001) and more commonly well differentiated (33% for cRCC vs 16% for solid ccRCC, p<0.001). Winters _et al_ also highlighted those with cystic necrosis, such as demonstrated in our patient, to have lower 4-year survival of 80% compared with 100% without necrotic features. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【33】The characterisation of cystic renal lesion relies on the Bosniak Classification, which provided means to stratify malignancy risks based on a multitude of radiological features, including the appearance of cyst wall, cystic content, septation, calcifications and contrast enhancement. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Bosniak IIF, III and IV lesions are more likely to be cancerous, each with malignancy risks of 5%–38%, 40%–70% and 90%–91%, respectively. 删除9：<u>8–10 </u>The latter two were more often referred for surgical management as, in addition to the risk of being malignant, higher Bosniak categories were known to be associated with raised likelihood of pT3–4 tumours (IIF 0% vs III 3.5% vs IV 15.6%, p=0.04) and of the higher nuclear grade 3–4 tumours (IIF 0% vs III 12% vs IV 36%, p<0.001), as demonstrated by Nouhaud _et al_ and Boissier _et al_ , respectively. 删除9：<u>8 9 </u>Bosniak categories, however, were not associated with increased incidence of recurrence or differences in the 5-year recurrence-free survival (IIF 82% vs III 92% vs IV 92%, p=0.60). 删除9：<u>8–10</u>\n\n【34】The recurrence rate of malignant cystic renal lesions following surgical resection, including those presenting as locoregional recurrence or distant metastases, is relatively low, ranging between 1.1% and 8.6%. 删除9：<u>8–10 </u>More common metastatic sites include retroperitoneal lymph nodes, lung, liver, bone and brain. Peritoneal involvement in RCC, which can lead to malignant ascites, as observed in our case was relatively uncommon, only affecting 1% of the population. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Nevertheless, the incidence of malignant ascites appeared to be higher in pRCC, compared with other histological subtypes of RCC, even in the absence of other distant metastatic sites. These were demonstrated by Sidana _et al_ , who found malignant ascites in 20% of their 100 patients with pRCC. Of the 20 patients with ascites, distant metastatic sites at the time of diagnosis were identified in 30% with no significant differences compared with 24.1% patients without ascites (p=0.609). More importantly, malignant ascites was recognised as a poor prognostic indicator with significantly reduced median overall survival in those affected (25 months in patients with ascites vs 42.5 months in patients without ascites, p=0.041). 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【35】The relatively high prevalence of malignant ascites reported by Sidana _et al_ may be surprising given the limited number of prior publications for evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis and/or malignant ascites attributed to RCC. Based on previous reports, peritoneal carcinomatosis, with or without ascites, can be associated with ccRCC, pRCC and NOS histological subtypes. 删除9：<u>2 12–18 </u>As reported by Sidana _et al_ , ascites may develop up to 73 months following the initial RCC diagnosis with a median time of 16 months. 删除9：<u>1 </u>As reflected in table 1 , peritoneal carcinomatosis may also be identified before or after primary tumour resection. 删除9：<u>2 12–18 </u>Ploumidis _et al_ identified a 5 mm omental nodule 24 months after a transperitoneal robot-assisted radical nephrectomy for a Fuhrman grade 1, pT2 pRCC. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Pandey _et al_ reported a case of multiple peritoneal nodules at the ileocolic junction diagnosed on exploratory laparotomy for right iliac fossa pain 6 months after radical nephrectomy. 删除9：<u>13 </u>Similar to our patient, the two postoperative peritoneal carcinomatosis cases were diagnosed together with other potential distant metastatic foci, with ours being the subpleural apical nodule. 删除9：<u>12 13</u>\n\n【36】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【37】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【38】Previously published case reports of peritoneal carcinomatosis secondary to different histological subtypes of RCC, with or without malignant ascites</u>\n\n【39】In terms of pathophysiology, it was postulated that peritoneal carcinomatosis in RCC might be secondary to either direct tumour extension outside of the renal capsule and Gerota’s fascia, or an embolic haematogenous metastatic event into the omentum, mesentery and peritoneum. 删除9：<u>1 2 14 </u>However, considering the possibility of the disease to manifest in the setting of smaller, low-stage and low-grade primary tumours, such as the Fuhrman grade 2, pT2 pRCC lesion in our case and the grade 1, pT2a pRCC lesion reported by Ploumidis _et al,_ 12 the latter hypothesis might be more likely. Certain general factors can contribute to tumour recurrence, which can be differentiated into tumour-related factors, local wound and patient’s immune response, as well as surgical approach and perioperative complications. 删除9：<u>19 </u>Through their multivariate analysis, Boissier _et al_ identified Fuhrman grade 4 tumours and patient’s general status at the time of surgery in the form of their American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) score to be prognostic factors for recurrence. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【40】Regarding surgical approach, the cystic nature of cRCC should necessitate caution to minimise the risk of perioperative cyst rupture, which may lead to consequent seeding. This is more relevant for cRCC, for the smaller, well-localised and well-differentiated tumours often prompt clinicians to consider less invasive approaches, in the likes of laparoscopic and/or nephron-sparing surgeries. Chen _et al_ identified that factors such as greater endophytic properties of the tumour, closer proximity to renal collecting system, Bosniak III lesions and surgeon’s experience correlate with risk of intraoperative cyst rupture. 删除9：<u>3 </u>However, despite the risk, the incidence of tumour seeding following urological laparoscopic surgery is relatively low, ranging between 0.1% and 4%, 删除13：<u>19 </u>and the cyst rupture may not necessarily cause tumour seeding and subsequent recurrence. In a study involving 268 partial nephrectomy patients with 18.7% incidence of cyst rupture, Pradere _et al_ found no evidence of recurrence or peritoneal carcinomatosis and port-site metastasis up to 100 months postoperatively. 删除9：<u>20 </u>A prior study by Spaliviero _et al_ involving 284 laparoscopic partial nephrectomy cases echoed a similar phenomenon, whereby only one retroperitoneal recurrence was reported 14 months postoperatively despite the negative margins and absence of intraoperative cyst rupture in all cases. 删除9：<u>21 </u>The study by Chen _et al_ also highlighted that only four of nine patients with recurrence were reported to have cyst rupture, and no association can be derived between cyst rupture with the site of recurrence (p=1.00). 删除9：<u>3 </u>Our case was an example of recurrence presenting as peritoneal carcinomatosis following a laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in the setting of negative cytology from the aspirated cystic content intraoperatively without any involvement of the renal bed or retroperitoneal lymph node. One potential explanation can be that tumour recurrence is more associated with the aggressiveness of the primary malignancy rather than intraoperative cyst rupture, as the malignant component of cystic tumours is usually more limited to its solid portion. 删除9：<u>20</u>\n\n【41】### Learning points\n\n【42】*   Peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignant ascites, although being uncommon in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), are important to recognise as it may indicate poor prognosis.\n\n【43】*   Recurrence of cystic RCC may occur following surgical resections, even in those of lower stage and lower nuclear grade primary tumours.\n\n【44】*   High incidence of intraoperative cyst rupture in malignant cystic renal lesions does not always translate to tumour seeding, but appropriate perioperative planning and intraoperative measures still need to be applied to minimise the risks.\n\n【45】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【46】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【47】Obtained.\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Dr Benjamin Popp, Anatomical Pathologist, Dorevitch Pathology Footscray Hospital.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:29:45", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:31:10", "cost": 84.643}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:25", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:31:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:29:45"}

The cap and the safety tab of the applicator were removed and loaded with the implant. Applicator was injected in vitreous cavity 3.5 mm from the limbus in the inferonasal quadrant at an angle of 45° with respect to the scleral surface. The actuator button was pressed and an audible click was heard. During the withdrawal of the applicator, it was realised that the implant was partly inside the scleral tunnel and partly in the subconjunctival space (broken into three pieces). A limited conjunctival peritomy was done to remove the implant segments from the subconjunctival space . Part of the implant stuck within the scleral tunnel was held with fine-toothed forceps and gently removed . The entry site and vitreous were inspected for any other implant residues, but none were found. Since we had completely removed all the broken pieces of the implant, a new applicator was used to deliver another dexamethasone implant at a different site. On a follow-up of 6 months, no adverse effect was noted and the intraocular pressure was within the normal limit at every visit.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】(A) External photograph of the left eye (taken intraoperatively) showing retained pieces of Ozurdex implant (blue arrow) in the subconjunctival space after localised conjunctival peritomy.

Fenolland _et al_ reported a case of inadvertent delivery of the Ozurdex implant into subconjunctival space, which was left as such. 删除9：<u>1 </u>They decided not to remove the broken implants. We chose to explore as we were not sure of the location of the implant and felt that the intrascleral fragments might not elicit a desired therapeutic response. Accidental intralenticular injection of implant has been reported previously by Chhabra _et al_ requiring cataract surgery after 3 months. 删除9：<u>2 </u>In another study, the dexamethasone implant was stuck intrasclerally which was mechanically pushed into the vitreous cavity. 删除9：<u>3 </u>In our patient, we did not push the intrascleral fragment because of the fear of crushing it within the scleral tunnel. The safety profile of intravitreal dexamethasone has been reported to be reasonably good, so we decided to inject one more dexamethasone implant in the same sitting and the lack of adverse effects on follow-up further justifies our management approach. 删除9：<u>4 </u>The patient responded well to the new implant, with a reduction in macular thickness and improvement in best-corrected visual acuity to 20/30 at 6 weeks postinjection. The present case acknowledges a rare possibility of Ozurdex implant being delivered at an unexpected location, the probable reasons and steps to avoid it. Finally, the authors suggest their technique to tackle it, in case such an event happens.\n\n【11】### Patients’s perspective\n\n【12】I am thankful to the treating physician for explaining the potential complications of a dexamethasone implant. I was relieved when they explained to me that they had removed the broken implant pieces and injected another implant safely. My eye was red for around 1 week postoperatively, which gradually recovered. My vision is gradually recovering, and I am aware of future complications of this implant but currently not facing any trouble.\n\n【13】### Learning points\n\n【14】We suggest the following measures to avoid the Ozurdex implant being delivered at an unexpected site:\n\n【15】*   Smaller intrascleral tunnel and visualisation of the tip of the applicator in the vitreous cavity before delivering the implant.\n\n【16】*   Ensure that the actuator button is completely pressed and is locked flush with the applicator before withdrawal.\n\n【17】*   Hear the audible click clearly after pressing the actuator button, wait a while and visualise the implant going into the vitreous if feasible (might not be possible always depending on the direction of the injector/applicator).\n\n【18】*   Document and inform the manufacturer for quality control and random check whether the implant gets delivered completely after pressing the applicator key.\n\n【19】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【20】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【21】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:36:29", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:38:05", "cost": 96.289}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:25", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:38:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:36:29"}

Laboratory parameters revealed anaemia with haemoglobin of 80 g/L (120–160 g/L), total leucocyte count of 5.5×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (4–11×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), platelet count of 212×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (150–450×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), serum creatinine of 70 µmol/L (44–132 µmol/L), serum albumin of 34 g/L (34–54 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase of 355 U/L (normal range 120–220 U/L) and uric acid of 327 µmol/L (89–475 µmol/L). Peripheral blood examination showed neutrophils of 80% with normocytic normochromic anaemia. Unspun urinalysis revealed 1+albumin in dipstick and 2–3 pus cells/high power field with sterile urine culture (significant pyuria). CT of abdomen revealed bilateral symmetrical homogeneous enlarged kidneys measuring 15 cm each without any focal lesion, no dilatation of pelvicalyceal system and decreased contrast perfusion along with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly . For evaluation of renomegaly with a possibility of an infiltrative disease, the patient underwent a kidney biopsy. The biopsy revealed sheets of atypical lymphoid cells replacing the entire renal parenchyma with size of around three times that of mature lymphocyte along with coarse chromatin and high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. Direct immunofluorescence was negative for immunoglobulins and complements. The patient subsequently underwent a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry. It revealed hypercellular marrow with sheets of blasts replacing the granulocytic and erythroid elements . On flow cytometry, these blasts were positive for CD19 and CD20 (marker of B lymphocyte), CD5 and CD13 (myeloid lineage marker), CD33 (myeloid marker), CD34 (marker of blast) and myeloperoxidase (MPO myeloid marker) ; suggestive of Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukaemia (MPAL-mixed myeloid/B cell) with renal infiltration. Remaining work up including echocardiography, funduscopy and cerebrospinal fluid examination for malignant cells were unremarkable. The patient was started on hydration and induction chemotherapy with Modified BFM-95 (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) protocol comprising of prednisolone, daunorubicin, vincristine along with intrathecal methotrexate. He did not develop tumour lysis syndrome or renal impairment. Unfortunately, the patient developed a massive middle cerebral artery infarct and expired few weeks after discharge from hospital.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】CT of the abdomen showing bilateral homogeneous enlarged kidneys with smooth outline and NO pelvicalyceal system dilatation.</u>\n\n【7】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【8】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【9】(A) and (B) Bone marrow aspirate smear showing sheets of blasts (May-Grunwald Giemsa stain, magnification 200× and 1000×, respectively).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first adult case reported in literature. The differentials for acquired bilateral nephromegaly in adults include HIV nephropathy, obstructive uropathy, kidney tumours, myelofibrosis with extramedullary hematopoiesis and rarely haematological malignancies like leukaemias/lymphoma infiltration. The most common site of extramedullary involvement in leukaemias are liver, spleen, lymph nodes and skin. Kidneys are a uncommon site for extramedullary dissemination of leukaemias and presentation with bilateral palpable renal masses is very rare. Although leukaemias usually have high total leucocyte counts at presentation, cases of acute leukaemias with nephromegaly and normal counts have been documented. 删除9：<u>2 </u>The most common imaging finding in renal leukaemic involvement is the presence of focal parenchymal abnormalities with multiple bilateral masses.

Since various conventional treatment for more than 6 months failed to alleviate my pain, an epidural procedure was suggested, which I accepted having full trust on the pain unit team. During two and half months, I had a catheter ‘in my spine’ with a pump with medication that completely relieved my pain.

However, the originality of the article is based on the specific context in which the protocoled technique is performed.\n\n【64】*   Despite the legitimate concern of healthcare professionals regarding the performance of invasive techniques in an outpatient setting, one should underline the capacity of this treatment to exponentially reduce the doses of systemic opioids and adjuvant analgesics, minimising side effects and risk of addiction while improving the patient’s quality of life.\n\n【65】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【66】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【67】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "index": 950, "show": true, "start": 950, "end": 2122, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【7】, 删除13：14 mg"}], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:21:55", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:27:23", "cost": 328.022}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:25", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:27:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:21:55"}

The patient was followed up 3 months later, where the previously described dermoscopic changes had resolved. This confirmed the dermoscopic changes to the melanocytic lesion were due to IPL and not a developing melanoma.\n\n【9】In comparison with the single wavelength emitted by lasers, IPL delivers many wavelengths of energy. Hair epilation devices act via selective photothermolysis and target melanin as the chromophore. 删除9：<u>2 </u>They take advantage of the higher density of melanocytes and larger melanosomes in the hair follicle to preferentially remove hair. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【10】Melanocytic naevi with junctional nests of heavily melanised melanocytes may also absorb energy emitted from hair epilation devices, leading to damage of melanosomes and the surrounding cells, as well as the stromal matrix. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Dermoscopic features of affected melanocytic naevi include heterogeneously sized globules, superficial blotches of brown pigment and loss of pigment network. 删除9：<u>3–5 </u>Through confocal microscopy, Yamashita _et al_ demonstrated that IPL photothermolysis of melanocytic lesions caused denaturation of melanin caps-containing cells and increased keratinocyte differentiation. 删除9：<u>6 </u>The clinically evident blotches of brown pigment are ‘microcaps’, consisting of cellular debris admixed with melanosomes and necrotic keratinocytes, which have risen to the epidermis. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Interestingly our patient only had two of the twenty monitored melanocytic naevi demonstrate dermoscopic change from photoepilation. We theorise this is due to the different energy settings used to target hair on the legs and back compared with the upper limbs and abdomen.\n\n【11】The described dermoscopic changes to melanocytic naevi from hair epilation devices may be concerning for melanoma, especially in an individual at high risk of melanoma, and therefore bring about the need for a biopsy. 删除9：<u>1 8 </u>In the context of treatment-modified melanocytic naevi, this has been termed pseudomelanoma due to their similarities on histological examination. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Complicating this however, are reports in the literature where malignant melanoma was diagnosed after laser treatment of presumed benign naevi, although it is likely that these lesions were initially misdiagnosed. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【12】A thorough history is integral in a dermatological consultation to elicit pertinent and important information to help differentiate diagnoses.

Systemically, blood pressure was checked and a peripheral neurological examination was done to look for any peripheral nerve thickening or sensation loss. Thereafter, ECG and blood investigations for complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, thyroid and parathyroid hormone profile were performed. ECG suggested arterioventricular block and atrial arrhythmia. These changes have been described in literature to be associated with cardiac amyloidosis for which he was advised consultation in the Department of Cardiology. 删除9：<u>1 </u>All other tests were within normal limits, thus ruling out multiple endocrine neoplasia, Refsum’s disease, leprosy, neurofibromatosis, Riley-Day syndrome, lipoid proteinosis and ichthyosis.\n\n【14】Considering the corneal perineural substance deposition and ECG changes, corneal neural amyloidosis was assumed to be the primary pathology. The patient did not give consent for biopsy in view of satisfactory visual acuity. He was managed conservatively with lubricants, given refractive correction and counselled for the need of corneal transplantation in future.\n\n【15】The corneas are specialised tissue innervated by long ciliary nerves, sub-branch of the trigeminal nerve with neural plexuses at various levels.

Thickened or prominent corneal nerves are early hallmarks of important systemic diseases. Observing them and investigating the aetiology may be life-saving in certain conditions.\n\n【17】Lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD) type IV may present with absent or polymorphic amyloidosis. Age and mutation determine the phenotypic appearance. In some cases, there might not be any lattice lines or only a subepithelial ground-glass haze on the central or inferior cornea. Some may also present as prominent corneal nerves with amyloid wrapped around them. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Zhu _et al_ 4 have described it as a neurotropic phenomenon in LCD where in vivo confocal microscopy provided a rapid, non-invasive way to observe the perineural amyloid deposition.

Early detection of thyroid storm is the key to decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. We present a rare case of thyroid storm induced by combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab in a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because of prominent hyperthyroidism with gastrointestinal symptoms and signs of heart failure, the patient was diagnosed with thyroid storm 3 weeks after initiating this combination immunotherapy. The patient had no history of thyroid disease but was positive for antithyroid antibodies. This case report suggests that thyroid function and symptoms of suspected thyroid storm should be evaluated routinely within 3 weeks from the initiation of therapy when combination therapy is administered in patients with NSCLC positive for antithyroid antibodies.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   Endocrine system\n*   Thyroid disease\n*   Lung cancer (oncology)\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

The ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody acting against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte 4 (CTLA-4), and nivolumab is a human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody. Combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab has demonstrated consistent efficacy in patients with advanced NSCLC. However, the incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including endocrine disorders such as pituitary and thyroid dysfunctions, has been an important issue with ICI treatment. The nivolumab and ipilimumab have notably similar irAE incidence rates. An increase in irAE incidence rate is observed when these drugs are administered in combination. According to a systematic review, the incidence rate of hyperthyroidism was observed to be 8% (34/407) in patients with advanced solid tumours. 删除9：<u>1 </u>According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V.5.0, the severity of thyroid dysfunction is low, 删除13：<u>2 </u>and there has been only one reported case of thyroid storm in a patient with advanced melanoma induced by combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【8】A previous study suggested that the risk of thyroid dysfunction induced by anti-PD-1 therapy can be increased in patients positive for antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) and/or antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) before treatment. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【9】We have reported a rare case of thyroid storm in a patient with advanced NSCLC receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】The patient was a woman in her 70s with advanced NSCLC. The chief complaints were dyspnoea on exertion and left-sided chest pain. Chest CT revealed a mass lesion in the left upper lung, and a bronchoscopy was performed. Based on the results of positron emission tomography-CT and contrast-enhanced MRI of the head, the patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, cT4N3M0, stage IIIC; genetic testing revealed no driver gene mutations, and the programmed death ligand-1 expression rate (22c3) was less than 1%. The patient’s Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) was 1. She was admitted to our hospital and combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab was initiated. Although the patient was positive for TgAb before chemotherapy, all other thyroid function test results were normal. She was asymptomatic and had never been diagnosed with thyroid goitre. After initial treatment, nausea (grade 1) and sinus tachycardia (grade 1) were observed on days 5 and 10, respectively. The treatment course was otherwise uneventful, and the second course of nivolumab was administered on day 21 after the initiation of treatment. The patient’s general condition was stable, and she was discharged 24 days after treatment initiation. However, on the day after discharge, she was rushed to the emergency room because of dyspnoea, nausea and cold sweats. The patient was tachycardic at 131 beats per minute and agitated, with symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Her blood pressure was 103/74 mm Hg, and her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15. Most notably, no thyromegaly, exophthalmos,or thyroid tenderness were appreciable on physical examination. The Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS) score was 50. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for thyroid storm management after endocrinology and cardiology consultation.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】The initial complete blood count was normal, but the C reactive protein level was slightly high. Blood cultures were found to be negative after 48 hours. An echocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, and the N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide levels were also high. The patient’s thyroid function test results on the day of presentation were as follows: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 0.01 μIU/mL; free thyroxine (FT4), 7.2 ng/dL; and free triiodothyronine (FT3), 16.0 pg/mL 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>.\n\n【14】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【15】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 1\n\n【16】Summary of laboratory test results taken before chemotherapy and on admission</u>\n\n【17】Her thyroid function test results prior to initial combination treatment were as follows: TSH, 1.51 μIU/mL; FT4, 1.3 ng/dL; and FT3, 3.3 pg/mL. However, her thyroid peroxidase immunoglobulin levels were normal, and TgAbs were positive at 106 IU/mL 删除10：<u>( table 1 )</u>. Chest radiography revealed a new left pleural effusion.\n\n【18】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【19】The patient exhibited several signs and symptoms of thyroid storm based on the BWPS diagnostic criteria for thyroid storm, including agitation, nausea with vomiting, tachycardia, fever and history of nivolumab and ipilimumab treatment. Differential diagnoses included medication-induced thyroid storm, Graves’ disease, thyroiditis, thyroid adenoma, toxic multinodular goitre and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. We considered Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s disease to be less likely based on the negative results for thyrotropin receptor autoantibodies and TPOAb. The chest CT scan showed neither adenoma nor goitre before chemotherapy. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis was an immune-mediated thyroid storm. The clinical course of the thyroid function tests before and after the initially combined immunotherapy supported this diagnosis .\n\n【20】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【21】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【22】Changes in thyroid function tests over the course of treatment. Day 25 represents the day from initiation of chemotherapy. FT4, free thyroxine; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone.</u>\n\n【23】Treatment\n---------\n\n【24】The patient was admitted to the ICU for a thyroid storm and was initiated on propranolol (20 mg per day) and landiolol (750 mg per day) to achieve appropriate control of her heart rate. Hydrocortisone (100 mg every 8 hour) and potassium iodide (200 mg per day) were also administered. Antithyroid drugs were not administered because anti-TSH receptor antibodies were negative and the cause of the thyroid storm was considered to be drug-induced destructive thyroiditis. 删除9：<u>5 </u>On day 2, she was febrile up to 40°C and exhibited signs of heart failure, therefore, she was initiated on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. On day 3, her general condition worsened, resulting in a further decline in cardiac function and circulatory failure despite treatment; therefore, norepinephrine therapy was started, and respiratory management was switched to invasive positive pressure ventilation. As acute renal failure was also observed, continuous haemodiafiltration was initiated to prevent her clinical condition from worsening. As a result of continued intensive management, thyroid function gradually recovered, and cardiac function improved accordingly. As her respiratory condition stabilised, she was extubated 9 days after intubation. The patient’s thyroid function improved over time and remained within the normal range; thus, thyroid medication was not administered.\n\n【25】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【26】After discharge from the ICU, rehabilitation was initiated to improve activities of daily living. However, her ECOG PS only improved by 3, and chemotherapy for NSCLC was terminated. She was discharged on day 40 after admission, and palliative care was continued at home.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】This case report is an example of a nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy-induced immune-mediated thyroid storm, which occurred within 3 weeks of treatment initiation. The clinical diagnosis of thyroid storm was confirmed by the BWPS system. This scale system assigns points in seven domains among five categories of thermoregulatory dysfunction, central nervous system effects, gastrointestinal-hepatic dysfunction, cardiovascular dysfunction and precipitant history. Scores were added, and scores of 45 or greater were considered highly suggestive of a thyroid storm. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Our patient’s score was 50 on presentation.\n\n【29】A notable point, in this case, was that the patient was positive for antithyroid antibodies. The incidence of thyroid dysfunction in patients positive for thyroid antibodies is high. Okada _et al_ reported that the incidence of thyroid dysfunction, including destructive thyroiditis and hypothyroidism, was higher in the thyroid autoantibody-positive group than in the autoantibody-negative group. It was also reported that the presence of TgAb or TPOAb or both at baseline was a general risk factor for immunotherapy-induced thyroid dysfunction. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【30】On searching several databases, we found only one case report in which ipilimumab and nivolumab combination induced thyroid storm in a patient receiving immunotherapy for advanced melanoma. In that case, the patient was negative for antithyroid antibodies but developed a thyroid storm 21 days after initiation of the combination therapy.\n\n【31】The combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies has been reported to increase the incidence of thyroid dysfunction and shorten the time for the onset of thyroid dysfunction. Iyer _et al_ reported that the median time to thyrotoxicosis after treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab combination was 2 weeks, whereas that with nivolumab monotherapy was 6 weeks. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【32】To summarise, we have reported a rare case of nivolumab and ipilimumab combination-induced thyroid storm. When combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy is administered in patients who are positive for antithyroid antibodies, it is desirable to perform thyroid function tests every 2 weeks, if possible. It may also be beneficial to monitor the thyroid function every 3 weeks after anti-PD-1 antibody administration because of the risk of development of thyroid-related adverse events in the early phase.\n\n【33】### Learning points\n\n【34】*   Combined nivolumab and ipilimumab immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an effective treatment, but it should be recognised that severe immune-related adverse events, such as thyroid storm, may be present.\n\n【35】*   In patients with positive antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) or antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) or both, consultation with an endocrinologist is recommended before initiating nivolumab plus ipilimumab, even if there is no history of thyroid disease.\n\n【36】*   In patients with NSCLC positive for TgAbs or TPOAbs or both, treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy, thyroid function and symptoms of suspected thyroid storm should be monitored every 2 or 3 weeks.\n\n【37】*   When nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy is administered, confirmation of thyroid function before the second course of nivolumab treatment is recommended.\n\n【38】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【39】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【40】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:50:58", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:51:17", "cost": 19.092}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:25", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:51:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:50:58"}

He found it increasingly difficult to concentrate on tasks. He did not have any other accompanying symptoms such as ataxia or vertigo. He had several ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultations where he was prescribed agents for vertigo and tinnitus but in vain. Brain imaging as well as brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) tests were unfruitful. Examination of the palate revealed a rhythmic, symmetrical, vertical and oscillating movement of the soft palate at a frequency of 30–50 clicks/min, which produced a clicking sound each time 删除10：<u>( video 1 )</u>. It was said to worsen with stress. The movement was not voluntarily suppressible and there were no accompanying signs of brainstem or cranial nerve dysfunction. As per his spouse, the ‘click’ was audible even while he was asleep. Considering normal neurological examination and imaging findings, a diagnosis of essential palatal tremor (EPT) was made. He was successfully treated with oral clonazepam (2 mg/day). The patient refused to take botulinum toxin injection. He was followed up for next 6 months during which he showed partial resurgence of the tremor as the medication was tapered, which necessitated resumption of previous doses of clonazepam along with addition of a new centrally acting agent in sodium valproate (400 mg/day).\n\n【4】删除11：<u>Video 1</u>\n\n【5】Palatal tremor is an uncommon hyperkinetic movement disorder comprising rhythmic oscillations of the soft palate. Owing to its rhythmicity, it was classified as a tremor as opposed to earlier label as a myoclonus, in the First International Congress of Movement Disorders in 1990. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Subsequently recognised as two types, symptomatic palatal tremor (SPT) and essential palatal tremor (EPT), by Deuschl _et al_ in 1990; there are important clinical and pathophysiological differences between the two. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Unlike SPT, where clicks are rarely present and associated with neurological deficits like dysarthria and nystagmus, palatal movements and ear clicks are the sole manifestations of EPT. The latter is produced by contraction of the tensor veli-palatini, causing sudden opening and closing of the eustachian tube. 删除9：<u>2 </u>The site of lesion in case of SPT is postulated to be the Guillain–Mollaret triangle , comprising the dentate nucleus, red nucleus and the inferior olivary nucleus. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Lesions anywhere in the dentato-rubro-olivary pathway cause the olive to get disinhibited resulting in compensatory hypertrophy and synchronous firing of its neurons. 删除9：<u>4 </u>These signals are relayed to the cerebellar cortex via climbing fibres resulting in oscillations. Pathophysiology of EPT, on the other hand, is obscure. As per Pearce, a supranuclear insult to the striatum or rostral brainstem resulting in disinhibition of olivary nucleus may be at play. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Although a functional origin has rarely been suggested owing to occasional suppressibility and distractability, persistence during sleep ruled out such a possibility in the present case. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【6】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【7】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【8】Schematic representation of the hypothetical Gullain–Mollaret triangle. projections from the dentate nucleus of cerebellum pass via the superior cerebellar peduncle, to the contralateral red nucleus and via the central tegmental tract, in the paramedian pontine tegmentum lateral to the medial longitudinal fasciculus, to synapse with the interior olive in the medulla. olivary dentate fibres ascend by the inferior cerebellar peduncle. ‘×’ indicates site of lesion anywhere within the hypothetical triangle.</u>\n\n【9】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【10】I was distressed with this clicking sound and was shocked to see my palate in mirror.

Although native to central South America, they have become pests in other parts of the world and are known to cause painful stings. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Their venom consists of a non-allergenic alkaloid component which causes an initial, painful skin reaction and a proteinaceous component that induces an allergic immune response. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>The alkaloid component contains cis and trans isomers of 2-methyl, 6-n-alkyl piperidine compounds and makes up 95% of the venom. 删除9：<u>4 </u>The remaining 5% of venom consists of protein components that are responsible for acute immunosensitisation in addition to a delayed-hypersensitivity reaction. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Although not completely characterised, the proteinaceous portion seems to consist of various enzymes including phospholipases, metalloproteinases, hyaluronidases and neurotoxins. 删除9：<u>4 6</u>\n\n【11】Clinically, the initial reaction from a sting is a 25–50 mm dermal flare, with wheal development within minutes and pustule development within hours. 删除9：<u>4 7 </u>These pustules transform into clear fluid filled vesicles within 4 hours and then cloudy fluid filled vesicles within 8 hours, indicating infiltration of inflammatory cells. The development of pustules occurs after 24 hours. Pathophysiology of the allergic response involves venom allergens processed by antigen-presenting cells and subsequent T cell activation. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Neutrophils are recruited to the sting site via inflammatory cytokines. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Eosinophils are seen in later-phase reactions, most likely due to a Th2-mediated mechanism. 删除9：<u>2 4 </u>Although histopathological examination has demonstrated that neutrophils are involved in the physiological reaction to fire ant stings 4 7 this has not been demonstrated _in vivo_ , to our knowledge.

Initially, the hand became swollen and turned blue for a couple of days followed by intermittent cold sensation and tingling of the hands with the skin turning white during the following weeks. There was no loss of strength and the patient had no history of Raynaud disease. He had minor complaints of lower back pain, without morning stiffness and nocturn pain. On clinical examination the left hand was paler and colder than the right and he had decreased capillary refill in the fingers with absent arterial pulsation. Laboratory examinations did not reveal any suspicious findings. Family history was negative for rheumatic disease. Ultrasound examination showed an occlusion of the left radial and ulnar artery and subsequent MRI confirmed a thrombosed aneurysm of the distal ulnar artery . Conventional angiography showed a segmental occlusion in the distal part of the radial  and ulnar artery  with extensive secondary collateral formation to the superficial and deep palmar arch. A diagnosis of a combined thenar and hypothenar hammer syndrome was made and initial treatment with vasodilating drugs relieved the symptoms with ganglion stellatum blockage or bypass surgery as options if symptoms recur.

The rash started 5 days after he self-administered a dose of insulin glargine that was 3 months beyond the expiration date. The rash started as pruriginous hives in the chest and spread to the extremities and head as a maculopapular rash with flaking. He denied any previous history of skin disease or malignancy. The patient’s home medications included apixaban, insulin glargine, chlorthalidone, ergocalciferol, fenofibrate, levothyroxine and valsartan. He had no allergies to medications, and he denied smoking, drinking alcohol or the use of recreational drugs.\n\n【4】On arrival to the emergency room, his vital signs were as follows: temperature 37°C, heart rate 108 beats per minute, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute and blood pressure 135/68 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were normal. Skin examination revealed diffuse scaly desquamating pink plaques covering the whole body and head including scalp but sparing the face . Left-sided supraclavicular and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy were palpable. There was no nail pitting, hair loss, joint pain or swelling. Oral mucosa was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations were significant for a glucose of 383 mg/dL, C reactive protein of 2.5 mg/dL and white cell count 177××10 <sup>9 </sup> /L with 1.6% eosinophils. Antinuclear antibody showed a fine granular and speckled pattern with a titter of 1:160. HIV, syphilis serology, and Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 and HTLV-2 were negative. CT scan with intravenous contrast of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no evidence of malignancy but mildly prominent bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, presumed to be reactive. Multiple skin biopsies revealed superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, dilated and tortuous capillaries in multiple dermal papillae, psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, thin suprapapillary plates and broad mounds of parakeratosis . Immunohistochemistry showed lymphocytes to be predominantly CD3 positive T cells with CD4>CD8, retention of CD7, and CD20 showed a normal distribution of B cells, consistent with psoriasis. No evidence of cutaneous lymphoma was identified. Thus, based on the pathology and the clinical presentation the patient was diagnosed with erythrodermic psoriasis (EP).\n\n【5】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【6】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【7】Desquamating rash of the hand.</u>\n\n【8】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【9】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【10】Back of the patient at admission.

The patient required treatment with an intravenous insulin drip in the intensive care unit. The patient was then switched to topical triamcinolone acetonide 1% ointment two times per day and oral cyclosporine 150 mg two times per day with improvement of the rash over 10 days. The patient was discharged home on his usual insulin glargine dose and all the other home medications. One week after discharge, the patient was readmitted for intravenous antibiotic treatment of otitis externa. At that time, he did not manifest a new or worsening rash. A perusal review of the literature did not show an association between EP and any of the patient’s home medications. The Naranjo probability scale was used to evaluate the adverse drug reaction. In our patient, the score was at least 7 or higher because some of the evaluations were not able to be performed. Our patient had self-administered a single dose of expired insulin glargine, and we did not repeat the administration, use a placebo, or detect the concentration in blood because he was already on insulin in the hospital. Therefore, we further postulated that expired insulin glargine was responsible for the induction of EP.\n\n【15】EP is rare and severe, only accounting for 1%–2.24% of psoriatic patients. 删除9：<u>1 </u>The common presentation is typically erythema, oedema, pruritus, ill-defined psoriatic plaques, scaling, hair loss, and rarely exudative lesions and palmoplantar or diffuse desquamation. 删除9：<u>1 </u>There have been several potential causes of EP. These range from environmental due to trauma, sunburn, alcoholism or infection; chemical reactions from CT contrast, topical tar; and systemic illness with HIV, leukaemia, lymphoma and gout. Medications such as lithium, bupropion, antimalarials, infliximab; discontinuing steroids, methotrexate and efalizumab have been associated with EP. 删除9：<u>1 </u>There is no previous description of EP associated with expired insulin glargine administration. The use of systemic glucocorticoids for EP is discouraged due to their ability to trigger severe psoriasis flares; however, this did not occur in our patient. Our patient was successfully treated with topical steroids and cyclosporine.\n\n【16】The exact pathogenesis of EP is not well understood. The disease is associated with predominantly T helper (Th) 2 expression from studies demonstrating increased levels of IgE in patients with EP. There is a switch from Th1 to Th2 dominant. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Type 1 IgE mediated has been the most reported type of hypersensitivity reaction to insulin but type 3 and type 4 can also occur. The presentation for insulin hypersensitivity typically ranges from a local erythema and swelling at the injection site to generalised reactions like urticaria and angioedema which does not match this patient’s presenting symptoms. 删除9：<u>3 </u>We believe this is the first report documenting a relationship between expired insulin and EP. The patient was advised about the correct use of medications before he was discharged.\n\n【17】### Learning points\n\n【18】*   Erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) should be suspected in a patient with a generalised cutaneous finding of erythema, oedema and pruritus after administration of expired insulin.\n\n【19】*   EP treatment with topical triamcinolone acetonide and oral cyclosporine is considered a better treatment option in diabetics to prevent further hyperglycaemia produced by systemic steroids.\n\n【20】*   Patient education regarding complications of insulin use should be addressed at all appointments.\n\n【21】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【22】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【23】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:46:51", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:47:09", "cost": 18.111}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:25", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:47:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:46:51"}

The prevalence of non-eruption of permanent incisors is 2%, often involving the maxillary central incisors (~70.6%). 删除9：<u>1 </u>A major cause for impaction of maxillary incisors is the obstruction of eruption by supernumerary teeth and odontomes, while other causes include developmental dental anomalies and ectopic positioning of tooth buds. Odontomes, being the most common odontogenic tumours, are dental hamartomas that constitute 22% of benign odontogenic tumours. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Though odontomes are mostly asymptomatic, they may present with altered tooth eruption patterns and non-vitality of adjacent teeth or may become symptomatic following local infection. Broadly, odontomes are classified into compound and complex types, with compound odontomes further classified into denticular, particulate and denticuloparticulate types. 删除9：<u>2 </u>They are rarely associated with syndromes like Gardner’s syndrome and Hermann’s syndrome. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Ideal management of odontomes involves removal of the obstructing odontome without disturbing the follicle to allow spontaneous eruption of the impacted tooth. This is generally observed in teeth with incomplete apex formation. If the tooth fails to erupt after 12 months, the tooth is exposed, and eruption is facilitated via bonded brackets. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【4】An 11-year-old male patient reported to the dental clinic with the chief complaint of non-eruption of the upper left front tooth.

No signs of swelling or inflammation were found on soft tissue examination. CBCT imaging was advised, which revealed the aetiology for non-eruption of #21 to be the presence of compound odontome . An impacted supernumerary tooth with incomplete root formation was seen on the palatal aspect, at the level of apices of #11 and #12. Multiple radiopaque structures bearing minimal resemblance to tooth structure were seen on the palatal aspect of the arch in relation to the apical and middle third of root of #22, suggestive of compound odontome.

The patient presented with a locked knee in 100° flexion and was unable to actively extend her knee. X-rays revealed an intra-articular dislocation of the patella with an entrapment of the upper pole in the intercondylar notch . A fracture was not visible on the plain radiograph. The patient had a successful closed reduction of her intra-articular patella dislocation under a general anaesthetic. The closed reduction was straightforward, with direct pressure placed on the inferior pole of the patella and the knee put in flexion. The manipulation under anaesthesia was performed in the operating theatre as it was uncertain if a closed reduction would be possible. A cylindrical cast was applied for 3 days postprocedure, until the postreduction MRI was done to exclude any traumatic pathologies. The clinical examination after reduction revealed no haemarthrosis, no palpable dehiscence in the quadriceps tendon and an intact straight leg raise test.\n\n【10】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【11】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【12】Lateral X-Ray of the affected knee.</u>\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【15】Sunrise X-Ray of the affected knee.</u>\n\n【16】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【17】The postreduction X-rays  showed adequate positioning of the patella in the trochlear groove.

The horizontal dislocation is more common and occurs after a direct trauma on a partially flexed knee, which leads to a rotation of the patella around its horizontal axis. When the knee joint is in flexion, the upper pole of the patella lies in front of the intercondylar groove, the initial traumatic blow, if exerted on the upper pole, pushes the patella posteriorly and it may lock in flexion. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【32】Horizontal rotation can detach the quadriceps tendon from the upper patella pole, and the articular surface faces distally to the tibia plateau. Less frequently, the lower pole of the patella tears away from the patellar tendon and becomes locked within the joint, with its articular surface pointing proximally. 删除9：<u>37 38 56 57 </u>In the less common vertical type of dislocation, the patella rotates on its vertical axis, with the edge lying in the notch. The articular surface faces medially or laterally, and the patient presents with the knee in near full extension. 删除9：<u>61 62</u>\n\n【33】According to our bibliographical analyses, the majority of the dislocations (58%, 37/64 patients) underwent an open reduction, 删除13：<u>21–54 </u>whereas only 31% (20/64 patients) could be reduced with a closed reduction. 删除9：<u>3–11 55–61 </u>In the other 11% of cases, the reduction and anaesthesia methods were not clearly mentioned. Murakami 35 has proposed that successful manipulative reduction depends on the degree of locking of the patella within the joint. Although successful closed reductions have been reported under sedation with ethonox, 删除13：<u>4 </u>chloroform 36 and even with intra-articular anaesthetic solution, 删除13：<u>55 </u>the importance of general anaesthesia with adequate muscle relaxation has been emphasised to prevent any further chondral damages. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【34】The mean age of the patients with this rare pathology was 31.9 years (range 9–93 years). The mean age of patients who underwent an open reduction was 22.4 years (range 9–88 years) and the mean age of patients with closed reduction was 45.3 years (range 10–93 years). It is becoming clear that a successful closed reduction under anaesthesia may be expected in the elderly group, in whom the dislocation is liable to occur owing to osteophyte locking rather that true impaction of the patella and the injury mechanism does not involve a high energy trauma.\n\n【35】An open reduction allows an inspection of the soft tissues and accurate repair if needed and should remain the preferred treatment for intercondylar patellar dislocation in young patients where the mechanism force is more important and an associated soft tissue injury more likely to happen due to lax patellar attachments. 删除9：<u>22</u>\n\n【36】### Learning points\n\n【37】*   Our case demonstrated that the patella had dislocated horizontally, and the reason of the entrapment was considered to be the osteophytes of the superior pole of the patella in the intercondylar groove.\n\n【38】*   This case report serves to highlight the existence of this rare condition in the elderly population as well and to remind medical practitioners that although rare, dislocation of the patella should be suspected in the case of locked knees, especially in patients with known osteoarthritic changes.\n\n【39】*   An open reduction allows an inspection of the soft tissues and accurate repair if needed and should remain the treatment of choice be intercondylar patellar dislocation in young patients where the mechanism force is more important and an associated soft tissue injury is more likely to happen.\n\n【40】*   Previous case reports confirm that the extensor mechanism usually remains intact as in our case but there can be varying degrees of quadriceps tendon avulsion. 删除9：<u>5 29 </u>Six (6/64) patients with intra-articular dislocation were found to have an associated avulsion of the distal quadriceps tendon, 删除13：<u>8 22 27 29 42 51 </u>one of them had additionally a medial patellofemoral ligament tear, 删除13：<u>22 </u>whereas one case had a coronal shear femoral Salter-Harris type III fracture in a 15-year-old boy. 删除9：<u>59</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:32:54", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:33:14", "cost": 20.242}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:25", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:33:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:32:54"}

With many reports of increasing burn-out among healthcare workers including cynicism/depersonalisation, 删除13：<u>12 13 </u>acknowledging that even those who experience minor COVID-19 illness could be at risk of potentially permanent and debilitating long term effects is important to ensure high quality, person-centred care. 删除9：<u>14 </u>We report a case of an adult female (author and patient KG) who experienced SSNHL 5 weeks following a mild COVID-19 infection and continues to experience mild chronic tinnitus.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】After waking in the morning, a woman in her 30s first noted aural fullness, noise sensitivity and mild vertigo. Over the next 24 hours, these symptoms worsened, and she developed unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus in the right ear. She presented to her general practitioner and on otoscopic examination the ear canals appeared normal and non-inflamed with intact tympanic membranes. A referral to an otolaryngologist (one of the authors) was provided. Over the proceeding 24 hours, these symptoms worsened, and she further developed paroxysmal positional vertigo. She was reviewed by JCCL within 48 hours of her initial symptoms.\n\n【11】Relevant medical history included hypertension (managed with 4 mg perindopril daily) and resolved gestational diabetes (now 8 years post partum). She had received three doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer Comimaty) COVID-19 vaccine. She had a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 infection 35 days prior to SSNHL onset. During her COVID-19 infection, she experienced sore throat, headache, nasal and sinus congestion, and lethargy. She did not require medical treatment and recovered by 2 weeks. She had no history of hearing loss or ear pathology and was relatively well prior to SSNHL but experienced ongoing mild nasal congestion since.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】Serial pure tone audiograms (PTA) are provided in figure 1 . Forty eight hours after initial symptom development, a PTA was conducted measuring hearing thresholds from 250 Hz to 6000 Hz, identifying hearing loss in the right ear between 35 and 85 dB . MRI was conducted on the same day with no identifiable cause for acute right-sided hearing loss, but revealed an empty, slightly expanded sella of the pituitary gland, suggestive of a previous auto infarction of a possible pituitary adenoma.\n\n【14】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【15】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【16】Serial pure tone audiograms in sequential order, demonstrating gradual hearing improvement in the right ear. Blue, left ear; red, right ear. HL, hearing loss.</u>\n\n【17】PTA was repeated 3 weeks later indicating a reduction in hearing loss (30–70 dB loss between 250 and 6000 Hz) . An extended-frequency PTA (including air and bone conduction) was conducted the following month and hearing thresholds were measured from 250 Hz to 16 kHz . Hearing thresholds in the left ear were within normal limits for all frequencies tested, whereas a mild sensorineural hearing loss was observed in the right ear in the mid frequencies (500–3000 Hz) and extended high frequencies (8–16 kHz). A PTA at 3 months showed marked improvement with 10–35 dB loss . A final PTA at 4 months demonstrated hearing within normal limits (5–25 dB) .\n\n【18】Treatment\n---------\n\n【19】Audio-vestibular symptoms were treated with oral prednisone burst for 7 days (25 mg daily) and taper (12.5 mg daily) for another 7 days. A 12-day course of oral betahistine 16 mg twice daily was also prescribed.\n\n【20】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【21】Due to the empty sella of the pituitary gland on MRI, serum hormone levels were performed including thyroid stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone and prolactin. All were reported to be within normal ranges and the patient is now under the care of an endocrinologist for ongoing surveillance. Three months since SSNHL, the patient now reports overall improvement but experiences intermittent pulsatile tinnitus.\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】This is an unusual case of SSNHL that developed 5 weeks following a mild COVID-19 infection. Like most cases of SSNHL where causation is difficult to prove, we postulate an association in this case especially since PTA revealed a sensory-neural mechanism for the unilateral hearing loss at the mid-to-high frequencies. Previous analysis of 20 asymptomatic people with COVID-19 showed deleterious effects on the cochlear hair cells and reduced amplitude of transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions compared with healthy individuals without a history of COVID-19. 删除9：<u>15</u>\n\n【24】According to a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies, 删除13：<u>16 </u>during 2020–2021, approximately one-third of patients with SSNHL were positive for COVID-19 at the time of presentation to an audiology/otolaryngology referral centre. Moreover, in two included studies that reported epidemiological data, presentations of SSNHL increased during the pandemic. 删除9：<u>6 17 </u>In a cross-sectional observational study by Dharmarajan _et al_ , 删除13：<u>18 100 </u>patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 received audiology testing that revealed sensorineural hearing loss in 53 of them.\n\n【25】There is heterogeneity in COVID-19 severity and the timing of audio-vestibular symptoms reported in published case studies. COVID-19 severity has ranged from asymptomatic or mild, 删除13：<u>7 9 19–26 </u>moderate, requiring hospitalisation, 删除13：<u>27 </u>to severe, where intubation and intensive care were needed. 删除9：<u>28 29 </u>Timing of audio-vestibular symptoms ranged from being the first indication of COVID-19 7 19 30 to 3–12 days 9 22 23 and between 4 and 12 weeks after reporting COVID-19 symptoms. 删除9：<u>20 21 25 27–29</u>\n\n【26】Based on the current evidence, the severity of COVID-19 infection and timing of SSHNL are therefore unpredictable. We recommend that clinicians apply a low threshold for suspicion of potential SSNHL among patients presenting with a wide variety of symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is challenging to apprise patients regarding the sheer variety of potential short and long term COVID-19 impacts, we believe SSNHL should be included among the kinds of impacts clinicians consider discussing with patients. Rauch 3 highlights that delayed diagnosis is a common challenge with cases of SSNHL with many patients and clinicians attributing sensations of ‘ear fullness’ to impacted cerumen or congestion due to respiratory infection or allergies. Early administration of high-dose corticosteroids is a significant predictor of auditory outcome and is the recommend first-line treatment. 删除9：<u>31 </u>It is therefore important for clinicians to carefully consider the potential for SSNHL and ensure prompt referral to specialists when symptoms first develop. This level of vigilance has also been highlighted by authors in relation to SSNHL occurring following COVID-19 infection. 删除9：<u>25</u>\n\n【27】SSNHL and associated symptoms can have a significant impact on quality of life, 删除13：<u>32 </u>and are closely associated with anxiety and depression. 删除9：<u>33 34 </u>This has implications for patient care and highlights the need for a holistic approach beyond medical treatment of SSNHL. Consideration of adjunct therapies such as stress reduction and well-being exercises may be worthwhile in tinnitus management and improvement in psychosocial outcomes. 删除9：<u>35</u>\n\n【28】In the coming months and years, it is likely that many currently unknown or poorly understood impacts of COVID-19 will be realised. As this area of research is largely limited to emerging studies with small population sizes, little is known about the risk factors for SSNHL to inform hearing screening protocols and early treatment with corticosteroids. It is vital that SSNHL be rigorously investigated among people who have active or recently recovered COVID-19 infections, as the risk of permanent audio-vestibular symptoms cannot be disregarded.\n\n【29】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【30】Even working in health education, I had no previous knowledge of SSNHL being associated with COVID-19. This was a shocking experience for me that had a significant impact on my way of life for several months as I have never had any problems with hearing before; not even an ear infection. I was unable to drive a car while experiencing severe vertigo. I needed to reduce my workload, negotiate flexible working arrangements with my employer, and take a leave of absence from study. I felt uncomfortable and had difficulty conversing with people and attending social activities due to my hearing loss and noise sensitivity. I was worried that this would be permanent, and that I may require a hearing aid. I now feel nervous about a second COVID-19 infection. What if I experience this again or even worse, it results in permanent hearing loss?\n\n【31】### Learning points\n\n【32】*   Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) might be a symptom of COVID-19 infection and could also present weeks after full recovery even among patients who only experienced mild illness.\n\n【33】*   The everyday impacts of SSNHL can be debilitating and distressing for patients and might lead to long term and potentially permanent disability.\n\n【34】*   Clinicians should be aware of the variety of potential short-term and long-term impacts of COVID-19 and inform patients regarding what symptoms they should monitor for. Low thresholds for further investigation and follow-up should be considered for impacts that can potentially lead to long term or permanent disability.\n\n【35】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【36】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【37】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors acknowledge the contribution of Boaz Mui, Flinders University.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:51:19", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:51:45", "cost": 25.246}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:25", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:51:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:51:19"}

An abdominal CT scan was performed and demonstrated a mechanical ileus with proximal jejunal dilation (47 mm) without free peritoneal air or fluid. She was taken to the operation room for a laparotomy with extended adhesiolysis and peritoneal washing. At the end of the surgery, a central catheter was placed in the right jugular vein under ultrasound guidance for parenteral nutrition (Omegaflex) to cover the period of oral fasting during her abdominal recovery. On the eighth day after surgery, the central line became dysfunctional and was switched on a guide wire. The patient was recovering well from abdominal surgery but developed a sudden transient paraesthesia of her right lower limb concomitant to the reinitiation of her parenteral nutrition.

Physical examination revealed numerous thick hyperkeratotic plaques measuring 10–20 mm located on the forearms and shins with firmly adherent scales over fingers and toes bilaterally with pinpoint capillary bleeding indicative of positive Auspitz sign, in addition to perioral scaly erythematous rash . Her skin lesions initially started 9 months prior to her current presentation. She was treated with triamcinolone 0.1% cream two times per day, which was changed to clobetasol ointment 0.05% two times per day with no significant response. Her altered mental status was attributed to an acute exacerbation of COPD. She was started on intravenous methylprednisolone three times a day as part of the management of COPD exacerbation and hydrocortisone 1% ointment two times per day for dermatitis with no significant improvement of her skin lesions. Histopathological examination of her skin biopsies demonstrated an irregularly acanthotic epidermis with slight spongiosis, psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, hyperkeratosis and confluent parakeratosis with neutrophilic collections . A preliminary diagnosis of rupioid psoriasis versus acrokeratosis paraneoplastica was made. There was a concern for a potential underlying internal malignancy given the classification of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica a paraneoplastic dermatosis. She had a family history of type 2 diabetes, breast and colon cancer, asthma, COPD and coronary arterial disease. Therefore, CT of the chest and abdomen and esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed with negative findings for any underlying neoplasia. A final diagnosis of rupioid psoriasis was made and due to the lack of response to topical and systemic steroids, she was started on 0.1% tacrolimus cream applied to bilateral upper and lower extremities two times per day with significant improvement of her skin lesions within 2 days.

Recognising the clinical presentation of paraneoplastic dermatoses can aid in the earlier diagnosis of internal malignancies.\n\n【21】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【22】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【23】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Dr Michelle Tarbox for her help in patient management and interpretation of histopathology images.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:31:39", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:31:47", "cost": 8.465}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:25", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:31:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:31:39"}

He denied any chest pain. Comorbidities included non-dilated ischaemic cardiomyopathy and bipolar affective disorder. An admission ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block (QRS duration=126 ms). A chest X-ray confirmed pulmonary congestion. Blood tests were unremarkable, with no evidence of infection. Highly sensitive troponin T was mildly elevated at 34 ng/L. He was successfully treated for decompensated heart failure with furosemide and dobutamine, achieving an 11 kg diuresis. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed severe biventricular dilatation with global left ventricular (LV) systolic impairment and an LV ejection fraction of 16%.\n\n【4】He was referred for assessment at our regional transplant centre and listed for a biventricular pacemaker following discussion at our multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting. Two weeks later, he returned for an uneventful elective implant of a cardiac resynchronisation therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) device.\n\n【5】Nine days on, he again presented to our emergency department with dyspnoea, testing positive for COVID-19 pneumonitis. On day 4 of this admission, he required transfer to the intensive care department for inotropic support. Unfortunately, this experience caused a significant deterioration in his mental health with paranoid thoughts and concerning behaviours. Following a thorough psychiatric assessment, he was discharged to a psychiatric hospital on day 10.\n\n【6】Six weeks later, he was repatriated to our centre with swelling at the site of CRT-D implant, with concerns raised regarding a possible wound infection. However, C reactive protein was just 4 mg/L with a white cell count of 6.2×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. A chest X-ray demonstrated retraction of the leads back to the generator pocket, with the defibrillator coil clearly visible in the left subclavian vein . He held a delusional belief that this was caused following an assault by hospital security staff, although there was no evidence to support this claim. He vehemently denied manipulating the device.\n\n【7】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【8】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【9】Chest X-ray showing entanglement of all three CRT-D leads in the pulse generator pocket with retraction of the defibrillator coil visible in the left subclavian vein.

The patient was born with bilateral clubfoot as an isolated musculoskeletal defect and underwent multiple corrective surgeries throughout his childhood and adolescence, with interval evolving deformity between surgeries. Previous operations included an Achilles tendon release, posteromedial release, and a corrective triple foot arthrodesis, which resulted in overcorrection and subsequent formation of skew foot bilaterally. His mobility was impaired secondary to deformity and pain, with a large impact on quality of life. At the time of referral, the patient was considering amputation with prosthesis to restore functional mobility. Examination and X-rays revealed complex bilateral deformity showing skew foot hallmarks of hindfoot valgus, midfoot supination, and forefoot adduction, with longitudinal arch flattening . Remnants of clubfoot were present with toes skewed medially with fixed flexion. The patient was planned for and underwent right foot reconstruction using the following methods: calcaneal dome osteotomy through non-union of subtalar joint with lateral bone block to correct the valgus deformity and the calcaneal pitch; calcaneocuboid joint osteotomy; dorsiflexing osteotomy of the first metatarsal; corrective first metatarsophalangeal joint arthrodesis; flexor tenotomies of lesser toes and transfixation with K-ires.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Preoperative plain film and clinical photograph showing acquired iatrogenic skew foot deformity of the right foot.</u>\n\n【7】The skew deformity of the right foot was successfully corrected, with achievement of a plantigrade foot and restoration of functional anatomy . Weekly 3-layer compression bandages (Unna boot) were applied. The patient progressed from a non-weight bearing status to weight bearing as tolerated with crutches after 4 weeks. Pain was significantly improved and the patient does not currently require analgesia. The medial incision was initially slow to heal (expected outcome given surgical lengthening of medial side of foot with consequent stretching of already thin tissue over bone). PICO (negative pressure wound therapy device) vacuum dressing was applied with good progress on healing. Following time for healing, similar corrective surgery on the left foot will be planned. The medial and dorsal plates have since been removed after bony healing to aid in closure .\n\n【8】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【9】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【10】Postoperative clinical photograph and plain film showing restoration of functional anatomy to a plantigrade foot.</u>\n\n【11】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【12】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【13】Postoperative weight-bearing plain film after removal of medial and dorsal plates at 6 months to aid in closure of medial wound after bony healing achieved.</u>\n\n【14】Clubfoot is the most common musculoskeletal birth defect, with an incidence of 1:1000 (up to 1:250 in Maori and Hawaiian populations). It presents bilaterally in 50%, and as an isolated deformity in 80%, with 20% associated with musculoskeletal syndromes. The gold standard for treatment is the Ponseti Method—repopularised in recent years, it involves serial external manual manipulation and recasting to gradually realign the foot. 删除9：<u>1 </u>It carries a 90% success rate, but also a 30% rate of recurrence. Prior to the adaptation of the Ponseti Method, surgical correction was more common—this carried an increased complication burden, including secondary deformity and overcorrection to skew foot as seen in this case. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Non-operative management has a lower success rate in correcting deformity, but can help improve functionality. Surgical correction is complex, given the need to correct the hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot—it is usually only considered where symptoms significantly impair patient quality of life. The goal of surgery is to restore a pain-free, functional plantigrade foot.\n\n【15】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【16】Being born with a severe case of bilateral talipes has caused me a number of issues in life, and I’ve had numerous surgeries on both feet in repeated attempts to remedy the issues, such as my walking abilities. While all in all they were somewhat successful, they’ve all still left me with difficulties in walking and with pain. Immediately in the weeks after this surgery I noticed a significant drop in resting pain within the foot. As I am not currently back to full walking capabilities, I cannot speak for it if it has aided in my overall comfort when walking, but it looks hopeful.\n\n【17】### Learning points\n\n【18】*   The Ponseti method of serial external manipulation and casting is the gold standard for correction of clubfoot, with over 90% success rate and fewer complications than surgical correction.\n\n【19】*   Skew foot surgical correction is complex and involves correction of hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot. It is considered where symptoms and deformity significantly impact quality of life.\n\n【20】*   The goal of surgical skew foot correction in adults is to restore a pain-free, functional plantigrade foot.\n\n【21】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【22】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【23】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:02:48", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:03:01", "cost": 13.553}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:25", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:03:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:02:48"}

Following evaluation in the emergency room demonstrating absence of any focal neurological sign, she was transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility. Five days following admission, she was sent to the emergency room for evaluation of altered mental status, atypical episodes of enuresis and headaches. Neurological exam revealed a depressed affect without neurological deficits. Head CT demonstrated a large, right frontal tumour with mass effect and significant obstructive hydrocephalus . MRI identified a large solid and cystic mass located within the right frontal and temporal lobes with reduced diffusivity and heterogeneous enhancement . The neuroradiographical differential diagnosis included high-grade glioma, anaplastic ependymoma or supratentorial embryonal tumour. History of radiation was most suggestive of a secondary malignancy. The patient underwent neurosurgical resection where histopathology revealed a hypercellular glial tumour with atypical nuclei, prominent mitoses and necrosis consistent with a diagnosis of high-grade glioma . Next-generation sequencing on the tumour revealed a mutation in _TP53_ (Y126C) and variants of unknown significance in nine genes ( _ALK_ , _ATRX_ , _BRIP1_ , _CIC_ , _EP300_ , _RB1_ , _IRS2_ , _PTCH1_ and _RANBP2_ ).

The patient was slightly drowsy, but he confirmed that he regularly misses haemodialysis, and he missed his last two treatments.\n\n【4】On arrival to the emergency department, vital signs were blood pressure 117/71 mm Hg, respiratory rate 15 per minute, heart rate 80 beats per minute and oxygen saturation 100% on ambient air. In the physical examination, the patient was slightly drowsy but was able to answer questions. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examination were normal. Laboratory data revealed blood urea nitrogen 61 mg/dL (normal range (NR) 9–20), creatinine 15.5 mg/dL (NR 0.66–1.25), phosphorus 5.9 mg/dL (NR 2.5–4.5), potassium 8.8 mmol/L (NR 3.6–5.0), glycaemia 10.8 mmol/L (NR<7.8), haemoglobin 92 g/L (NR 11.1–14.6) and a haematocrit 30.3% (NR 33.2–43.4).\n\n【5】Initial ECG revealed a sine-wave pattern .

Progression of hyperkalaemia causes a merger of the widened QRS complex with the elevated ST segment and T wave, and loss of the P wave that will lead to the appearance of the sine-wave pattern. ECG with a sine-wave pattern has high specificity for detecting hyperkalaemia. If there is a high clinical suspicion for hyperkalaemia (as in our patient who missed two dialysis sessions), if the patient is clinically unstable or unconscious, and if a point-of-care potassium result is not available in the emergency department, initiation of treatment might be considered prior to laboratory confirmation. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Ventricular fibrillation or asystole, associated with flaccid motor weakness or quadriplegia, are further complications of unrecognised hyperkalaemia.

Over the month prior to presentation, the patient noticed two growing nodules over his right distal forearm. He reported occasional bleeding of the lesions with trauma but denied associated pain or pruritus. Over-the-counter salicylic acid gel for treatment of presumed warts did not improve his symptoms. Further history revealed he had been off antiretroviral therapy for one year and had been potentially scratched by a cat prior to the development of the cutaneous nodules. On examination, he had two violaceous, umbilicated nodules with overlying haemorrhagic crust on his right distal forearm without regional lymphadenopathy . Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Laboratory testing demonstrated a mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase (55 U/L), and normal alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. Complement fixation antibody titer for _Histoplasma_ yeast was 1:8, but urine _Histoplasma_ antigen was undetectable. Rapid plasma reagin was unreactive, and interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis was negative. _Bartonella henselae_ and _Bartonella quintana_ antibody titers were negative. Abdominal and pelvic CT displayed two subcentimeter hepatic hypodensities with peripheral enhancement and numerous splenic hypodensities associated with abdominal lymphadenopathy . A punch biopsy of the skin was performed , and Warthin-Starry staining demonstrated clusters of bacteria, confirming the diagnosis of bacillary angiomatosis (BA) . HHV8 staining was negative.

This is initially attempted with medical measures; the failure of which requires some form of surgical intervention. Trabeculectomy is the gold standard for glaucoma filtering surgery, in which aqueous humour flows into the subconjunctival space leading to an elevation of the conjunctiva, referred to as a ‘filtering bleb’. The success of trabeculectomy is frequently augmented by the use of mitomycin C (MMC). 删除9：<u>3 </u>MMC is an antifibrotic agent. Cotton sponges are soaked in MMC 0.1–0.5 mg/mL and applied between the sclera and conjunctiva for 1–5 min.

Sputum and bronchial washing cultures revealed _A. fumigatus_ . Histology revealed filamentous fungi and Charcot–Leyden crystals with an eosinophilic reaction in lung tissue obtained by transbronchial lung biopsy . The patient’s condition fulfilled the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) criteria. Although no mycobacteria and/or granulomas were histologically detected, _M. avium_ was isolated by bronchial washing mycobacterial culture; clarithromycin susceptibility was confirmed (minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.5 µg/mL). On the basis of bronchoscopy findings, we diagnosed the patient with simultaneous ABPA and MAC-LD.\n\n【20】Treatment\n---------\n\n【21】Although systemic corticosteroids are preferred for stabilisation of ABPA symptoms, immunosuppression is an inevitable adverse effect of corticosteroids. MAC-LD is a refractory and progressive infectious disease, especially in immunocompromised hosts. 删除9：<u>8–10 </u>Itraconazole monotherapy (400 mg/day) was selected as initial treatment to avoid immunosuppression with systemic corticosteroids. The patient’s inhaler treatment was stepped up to fluticasone propionate plus formoterol fumarate (600 and 20 µg/day) for asthma symptoms.\n\n【22】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【23】After 4 months of itraconazole treatment, the patient’s total IgE concentration decreased by 6287 IU/mL (69.1% reduction from baseline) . Although the patient’s asthma symptoms were controlled, his cough gradually worsened; _M. avium_ was repeatedly identified by sputum culture . Chest CT showed that the mucoid impaction had improved, but centrilobular small nodules remained . We suspected that the cough was caused by MAC-LD; therefore, we switched the antifungal therapy to combination antimicrobial therapy comprising clarithromycin (800 mg/day), rifampicin (450 mg/day) and ethambutol (750 mg/day) for the management of MAC-LD. We observed clinical improvement in the cough and negative culture conversion of MAC; both results were achieved without systemic corticosteroids . Seven months after termination of itraconazole, the ABPA relapsed with asthmatic symptoms, and the IgE concentration was elevated again . Itraconazole was reinitiated; rifampicin for MAC-LD was discontinued because of the potential for a severe drug interaction between itraconazole and rifampicin. Considering the presence of elevated liver enzymes, we reduced the itraconazole dosage to 200 mg/day to reduce the risk of a drug interaction between itraconazole and clarithromycin. The ABPA recurred 12 months after sputum culture conversion of MAC; therefore, we terminated the anti-MAC therapy (total duration, 删除13：<u>18 </u>months) and restored the itraconazole dosage to 400 mg/day . The patient’s asthma symptoms immediately improved, and he did not exhibit ABPA or MAC-LD relapse for 14 months after the termination of clarithromycin and ethambutol .\n\n【24】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【25】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【26】The patient’s clinical course.

The prevalence of MAC is increasing worldwide, and immunosuppression is a risk associated with MAC infection. 删除9：<u>11 12 </u>Coinfection by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is a major complication in patients with ABPA. Ishiguro _et al_ 3 examined cases of NTM in patients with ABPA; they found that NTM was diagnosed at an average of 6.4 years after the administration of systemic steroids for ABPA, suggesting that the administration of systemic corticosteroids is a risk factor for NTM exacerbation and lower respiratory tract infections. Kunst _et al_ 12 described four patients with ABPA among 30 patients with concurrent NTM and bronchiectasis. These reports suggest that bronchiectasis caused by ABPA or NTM might be an important predisposing factor; clinicians should carefully evaluate this dual presentation. 删除9：<u>13</u>\n\n【29】Regarding the characteristic CT findings, bronchiolitis with bronchiectasis is typical feature of MAC-LD; ABPA also displays bronchiolitis with bronchiectasis-associated mucous plugs. In the present case, the mucoid impaction disappeared with antifungal treatment, but the centrilobular small nodules remained. Although we suspected that this bronchiolitis was caused by MAC-LD, it did not improve after anti-MAC treatment . Because both ABPA and MAC-LD mainly occur in the bronchus and MAC-LD is a refractory infection, it is difficult to distinguish the two diseases based on CT findings in cases of dual presentation.\n\n【30】Although we initially considered corticosteroid±antifungal agent±anti MAC agent therapy in this case, we chose itraconazole monotherapy as initial therapy. To the best of our knowledge, there is minimal discussion regarding the treatment of patients with this dual presentation because the diseases are rarely diagnosed simultaneously. In most cases of dual presentation, treatment for the predisposing disease is prioritised. Although at least several months of systemic corticosteroid administration is the preferred approach for ABPA treatment, Agarwal _et al_ 14 reported that itraconazole monotherapy might be an alternative therapy for ABPA, with fewer adverse effects of immunosuppression.\n\n【31】We chose a watchful waiting approach for MAC-LD because we presumed that the patient’s asthmatic symptoms were caused by ABPA, rather than MAC-LD. An official guideline from The American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, and Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends antimicrobial therapy for MAC-LD with positive acid-fast bacilli sputum smears and/or cavitary lung disease. 删除9：<u>15 </u>We suspected a nodular bronchiectasis type of MAC-LD without positive sputum smear and cavitary findings; antimicrobial therapy was not immediately necessary if we avoided the use of corticosteroids. We also suspected that the MAC was commensal. Although the ABPA was controlled, MAC was repeatedly isolated and centrilobular small nodules remained visible on CT. We switched the antifungal therapy to antimicrobial therapy for MAC-LD and achieved sputum culture conversion of MAC. Accordingly, the ABPA and MAC-LD were controlled without systemic corticosteroids for 38 months. Despite some reports of successful corticosteroid and anti-MAC treatment for ABPA with MAC-LD, 删除13：<u>13 16 17 </u>the long-term prognosis in such cases is unclear. The negative sputum culture conversion rate with standard chemotherapy for MAC-LD with systemic corticosteroids is reportedly 33%, 删除13：<u>7 </u>and the rate for all types of MAC-LD is 71.8% to 92.3%. 删除9：<u>18–20 </u>Although relapse and reinfection rates for MAC-LD with any type of immunosuppression are unclear, the rates for all types of MAC-LD remain high (33%–74%). 删除9：<u>18 21 </u>Mussaffi _et al_ 22 reported that ABPA during systemic corticosteroid therapy is a risk factor for NTM deterioration in patients with cystic fibrosis. To minimise the risk of refractory MAC-LD progression, we chose itraconazole monotherapy rather than systemic corticosteroids.\n\n【32】There is a need to consider possible drug interactions between itraconazole and rifampicin. Rifampicin is a powerful CYP3A4 inducer that accelerates the hepatic metabolism of itraconazole and prednisolone; concurrent administration can substantially reduce the serum concentration of itraconazole. 删除9：<u>23 24 </u>We chose to avoid concomitant administration of itraconazole and rifampicin. Rifabutin is a major alternative to rifampicin because it has fewer reported drug interactions. Moon _et al_ reported that one-third of patients receiving itraconazole and a low dosage of rifabutin reached a therapeutic concentration of serum itraconazole. 删除9：<u>25 </u>Rifampicin also increases prednisolone clearance by 45%, and at least a twofold increase in prednisolone dosage is required for concurrent administration of rifampicin and prednisolone. 删除9：<u>26 </u>Recently, Miwa _et al_ reported that the clarithromycin/ethambutol regimen is not inferior to the standard clarithromycin/rifampicin/ethambutol regimen; 27 28 the clarithromycin/ethambutol regimen might be reasonable for cases with itraconazole-containing regimens, rather than rifampicin-containing regimens. There is also a need to consider possible drug interactions between itraconazole and clarithromycin.

However, subdural hygroma occurrence is a very rare complication after revision spinal fusion surgery. Here, we report a case of revision lumbar fusion surgery at the L3–4 level. The patient developed acute conus medullaris syndrome at 10 days postoperatively. MRI showed a subdural, extra-arachnoid area fluid collection following the T12–L2, cephalad to the area of revision spinal fusion. When patients have a decreased motor grade, difficulty in voiding urine and neurological abnormalities after lumbar spine surgery, conus medullaris syndrome with a possible occurrence of subdural hygroma should be considered. In this situation, immediate imaging investigations and emergency surgery might be necessary to reduce the pressure on the spinal cord.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   Neurosurgery\n*   Spinal cord\n*   Neuroimaging\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

SSH must be differentially diagnosed from a subdural haematoma, empyema and lipoma. This differentiation can be made using MRI, mainly owing to differences in the parts involved in these complications. Cystic lesions are located in the epiarachnoid or subdural spaces. The physiology behind cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation within the subdural space is hypothesised to result from tears in the arachnoid membrane. Although SSH is possible, it is a rare complication of cranial and spinal surgeries. Some cases of SSH have been reported following spinal decompression surgery. In the most cases, a pinhole leak in the arachnoid membrane caused SSH. 删除9：<u>1 2</u>\n\n【8】This case report describes a postoperative complication, especially the case of a patient with conus medullaris syndrome with SSH developed proximal to the area of spinal fusion. Contrary to previously reported cases, SSH occurred very late in our case, at 10 days postoperatively.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】This retrospective review was conducted with the approval of the corresponding institutional review board of our hospital. A woman in her 70s with chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension underwent laminectomy and discectomy at L4–5–S1 and posterior lumbar interbody fusion at L4–5–S1 2 years previously. At 1 year and 6 months after the first surgery, she visited the outpatient clinic for aggravated back pain and radiculopathy. Radiography and MRI findings revealed an L3 spinal compression fracture, severe central canal stenosis and right foraminal stenosis at L3–4, and bilateral pedicle screw loosening at L4 . Therefore, we performed revisional surgery. L3–4 posterior decompression and posterolateral fusion, as well as posterior instrumentation, were performed at L2–3–4.\n\n【11】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【12】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【13】(A) Sagittal and axial T2-weighted MRI obtained preoperatively, 删除13：<u>6 </u>months after a previous laminectomy and discectomy at L4–5 and posterior lumbar interbody fusion at L4–5–S1. There were no signs of fluid collection. (B) Sagittal and axial T2 MRI obtained 10 days after the development of conus medullaris syndrome. The image reveals newly developed subdural complicated fluid collection (arrow) through the T12–L1–L2 level, which seems to cause moderate conus medullaris compromise. (C) Sagittal and axial T2 MRI obtained after hygroma evacuation. The previous fluid collection is resolved.</u>\n\n【14】Postoperatively, the patient underwent prolonged periods of bed rest, and her general weakness was severe. On postoperative day 8, the patient started walking. At 10 days after the revision surgery, the patient chad decreased right lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Urinary retention and sacral hypoesthesia were observed.\n\n【15】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【16】MRI performed immediately after the patient-reported symptoms revealed a newly developed subdural fluid collection extending between T12–L1–L2, located on the right side of the canal, compressing the spinal cord .\n\n【17】Treatment\n---------\n\n【18】The patient’s right lower extremity motor function deteriorated further as time passed. Therefore, we decided to perform emergency surgical exploration with posterior decompression by T12–L1–L2 laminectomy and epi-arachnoid fluid evacuation. After making a 5 mm incision in the dural sac, a yellowish fluid was drained. After fully draining this yellowish fluid, the dural sac was successfully repaired. After surgery, although the right motor grade slowly recovered, urinary retention persisted.\n\n【19】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【20】MRI performed at 2 weeks after the final surgery revealed complete removal of subdural fluid accumulation at the L1–2 level and resolved moderate spinal cord compression . At 4 weeks postoperatively, the patient’s motor grade was restored to grade 4. The patient’s sensory grade almost recovered to a normal level.\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】Subdural hygroma is a very rare but well-known complication of revision spinal surgery, spinal anaesthesia or Chiari malformation surgery, 删除13：<u>1 2 </u>such as foramen magnum decompression. 删除9：<u>3–5 </u>Development of neurological symptoms after spinal fusion surgery due to CSF collection is rare and difficult to diagnose. 删除9：<u>3 6 </u>A subdural hygroma is a CSF collection between the dura mater and the arachnoid membrane. In the most previous cases, incidental durotomy could occur during decompressive surgery, resulting in CSF leakage. 删除9：<u>7 8 </u>Without evidence of durotomy, CSF collection can be accompanied by a pinhole injury to the arachnoid membrane, and a one-way slit valve may develop, causing CSF collection in the subdural space. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【23】In this case, SSH occurred following revision fusion surgery. In most previous cases, SSH occurred 2–5 days postoperatively. This can be related to the starting point of ambulation. However, in this case, SSH occurred at 10 days postoperatively, which was different from other reported cases. The exact cause of this delay is unknown. 删除9：<u>4 5 </u>However, ambulation was delayed owing to the patient’s poor postoperative condition and remarkable medical history. The symptoms developed at 2 days after ambulation, and the onset of SSH might have been related to the initiation of ambulation and movement of fluids in the epiarachnoid space. There were no events, such as dura tears, during the operation. Nevertheless, as this was a revision fusion surgery, the risk of dura injury was higher. Generally, the fluid collection was caused by a pinhole injury to the arachnoid membrane resulting in a spread of fluid in the subdural and epiarachnoid space, which might have been caused by the movement of the collected fluid in the subdural space after ambulation. 删除9：<u>7 8</u>\n\n【24】In cases where the motor grade decreased a few days after surgery, the cause of the haematoma was considered first, and MRI scanning was urgently performed after a physical examination. It should be noted that SSH could also cause spinal cord or root compression after spinal fusion surgery. Therefore, it is necessary to note that rapid MRI and treatment could affect a patient’s long-term outcomes. 删除9：<u>10–12 </u>In previous studies, the cause of SSH was only a hypothesis, and no clear cause was ever revealed. To prevent SSH after revision spinal fusion surgery, more researches on the causative factors are needed.\n\n【25】SSH should be considered one of the causes of motor weakness after revision lumbar fusion surgery. Early diagnosis and decompression surgery may help achieve recovery.\n\n【26】#### Learning points\n\n【27】*   Subdural hygroma is a rare complication after revision spinal fusion surgery.\n\n【28】*   When delayed motor weakness is evoked after revision spinal fusion surgery, a subdural hygroma may be the cause.\n\n【29】*   To make a differential diagnosis of subdural hygroma from other problems, detailed history taking, physical examination and performing MRI are essential.\n\n【30】*   When subdural hygroma is diagnosed, it is important to treat it with surgery quickly to achieve recovery.\n\n【31】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【32】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【33】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:33:05", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:37:35", "cost": 269.911}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:24", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:37:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:33:05"}

Risk factors for development of SIPE include advanced age, 删除13：<u>2 </u>female sex, 删除13：<u>3 </u>hypertension, 删除13：<u>7 </u>long course distances, 删除13：<u>4 </u>cooler water temperature, 删除13：<u>5 </u>and pre-existing heart disease. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Furthermore, lower lung volumes and expiratory flow 12 months earlier, 删除13：<u>9 </u>higher mean pulmonary arterial (PAP) and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures (PAWP) at rest, 删除13：<u>10 </u>have all been correlated with the development of SIPE.\n\n【7】The precise pathophysiology remains elusive but likely involves increases in pulmonary arterial pressures related to centralisation of blood volume and an exaggerated pulmonary vasoconstrictive response to cold in the setting of increased cardiac output during exercise. 删除9：<u>10 </u>When combined with peripheral vasoconstriction, increasing left ventricular afterload in cold water, together with negative pulmonary pressures during inspiration, there is stretch of the pulmonary capillary basement membrane which leads to alveolar oedema. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Individuals with left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension or structural heart disease typically have higher atrial pressures and are therefore less likely to tolerate further increases in preload, predisposing to SIPE. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【8】Clinical examination typically demonstrates bi-basal crepitations, and radiological investigations frequently display changes consistent with alveolar oedema. It is recommended that those presenting with SIPE undergo detailed evaluation of their cardiovascular physiology. In divers, elevated troponin, natriuretic peptides and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with myocardial strain and transient hypokinesia on echocardiography have been reported. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Typically, coronary artery abnormalities are ruled out using CT angiography and patients often undergo cardiac MRI to define cardiac structure and function further. Other investigations such as MRI renal angiography and 24-hour urinary catecholamines may be undertaken to rule out uncommon causes of pulmonary oedema.\n\n【9】Treatment is primarily supportive and involves immediate removal from water and cessation of exercise while sitting upright. 删除9：<u>11 </u>Oxygen therapy is frequently required. Diuresis, bronchodilators and continuous positive airway pressure may be necessary in some instances, while invasive mechanical ventilation with haemodynamic support is reserved for the most severe cases. Episodes typically resolve within 24–48 hours of leaving the water, but autopsy findings have been suggestive of IPE in approximately 10% of scuba-diving deaths. 删除9：<u>13 14 </u>Notably, left ventricular hypertrophy was confirmed in all such cases.\n\n【10】Recurrence is common and has been reported between 13% and 22% among scuba divers and swimmers. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Episodes vary in severity and frequently do not require hospitalisation; however, patients should be appropriately informed regarding the high risk of recurrence, and following an initial episode, should be assumed to have a predisposition. Swimming at a slower pace, accompanied, in warmer water without a tight-fitting wetsuit are appropriate first steps following recovery. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided and any comorbidity that worsens diastolic function should be optimised. Prophylactic sildenafil has been shown to lower PAP and PAWP, 删除13：<u>10 </u>and this appears to be an effective preventative measure in those with a history of recurrent SIPE. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Sufficiently powered randomised controlled data are needed for formal validation of this approach.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A fit and well female in her 50s presented with significant dyspnoea and haemoptysis following a night open-water swimming event in water of around 17°C while wearing a wetsuit. She had no past medical history of note.\n\n【13】A keen competitive long-distance swimmer and triathlete, she had experienced significant dyspnoea during an open-water event 2 weeks prior and was forced to abandon, before feeling breathless for some days afterwards.

Significant structural heart disease was ruled out via transthoracic echocardiography. Mild structural cardiac abnormalities should not be overestimated when IPE is suspected, as significant pressure changes can exacerbate mild underlying cardiovascular abnormalities. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Cardiac MRI demonstrated localised myocardial oedema in the setting of normal right and left ventricular size and function. A non-specific indicator of myocardial injury, this pattern could be consistent with ischaemia, pressure overload or a subclinical myocarditis. Alternative pathologies can also be excluded using cardiac MRI. Myocardial infarction is often characterised by a sub-endocardial distribution of late gadolinium enhancement, 删除13：<u>16 </u>while typical morphological appearances and apical oedema may be appreciated in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 删除9：<u>17 </u>Arrhythmia was deemed less likely and subsequent 48-hour monitoring was reassuring.\n\n【34】Non-cardiogenic causes are broad and, in the absence of clear neurogenic pathology, pulmonary embolism should be considered. In this case, CT pulmonary angiography ruled out thromboembolic disease and demonstrated ground-glass changes throughout both lungs consistent with pulmonary oedema. In circumstances where aetiology is unclear, renal artery stenosis should be considered and investigated via appropriate imaging.\n\n【35】In this case, a history of acute dyspnoea occurring in cold water, on exertion, while wearing a wetsuit, accompanied by pulmonary oedema with spontaneous resolution in the absence of aspiration or structural heart disease, was felt to be diagnostic of IPE. The time course suggests that the recent COVID-19 booster vaccination was unrelated.\n\n【36】Treatment\n---------\n\n【37】Symptoms settled within 2 hours of presentation to hospital. A treatment dose of dalteparin was administered while CT pulmonary angiography was awaited and the patient was discharged the next morning.\n\n【38】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【39】Following a period of monitoring, the patient was discharged the following day. Four days post admission, troponin T had fallen to 8 ng/L (normal range <14 ng/L) and NT-Pro BNP to 288 ng/L (normal range <150 ng/L). On clinic review, the ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm, and T wave inversion in leads I, AvL and V6 with a normal cardiac axis and corrected QT interval .\n\n【40】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【41】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 5\n\n【42】Twelve-lead ECG on follow-up demonstrating sinus rhythm and T wave inversion in leads I, AvL and V6.</u>\n\n【43】Interval cardiac MRI demonstrated resolution of myocardial oedema as well as basal cavity inferior lateral fibrosis .

An exercise test was completed 3 months post admission and demonstrated an appropriate rise in blood pressure without undue symptoms or arrhythmia.

She will be reviewed with a surveillance cardiac MRI in early 2023.\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published evidence of myocardial oedema characterised using MRI in the setting of IPE. While it is conceivable that this represents a pre-existing inflammatory process such as myocarditis which contributed towards IPE, it is also potentially a consequence of the acute episode. This is an interesting finding and complements historic data demonstrating reversible and frequently regional myocardial dysfunction in the setting of IPE. 删除9：<u>12 18–20 </u>Importantly, echocardiography was normal in this case, although 2 days following the acute episode, therefore any dysfunction is unlikely to have been fully appreciated.\n\n【51】The aetiology of myocardial dysfunction in these scenarios is unclear, but authors have proposed a stress cardiomyopathy, akin to Takotsubo, as the underlying cause—a syndrome in which localised myocardial oedema on MRI is frequently observed. 删除9：<u>21 </u>There are other possible explanations for localised myocardial oedema in this setting. Ischaemia due to cold-induced coronary vasospasm in the setting of increased myocardial oxygen demand or ventricular pressure overload as suggested in this case by an elevation in NT-Pro-BNP. In addition, the slight troponin elevation in combination with localised lateral repolarisation abnormalities, together with the myocardial oedema and fibrosis seen on the initial MRI, support a degree of myocardial injury. The ECG in particular adds to existing data which appears to demonstrate a tendency toward lateral repolarisation and ST segment disturbances. 删除9：<u>12 18 19</u>\n\n【52】In this case, hypertension at clinic review may allude to a predisposition to increased vascular tone in the setting of environmental stimuli. Indeed, those with a history of IPE have been shown to be more likely to demonstrate pathological vasoconstriction when exposed to cold and to have an increased likelihood of subsequently developing hypertension. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【53】The UK Diving Medical Committee has published guidance for divers. 删除9：<u>22 </u>However, at present, there are no formal national medical guidelines concerning the recognition and management of this complex condition. Detection is therefore dependent on a low index of suspicion when reviewing breathless patients who have been immersed.\n\n【54】As cardiac MRI becomes mainstream globally, it is likely that more data from IPE cases will emerge, enabling us to characterise myocardial pathology better in this under-diagnosed syndrome and potentially contribute toward risk stratification algorithms. This may facilitate individualised guidance regarding continued participation in water activities.\n\n【55】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【56】While swimming in a quarry at a night swim I started to hyperventilate and realised I couldn’t swim any further. Luckily, I was able to call for help and got guided back to the quay by a paddleboard. When I got out, I undid my wetsuit and immediately felt the sensation of my lungs filling with fluid. I started to cough and had a metallic taste in my mouth. When I got into the light, I could see my sputum was pink and frothy.\n\n【57】I was very lucky to be surrounded by a great team at the quarry who all knew I had SIPE. My husband drove me to the ED \\[emergency department\\] where I underwent an ECG, CXR \\[chest X-ray\\], bloods and CTPA \\[CT pulmonary angiogram\\]. Throughout the evening I passed urine frequently for about 10 hours until the cough stopped and I was discharged home.\n\n【58】Two weeks prior to this incident I had experienced a much milder event while open water swimming in the sea that I hadn’t attributed to SIPE at the time, but had also experienced difficulty in my normal running and pool swimming training. I had just assumed I was a bit under the weather.\n\n【59】Other than this I have had no other symptoms and am now fully recovered and back to full training.\n\n【60】### Learning points\n\n【61】*   Immersion pulmonary oedema is under-recognised and should be considered in any patient presenting with dyspnoea following immersion.\n\n【62】*   Thorough investigation of the cardiovascular system should be undertaken and is frequently normal.\n\n【63】*   Some patients may demonstrate transient myocardial dysfunction during an acute episode. This may be identified via demonstration of hypokinesia on echocardiography or hypokinesia or myocardial oedema on cardiac MRI.\n\n【64】*   The precise aetiology of this condition is yet to be established. Possibilities include a stress cardiomyopathy, coronary vasospasm, ventricular pressure overload, or an inflammatory process.\n\n【65】*   Recurrence is common and following an initial episode, patients should be presumed to have a predisposition. Patients should therefore be counselled appropriately.\n\n【66】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【67】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【68】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:30:25", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:30:51", "cost": 25.514}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:24", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:30:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:30:25"}

In one recent review, there was 111 publications over the last 25 years, mostly single case reports. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Some of the most common mechanisms for gastric pneumatosis include gastric ischaemia or infarction, bacterial infection and gastric mucosal disruption facilitating air penetration, such as in forceful vomiting or gastric outlet obstruction. 删除9：<u>1 2</u>\n\n【8】Due to the rich collateral blood supply to the stomach, gastric ischaemia itself is a rare entity. Aetiologies of gastric ischaemia can be divided into systemic hypoperfusion, such as in shock, or local causes of hypoperfusion, such as in gastric volvulus, coeliac axis occlusion or in superior mesenteric artery syndrome. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【9】The treatment of gastric pneumatosis is often conservative; however, surgery may be required depending on the aetiology. 删除9：<u>1 </u>In one recent study, patients with elevated serum lactic acid, elevated serum creatinine, or concomitant small bowel or colonic pneumatosis were found to have higher mortalities. It has been suggested that more aggressive treatment may be warranted in these patients. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【10】We report a rare case of gastric ischaemia and pneumatosis following therapeutic left gastric artery gelfoam and coil embolisation that was treated with conservative measures.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A man in his 70s with a medical history significant for recurrent upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding secondary to a gastric dieulafoy lesion, erosive gastritis, coronary artery disease with a drug-eluting stent (on aspirin 81 mg daily), chronic kidney disease stage III, hypertension and non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes presented with a 1-week history of worsening fatigue and shortness of breath.\n\n【13】The patient was recently hospitalised three times in the past few months for severe symptomatic acute blood loss anaemia secondary to a bleeding gastric dieulafoy lesion. This was treated on the first admission with argon plasma coagulation and clipping and the third admission with epinephrine and clipping. No intervention was necessary during the second admission.\n\n【14】On presentation, he was found to have a haemoglobin of 57 g/L and was transfused two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). He began having multiple episodes of melena associated with a brief hypotensive episode and was subsequently transfused three additional units of pRBCs. He underwent oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) revealing active bleeding of the gastric dieulafoy lesion that was treated with Injection Gold Probe.\n\n【15】Next day, the patient had a drop in his haemoglobin, which required transfusion of an additional unit of pRBC. This drop in haemoglobin was attributed to continued bleeding of his dieulafoy lesion. Since endoscopic therapeutic approaches had failed three times and the recurrent bleeding was significant enough to warrant multiple hospitalisations the decision was made to consult interventional radiology (IR) for embolisation. The patient underwent gelfoam and coil embolisation of the left gastric artery with successful haemostasis.\n\n【16】He had no further drops in haemoglobin or evidence of melena or haematochezia after the embolisation. Over the next 72 hours after the procedure, he developed persistent diffuse abdominal pain and vomiting. He then became septic with fever of 38.9°C, tachycardia to 120 s and leucocytosis with white cell count of 20.8 10ˆ9/L.\n\n【17】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【18】A CT abdomen pelvis with intravenous contrast showed pneumatosis and mural thickening along the wall of the lesser curvature of the stomach . An OGD showed diffuse ischaemic changes, characterised by discolouration and deep ulceration in the proximal stomach involving the anterior and posterior wall extending down to the lesser curvature of the stomach .

Blood cultures were drawn which did not yield growth of any organisms. An OGD was performed 2 days after diagnosis of pneumatosis to assess extent of ischaemia and found diffuse ischaemic changes characterised by discolouration and deep ulceration of the proximal stomach involving the anterior and posterior wall with extension to lesser curvature of stomach. Nasogastric (NG) was placed to suction to alleviate the large volume of gastric secretions (1–2 L per day). He was treated with high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy with intravenous pantoprazole 40 mg three times a day. He was unable to tolerate postpyloric feeding via NJ tube due to abdominal pain and was initiated on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). A repeat CT abdomen done 5 days after initial diagnosis showed improvement in gastric pneumatosis. He completed a 10-day course of intravenous antibiotics. He was on TPN for a total of 21 and then transitioned to enteral tube feeds that were well tolerated. He was able to slowly restart eating by mouth and tolerated advancements of diet from clear liquid to solids. Enteral tube feeds were stopped day before discharge.\n\n【27】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【28】The patient was hospitalised for a total of 33 days. On discharge, he was tolerating a low fat and low fibre diet. A repeat CT abdomen pelvis non-contrast prior to discharge showed persistent and similar appearing gastric pneumatosis. The patient was seen in the GI clinic 1.5 months after discharge and was noted to be feeling well overall with occasional bloating during meals. He continues to follow up with his primary care physician and gastroenterologist over a year after discharge.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】Gastric pneumatosis has a variety of causes, including gastric ischaemia and infarction. Gastric ischaemia is a rare condition on its own, that may be under-reported, under-recognised and underappreciated. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【31】The aetiologies of gastric ischaemia are many and there are numerous risk factors that have been identified. One retrospective study separated aetiologies into local vascular (n=8; 47%), mechanical obstruction (n=5; 29%) and systemic hypoperfusion from shock (n=4; 24%). Local vascular causes include coeliac artery ostial stenosis, postsurgical complications, portal vein thrombosis and hepatic artery embolisation. Causes of mechanical obstruction include paraoesophageal hernias and gastric outlet obstruction. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Other rarer causes of gastric ischaemia that have been reported in case reports include disseminated intravascular coagulation, 删除13：<u>5 </u>severe mesenteric ischaemia, 删除13：<u>6 </u>antiphospholipid syndrome complicated by adrenal insufficiency due to bilateral adrenal gland infarction, 删除13：<u>7 </u>complication of endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer 8 and following intra-arterial infusion of vasopressin into the left gastric artery. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【32】Known risk factors for gastric ischaemia include advanced age, smoking, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, hypertension and portal hypertension. 删除9：<u>10 </u>Ageing and diabetes decrease gastric motility and delay gastric emptying which leads to gastric distention which then results in increased intragastric pressure. 删除9：<u>11 </u>This mechanism has been shown to decrease gastric blood flow in animal models. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Smoking increases acid and pepsin secretion and levels of oxygen-free radicals as well as decreasing prostaglandin synthesis, gastric blood flow and mucus secretion. 删除9：<u>13 </u>Portal hypertension decreases gastric blood flow due to vascular congestion. 删除9：<u>10 </u>Our patient had multiple risk factors for the development of gastric ischaemia after left gastric artery embolisation, including advanced age, atherosclerosis, diabetes and hypertension.\n\n【33】The most common presenting symptoms of gastric ischaemia are abdominal pain, GI bleeding and acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy. CT imaging may show evidence of gastric pneumatosis or portal vein air. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Diagnostic endoscopy is recommended for suspected gastric ischaemia because it can confirm the diagnosis, estimate severity of the ischaemia and rule out other pathologies. 删除9：<u>2 </u>The most common endoscopic findings are mucosal congestion and haemorrhagic (purplish hue) mucosa with or without ulceration, usually on the greater curvature of the body. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【34】Management options for gastric ischaemia are divided into surgical and conservative. Conservative approaches involve gastric acid suppression with PPIs, broad-spectrum antibiotics, NG tube decompression, fluid resuscitation and TPN. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Broad-spectrum antibiotic use is selective with some authors using antibiotics if there is presence of gastric pneumatosis on imaging. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Intervention can be surgical via gastric resection or with IR. For example, in the latter case, if the aetiology is hepatic artery ostial stenosis then a stent can be placed with IR. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Surgical intervention is recommended for gastric perforation and gangrenous or necrotising gastritis that has not responded to conservative management as well as all cases of ischaemia secondary to gastric volvulus. 删除9：<u>2 </u>In one study, the median duration of hospitalisation was 15 days and the mortality was 24% within 6 months of diagnosis. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【35】Gastric ischaemia following embolisation is rare due to rich collateral supply to the stomach.

He presented to the emergency department due to headache and one episode of vomiting. Headache initially was relieved by simple analgesia which subsequently became resistant to therapy. CT angiography demonstrated right intraventricular haemorrhage without a clear source of bleeding. MRI found a stable right thalamic haematoma probably originating from a leaking arterial-venous malformation. A cerebral arteriography performed the next day concluded that the haematoma probably originated from a branch of the right posterior cerebral artery. The neurologically asymptomatic patient was scheduled for an elective embolisation of the arterial-venous malformation under general anaesthesia 1 week later. The patient was fasted for at least 6 hours before anaesthesia and received no premedication. Standard monitoring included a three‐lead ECG, non‐invasive blood pressure, end‐tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide and peripheral pulse oximetry. To monitor the depth of anaesthesia, we used the SedLine Brain Function Monitor (Masimo). The bilateral SedLine electroencephalogram (EEG) Sensor was installed on the patient’s front . The front electrodes were not visible on the operator’s X-ray screen  and did not disturb at any moment the operator during the procedure. The cable of the sensor was conducted posteriorly with respect to the patient’s head and kept out the field of the radiological image . Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with a target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol (Orchestra Base Primea, Fresenius Kabi) using the pharmacokinetic model of Schnider _et al_ . 删除9：<u>4 </u>Analgesia was assured with intermittent boluses of sufentanil 0.2 µg/kg. The lungs were normoventilated (end‐tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 4.6–6.0 kPa) with 50% oxygen–air mixture. Neuromuscular block was induced with rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg and maintained with intermittent boluses of 0.2–0.3 mg/kg to obtain a deep neuromuscular block (post tetanic count of 2) measured with acceleromyography on the patients left thumb (IntelliVue NMT Module, Philips). After intubation an invasive arterial line was placed in the right radial artery. We used the Patient State Index (PSI) of the SedLine Brain Function Monitor to titrate the depth of anaesthesia targeting a PSI between 25 and 50. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Relatively low calculated doses of propofol were necessary to maintain a stable depth of anaesthesia, with calculated effect-site concentrations of about 2.6 µg/mL  and a PSI of about 27 . The neuroradiological intervention was uneventful but was ended after 2 hours without embolisation of the arteriovenous malformation as no source vessel could be identified. The target-controlled perfusion of propofol was stopped (local time 13:30, total perfusion time 2 hours and 18 min, total propofol dose 1043 mg) and 2 min later (local time 13:32) the patient received sugammadex intravenously (4 mg/kg) to reverse deep neuromuscular block with a train of four count of 0 (post-tetanic count was not done before reversal).

The event of immediate arousal from anaesthesia was followed by a very steep increase in the PSI index (up to 80 and more) with an EMG activity of 80% and a spectral edge frequency of about 17 Hz .

The patient received regular postoperative follow-up which was uneventful.\n\n【36】Discussion\n----------\n\n【37】In this case report, we describe a case of rapid arousal form anaesthesia after the reversal of deep rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block with sugammadex despite still significant calculated doses of propofol at the effect site. Signs of light anaesthesia have been reported after sugammadex administration in several dose-finding studies. 删除9：<u>6 7 </u>Chazot _et al_ reported a case who immediately awoke after sugammadex administration in absence of any stimulation with still adequate anaesthesia under propofol and remifentanil. 删除9：<u>8 </u>In this patient brain function monitoring was done with Bispectral Index (BIS) (BIS; Aspect Medical System, Norwood, Massachusetts, USA) and Neurosense (Neurowave System, Cleveland, Ohio, USA). In 2020, a randomised clinical trial by Le Guen _et al_ in 51 patients showed that despite constant perfusion with propofol and remifentanil, sugammadex causes signs of awakening in the absence of documented post-operative awareness. 删除9：<u>9 </u>The BIS monitor was used to monitor anaesthetic depth. Sugammadex is reported in the literature to have a very low affinity for other molecules such as propofol. 删除9：<u>7 8 </u>Consequently its direct interference with the depth of anaesthesia (in terms of displacement of the hypnotic agent) is considered to be clinically irrelevant. The case presented here differs from the previous ones in that the Sedline Brain function Monitor Masimo was used. This monitor produces a parameter called PSI derived from a proprietary algorithm by processing a high-resolution four-channel EEG with advanced artefact filters. 删除9：<u>10 </u>The PSI has been clinically validated to measure the depth of anaesthesia and sedation. 删除9：<u>11 12 </u>The calculation of the PSI takes about 2 min. It uses parallel signal processing engines to extract a clearer EEG signal for computing PSI. It is thus less influenced by artefacts arising from neuromuscular blockade which limit other monitoring techniques as previously demonstrated by Schuller _et al_ . 删除9：<u>13 </u>In particular, the BIS has been shown to be highly influenced by peripheral electromyography which contributes considerably to the diagnosis of high BIS, and is particularly essential for determining BIS >80. 删除9：<u>14 </u>The bilateral Masimo Sedline electrodes are radiolucent and were not disturbing during the neuroradiological procedure. The patient underwent 2 hours of general anaesthesia using a Propofol TCI according to the pharmacokinetic model of Schnider _et al_ , 删除13：<u>4 </u>with a calculated effect site concentration of about 2.6 µg/mL. The patient was kept under deep neuromuscular block (post-tetanic count 2) due to the inherent safety requirements of the neuroradiological intervention. The lecture of the PSI, the interpretation of the bilateral raw EEG and the density spectral array (DSA), allowed us to titrate the anaesthetic drugs to the minimum dosages for effective and safe hypnosis. Intracerebral pathologies might give asymmetric BIS values, but the thresholds at which the extent and type of intracranial pathologies affect BIS are largely unknown. 删除9：<u>15 16 </u>This should be kept in mind using brain function monitoring in neuroradiological interventions. Our patient had a normal neurological examination before the procedure and the intracerebral bleeding had happened 1 week before the intervention. There was no asymmetry in the DSA. We might, therefore, believe that the calculated PSI correctly reflected anaesthetic depth in this patient. At the end of the procedure, only 2 min after having stopped the propofol perfusion the patient emerged very rapidly and unexpectedly after the administration of sugammadex at a dose of 4 mg/kg. This immediate awakening was documented by Masimo Sedline monitoring. Postmedication excluded signs and symptoms suggestive of awareness. TCI are used routinely to simplify the administration of intravenous drugs during general anaesthesia and to increase its precision but there are large variations in measured serum concentrations. 删除9：<u>17 </u>One might argue that anaesthetic depth of the patient was already very superficial at the moment we stopped the propofol perfusion, and that the indicated effect site concentrations are calculated and not measured values, but this would have been reflected in a higher PSI value which was about 27 at this moment and which indicated adequate anaesthesia. It is very improbably that the 2 min interruption of the propofol perfusion induced this very rapid arousal (about 2% of total propofol perfusion time). We believe that the observed effect of sugammadex is indirect and might be mainly explained by the afferentation theory. The latter was first described by Lanier _et al_ on a sample of dogs 18 and later taken up by Vasella _et al_ . 删除9：<u>19 </u>The afferentation theory predicts that stimulation of the neuromuscular spindles will produce cerebral stimulation. Cortical activity has therefore a peripheral component deriving from muscular proprioceptive afferences. Neuromuscular block would lead to a ‘peripheral silence’ which sugammadex could interrupt. Compared with previous reports, we used a neuromonitoring method that does not depend on peripheral electromyography, which, therefore, allows us to study more precisely the changes in cortical activity which were observed after the administration of Sugammadex.\n\n【38】In conclusion, this case illustrates the possibility of unexpectedly rapid emergence from effect site-targeted propofol anaesthesia on reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex. A potential explanation behind this phenomenon could be the sugammadex-induced indirect increase of central stimulation via the reactivation of ascending central pathways originating from neuromuscular spindles. These observations argue for the need of further research between the interaction of neuromuscular blockade and depth of anaesthesia.\n\n【39】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【40】Here there are some words about my experience under general anaesthesia: ‘I fell asleep very easily, without stress, but I was scared of awakening with nausea. When I woke up, it was as if nothing had happened. I woke up very well. I also vividly remember well what we had talked about just before I fell asleep and especially an awakening without nausea and without having the “head among the clouds‘ (Translated from French)\n\n【41】### Learning points\n\n【42】*   Reversal of rocuronium induced neuromuscular block with Sugammadex may induce rapid arousal from anaesthesia.\n\n【43】*   This rapid arousal might be explained by the afferentation theory.\n\n【44】*   Brain function monitoring to avoid awareness and titrate depth of anaesthesia could be of utmost importance in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents.\n\n【45】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【46】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【47】Obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "\n【9】We describe the case of a 42-year-old man (75 kg, 删除13：177 cm)", "content": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】We describe the case of a 42-year-old man undergoing elective embolisation of an arteriovenous malformation at the level of the right posterior cerebral artery under propofol anaesthesia.

The latter was first described by Lanier _et al_ on a sample of dogs 18 and later taken up by Vasella _et al_ . 删除9：<u>19 </u>The afferentation theory predicts that stimulation of the neuromuscular spindles will produce cerebral stimulation. Cortical activity has therefore a peripheral component deriving from muscular proprioceptive afferences. Neuromuscular block would lead to a ‘peripheral silence’ which sugammadex could interrupt. Compared with previous reports, we used a neuromonitoring method that does not depend on peripheral electromyography, which, therefore, allows us to study more precisely the changes in cortical activity which were observed after the administration of Sugammadex.\n\n【38】In conclusion, this case illustrates the possibility of unexpectedly rapid emergence from effect site-targeted propofol anaesthesia on reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex. A potential explanation behind this phenomenon could be the sugammadex-induced indirect increase of central stimulation via the reactivation of ascending central pathways originating from neuromuscular spindles. These observations argue for the need of further research between the interaction of neuromuscular blockade and depth of anaesthesia.\n\n【39】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【40】Here there are some words about my experience under general anaesthesia: ‘I fell asleep very easily, without stress, but I was scared of awakening with nausea. When I woke up, it was as if nothing had happened. I woke up very well. I also vividly remember well what we had talked about just before I fell asleep and especially an awakening without nausea and without having the “head among the clouds‘ (Translated from French)\n\n【41】### Learning points\n\n【42】*   Reversal of rocuronium induced neuromuscular block with Sugammadex may induce rapid arousal from anaesthesia.\n\n【43】*   This rapid arousal might be explained by the afferentation theory.\n\n【44】*   Brain function monitoring to avoid awareness and titrate depth of anaesthesia could be of utmost importance in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents.\n\n【45】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【46】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【47】Obtained.</u>", "index": 2162, "show": true, "start": 2162, "end": 2228, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "删除13：177"}], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:50:03", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:50:56", "cost": 52.271}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:24", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:50:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:50:03"}

Abnormal laboratory investigations included low haemoglobin 118 g/L (130–180 g/L), slightly elevated prothrombin time 14.6 s (9.5–14 s), elevated plasma viscosity 2.09 mPa.s. (1.5–1.72 mPa.s.) and slightly low sodium 130 mmol/L (133–146 mmol/L). Non-contrast CT head  showed a dilated hyperdense left superior ophthalmic vein and CT venogram confirmed left superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis (SOVT). No radiologically discernible cause was found and the rest of the venous sinuses were patent. Patient was referred to ophthalmology services which found no abnormality on further ophthalmological examination and were not able to ascribe a cause for the patient’s condition.

As I was coming down the hill, I didn’t realise the speed I had picked up until I was seconds away from hitting a kerb and being thrown from the scooter. As a result of the speed and impact of the fall, I broke my foot. Immediately after the fall, there was no pain until I tried to stand on my right foot. Two days later, my foot doubled in size and I was brought for an X-ray.

We also searched the vaccine adverse event reporting system and found 50 reports of suspected HLH following COVID-19 vaccination.

Multiple platforms were used to develop vaccine candidates, including messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The mRNA vaccines, tozinameran and elasomeran, were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under emergency use authorisations; currently only tozinameran has full FDA approval. Both are highly efficacious in preventing serious outcomes, including hospitalisation, severe illness and death. Current knowledge about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines relies on data from phase 1–3 randomised controlled trials and vaccine safety surveillance systems. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>Due to the highly contagious nature of the disease and the pandemic straining healthcare systems, the benefits of mass vaccination efforts are unquestionable. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Nonetheless it is important to recognise that similar to post-COVID-19 infectious complications, rare life-threatening complications post vaccination have also been reported including thrombocytopaenia, haemolytic anaemia, vasculitis and myocarditis. 删除9：<u>4–9</u>\n\n【7】Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, severe, uncontrolled hyperinflammatory reaction where activated lymphocytes and histiocytes infiltrate all organs and secrete large amounts of cytokines, leading to tissue damage and organ failure. Characteristic features include prolonged fever, splenomegaly, pancytopenia and haemophagocytosis. Biochemical markers include hyperferritinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and hypofibrinogenaemia. Due to its rarity and variable clinical presentation, an accurate diagnosis may be delayed, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Although HLH has been described post-Covid-19 infection as well as postadenoviral vector vaccination, 删除13：<u>10–14 </u>it has never been reported post-mRNA vaccination. We report two cases of HLH admitted to our hospital from June to August 2021 after administration of mRNA vaccines. We also searched the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) (last release 09/10/21) for ‘HLH’ and found 50 reports of suspected HLH postvaccination. 删除9：<u>15 </u>We cannot currently define a causal relationship between vaccination and the development of HLH, additional surveillance is needed to understand whether a relationship exists, if any, between them.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】Patient 1 is a 60-year-old man with a history of Barrett’s esophagus who developed altered mental status and slurred speech 6 days after the first dose of tozinameran (BNT162b2 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine). He was initially diagnosed with transient ischaemic attack, but progressively deteriorated over the next month developing fevers, drenching night sweats, loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss, delirium and became non-ambulatory.\n\n【10】Patient 2 is a 32-year-old woman with no prior medical history who developed high fevers 4 weeks after the second dose of tozinameran. She was briefly hospitalised at an outside hospital with new anaemia (haemoglobin 80 g/L), hyperferritinaemia (35 000 ng/mL) and elevated transaminases. Rheumatological, oncological and infectious workups were negative, and fevers worsened despite 8 weeks of prednisone 50 mg daily. By the ninth week of worsening symptoms as an outpatient, fevers reached 40°C and became debilitating. She was re-admitted and was transferred to our institution for further management. By this time her ferritin had increased to 68 212 ng/mL (normal range 15–150 ng/mL) and neopterin was 9.5 ng/mL (normal range <2.5 ng/mL).\n\n【11】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【12】Acute COVID-19 infection was ruled out in both patients based on negative PCR tests of nasopharyngeal specimens. Negative nucleocapsid and positive anti-spike antibodies confirmed no prior COVID-19 infection.\n\n【13】Patient 1 met 6/9 HLH criteria including a bone marrow biopsy that showed haemophagocytosis 通用删除1(英):<u>删除10：<u>( table 1 , figure 1A )</u></u>. Patient 2 met 7/9 HLH criteria including haemophagocytosis on bone marrow biopsy 通用删除1(英):<u>删除10：<u>( table 1 , figure 1A )</u></u>. The diagnosis of HLH was made in both patients based on these criteria.

HLH, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.</u>\n\n【20】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【21】The differential diagnosis was very broad in both patients. Table 1 lists the complete work up for each patient, which aimed to rule out not only an aetiology for their fevers but also an underlying aetiology that could result in secondary HLH. Given their high fevers, infectious aetiologies were high on the differential for both patients. In addition to blood cultures and ruling out SARS CoV-2 infection, evaluation for Aspergillus, Babesia, Bartonella, Brucella, Leptospira, Tuberculosis and Francisella tularensis in the serum were performed. Both patients also had lumbar punctures to evaluate for bacterial, fungal and viral aetiologies; studies included evaluation for Cryptococcus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and West Nile virus.\n\n【22】When infectious aetiologies were negative, both patients also underwent an extensive rheumatologic workup which included evaluation for systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disorder and vasculitis.\n\n【23】CT, including positron emission tomography CT, was also performed to evaluate for oncological explanations for their symptoms. Although lymphadenopathy was seen in both patients, biopsies of suspicious lymph nodes were non-diagnostic for malignancy. Additionally, both patients had bone marrow biopsies as part of the workup for fever of unknown origin, both to evaluate for HLH as well as to rule out a haematological malignancy which subsequently revealed evidence of haemophagocytosis. A final diagnosis of HLH was even more suggestive following drastic clinical response to HLH-directed treatment as well as further serological testing (elevated CXCL9, neopterin).\n\n【24】Treatment\n---------\n\n【25】Patient 1 was initially treated with 5 days of prednisone 1 mg/kg prior to the diagnosis of HLH but his symptoms were refractory to this treatment, and he continued to deteriorate. He was subsequently started on HLH-directed therapy with etoposide and dexamethasone.\n\n【26】Patient 2 had initial improvement in her symptoms and pancytopenia after starting etoposide and dexamethasone but after her fourth etoposide dose she developed neutropenic fevers and haemodynamic instability without identifiable infectious source. Due to concern for disease refractoriness, she was started on emapalumab-lzsg.\n\n【27】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【28】Patient 1 had dramatic improvement in his speech, ambulation and pancytopenia within 48 hours of starting etoposide and dexamethasone . He was discharged 13 days after his first etoposide dose and he initially continued to improve on outpatient follow-up visits, however, symptoms (night sweats, malaise) relapse and his HLH biomarkers worsen (worsening thrombocytopaenia, rising triglycerides, elevated ferritin) anytime he is tapered off steroids. He has been started on cyclosporine without meaningful improvement, so we have restarted steroids.\n\n【29】Patient 2 similarly had rapid improvement in her symptoms and laboratory markers after starting second line HLH-directed therapy. She was discharged home after 5 weeks and continues to improve on outpatient follow-up visits. She completed eight treatments of emapalumab-lzsg and on discontinuation, laboratory markers worsened, so we plan for a longer course of emapalumab-lzsg.\n\n【30】For patient 1, we considered intrathecal methotrexate as treatment for the neurological manifestations of HLH. Although intrathecal therapy has been used in thrombocytopenic patients, there is no consensus on a safe cut-off value of platelet counts. The patient had profound thrombocytopaenia (<20 000/µL), which was unresponsive to platelet transfusions during his hospital course. Given the risks of haemorrhagic complications, we were unable to offer this therapeutic intervention during the hospitalisation. Additionally, his neurological symptoms improved rapidly with systemic first line treatment for HLH with etoposide and steroids.\n\n【31】For patient 2, we discussed pursuing an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant as she initially had worsening laboratory HLH markers after emapalumab was being tapered. We are currently awaiting results of genetic testing to rule out hereditary HLH mutations that may have predisposed her to developing HLH before we subject her to transplant considering that she is being weaned off the emapalumab. Her biomarkers have also improved with prolonged emapalumab so we have currently deferred pursuit of transplant.\n\n【32】Elevated D-dimer can also be seen in HLH as many patients will have hepatitis and abnormal coagulation parameters. Although D-dimer is not included in the diagnostic criteria for HLH, it may be of interest to trend this lab to evaluate for response to HLH directed therapy.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】Over 350 million mRNA-vaccine doses have been administered in the USA without reported cases of HLH post-mRNA vaccination in the literature. 删除9：<u>16 </u>In addition to our two patients, we found 48 additional reports of HLH following COVID-19 infection in the VAERS database 删除10：<u>( table 2 and online supplemental table S1 )</u>. There were 25 females/25 males with a median age of 58-years-old. The distribution of vaccines was Pfizer 通用删除7(英):<u>(34)</u>, Moderna 通用删除7(英):<u>(14)</u> and Janssen 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>. Symptoms developed a median of 8 days (0–61 days) post first 通用删除7(英):<u>(22)</u> and second 通用删除7(英):<u>(24)</u> dose. All but one case required hospitalisation (median 14 days). At the time of the reporting, only 20% had recovered and seven patients had died. It is unclear if all patients met criteria for HLH with several reports indicating an alternative diagnosis was suspected.\n删除8：<u>### Supplemental material\n\n【35】\\[bcr-2021-247022supp001.pdf\\]</u>\n\n【36】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【37】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 2\n\n【38】Reported cases of HLH related to SARS/CoV-2 vaccine to the VAERS database</u>\n\n【39】Vaccination remains one of our most effective public health tools in the setting of an ongoing worldwide pandemic. The potential relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and development of HLH warrants further investigation. Although review of the literature reveals HLH following COVID-19 infection 10–12 and post-COVID-19 adenoviral vector vaccination, 删除13：<u>13 14 </u>this is the first report of patients developing HLH post COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. In two cases of HLH following ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) (AZD1222), patients were refractory to first line HLH directed therapy and responded to administration of anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. 删除9：<u>14 </u>In our report, patient 2 had a short response to etoposide and steroids but became refractory and required administration of emapalumab-lzsg with clinical improvement.\n\n【40】Our report is limited by its retrospective approach, the self-reported nature of VAERS data, and lack of access to primary vaccine trial data and to the VAERS reporters to confirm the HLH diagnoses. VAERS cases may initiate investigations into potential associations between a vaccine and adverse events, but on their own cannot prove causality. Pharmacovigilance is therefore key to determine the true incidence of these exceedingly rare toxicities considering that millions of doses of the various available vaccines have been safely administered worldwide. We hope that our two cases of HLH raise awareness of a potential unexpected adverse effect associated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as prompt recognition of this condition is of utmost importance to initiate life-saving therapy.\n\n【41】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【42】#### Patient 1\n\n【43】This has been the most incredibly painful and difficult 6 months of my family life. All of my health issues began after my vaccination and my health declined at a rapid rate. There was no progress or understanding of what was causing this deterioration and I felt my life was in severe danger.\n\n【44】After being diagnosed with HLH my life turned around. Starting the medications for HLH has helped me. I am looking towards many years of good health. I feel very strongly that the medical community should know my story in case it could save someone else’s life.\n\n【45】#### Patient 2\n\n【46】I almost died because of HLH especially since the traditional chemotherapy did not work for me.

Due to the rarity and variable clinical presentation of HLH, an accurate diagnosis may be delayed, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality.\n\n【49】*   This is the first report of HLH developing in two patients post-COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination in the absence of other identifiable causes of HLH. Further investigation is needed to understand the relationship between COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and development of HLH.\n\n【50】*   HLH and other adverse events reported after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination remain extremely rare and should not diminish the well-documented safety profile of mRNA vaccines.\n\n【51】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【52】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【53】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 13:35:22", "endTime": "2024/09/23 13:35:31", "cost": 9.037}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:24", "update_time": "2024-09-22 21:35:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 21:35:21"}

This variant was also present in his mother (father was not available for testing). Finding this variant was unexpected, but as it was maternally inherited and as his mother displayed a similar phenotype, a provisional diagnosis of Noonan-NF1 (Neurofibromatosis type 1)-related disorder was made. In view of the NF1 variant of unknown significance and unclear fit with clinical phenotype, he went on to have duo whole exome sequencing which did not identify any relevant pathogenic variants.\n\n【6】At 7 years of age, he was re-referred to Genetics clinic from Neurosurgery due to a new development of cervical vertebral abnormalities. Advancements in genomic testing meant that both the patient and mother were able to undergo further agnostic duo exome sequence analysis.

On further questioning, he reported that he had several episodes of self-limiting chest discomfort 2 weeks prior to the presentation day. During these episodes, the patient did not seek any medical attention due to fear of contracting COVID-19.

In the presence of STE in the inferior leads on 12-lead ECG and ventricular tachycardia in a pre-elderly man, inferior myocardial infarction is the most likely diagnosis. Additionally, haemodynamic instability and abnormal examination findings indicating reduced tissue perfusion are suggestive of acute cardiogenic shock. Moreover, pansystolic murmur in the left sternal border on auscultation raises suspicion for AMI-related complications such as post MI VSR or papillary muscle rupture. Therefore, LVGs in the right anterior oblique and left anterior oblique projections were immediately performed that showed the basal, mid and distal inferior wall hypokinesis with evidence of shunt from the left ventricle to the right ventricle at systole. TTE confirmed the defect in the mid portion of the interventricular septum (IVS). Bilateral selective coronary angiogram revealed a total occlusion of the RCA at the mid-level that was the culprit lesion for AMI.\n\n【32】Overall, the patient’s presentation was consistent with cardiogenic shock due to complicated AMI. Given ventricular tachycardia leading to haemodynamic compromise, a successful cardioversion was performed. In addition to intravenous vasopressors, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted for the purpose of percutaneous mechanic circulatory support (PMCS) due to cardiogenic shock. The case was discussed with the cardiothoracic surgery team and emergent repair of VSR was declined due to high-risk features. Therefore, the decision was made to proceed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the culprit lesion. After pre-dilatation of the index lesion, two drug-eluting stents were inserted to the mid RCA with no complications.\n\n【33】On the first day post cardiac catheterisation, he remained in cardiogenic shock and pulmonary oedema despite intravenous vasopressors, IABP counter-pulsation therapy and mechanical ventilation. Given severe upper and lower peripheral vascular disease, percutaneous mechanical circulatory support with axial or centrifugal flow was not feasible at our institution. The patient was eventually transferred to a larger centre for advanced PMCS and surgical closure of the VSR. He was placed on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) on arrival at the accepting centre and underwent surgical closure on VA ECMO 4 days after the transfer. Over the next several days, VA ECMO was successfully decannulated. However, the patient continued to require increasing pressure support and oxygen requirements that eventually progressed to persistent hypotension on maximum pressure support. The patient eventually had a cardiac arrest and expired within 10 days of surgery.\n\n【34】Global health problem list\n--------------------------\n\n【35】The incidence of the COVID-19 has been up trending globally with increasing morbidity and mortality since the outbreak was officially confirmed in 2019.\n\n【36】The overall mortality rate has risen worldwide, especially in the USA which was 20% higher between March and August 2020 in comparison with all-cause mortality from previous years since 2014.\n\n【37】Since public health measures have been announced globally to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19, late presenting cases from cardiac and non-cardiac conditions became more prevalent due to the inability to reach designated healthcare centres on time for multitude of reasons including the contagious nature of the virus, stay home orders, strict hospital policies for preventing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic as well as overburdened healthcare systems.\n\n【38】This global pandemic has a likely positive correlation with the increased proportion of late presenting fatal cardiac emergencies especially mechanical complications post AMI.\n\n【39】Global health problem analysis\n------------------------------\n\n【40】Post MI VSR results from a complete occlusion of a coronary artery supplying blood to a territory of the IVS. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Latham first recognised VSR as a complication of AMI in an autopsy report in 1847. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Although, the incidence reported is somewhere between 1% and 3% historically, the current data has shown a marked decrease in incidence by about 10-fold primarily due to the advancement of early reperfusion strategies for the last few decades. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Despite the advent of percutaneous and surgical techniques in the closure of post MI VSR, it still remains a devastating complication with grim prognosis. In the published series, the mortality rate varies at 18.4% with the delay of surgery up to 7 days, 58.4% with emergent repair and 94% if left untreated by day 30 post presentation. 删除9：<u>8 9 </u>Therefore, high index of suspicion is required for early recognition and treatment optimisation in a timely manner.\n\n【41】Universal risk factors of this fatal complication are advanced age, female gender, history of stroke, ST-segment elevation on ECG, elevated cardiac markers, higher heart rate, lower blood pressure, higher Killip classification and delayed or lack of reperfusion. The data also shed light into a negative correlation between the presence of atherosclerotic risk factors and post MI VSR. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Our case was classical for the late presentation of acute inferolateral MI complicated by VSR. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors were relatively less present which was consistent with the current data.\n\n【42】The anterior IVS is supplied by the left anterior descending (LAD) artery as opposed to a dominant RCA generally provides a blood supply to the inferior IVS. As a result, apical VSRs are seen in the presence of total occlusions of the LAD whereas infarcted dominant RCAs usually result in basal VSRs. Moreover, RCA-related VSRs are more likely to be large and associated with intra-myocardial dissection and involvement of the free wall. 删除9：<u>8 10 </u>In our case, the defect interestingly was located in the mid portion of the IVS. This may be explained by the RCA being dominant and supplying such a large territory in the IVS from the base to the mid portion.\n\n【43】When it comes to timing of surgery, the mortality rates have been reported lower in patients with delay of the closure than those who underwent early repair within 1 week or treated conservatively. 删除9：<u>5 10 </u>Despite medical treatment, PMCS and a successful PCI of the infarct-related artery with an optimal door-to-balloon time, cardiogenic shock remained persistent. Our patient remained on ECMO for 10 days and underwent a surgical closure of the VSR on day 10. He transiently recovered from shock but unfortunately developed cardiac arrest and expired in the same hospitalisation.\n\n【44】Since the global health organisations announced the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, the whole world has started operating interventions to mitigate the spread of the virus using public health measures including self-isolation, social distancing and wearing facial masks. Despite this global effort, symptomatic patients from COVID-19 have surged to the hospitals and COVID-19 positive admission rates reached to historical high numbers in 2020. However, the fear of contagion made some patients with angina or equivalents to present to the facilities either very late or did not present at all. Furthermore, universal efforts to inhibit the spread of the virus have resulted in unwanted deviations in the STEMI guidelines. The donning and doffing process of the protective personal equipment (PPE) and the absence of negative pressure systems in the most cardiac catheter laboratories have required additional steps and tests prior to initiating emergent percutaneous coronary interventions. Therefore, large delays have been seen in symptom onset to hospital time as well as door-to-balloon time due to contemporary hospital disinfection protocols. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【45】Conversely, the total number of non-COVID-19 hospitalisations in 2020 declined remarkably in comparison with the hospitalisations in 2019. 删除9：<u>11 12 </u>A retrospective analysis from Italy showed that COVID-19 negative STEMIs experienced approximately two times longer door-to-balloon time in 2020 as compared with the door-to-balloon time in the pre-COVID years. Also, the major adverse cardiac events were more likely to be seen in the study group. 删除9：<u>13 </u>At the beginning of the outbreak, there was a significant reduction in acute cardiac admissions and length of stay concerning about disruption in acute care of cardiovascular conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【46】In terms of non-COVID-19 non-cardiac emergencies, delayed care seeking due to disruption in the healthcare utilisation has resulted in increased morbidity and mortality. An observational prospective study enrolling a total of 185 patients has shown that 50% of the acute surgical cases who tested negative for the COVID-19 experienced service delay in healthcare and presented late with stage IV cancer as underlying aetiology. 删除9：<u>14</u>\n\n【47】According to a nationwide, web-based 1-week survey between June 24 and June 30 2020, 41% of the US adults were found to have avoidance of medical care during the pandemic due to concerns about COVID-19. Medical care delay was more prevalent in non-Hispanic black population, young adults, aged 18–24 years, disabled persons and those with chronic conditions. The percentage of individuals who denied seeking emergent/urgent care was about 12% based on the survey. Approximately one-third of the survey population reported delay in routine care in regards to a degree of fear and worry in the general population. 删除9：<u>15</u>\n\n【48】Despite the outbreak-related delays in acute cardiac care, primary PCI still remains the cornerstone treatment strategy for patients who had a STEMI at PCI-capable hospitals when it could be provided in a timely manner, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated cardiac catheterisation laboratory (CCL). In order to prevent late door-to-balloon time in STEMIs, several actions have been recommended by cardiac societies across high-impact regions in the USA. These actions include a quick screening for COVID-19, the use of ultra-rapid COVID-19 testing if available, rapid classification of patients with STEMI into COVID-19 positive/probable or COVID-19 possible groups and transferring COVID-19 positive or probable STEMIs to dedicated CCLs. 删除9：<u>16</u>\n\n【49】The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to AMI and its complications is largely unknown since the data are lacking. Additionally, large delays from diagnosis to treatment in this context have become ordinary during the pandemic and it is unclear the amount of impact on morbidity and mortality rates due to increased risk of developing post-MI complications.

The 2019 edition of the Nosology & Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders classifies osteogenesis imperfecta into type 1 (non-deformation with persistently blue sclerae), type 2 (perinatal lethal form), type 3 (progressively deforming type), type 4 (moderate form), 删除13：<u>1 </u>type 5—which is accompanied by interosseous calcification/hyperplastic callus—and other types. Type 1 is the most common type of osteogenesis imperfecta among adults.\n\n【8】In more than 90% of cases, osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by genetic mutations ( _COL1A1, COL1A2_ ) affecting type I collagen, which is a major component of connective tissue, especially in the bones and ligaments. Clinically, patients with osteogenesis imperfecta exhibit susceptibility to fracture, growth disorders, hearing loss, hyperextension of the joints and skin and valvular disease. In 1965, Manschot demonstrated that osteogenesis imperfecta is associated with thinning of the cornea and sclera as well as blue scleral findings. 删除9：<u>2 </u>In 2014, Wallace _et al_ 3 reported an association between osteogenesis imperfecta and open-angle glaucoma. Other typical ocular findings are myopia and keratoconus. However, only three case reports have described macular neovascularisation (MNV) occurring in the context of osteogenesis imperfecta. 删除9：<u>4–6</u>\n\n【9】In this report, we discuss a case in which MNV resulted in metamorphopsia and decreased visual acuity in a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta, exhibiting a novel _COL1A1_ gene mutation .\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A woman in her 30s who reported experiencing metamorphopsia and diminished visual acuity in her right eye for 1 month was referred to Oita University Hospital for detailed examination. Although she had four fractures during her childhood, she had no history of systemic illness. She also disclosed that her otolaryngologist had diagnosed hearing loss, the cause of which remained unknown. Blue sclerae were also observed in two of the patient’s children (both male). The elder son, who was 9 years old, had several histories of fractures and was short in stature. The younger son, who was 7 years old, had a history of fractures in early childhood.\n\n【12】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【13】Decimal visual acuity was 0.4×−3.5D in her right eye and 1.2×−3.5D in her left eye. Ocular pressure was 14 mmHg in her right eye and 15 mmHg in her left eye. Axial length was 23.97 mm in her right eye and 23.96 mm in her left eye. Both eyes exhibited blue sclerae . Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) indicated that corneal thickness was 421 µm in the right eye and 427 µm in the left eye. There were no noteworthy findings in the optic media, and her left fundus was normal. However, her right fundus exhibited a greyish-white exudative lesion with haemorrhage, extending into the parafovea and serous retinal detachment (size: 2 papillae) . Fundus autofluorescence images showed a faint hypofluorescence consistent with the range of serous retinal detachment and a hypofluorescence in the area of the subretinal haemorrhage . A highly reflexive exudative neovascular complex above the retinal pigment epithelium was also observed on OCT images . There was no local thickening of the choroid or compression of the choriocapillaris, and the thickness of the choroid was almost normal. OCT angiography B-scan clearly demonstrated a blood flow signal consistent with the exudative lesion in the parafovea . Reconstructed composite images showed clear subretinal vascular networks . Based on the above, the patient was diagnosed with type 2 MNV.\n\n【14】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【15】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【16】Photograph of the anterior segment of the eye at the first visit (blue sclerae).

Relative to the Young Adult Mean, bone mineral densities for the right femur, left femur and lumbar spine were 62%, 60% and 72%, respectively, which were lower than the standard value of 80% or more. Genetic analysis via next-generation sequencing revealed a novel variant of a nonsense mutation in _COL1A1_ (heterozygous, c.495T>A, p.Tyr165\\*). Furthermore, the relevant spot was confirmed by Sanger method .

However, 删除13：<u>1 </u>month later, mild serous retinal detachment was observed again, although corrected visual acuity in her right eye remained unchanged at 1.2. A second injection of ranibizumab into the vitreous body promptly attenuated the exudative changes.

(C) The composite image of OCTA shows that MNV had diminished dramatically (yellow arrow).</u>\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】The present report is the first to discuss a case of MNV associated with osteogenesis imperfecta in Japan. Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta exhibit blue sclerae due to scleral thinning and transparency of the choroid, resulting from collagen abnormalities. This sign can also be observed in patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. In general, in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, abnormalities in type I collagen reduce ocular rigidity, resulting in axial elongation of the globe and myopia associated with the development of posterior staphyloma.\n\n【37】Bruch’s membrane is composed of five layers. From the retinal side, these layers are the basement membrane of retinal pigment epithelial cells, the inner collagen layer, the elastic plate, the outer collagen layer and the basement membrane of choroidal capillaries. Since the inner and outer collagen layers contain type I collagen, _COL1A1_ mutation may explain weakening of Bruch’s membrane in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. In all previous reports of MNV associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, the presence of lacquer cracks was confirmed. 删除9：<u>4–6 </u>Rishi _et al_ reported that a 12-year-old girl developed a lacquer crack after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, speculating that the temporary increase in intraocular pressure after intravitreal injection or contraction of the retinal pigment epithelium associated with the retraction of MNV caused the Bruch’s membrane to rupture. Bellanca _et al_ 5 reported lacquer cracks in a 28-year-old man with osteogenesis imperfecta who did not use antivascular endothelial growth factor drugs. Despite treatment for MNV, the patient developed lacquer cracks, which may have been due to decreased tension and ankylosis of the eyeball resulting from eyeball elongation.\n\n【38】In the present case, no clear lacquer cracks were observed either before or after treatment. Although refractive errors can develop over a long period of time, the error observed in our patient was smaller than that indicated in previous reports, and no conspicuous extension of the ocular axis was observed. In addition, we speculate that the nonsense mutation  in _COL1A1_ detected in our patient was not a dominant-negative mutation but instead represented a null allele due to nonsense codon-mediated mRNA degradation, resulting in haploinsufficiency. Therefore, although susceptibility to fracture and mild hearing loss were observed in the present case, systemic symptoms remained mild and did not interfere with daily life. We believe that lacquer cracks did not occur given that the patient exhibited only mild weakening of Bruch’s membrane.\n\n【39】Some reports have described genetic mutations affecting other types of collagen, which have also been associated with fragility of Bruch’s membrane. Corominas _et al_ 7 reported an association between exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and _COL8A1_ gene mutation. According to their report, hyperpigmentation of the macula occurred in patients with early AMD exhibiting the _COL8A1_ mutation, who exhibited a greater degree of myopia than those without the mutation. Previous mouse studies have suggested that structural changes in Bruch’s membrane associated with the _COL8A1_ mutation lead to the onset of AMD. Thus, abnormalities in collagen fibres may lead to fragility of Bruch’s membrane, thereby resulting in structural changes and contributing to MNV. Indeed, we speculate that such weakening occurred in our patient due to changes in type I collagen in both the inner and outer layers, resulting from _COL1A1_ mutation.\n\n【40】Fortunately, in the present case, rapid improvement of the exudative changes and suppression of relapse were achieved with only two intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. Furthermore, since MNV was located slightly inferior to the fovea centralis, improvements in visual acuity were better than those reported for previous cases. 删除9：<u>4–6 </u>Since fragility of Bruch’s membrane represents the basis of onset, recurrence and relapse are likely in patients exhibited MNV, highlighting the need for regular follow-up.\n\n【41】In conclusion, we discussed a case of MNV associated with osteogenesis imperfecta due to a nonsense mutation in _COL1A1_ . We believe that thinning of the cornea and sclera decreased the rigidity in the globe, and weakening of Bruch’s membrane due to abnormalities in type I collagen contributed to the onset of MNV in our patient.\n\n【42】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【43】(The author translated the patient’s perspective into English.)\n\n【44】From an early age, I felt that my eyes were of a different colour from the people around me. I did not really care because I thought this was because the pigment of my body was lighter than the others.\n\n【45】Since I was in elementary school, I had repeated fractures and my wrists and fingers remained bent. My vision gradually became myopic. I had never been told that these are symptoms of this disease (osteogenesis imperfecta).\n\n【46】This time, my field of vision suddenly became unclear, landscapes were distorted, and my vision became blurry; it became difficult for me to see. I even hit the wall several times. I went to an ophthalmologist because I was afraid that I would lose my eyesight.\n\n【47】For the first time, I learnt the blue colour of the white of my eye (conjunctiva), the repeated fractures I experienced and macular neovascularisation in my eyes were symptoms of osteogenesis imperfecta.\n\n【48】The two injections I received into my eyes were very scary. Thanks to that I am getting better and living the same life as before. However, I am worried that it may recur every time I come to the hospital for a regular check-up.\n\n【49】I was worried that my two sons had inherited it, so my sons also underwent genetic testing. Turns out that both of them had inherited the disease; this shook me more than when I discovered that I had the disease.\n\n【50】I really did not want them to inherit it. It took me some time to make up my mind that I had to deal with this illness along with my two children.\n\n【51】Since both my children have low bone density, they experience several fractures and sprains.

Haemangiomas are more commonly found in children, and are termed vascular tumours. Presentation in the adult age group is highly unusual. Haemangiomas are classified as benign, locally aggressive and malignant lesions according to the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification. The patient typically describes the lesion as an indistinct mass that becomes larger or smaller with time. Deep-seated haemangiomas cannot be distinguished from malignant soft tissue tumours without imaging and histopathological studies. Different types of typical haemangiomas have been described, 删除13：<u>1 </u>which may demonstrate unique radiological manifestations; however, in many cases, the imaging characteristics are insufficient in reaching a diagnosis. Haemangiomas have a proliferation and then a degeneration phase. First, there is a rapid growth of endothelial cells that form syncytial masses with or without increased blood flow, and this phase is linked to high angiogenic factor levels such as vascular endothelial growth factors and basic fibroblast growth factors. This is followed by an end stage, also called the involution stage, in which complete sclerosis or hyalinisation of the haemangioma matrix occurs. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>These sclerosed haemangiomas are mostly asymptomatic and often incidentally found. Radiological investigations play an important role in diagnosing haemangiomas, as these lesions have typical imaging features. On USG, these appear as hypoechoic lesions with or without vascular flow and as T1/T2-weighted iso/hyperintense lesions on MRI; however, rarely atypical morphologies might also be detected. 删除9：<u>4 5 </u>The process of sclerosis changes the radiological characteristics, making their diagnosis nearly impossible by using imaging characteristics only. This may warrant surgical/pathological correlation.\n\n【14】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【15】I was having this swelling in my hand for a long while, it was increasing in size and sometimes it was painful. I came to the hospital and doctors helped me a lot.

We highlight post-resection histopathological examination for sclerosing haemangiomas as they mimic other benign neoplasms.\n\n【20】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【21】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【22】Obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:02:22", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:02:33", "cost": 10.927}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:24", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:02:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:02:22"}

The most common sites of metastasis are the lung, bones, liver and brain, with small intestine metastasis being minimally reported in the literature. This report describes a case of small bowel obstruction caused by metastatic RCC in a male patient in his 60 s who had previously undergone a radical nephrectomy with adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy 6 years prior. The patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy converted to a laparotomy due to the complexity of the case. During surgical exploration, an enterectomy and end-to-end anastomosis were performed. This case emphasises the possibility of RCC metastasising to the small intestine, which may present with small bowel obstruction, while highlighting the importance of patient education for early detection to improve prognosis. Additionally, this report discusses treatment options for managing RCC metastasis to the small intestine.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   Small intestine cancer\n*   Renal medicine\n*   Gastrointestinal surgery\n*   Gastroenterology\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Its occurrence is primarily observed in men between 50 and 70 years, with multiple associated risk factors, including hypertension, older age, polycystic kidney disease and hereditary diseases. Approximately 63 000 new incidences and 14 000 deaths are reported from RCC annually, 删除13：<u>1 </u>with 25%–30% reporting metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. The most commonly affected sites of metastasis include the lungs (45%), bones (30%), lymph nodes (22%), liver (20%) and brain (9%), while the involvement of the small bowel is exceedingly rare, with only a few published case reports available. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>However, metastasis to the small bowel may be more common than caseloads suggest, and the prognosis associated with metastatic RCC is grim. Median survival time typically ranges between 6 and 12 months, with a 2-year survival rate of 10%–20%. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Therefore, educating the population on early recognition and evaluation is of utmost importance, particularly in the presence of risk factors, as stage 1 tumours have a 90% 5-year survival rate. Unfortunately, many early cases (25%) are asymptomatic, and the classic triad of flank pain, haematuria and palpable mass on physical examination is present in only 10% of individuals. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Consequently, it is essential to emphasise patient education and enhance physician awareness to improve the prognosis for individuals at risk of developing this disease.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A man in his 60 s with a medical history significant for hypertension, iron deficiency anaemia treated with iron supplements and a past diagnosis of RCC followed by a right nephrectomy and adjuvant pembrolizumab chemotherapy 6 years prior presented to the emergency department with complaints of constipation and recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting for the past week.\n\n【10】On examination, the patient exhibited hypertension, a blood pressure reading of 171/95 and tachycardia, with a heart rate of 109 beats per minute. Gastrointestinal examination findings revealed mild abdominal tenderness in all quadrants and mild distension. A CT scan revealed a small bowel obstruction likely caused by a stricture. A nasogastric tube was placed for gastric decompression. Subsequently, a small bowel series was conducted, but it failed to pass appropriately into the colon, indicating the necessity for surgical intervention. Following adequate resuscitation and correction of electrolyte imbalances, the patient was taken to the operating room for a diagnostic laparoscopy, where several centimetres of erythematous and woody small bowel were discovered as the source of the obstruction. Consequently, the laparoscopy was converted to a laparotomy, and a segment of the affected small bowel was surgically removed. A primary side-to-side anastomosis was then performed to reconnect the healthy portions of the bowel.\n\n【11】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【12】The patient had been experiencing worsening constipation for several weeks following treatment with iron supplements for anaemia. He underwent an evaluation at an external institution due to similar concerns 6 days before the present visit. During that evaluation, he was prescribed lactulose, MiraLax and Senna to alleviate his constipation. An initial abdominal and pelvic CT scan revealed a mid to distal small bowel obstruction attributed to a stricture in the small bowel. The patient did not exhibit any signs of fever or leucocytosis at the time. Non-operative management was implemented, involving nasogastric tube decompression, intravenous fluids and treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam. His condition stabilised, and he was discharged in a stable state after 3 days, with the ability to tolerate oral intake.\n\n【13】However, 删除13：<u>3 </u>days later, he presented to our institution with worsening symptoms and sought evaluation in the emergency room for suspected small bowel obstruction. A comprehensive workup was conducted, including relevant laboratory tests that showed stable microcytic anaemia indicated by a haemoglobin of 10.4 and a haematocrit level of 34.3. CT imaging revealed a partial obstruction in the small bowel with a suspected transition point located centrally in the lower abdomen. After surgical consultation, nil per os status, nasogastric decompression, intravenous fluid resuscitation and a small bowel series were recommended. Following the completion of the small bowel series, which confirmed a complete obstruction, the decision was made to proceed with surgical intervention. The patient consented to a diagnostic laparoscopy with the possibility of a laparotomy.\n\n【14】Treatment\n---------\n\n【15】After the small bowel series failed to demonstrate the appropriate contrast passage into the colon within the expected timeframe, the patient provided informed consent for a diagnostic laparoscopy with the potential need for a laparotomy. Intraoperatively, no significant adhesions were encountered, and there were no indications of peritoneal, diaphragmatic or solid organ seeding. The small bowel was then run and exhibited a 50 cm erythematous, tortuous, thickened and woody segment. Consequently, the decision was made to convert to laparotomy to resect the affected portion of the small bowel. The bowel in question was brought extracorporeally. The involved distal jejunum, proximal ileum and bulky lymphadenopathy were resected pie-shaped, and a stapled side-to-side anastomosis was created. Incidentally, a Meckel’s diverticulum was appreciated and was left in place given no signs of appreciable disease. The patient was subsequently transferred to the surgical department for postoperative care.\n\n【16】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【17】The patient’s postoperative recovery proceeded without complications. Over the following days, he demonstrated bowel activity that led to removing his nasogastric tube. He successfully tolerated a diet and experienced a complete restoration of bowel function. As a result, he was discharged home on day 6 following the operation.\n\n【18】The resected specimen was sent to the pathology department for examination. Macroscopically, the small bowel exhibited a white-tan firm area, with a thickened wall measuring 10.3 cm in circumference . This area appeared to involve the serosa, mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria and attached mesenteric tissues. The pathology report revealed the presence of metastatic RCC . The carcinoma displayed prominent necrosis, haemorrhage/thrombus and extensive sarcomatoid features involving the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, subserosa and serosa. Extensive lymphovascular invasion was also observed. Peri-intestinal lymph nodes revealed metastatic RCC involving 10 of 13 lymph nodes. The portion of the metastatic RCC without sarcomatoid features present in the resected bowel specimen displayed morphological similarity to the patient’s previously diagnosed RCC from the right nephrectomy performed 6 years prior, as well as the lymph node biopsies taken from station 7 and station 4L 5 years ago.\n\n【19】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【20】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【21】Left: The postoperative specimen of the small bowel displays a white-tan firm area with a circumferential thickened wall.

A well-healing incision was noted, with a seroma at the distal incision site, measuring the size of a golf ball. However, there were no signs of erythema or drainage. After undergoing a positron emission tomography (PET) scan 7 weeks postoperation, the patient returned for another follow-up visit. The PET scan revealed positive metastasis in three lymph nodes without reported complaints during this visit. The patient was subsequently scheduled for further management with oncology.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】RCC originates from the renal cortex. The exact causes of RCC are not fully understood, although several risk factors have been identified, including advanced age, hypertension, nephrolithiasis and polycystic kidney disease. Hereditary diseases, such as tuberous sclerosis, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Birt Hogg-Dube syndrome and exposure to certain occupational hazards like asbestos and herbicides, are also associated with an increased risk of RCC. However, most cases are sporadic and are found incidentally. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Additional imaging, such as CT or MRI with intravenous contrast, is recommended for incidentally found indeterminate renal masses, with a specific approach determined based on the Bosniak Class. 删除9：<u>5</u>\n\n【28】Treatment options for RCC are determined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system (Eighth Edition, 2017). ‘For stage I renal cell cancer measuring less than 7 cm and confined to the kidney, nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy is the treatment of choice and is usually curative…For stage II renal cell cancer, laparoscopic radical nephrectomy is the treatment of choice. For stage III renal cell cancer, open radical nephrectomy is the standard of care. Adrenalectomy or extensive lymph node dissection is only recommended when abdominal CT shows evidence of adrenal or lymph node invasion. Stage IV renal cell cancer is not curable. Treatment is palliative…’. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【29】Our patient had undergone a right radical nephrectomy 6 years prior for a right renal mass that had invaded perinephric tissues. The final pathology report showed a multifocal clear RCC with a Fuhrman grade 3. Two masses measuring 7.0 and 9.0 cm, respectively, were excised. The primary tumour was classified as T3a NX. Treatment was appropriate per the AJCC staging system (Eighth Edition, 2017), as no definitive lymph nodes were found in the specimen, and extensive lymph node dissection was not indicated. At the current presentation, small bowel metastasis advanced the patient’s stage to IV.\n\n【30】RCC often remains asymptomatic in the earlier stages and exhibits non-specific signs. The management of RCC requires a multidisciplinary approach. Mortality rates have decreased due to improved detection and treatment strategies, underscoring the importance of patient education. The prognosis of RCC significantly improves when diagnosed at earlier stages, as the 5-year survival rate drops from over 90% to below 40% once lymph node involvement occurs.\n\n【31】Other sporadic RCCs metastasis to the small bowel cases have been reported, with patients presenting symptoms such as haematochezia and anaemia. In one such case, the patient had the affected bowel segment resected and was then placed on palliative radiation therapy due to metastasis to the bone and brain. The patient passed away from complications of coronary artery disease within a few months. In the second case, the patient had the affected bowel segments resected and was not put on any systemic therapy. The patient was then put on surveillance every 6 months. In the last such case, the patient was prescribed pembrolizumab due to brain metastasis 2 months after resection. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【32】The small bowel is difficult to evaluate through endoscopic and radiological techniques; the disease, if present, is often advanced at the time of examination. The optimal imaging strategy for small bowel assessment remains unclear. Enteroscopy, performed via oral and anal approaches, is recommended and should not be limited to the upper digestive tract. CT/MR enterography is the preferred diagnostic and staging modality, while PET-CT can aid in initial diagnosis and staging, although it is not routinely recommended. Small bowel video capsule endoscopy has limitations due to its inability to obtain tissue samples and its restricted use in cases of small bowel obstruction, with a reported false negative rate of up to 18.9%. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【33】RCC is staged through Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM) classification. It defines stage IV as T4 (invasion beyond Gerota’s fascia or involvement of the ipsilateral adrenal gland), any N (lymph node metastasis), M0 (no distant metastasis) or any staging with M1 (distant metastasis). 删除9：<u>7 </u>Stage IV can be further categorised into oligometastatic disease. While definitions for oligometastatic state vary, it represents an intermediate stage between localised and widespread disease with limited metastatic growth potential, with various authors citing ≤5 metastatic lesions. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【34】Oligometastatic RCC management involves targeted local therapies like surgery or radiation, while polymetastatic disease requires systemic treatments. In managing oligometastatic RCC, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT/SABR) has been used, particularly in poor surgical candidates, due to its non-invasive nature and modest morbidity profile. SBRT involves ablation of the target lesions while sparing surrounding tissue. Surgical intervention is preferred for lesions greater than 7–8 cm. It was theorised that locally ablative therapies targeting clinically evident metastatic disease sites could improve prognosis. However, data on the topic is limited, and such treatment’s efficacy remains controversial. There is emerging evidence that SBRT may be able to reverse antitumor immunity, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. 删除9：<u>8 </u>The RAPPORT trial prospectively evaluated SBRT and immunotherapy in patients with oligometastatic RCC. The trial demonstrated total metastatic ablation’s safety and local effectiveness using radiotherapy and pembrolizumab. However, further research is needed to explore the potential benefits of SBRT and immunomodulators in this context. Patients with limited disease and short disease-free intervals may be at risk of developing additional metastasis and potentially benefit from SABR. This field of research is continuously evolving, and more studies are required to investigate the role of immunomodulators in managing oligometastatic RCC. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【35】### Learning points\n\n【36】*   Renal cell carcinoma is an unpredictable malignancy, and while the most common sites of metastasis are the lung, bone, liver and brain, it is essential not to overlook uncommon sites such as the small intestine. Metastasis can indicate a poor prognosis for this disease.\n\n【37】*   Ongoing surveillance following nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma is crucial as a significant percentage of patients (20%–50%) can still develop metastatic disease.\n\n【38】*   Managing complicated cases, as in this case, requires a multidisciplinary approach involving various medical specialities. Collaborative decision making and treatment prioritisation are necessary to ensure optimal patient care.\n\n【39】*   Both the continuous education of healthcare providers and patient education play a role in patient care. Educating patients about the signs of the disease can lead to early detection, which is crucial in improving prognosis. Healthcare providers must also stay informed about the latest medical treatments and management strategies advancements.\n\n【40】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【41】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【42】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:24:06", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:24:19", "cost": 12.883}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:24", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:24:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:24:06"}

She had long-standing poor left visual acuity (VA) due to a compressive optic neuropathy treated by surgery in childhood. She also had chronic angle closure glaucoma, treated with bilateral laser peripheral iridotomies (PIs) and left lensectomy. She was otherwise healthy with no active other medical conditions.\n\n【4】On examination, VA was 6/9.5 and 6/24 in right and left eyes, respectively. She had a left relative afferent pupillary defect, patent bilateral PIs, left pseudophakia and intraocular pressure of 12 mm Hg bilaterally. There was no evidence of intraocular inflammation. While the right optic disc was normal, the left eye had significant cupping and pallor. There was symmetrical perivascular nummular pigmentation with associated chorioretinal atrophy most notable at the superotemporal vascular arcades . Autofluorescence imaging highlighted the extent of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) atrophy in the same distribution, with less marked mottling of RPE autofluorescence nasally . Optical coherence tomography showed preserved foveal photoreceptor structures, no macular oedema/schisis and absent retinal nerve fibre layer in the left eye, in keeping with advanced optic neuropathy. Static perimetry showed advanced visual field loss in the left eye likely due to the advanced optic neuropathy and an early ring scotoma in the right eye more marked inferiorly in keeping with the distribution of retinal atrophy . Rod responses were absent on full field electroretinogram and cone responses were delayed and attenuated with the pathognomonic bright flash a-wave amplitude greater than 30 Hz flicker amplitude. Panel-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) detected a homozygous likely pathogenic mutation (c.305C>A,p.Ala102Asp) in the _NR2E3_ gene (15q23) which has been reported as responsible for autosomal recessive enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS), also known as Goldmann-Favre syndrome.\n\n【5】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【6】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【7】Widefield colour Photographs (T200x camera, Optos plc, UK) of the right (A) and left (B) eyes showing predominantly superotemporal perivascular nummular pigmentation and outer retinal atrophy/pallor.

Her medical history included iron-deficiency anaemia and previous tubal ligation 11 years ago. She presented to her general practitioner with a few months’ history of perianal pain and swelling. She was diagnosed with a perianal abscess and was initially treated with oral antibiotics with some improvement in symptoms. However, she re-presented with ongoing perianal swelling and discharge. She was reviewed by a colorectal surgeon and MRI of the pelvis was organised. This demonstrated an apparent complex fistula-in-ano arising from the anorectal junction at the 8 o’clock position, associated with a 30 mm partial horseshoe abscess that ended within the left ischiorectal fossa . Based on the MRI finding and ongoing symptoms, the decision was made to proceed to examination under anaesthesia with incision and drainage of the perianal abscess. Intraoperative findings included a foreign body within the large left ischiorectal fossa abscess cavity, found to be a Filshie tubal ligation clip , but no obvious fistula-in-ano.

Tubal occlusion/ligation via Filshie clips constituted the primary contraceptive method for 5.7% of Australian women in 2016. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Advantages of the Filshie clip over electrocoagulation include its increased reversibility, reduced risk of ectopic pregnancy and relative procedural ease. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【14】However, Filshie clips are not without complications.

Current treatment strategies are based on agents without tumour cell specificity, such as proteasome inhibitors (eg, bortezomib, carfilzomib), immunomodulatory drugs (eg, thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide) monoclonal antibodies (eg, daratumumab, elotuzumab) and conventional chemotherapy.\n\n【8】Genome sequencing of myeloma cells revealed a wide spectrum of potentially actionable mutations, including BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, FAM46C, DIS3 and others. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【9】The mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK pathway is the major signal transduction cascade that regulates cell growth. In myeloma the most frequently observed recurrent mutations involve this pathway. 删除9：<u>3 </u>An emerging therapeutic target is the BRAF V600E mutation that leads to constitutional activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling pathway and results in tumour cell growth, differentiation and survival. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【10】Oral inhibitors of BRAF-mutant kinase are approved and widely used for the treatment of BRAF-mutant melanoma. 删除9：<u>5 </u>In MM, BRAF V600E mutations are detected in 3%–10% of patients, and have been associated with rapidly progressing, relapsed or refractory disease, extramedullary disease and IgA MM, with short PFS and overall survival. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【11】The activating BRAF V600E mutation was reported to be of therapeutic relevance in MM: The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib as a single agent was evaluated in a small study of patients with BRAF-mutant MM. Although the overall response rate was 33%, median PFS of 4.3 months was short and suggested early resistance. 删除9：<u>7 </u>In experimental tumour models and in patients with malignant melanoma, MEK activation was shown to compensate for pharmacological BRAF inhibition, and combined MEK and BRAF inhibition was highly synergistic and therefore able to delay resistance. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Our hypothesis was that MM harbouring an activating mutation of BRAF could be highly vulnerable to dual BRAF and downstream MEK inhibition. Here, we describe successful treatment with a combination of dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib in a patient with refractory BRAF-mutant MM.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A man in his 70s presented with an osteolytic skull lesion, headache, bone pain, and pancytopenia without fever. Biopsy of the skull lesion revealed IgA-kappa MM with an extraordinarily high proliferation index (Ki67=70%). Cytogenetic studies indicated high-risk disease with gain of 1q and IGH-FGFR3 fusion t(4;14); serum free light chain concentrations were kappa 195 mg/L and lambda 8 mg/L, with elevated kappa/lambda ratio (24.4). At diagnosis, serum paraprotein was 13.2 g/L.\n\n【14】Standard systemic therapy with bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) was initiated, along with palliative radiotherapy to the skull (15×2.5 Gy) and to an osteolytic vertebral body (12×3 Gy). After five cycles, the patient met the criteria for very good partial response (VGPR). After two further cycles of treatment, rapid clinical and serological relapse was evident, with regrowth of the skull lesion and increased kappa light chains (936 mg/L). Carfilzomib was initiated as a salvage treatment but was unsuccessful, and kappa light chains rose to 1307 mg/L. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-CT indicated a metabolically active MM with osteolytic bone lesions, extramedullary soft tissue lesions and pleural effusion .

No new safety signals could be identified. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Interestingly, two patients under dual BRAF/MEK inhibition had new KRAS mutations at time of progression—one with the same KRAS p.G12V mutation we found in our patient.\n\n【38】In another study of 180 paired tissue biopsies of newly diagnosed and relapsed MM Xu _et al_ showed enrichment of RAS and BRAF mutations in relapsed MM compared with newly diagnosed MM. As expected, BRAF mutations were significantly associated with activated downstream signalling while only KRAS and not NRAS mutations were associated with pathway activation. 删除9：<u>3 </u>These findings correspond well with our observations.\n\n【39】MM follows multiple evolutionary pathways over a patient’s course of disease. Keats _et al_ used serial genomic analysis of samples collected at different points of progression in 28 patients. They found in a high-risk patient with t(4;14)—similar to our patient—a higher mutation rate than patients without high-risk genetic abnormalities. Different clones appeared to compete with each other depending on the selection pressure caused by therapy. 删除9：<u>13</u>\n\n【40】These observations suggest that resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibition can be mediated by selection of genetically distinct resistant clones characterised by activating mutations of RAS genes. A better understanding of resistance mechanisms could lead to the development of new therapies acting on the RAS/RAF pathway (eg, highly selective KRAS or pan-KRAS inhibitors).\n\n【41】Sequencing of BRAF provides a rapid method for detecting BRAF V600E mutations. 删除9：<u>14 </u>The presence of this mutation should be considered particularly in patients with limited treatment options such as rapidly progressive disease, IgA MM and extramedullary disease. 删除9：<u>15 </u>While the primary biopsy can be re-examined, a new bone marrow/extramedullary biopsy should be preferred at relapse, as mutations are more common in the recurrent setting. A ‘liquid biopsy’ may be an alternative to repeat bone marrow sampling to characterise the mutational landscape that developed during clonal selection in response to the specific treatment.\n\n【42】Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition represents a promising strategy for treating BRAF V600-mutated MM. More information is required regarding the long-term success rate and optimal treatment regimen at relapse.

Multiphase abdominal MRI on hospital day (HOD) 3 showed interval enlargement of aneurysm, measuring 3.9×3.1 cm, and again noted three stable lesions consistent with abscesses . Given the interval enlargement of aneurysm, the concern for a mycotic aneurysm was raised, and infectious disease and vascular surgery were consulted. CT angiography of the abdomen obtained on HOD 5 demonstrated worsening inflammatory changes in the porta hepatis, including new wall thickening of the aneurysm and diffuse periportal oedema. A significant regional mass effect had developed, causing near complete luminal narrowing of the proper hepatic artery. There was an interval change in the enhancement pattern of the vascular lesion , which showed minimal filling on the arterial phase, presumably due to compromised arterial supply and uniform opacification on the portal venous phase.\n\n【30】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【31】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【32】Contrast enhanced MRI of liver.

The patient was not considered a candidate for surgical intervention due to the risk of blood loss and the benefits of coiling or intervening on an enlarging aneurysm were thought to outweigh the risks of endovascular management in a potentially infected space. In preparation for planned endovascular coiling, catheter angiography of the proper hepatic artery was conducted on HOD 6. This demonstrated a lack of opacification of the aneurysm sac  suggestive of thrombosis. There was significant narrowing of mid and proximal portion of the proper hepatic artery, possibly due to compression from the adjacent thrombosed aneurysm, similar to that seen on the previous CT. To further evaluate the vascular supply to this lesion, portal venous angiography was performed on HOD 7 . This showed no appreciable communication between the vascular lesion and the portal vein. On HOD 7, drainage catheters were placed under ultrasound guidance in the two right hepatic liver abscesses.

Susceptibility testing demonstrated that the isolate was sensitive to ampicillin (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 0.25), meropenem (MIC 0.125), penicillin (MIC 0.25) and TMP/SMX (MIC 0.032). All abscesses decreased in size on repeat liver CTs on HOD 13 and HOD 20, and the hepatic artery aneurysm remained thrombosed. Percutaneous drains were removed due to minimal drainage, and the patient was discharged in good condition on HOD 23 with outpatient intravenous ampicillin until the resolution of undrained liver abscess on imaging. A repeat CT of her liver done at 5 weeks of treatment demonstrated ongoing improvement in abscess size. She was switched to oral amoxicillin with a plan for repeat imaging.

The patient was not considered a candidate for surgical intervention due to the risk of blood loss and the benefits of coiling or intervening on an enlarging aneurysm were thought to outweigh the risks of endovascular management in a potentially infected space. In preparation for planned endovascular coiling, catheter angiography of the proper hepatic artery was conducted on HOD 6. This demonstrated a lack of opacification of the aneurysm sac  suggestive of thrombosis. There was significant narrowing of mid and proximal portion of the proper hepatic artery, possibly due to compression from the adjacent thrombosed aneurysm, similar to that seen on the previous CT. To further evaluate the vascular supply to this lesion, portal venous angiography was performed on HOD 7 . This showed no appreciable communication between the vascular lesion and the portal vein. On HOD 7, drainage catheters were placed under ultrasound guidance in the two right hepatic liver abscesses.

In preparation for planned endovascular coiling, catheter angiography of the proper hepatic artery was conducted on HOD 6. This demonstrated a lack of opacification of the aneurysm sac  suggestive of thrombosis. There was significant narrowing of mid and proximal portion of the proper hepatic artery, possibly due to compression from the adjacent thrombosed aneurysm, similar to that seen on the previous CT. To further evaluate the vascular supply to this lesion, portal venous angiography was performed on HOD 7 . This showed no appreciable communication between the vascular lesion and the portal vein. On HOD 7, drainage catheters were placed under ultrasound guidance in the two right hepatic liver abscesses. The third abscess was in an anatomical position unamenable to drainage.\n\n【37】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【38】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 5\n\n【39】Digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) of the common hepatic artery shows no opacification of the aneurysm (A).

All abscesses decreased in size on repeat liver CTs on HOD 13 and HOD 20, and the hepatic artery aneurysm remained thrombosed. Percutaneous drains were removed due to minimal drainage, and the patient was discharged in good condition on HOD 23 with outpatient intravenous ampicillin until the resolution of undrained liver abscess on imaging. A repeat CT of her liver done at 5 weeks of treatment demonstrated ongoing improvement in abscess size. She was switched to oral amoxicillin with a plan for repeat imaging.

With increased use of methadone, there has been increasing reporting of less commonly reported side effects (ie, hypoglycaemia). Here, we describe a woman in her 70s with history of opioid use disorder on methadone, stage 4 chronic kidney disease and prior hypoglycaemic episodes who initially presented with perforated gastric ulcer requiring surgical repair. Her perioperative course was complicated by profound hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. Given concern for methadone-induced hypoglycaemia, methadone was discontinued with monitoring of subsequent blood glucose, insulin, C peptide, proinsulin, β-hydroxybutyrate and blood methadone levels. As the serum methadone levels decreased, insulin levels substantially decreased in parallel. After 21 days off methadone, dextrose infusion was discontinued with restoration of euglycaemia. In a patient with hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and methadone use, it is important to consider discontinuing methadone and re-evaluate fasting glucose levels prior to an extensive and invasive insulinoma workup.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   Endocrine system\n*   Psychiatry (drugs and medicines)\n*   Drugs: endocrine system\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

This case uniquely demonstrates normalisation of blood glucose levels through repeated supervised fasts after methadone was held, a finding not reported in current literature.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A woman in her 70s was admitted following acute onset of abdominal pain from perforated gastric ulcer. The perioperative period was notable for profound hypoglycaemia. She has a history significant for opioid use disorder and had been prescribed methadone for over three decades, incidentally found hepatitis C infection with spontaneous clearance without cirrhosis, class 2 obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 38 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , hypertension and stable stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) of unclear aetiology. She reported episodes of confusion, non-sensical speech, blurry vision and diaphoresis that occurred when skipping a meal. Those symptoms did not occur when she ate three meals per day with a snack at bedtime. She had two prior evaluations for hypoglycaemia 4 and 2 years before her current admission at outside hospitals.\n\n【13】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【14】Four years prior to her current admission, she presented with transient right arm weakness with a point-of-care (POC) glucose of 20 mg/dL. She had resolution of her symptoms with intravenous dextrose. A CT scan of the head without contrast did not show acute changes. With a serum glucose of 3.2 mmol/L (58 mg/dL), an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> and a serum creatinine of 229.9 µmol/L (2.6 mg/dL, similar to her baseline value), she had an insulin level of 18.5 µU/mL and a C peptide of 1.89 ng/mL. The patient’s glucose level rose by less than 1.4 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) following intravenous glucagon administration. Her home medications were methadone 115 mg daily and amlodipine 5 mg daily. She denied alcohol intake or illicit drug use.\n\n【15】Sulfonylurea ingestion was ruled out with a negative hypoglycemic agent screen and insulin autoimmune syndrome was ruled out with a negative insulin autoantibody test. Non-invasive imaging techniques for insulinoma localisation, including CT and MRI studies of the abdomen with contrast, were contraindicated due to renal impairment. Endoscopic ultrasonography did not detect any pancreatic lesions. Based on these results, it was suspected that hypoglycaemia was multifactorial from methadone-induced hyperinsulinaemia and impaired clearance of methadone metabolites and gluconeogenesis from kidney dysfunction. Methadone was tapered down from 115 to 15 mg daily, which led to the resolution of hypoglycaemia.\n\n【16】Two years prior to her current admission, the patient was admitted to an outside hospital with confusion, blurry vision and diaphoresis. She had profound hypoglycaemia with a plasma glucose level of 1.8 mmol/L (33 mg/dL). She demonstrated pathological endogenous hyperinsulinaemia with an insulin level of 46.5 µU/mL and C peptide of 34.3 ng/mL. Her random cortisol level at 12:50 pm was 0.8 µmol/L (27 µg/dL), excluding adrenal insufficiency. During this admission her serum creatinine was 194.5 µmol/L (2.2 mg/dL) with an eGFR of 22 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> when the insulinoma workup was initially sent. At that time, she was prescribed methadone 105 mg daily. The patient was started on prednisone 20 mg two times per day and methadone was tapered to 40 mg daily on discharge. By the end of her hospital stay, her glucose levels stably ranged from 4.4 mmol/L (80 mg/dL) to 7.7 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). She was advised to taper methadone and prednisone, and transition to buprenorphine/naloxone. The patient had received outpatient care outside our institution prior to her current admission; however, records were not accessible through our electronic medical record. Although the medical history provided by the patient was limited, she reports not completing evaluation besides the inpatient evaluations from prior to her current admission. She continued to have repeated episodes of confusion, non-sensical speech, blurry vision and diaphoresis that occurred when skipping a meal that she self-managed with frequent snacking while on methadone.\n\n【17】She presented with a perforated gastric ulcer which led to emergent surgery where she underwent a graham patch repair during her current admission. Her preoperative period was notable for symptomatic hypoglycaemia, with a nadir serum glucose level of 1.94 mmol/L (35 mg/dL). At this time, she was prescribed methadone 60 mg daily. Her weight on admission was 115 kg.

Despite recovering after surgery and maintaining her caloric intake, the patient continued to be hypoglycaemic (blood glucose as low as 1.2 mmol/L or 36 mg/dL) 2 weeks later. At that time, she was switched to buprenorphine/naloxone.\n\n【22】删除4：<u>Table 2 and figure 1 summarise the laboratory results during repeated supervised fasts for evaluation of hypoglycaemia in addition to diagnostic criteria for different causes of hypoglycaemia.

Three days after methadone discontinuation, she was maintained on a solution of 50% dextrose in water infused at a rate of 25 mL/hour in addition to meals to maintain a target glucose level of 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL). The first monitored fast was conducted and found that after an hour after stopping the dextrose solution, her plasma glucose dropped to 2.9 mmol/L (52 mg/dL) with associated confusion and drowsiness. Additional labs drawn at the same time showed an insulin level of 7.4 µU/mL, C peptide of 1.05 ng/mL, proinsulin of 8.9 pmol/L and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) of 0.03 mmol/L. Serum methadone level was 610 ng/mL (therapeutic range 100–400 ng/mL). A serum creatinine was 247.6 µmol/L (2.8 mg/dL) and her eGFR was 19 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> .

Seven hours after discontinuing the dextrose solution and her diet, her serum glucose dropped to 1.2 mmol/L (36 mg/dL), with an insulin level of 7.7 μU/mL, C peptide of 0.94 ng/mL, proinsulin of 7.9 pmol/L and BHB of 0.03 mmol/L. At this time, the patient’s serum methadone level was 410 ng/mL. Her serum creatinine was 229.9 µmol/L (2.6 mg/dL) with an associated eGFR of 21 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . The results of all three supervised fasts are shown in figures 1 and 2 .\n\n【33】Fourteen days after methadone discontinuation, the patient’s maintenance fluid was decreased to 20% dextrose in water infused at a rate of 30 mL/hour. Fourteen hours after stopping this solution and beginning the fast, her serum glucose dropped to 2.7 mmol/L (49 mg/dL), with an associated insulin level of 4.4 μU/mL, C peptide of 0.58 ng/mL, proinsulin of 4.7 pmol/L and BHB of 0.15 mmol/L. Her serum creatinine level was 247.6 µmol/L (2.8 mg/dL) and eGFR was 20 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . Serum methadone level was 99 ng/mL.\n\n【34】She underwent endoscopic ultrasonography which did not detect distinct pancreatic lesions. A selective arterial calcium-stimulation test was attempted as an additional test for tumour localisation. Insulin levels did not rise by twofold within 90 and 120 s of calcium stimulation in the distal splenic artery and proper hepatic artery, which would localise to the body and tail of pancreas; of note, however, most samples drawn were haemolysed and were unable to be used to detect insulin levels.\n\n【35】Twenty-one days after methadone discontinuation, the dextrose infusion was stopped without recurrence of hypoglycaemia. Serum methadone level was undetectable then. She was made NPO the following day for 24 hours and POC glucose checks showed stable readings ranging between 4.6 mmol/L (82 mg/dL) and 5.2 mmol/L (93 mg/dL). The patient was medically stable and was ultimately discharged. Her methadone prescription was changed to buprenorphine/naloxone.\n\n【36】Outcome and Follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【37】The patient responded well to buprenorphine/naloxone without any side effects. About 6 months following her admission and the initiation of buprenorphine/naloxone, she reported that she no longer had abnormally low POC glucose levels or confusion when skipping a meal. Furthermore, her fasting POC glucose levels were in the 4.4–5.0 mmol/L (80–90 mg/dL) range.\n\n【38】Discussion\n----------\n\n【39】This case demonstrated evidence of endogenous hyperinsulinaemia in a patient who had no localising pancreatic lesions with reversible hypoglycaemia as serum methadone levels tapered off, suggesting methadone-induced hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. Whipple’s triad, a clinical trio of symptoms which suggests the presence of an insulinoma, was established by the presence of neuroglycopenic symptoms when her glucose was less than 3.1 mmol/L (55 mg/dL), with resolution of symptoms after treatment. When the plasma glucose concentrations were 1.8 mmol/L (33 mg/dL), 2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) and 2.9 mmol/L (52 mg/dL), the insulin concentrations were greater than 3.0 μIU/mL and the C peptide concentrations were greater than 0.6 ng/mL, confirming endogenous hyperinsulinaemia. Although the patient has stage 4 CKD with an eGFR of 20–25, significant decreased renal insulin metabolism is not expected in a non-diabetic patient with renal disease until the eGFR level falls to less than 15–20 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . 删除9：<u>26 27 </u>Additionally, her serum creatinine levels and calculated eGFR drawn concurrently with insulinoma workups did not vary significantly and were near her baseline creatinine of 229.9 µmol/L (2.6 mg/dL), eGFR of 20–22 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> (range: 194.5–247.6 µmol/L; eGFR 19–21 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ). Therefore, renal insufficiency alone is unlikely to explain this degree of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in this case.\n\n【40】The patient underwent repeat evaluations during multiple admissions, which excluded other causes of hypoglycaemia, including exogenous insulin use, sulfonylurea ingestion and insulin autoimmune syndrome. There were several clinical findings that were not consistent with insulinoma. First, while on methadone, this patient did not respond to intravenous glucagon as plasma glucose concentration did not rise by at least 1.4 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) despite being well nourished (BMI 38 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and having no evidence of hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Second, no discrete lesion was identified on endoscopic ultrasound. Third, during her final supervised fast when the methadone level decreased to 99 ng/mL, her C peptide and proinsulin levels were no longer inappropriately elevated, and glucose levels remained in normal range.\n\n【41】There are two retrospective studies 20 23 and eight case reports of hypoglycaemia in the setting of methadone use. 删除9：<u>14–19 21 22 </u>The lowest reported glucose level was 0.6 mmol/L (10 mg/dL), 删除13：<u>22 </u>with a median of 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) and range between 0.6 mmol/L (10 mg/dL) and 2.4 mmol/L (44 mg/dL).

Similar to our case presentation, testing for sulfonylurea and metabolic causes of hypoglycaemia was negative. An 18-hour fasting challenge was performed and the patient remained euglycaemic on hospital day 14 after methadone had been cleared from the child’s system. We noted a similar phenomenon when our patient had low serum methadone levels, she remained euglycaemic for longer periods of time without the need for dextrose supplementation. Li and colleagues reported the case of a woman in her 50s with opioid use disorder who presented with respiratory failure and refractory hypoglycaemia (2.1–2.6 mmol/L) 4 hours after the ingestion of 1000 mg of methadone. 删除9：<u>21 </u>Dextrose was able to be weaned off 54-hours after ingestion. Fung _et al_ presented a similar case of an otherwise healthy woman in her 20s who presented with altered mental status following the ingestion of 800 mg of methadone and was found to have hypoglycaemia with a blood glucose of 0.6 mmol/L (10 mg/dL). 删除9：<u>22</u>\n\n【43】Masharani _et al_ outline the case of a woman in her late 30s with obesity, stage 3 CKD (eGFR 30–60) and back pain on methadone 160 mg every 6 hours as needed who presented with Whipple’s triad. 删除9：<u>17 </u>She had endogenous hyperinsulinaemia (insulin of 8.5 µU/mL, C peptide of 2.7 ng/mL, proinsulin of 49 pmol/L and BHB of 0.15 mmol/L) with a serum glucose level of 2.4 mmol/L (44 mg/dL). Sulfonylurea screen and insulin autoantibodies were negative. She had a normal cosyntropin stimulation test. Endoscopic ultrasound and 68 gallium-labelled octreotide positron emission tomography/CT were negative. Methadone was tapered off and she was transitioned to buprenorphine with resolution of the hypoglycaemia the following day. Also described is a brief case of a patient on dialysis and 240 mg of methadone daily who developed episodes of symptomatic hypoglycaemia (up to 1.2 mmol/L) that resolved after methadone dose reduction to 100 mg daily.\n\n【44】Maingi _et al_ described a case of a man in his mid 40s with rectosigmoid cancer, renal failure and malabsorption on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) infusion for 18 hours a day. 删除9：<u>18 </u>When his fentanyl patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA) for cancer pain was changed to methadone, he developed symptomatic hypoglycaemia that resolved only after methadone infusion was stopped. Gjedsted _et al_ presented a similar case of a female child with acute lymphatic leukaemia and cancer pain. 删除9：<u>19 </u>When intravenous fentanyl was changed to intravenous methadone and the dose was escalated from 860 mg/24 hours to 1560 mg/24 hours, blood glucose declined from the range of 5.6–11.1 mmol/L (100–200 mg/dL) to 1.1–1.7 mmol/L (20–30 mg/dL). Reduction of the dose of methadone normalised the blood glucose.\n\n【45】Moryl _et al_ conducted a chart review of 59 patients on methadone for cancer pain and reported 11 patients with a glucose level <3.9 mmol/L (mean level of 3.0 mmol/L, range of 1.3–3.7 mmol/L) precipitated by dose escalation. 删除9：<u>20 </u>In a retrospective observational study, Flory and colleagues found a significant increased risk of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with methadone at doses greater than 40 mg/day (p < 0.01). Logistic multivariable regression showed a significant association between methadone and hypoglycaemia with an OR of 2.2 (95% CI (1.6–2.9)) and a dose-response relationship with an OR of 3.1 (95% CI (2.5–3.6)) when doses were greater than 80 mg/day. 删除9：<u>23</u>\n\n【46】Our study has a few limitations. First, the generalisability of our study is limited as we are only able to draw conclusions from one case. The sensitivity for detecting insulinomas by endoscopic ultrasound is poor (75–83%) and a lesion may have been missed during this examination. 删除9：<u>28 </u>The gold standard diagnostic test for insulinoma localisation, the selective calcium arterial stimulation test (SACST), was inadequate due to haemolysed samples in the proximal splenic artery, gastroduodenal artery and superior mesenteric artery, which would localise to the head, neck and body of the pancreas, respectively. We did not repeat the SACST because the results of the hypoglycaemia evaluation during the third supervised fast were available and no longer consistent with an insulinoma (C peptide was <0.6 ng/mL and proinsulin was <5 pmol/L despite a glucose level of 2.7 mmol/L). The insulin level, although drastically decreased over time, is only mildly above the reference range and we believe this is in part related to the poor kidney clearance. Second, when the serum methadone level was undetectable, the patient underwent a short fast of 24-hour duration, which preserved her blood glucose levels in 4.6–5.2 mmol/L (82–93 mg/dL) range. About two-thirds of patients with insulinoma have hypoglycaemia within the first day of fasting and 85–95% have hypoglycaemia within 48 hours. 删除9：<u>29 </u>We did not pursue the standard 72 hours duration of the fast because we had a low clinical suspicion for an insulinoma and the patient was otherwise ready for hospital discharge.\n\n【47】Hypoglycaemia is now listed as one of the potential adverse effects of methadone in the setting of overdose or dose escalation in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 删除9：<u>30 </u>Further prospective studies are needed to determine the prevalence of new-onset hypoglycaemia in methadone users in addition to establishing the biochemical cause of hypoglycaemia in diverse patient populations with or without other hypoglycaemic risk factors. We believe providers should consider high doses of methadone as a potential aetiology in a patient with recurrent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and consider tapering off methadone prior to undergoing an extensive and invasive insulinoma workup.\n\n【48】### Learning points\n\n【49】*   Excess methadone use may clinically present as an insulinoma; however, the annual incidence of insulinoma is 1–4 in one million, whereas the number of methadone prescriptions yearly is increasing.\n\n【50】*   Consider methadone-induced hypoglycaemia in a patient with laboratory evidence of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia with concurrent use of methadone, in addition to other causes of hypoglycaemia (eg, exogenous insulin use, sulfonylurea ingestion and insulin autoimmune syndrome) ruled out.\n\n【51】*   The gold standard for diagnosis of insulinoma is a selective calcium arterial stimulation test, which is a time-consuming, invasive and costly study. Therefore, consider discontinuing high dose methadone in patients with hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and re-evaluate fasting glucose levels prior to invasive/extensive workup for insulinoma.\n\n【52】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【53】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【54】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:58:51", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:59:20", "cost": 28.38}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:24", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:59:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:58:51"}

There were no soft tissue abnormalities detected intraorally. Extraoral examination revealed no abnormalities. Radiographical examination revealed a proximal radiolucency involving the pulp with thin dentinal walls and an open apex . The tooth elicited negative response to thermal and electric pulp testing. Based on the clinical and radiographical findings, a diagnosis of pulp necrosis with asymptomatic apical periodontitis was made. The treatment plan included apexification with mineral trioxide aggregate and reinforcement of the dentinal walls with flowable composite followed by postendodontic restoration using a post and core.\n\n【5】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【6】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【7】(A) Preoperative photograph.

Rubber dam isolation was carried out, and access cavity preparation was done under magnification loupes (3.5×, Zumax). Following pulp extirpation, the tooth was negotiated with a #15 K file (Dentsply Maillefer, Oklahoma, USA). Working length was determined using an apex locator (Root ZX Mini; J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan) and was confirmed with an intraoral periapical radiograph. The biomechanical preparation was carried out using #80 K file with frequent irrigation using 2.5% sodium hypochlorite with a side vented needle. This was followed by irrigation with 17% EDTA and a final rinse with saline. A Ca(OH) <sub>2 </sub> intracanal medicament was placed after drying the canal with paper points followed by temporisation of the tooth using Cavit (3M ESPE, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA). In the second visit after 2 weeks, under rubber dam isolation, the canal was thoroughly irrigated using 2.5% sodium hypochlorite followed by saline to wash out any remnants of the calcium hydroxide dressing. After drying the canal with suitable paper points, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) (MTA Plus, Dentsply Tulsa) apexification was carried out using MTA carrier to create the apical plug. An apical barrier of 4 mm was established . A finger plugger was used to evaluate the setting of MTA followed by the reinforcement of the canal walls on the same day since the remaining dentin thickness of the walls was less. Etching of the canal was carried out using 37% phosphoric acid for 15 s; saline irrigation was carried out and dried with paper points. A micro applicator tip was used to apply a thin coating of dentin bonding agent and it was then light cured. A flowable composite resin, G-aenial Universal Flo (GC, India), was injected into the canal and a light transmitting post, Luminex (Dentatus, Weissman Technology), was inserted centrally.\n\n【9】Excess material was removed from the access cavity and a light-curing tip was placed at the end of the post for curing the flowable composite. The post was then removed with a rotating and pulling motion . In the space left after post removal, the post was luted with an adhesive resin cement (Maxcem Elite Kerr Self-cure; Kerr, Orange, California, USA) . The core build-up was done with a core buildup material (LuxaCore Z; DMG, Hamburg, Germany) followed by tooth preparation and recording of the impression.

This huge number of cells (each with multiple mechanisms of oncogenesis) has resulted in over 150 types of cancer, 删除13：<u>2 </u>with countless more subtypes and variants. Thus, each malignancy is unique and cancer patients need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. To address this challenge, clinical oncologists use various classification schemes to group cancer patients into a framework via which educated treatment decisions can be made. The most used standardised classification system is from the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) which considers a cancer’s histology, location and extent of involvement which groups each patient’s cancer into a specific type and stage. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Once a patient has been appropriately staged, national guidelines exist for best standard of care practices allowing standardisation of treatment.\n\n【9】Despite our best efforts to classify the vast diversity of cancers, however, there remain challenging cases which do not fit this traditional model. These unique cancers present challenging clinical situations for oncologic healthcare providers, as there are rarely, if ever, clinical studies that directly apply. Best practice in these unique situations is for multidisciplinary (and in this case, multisite) evaluation by an experienced and diverse group of healthcare providers.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A man in his 70s previously diagnosed with a high risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate, with an initial Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) as high as 88 ng/mL and Gleason grade group 4 disease, received definitive treatment with external beam radiation therapy and low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy 11 years ago. In his primary course of radiation, he received 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes followed by an LDR brachytherapy boost to the prostate for an additional 110 Gy delivered via通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>125 </sup></u> I seed implantation. He did well for the following 10 years until he developed lower urinary tract symptoms which prompted him to be evaluated via cystoscopy which identified a necrotic tumour involving the posterior bladder wall and bladder neck. He underwent transurethral resection of a bladder tumour with pathology reporting a high-grade adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for GDX2, CEA, SATB2, Villin and CK20 and negative for CK7, NKX3-1, PAP and PSA. The morphology and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with colorectal primary. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Colonoscopy was recommended which was done soon afterwards which was negative for any evidence of a rectal lesion.\n\n【12】He underwent a restaging axumin PET/CT which showed increased uptake in the prostate as well as a left inguinal lymph node which was slightly enlarged at 1.3 cm in maximum dimension. An MRI of the pelvis showed an enlarged and heterogeneous prostate gland along with nodularity in the posterior urinary bladder wall contiguous with the prostate, suggestive of recurrent prostate cancer. He was found to have an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of 11.1 ng/mL (normal is <2.5 ng/mL) and slightly elevated cancer antigen 19–9 of 35.5 U/mL (normal<35 U/mL) however his PSA remained low at 0.021 ng/mL. Given discordant imaging, tumour markers and pathology a CARIS genomic prevalence score (GPS) 5 was ordered which also favoured a colorectal cancer primary.\n\n【13】The patient was presented at a multidisciplinary genitourinary and gastrointestinal tumour board and after discussion, it was uncertain whether the case was a primary bladder cancer, recurrent prostate cancer or locally advanced rectal cancer. The recommendation of the tumour board was for the patient to undergo surgical resection either via cystoprostatectomy or pelvic exenteration however the patient refused surgery. Despite multiple visits with a surgical specialist, the patient remained steadfast that he was not interested in surgery. He was thus referred to radiation oncology for consideration for reirradiation. He was counselled on the increase risks of complications associated with reirradiation but decided to proceed with radiotherapy. 删除9：<u>6–9 </u>He received reirradiation initially with external beam radiation to 45 Gy in 25 fractions with concurrent capecitabine followed by an interstitial high dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost to the prostate as well as the area of nodularity in the posterior bladder wall and bladder neck identified on MRI.\n\n【14】An FDG PET/CT performed at 6 months after radiation therapy revealed a single enlarged left-sided mesorectal lymph node consistent with recurrence however despite this progression his PSA remained undetectable off androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The lymph node was treated with Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) to a total dose of 35 Gy in five fractions. A CT scan obtained 2 months after treatment revealed a decrease in size in the mesorectal lymph node. An additional CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis 5 months after his SBRT treatment revealed stable disease. He is currently doing well post-treatment but is experiencing urinary retention secondary to his multiple therapies. A foley has been placed secondary to these symptoms and he is to undergo placement of a suprapubic catheter.\n\n【15】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【16】When the patient initially began experiencing lower urinary tract symptoms and a cystoscopy demonstrated a mass involving the bladder, the patient underwent imaging studies including a pelvic MRI with and without contrast. The MRI revealed a markedly heterogeneous appearance of the prostate gland with no definitive abnormality pertaining to the rectum and no evidence of metastatic disease in the pelvis . FDG PET/CT-imaging was also performed which revealed intensely FDG-avid region along the prostate/bladder neck with a maximum standardised uptake value 15.0 consistent with malignancy . Tumour markers included PSA of 0.021 ng/mL, CEA significantly elevated at 11.1 ng/mL (normal is <2.5 ng/mL), and cancer antigen 19–9 slightly elevated at 35.5 U/mL (normal is <35 U/mL). CARIS-GPS testing was done which is a complex molecular analysis of the cancer’s genetic profile intended to identify patients who are good candidates for targeted therapies. 删除9：<u>5 </u>This test was consistent with colorectal carcinoma.\n\n【17】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【18】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【19】MRI showing the prostatic lesion invading into the bladder.</u>\n\n【20】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【21】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【22】PET scan showing PET positive disease in the prostate.</u>\n\n【23】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【24】The differential diagnosis favoured a malignancy secondary to the imaging characteristics. This included a recurrent prostate cancer, a bladder primary or another malignancy. A biopsy was obtained, and the tumour markers included a highly elevated CEA and a low PSA which were most consistent with a primary colorectal cancer. Other diagnosis included tuberculosis and inflammatory tissue involving the bladder and prostate secondary to the patient’s previous radiation therapy.\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】No specific guidelines exist for management of the unique circumstances of the presented case. As this patient developed a cancer in a previous radiation field, recommended treatment, extrapolated from management of recurrent primary rectal and prostate cancers, was surgical resection. In this case, surgical resection would include at least a cystoprostatectomy which involves removal of the prostate and urinary bladder followed by placement of urostomies bilaterally. This would likely be followed by adjuvant therapy which would include ADT (for prostate cancer) or FOLFOX chemotherapy (for rectal cancer).\n\n【27】Given the patient’s refusal to undergo surgery, he was instead offered reirradiation via a combination of external beam and HDR brachytherapy. He underwent a planning session for external beam radiation therapy and received treatment to a volume which included the entire prostate, area of nodularity in the posterior bladder wall and bladder neck plus a 5 mm margin. External beam radiation treatment was delivered to a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions using intensity modulated radiation therapy with twice daily capecitabine (dose of 825 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) taken on the days he received radiation therapy  After completion of the external beam radiation therapy, he underwent two HDR interstitial brachytherapy treatments to a total dose of 19 Gy in two fractions . The brachytherapy boost was prescribed a volume including the entire prostate as well as the area of nodularity in the posterior bladder wall and neck identified on MRI with no margin.\n\n【28】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【29】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【30】External beam radiation plan.</u>\n\n【31】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【32】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【33】Brachytherapy treatment plan.</u>\n\n【34】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【35】Immediately following completion of his second brachytherapy treatment, the patient developed urinary hesitation and straining which prompted an emergency room (ER) visit. He was prescribed antibiotics and sent home with a Foley catheter. Two months after the completion of treatment, he was seen in routine follow-up evaluation, and was doing well. He underwent imaging studies at this time including a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, which revealed no evidence of metastatic disease and no evidence of regional or distant metastasis.\n\n【36】Approximately 6 months after treatment, he developed worsening urinary retention with distention of the bladder causing pain and discomfort. He was again seen in the ER where he was encouraged to perform straight catheterisation however, he was reluctant to perform this procedure and eventually had a foley catheter placed.\n\n【37】A CT scan of the pelvis obtained approximately 4 months status post the completion of therapy revealed a new enlarged mesorectal lymph node . An FDG-PET scan revealed a single enlarged left-sided mesorectal fat lymph node demonstrating increased radiotracer activity and presumably reflecting metastasis. There was no other site of FDG avid disease including within the prostate. He agreed on proceeding with further radiation therapy to the mesorectal lymph node and received five fractions of 7 Gy per fraction via SBRT to the enlarged lymph node to a total dose of 35 Gy. SBRT was prescribed to a volume which included the enlarged lymph node plus a 5 mm margin and was delivered on a TrueBeam Linear Accelerator with 6 MV photons.\n\n【38】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【39】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 5\n\n【40】Enlarged perirectal lymph node.</u>\n\n【41】A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis approximately 5 months status post therapy did not reveal any evidence of recurrent disease and a stable appearing meso-rectal lymph node.\n\n【42】Discussion\n----------\n\n【43】This case presented numerous clinical challenges. First, this patient’s cancer did not fit into our traditional site-specific framework for cancer stratification. Given the patient’s oncologic history and location of recurrent tumour in the prostate and posterior bladder wall, it was initially believed to be recurrent prostate cancer. Morphology and immunohistochemical staining of his TURP specimen, which was obtained for non-oncologic purposes, however, was most consistent with a primary colorectal cancer. Additionally, his PSA remained low which was inconsistent with prostate cancer recurrence, and he was found to have elevated CEA level more than four times the upper normal limit which is typically associated with colorectal cancer. 删除9：<u>10 </u>Subsequent CARIS-GPS testing was ordered which favoured a colorectal primary suggesting that this tumour may be a new primary colorectal cancer. A colonoscopy was ordered to evaluate for this, but no rectal mass or lesion was identified. Colorectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed on prostate biopsy is rare but has been previously described. A case series published in 2007 identified nine such cases. 删除9：<u>11 </u>All of these cases were subsequently found to have either direct extension of the primary tumour to the rectum or a distant site of colorectal cancer. Only one patient had previously received radiation therapy. Metastatic colorectal carcinoma metastatic to the prostate is also exceptionally rare but has been described. 删除9：<u>12</u>\n\n【44】As this patient’s cancer did not fit into any traditional framework, providing an educated treatment decisions required considering evidence and standard practice from other cancer sites including prostate and rectal cancer. This exemplifies the importance of evaluation by a multidisciplinary oncologic team and, if necessary, across different cancer sites. This patient was evaluated by both gastrointestinal and genitourinary multidisciplinary tumour boards and the consensus was for surgical resection, which the patient refused.\n\n【45】As patient was refusing surgery, he was considered for reirradiation. This presents another clinical challenge as reirradiation is associated with poor outcomes and high toxicity. 删除9：<u>6–8 </u>Treating to an ablative dose of radiation usually requires a biologic effective dose of >~100 Gy, however the nearby organs at risk are still affected by his prior course of radiation 10 years ago, giving them a lower tolerance for radiation-related toxicities. 删除9：<u>9 13 </u>After reviewing this patient’s prior radiation field and current extent of disease, it was deemed feasible to provide an ablative dose (while sparing nearby rectum and bladder) via a combination of external beam radiation plus a brachytherapy boost. To minimise the field of reirradiation, only gross disease was targeted with no attempt to electively treat microscopic disease. This strategy was similar to a recent case describing definitive radiation treatment for synchronous colorectal and prostate cancers. 删除9：<u>14</u>\n\n【46】Another unique feature of this case was administration of concurrent chemotherapy. In the management of prostate cancer, radiation is usually administered alone or in combination with ADT. Radiation treatment for a rectal cancer, however, usually employs concurrent chemotherapy as 5-Fluorouracila (5-FU) or capecitabine has been shown to improve survival in rectal cancer patients and is well tolerated. 删除9：<u>15 </u>Given this tumour’s location, the radiation field was more typical of a prostate cancer and thus the patient was treated with a course of radiation commonly used in prostate cancer patients including external beam radiation to the pelvis followed by an interstitial brachytherapy boost. Given his primary tumour histology and tumour markers, however, he was treated concurrently with capecitabine.\n\n【47】Finally, it is important to consider the possibility that this patient’s cancer was radiation induced. Although widely utilised in the treatment of many types of cancer, radiation treatment is associated with increased risk of a secondary malignancy in the radiation field. 删除9：<u>16 </u>For prostate cancer patients receiving radiation, this includes an increased risk for secondary rectal and bladder cancers which are well-reported late toxicities of pelvic radiation. 删除9：<u>17 18 </u>This risk may increase to be as high as 1 in 70 patients for patients surviving >10 years after radiation however distinguishing between radiation induced malignancies versus recurrent cancer versus de novo new primary cancers is not always possible. 删除9：<u>19 </u>Regardless, radiation treatment is often utilised even in the setting of a radiation-induced malignancy, although this should be done with caution due to reirradiation of normal tissues. 删除9：<u>7–9</u>\n\n【48】### Learning points\n\n【49】*   This is a rare case of an adenocarcinoma with colorectal histology and genomic profile which is in the prostate and bladder.\n\n【50】*   Not all malignancies fit into conventional oncologic classification models. Management of these unique cases requires extrapolation from other disease sites.\n\n【51】*   Best practice involves coordinated decision by a multidisciplinary oncologic team.\n\n【52】*   Definitive reirradiation is feasible, but caution must be exercised due to higher risk of toxicity.\n\n【53】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【54】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【55】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:22:30", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:23:55", "cost": 84.716}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:24", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:23:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:22:30"}

She appeared well and the physical examination only showed bilateral cervical adenopathy and exudative tonsils. Rapid antigenic detection test for group A Streptococci and reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. She was discharged home with symptomatic treatment for suspected viral pharyngitis.\n\n【11】Two days later, she consulted another emergency department because of persistent fever and new-onset epigastric pain despite improving sore throat. She denied past or current drug use.\n\n【12】On examination, she appeared very unwell, blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate was 110/min and body temperature was 35.8°C. Oropharyngeal examination showed a small right submandibular adenopathy, an erythematous throat and bilateral tonsillitis. Epigastric tenderness, hepatomegaly and right hypochondrium pain were present. A right gluteal pain was elicited on palpation without cutaneous lesion or palpable collection.\n\n【13】The patient was transferred to our tertiary referral hospital and admitted for further management of suspected abdominal sepsis (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment \\[SOFA\\] score=7 points). 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】Laboratory results on admission and on day 2 are shown in table 1 .

It showed fibrinous adhesions in the hepatic area (perihepatitis) as well as purulent peritonitis in the rectouterine pouch. Both 16S rRNA performed on abdominal fluid and fibrinous adhesions were negative. Blood cultures resulted positive for _F. necrophorum_ in 29 hours.\n\n【27】Postoperatively, the patient developed acute delirium and acute pulmonary oedema, attributed to aggressive fluid resuscitation and sepsis-associated capillary leak syndrome. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen and vasopressor support. A repeated total-body contrast-enhanced CT scan on day 3 showed a right lingual vein thrombosis  and a right precentral cortical brain lesion . On day 6, due to persistent fever and abdominal pain, a contrast-enhanced abdominal-CT was repeated. It showed a large right intramuscular gluteal abscess (40×80×15 mm) without evidence of connections with the collection previously described in the rectouterine pouch . Growing pulmonary lesions were also noted at this time. The gluteal abscess was surgically drained. Broad range 16S rRNA PCR performed on drainage material returned positive for _F. necrophorum_ . Brain MRI showed a right frontal abscess of 9×11 mm .

Ventricular function and morphology as well as valvular apparatus were normal. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) was documented and confirmed by a bubble study.\n\n【38】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【39】Lemierre syndrome was considered in the differential diagnosis because of the history of sore throat, clinical signs of pharyngotonsillitis and the presence of a possible septic embolisation in the lungs. Abdominal symptoms have been commonly reported in patients with typical Lemierre syndrome initiated by a pharyngeal infection. 删除9：<u>2 5 </u>However, primary infection sites can be found in the liver and be associated with portal vein thrombosis (pylephlebitis), 删除13：<u>8–10 </u>or in gynaecological organs such as the vagina, cervix and uterus (with or without intrauterine device) and be associated with pelvic veins thrombosis. 删除9：<u>11–16 </u>Although not specific, thrombocytopaenia, as observed in the present case, is a common feature of Lemierre syndrome. 删除9：<u>2 5 </u>There was no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n【40】The presence of a perihepatitis with periportal oedema and a 3 cm collection in the rectouterine pouch initially raised the suspicion of a pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) complicated by Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS), an inflammation of the liver capsule associated with chronic PID. 删除9：<u>17 18 </u>FHCS starts by ascending infection from the cervix or the vagina to the endometrium. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for FHCS diagnosis.\n\n【41】An infectious endocarditis was also initially considered. Endocarditis caused by _F. necrophorum_ is exceptional with only 10 cases reported in the literature since 1980. 删除9：<u>19</u>\n\n【42】Treatment\n---------\n\n【43】According to our institutional guidelines and because of the suspicion of abdominal sepsis, empiric antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam was promptly initiated on admission. As the laparoscopy suggested PID, the treatment was then modified to ceftriaxone, metronidazole and doxycycline. After identification of _F. necrophorum_ in the blood cultures and exclusion of _C. trachomatis_ , doxycycline was stopped. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole were continued based on susceptibility test ( _F. necrophorum_ isolate was sensitive to penicillins, carbapenems, clindamycin, moxifloxacin and metronidazole).\n\n【44】The pelvic and gluteal abscesses were surgically drained. Regarding the right frontal brain abscess, conservative management was initially attempted. However, due to the progression of the abscess and the onset of neurological symptoms (left facial palsy and dysarthria) on effective antibiotic therapy, a craniotomy was performed, and ceftriaxone and metronidazole were replaced by meropenem. Only a partial drainage of the abscess was possible because of the critical localisation near the motor cortex.\n\n【45】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【46】The patient was discharged home after 26 days. Meropenem was administered for 6 weeks after the neurosurgical intervention without any complications.\n\n【47】A thorax and abdominal contrast-enhanced CT 1 week after initiation of meropenem showed a regression of the pulmonary lesions and complete regression of the gluteal abscess.\n\n【48】Neurological recovery was excellent after speech therapy. Cerebral MRI showed a complete regression of the abscess 1 month after surgery. At 6-month follow-up (4 months after cessation of antibiotic therapy), the patient was doing well and had no complaints. At that time, brain MRI showed complete healing of the cerebral abscess.\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】Local infections with anaerobic organisms leading to thrombophlebitis with distant embolisation were first described by Lemierre. 20 _F. necrophorum_ is the most common aetiological agent of Lemierre syndrome, but other organisms from the oral flora can be found, such as Streptococci and less frequently _Staphylococcus aureus_ . 1 3 _F. necrophorum_ is classified into two subspecies: subsp. _necrophorum_ , involved in most veterinary infections, and subsp. _funduliforme_ , responsible for most human cases. In vitro studies show that _F. necrophorum_ subsp. _funduliforme_ is able to evade complement attack by binding factor H, and to activate the contact system, suggesting a potential role of these mechanisms in the virulence of the pathogen. 删除9：<u>21 22 </u>However, the exact mechanisms used by _F. necrophorum_ subsp. _funduliforme_ to escape human host defence and cause severe invasive infections remain largely unexplored. Septic clots are usually observed within 1–3 weeks after primary infection. 删除9：<u>5 23 24</u>\n\n【51】The overall annual incidence of Lemierre syndrome, defined as a documented _F. necrophorum_ infection with primary foci in the head and neck, and dissemination to a nearby region (eg, mastoiditis) and/or distal regions (eg, pulmonary septic emboli), has been reported to be 3.6 per million persons per year in the Danish general population and 14.4 cases per million in people aged 15–24 years old. 删除9：<u>6 </u>The reasons for the characteristic age distribution, with a predilection for young individuals, remain unclear but might be due to its possible association with EBV-related infectious mononucleosis, which presumably facilitates the entry of _Fusobacterium_ inside the connective tissue. 删除9：<u>25 </u>Recent epidemiological data suggest an increased incidence of invasive _Fusobacterium_ spp infections from 2010 to 2017. 删除9：<u>5 </u>This trend might be explained by several factors: a decrease in antibiotic prescriptions for upper airway tract infections, more sensitive laboratory techniques for pathogen detection and decreased rates of tonsillectomy. 删除9：<u>26 27</u>\n\n【52】Septic thrombosis is traditionally described as occurring in the internal jugular vein. In our patient, we identified a thrombosis of the right lingual vein at a relatively late stage, after 72 hours of hospitalisation. We hypothesised that a jugular thrombosis might have occurred earlier and could have already embolised at the time the patient underwent radiologic exploration. Indeed, it has been suggested that the finding of a jugular vein thrombosis at the time of clinical presentation may not be a sensitive diagnostic criterion for Lemierre syndrome. 删除9：<u>28 </u>The lung is the most common site of embolisation, accounting for up to 85% of the cases. 删除9：<u>29 </u>Our patient presented other uncommon embolisation sites. Muscle abscesses have been reported in rare cases, resulting generally from contiguous thrombophlebitis and associated with fasciitis or arthritis. 删除9：<u>30 31 </u>The central nervous system is usually not affected because of downstream venous embolisation of the septic emboli in the pulmonary circulation. Only 3%–5% of patients had brain abscesses in a review of 251 infections caused by _Fusobacterium_ spp (but not necessarily with Lemierre syndrome). 删除9：<u>1 </u>Mechanisms causing epidural or brain abscesses in Lemierre syndrome include retrograde intracranial extension of the septic thrombosis from the internal jugular vein or contiguous dissemination from an otogenic source of infection. 删除9：<u>2 29 </u>In the present case, we postulated that the presence of a PFO contributed to an arterial haematogenous diffusion of _F. necrophorum_ and extensive systemic embolisation, a mechanism proposed to explain septic emboli in the arterial circulation in Lemierre syndrome. 删除9：<u>32 </u>To the best of our knowledge, only two cases of Lemierre syndrome with brain abscess and echocardiographic evidence of right-to-left shunt through a PFO have been reported in the literature to date. 删除9：<u>33 34 </u>Some cases of ischaemic strokes due to arterio-arterial septic embolism from the internal carotid artery (in contiguity with the internal jugular vein) have been described. 删除9：<u>32 35 </u>In the present case, there was no evidence of ischaemic stroke or cervical arterial defects.\n\n【53】Recent studies show that _F. necrophorum_ isolates are generally susceptible to penicillin with a resistance rate between 0.7% and 2% and no resistance to clindamycin or metronidazole have been identified. 删除9：<u>5 24 </u>Our patient demonstrated progression of cerebral abscess despite effective therapy with high doses of metronidazole. The increase in size on cerebral MRI was explained probably by the need of surgical drainage in order to control the infection rather than the development of antibiotic resistance as the negative culture on the abscess may suggest. However, the therapy was changed to meropenem with a favourable outcome after neurosurgical drainage.\n\n【54】The benefit of anticoagulation in Lemierre syndrome is debated in the absence of interventional studies.

Examination findings were consistent with fracture of the left neck of femur. Laboratory investigations, including ECG, were normal. He was discharged after total left hip arthroplasty. During outpatient evaluation for syncope and dizziness, his 24-hour Holter examination showed predominantly sinus rhythm with episodes of first-degree atrioventricular block, ventricular ectopy <1%. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large, elongated, mobile left atrial mass with no clear attachment, measuring 4.8 cm × 1.6 cm and a dilated left atrium. Transoesophageal echocardiogram revealed a 4.7 cm × 3.5 cm × 2.6 cm multilobulated, gelatinous, mobile left atrial mass attached to the area around the fossa ovalis of the interatrial septum not prolapsing through or obstructing the mitral valve . CT of thorax, abdomen and the pelvis confirmed intracardiac left atrial mass. There were no signs of extracardiac primary malignancy, metastatic disease or lymphadenopathy. Preoperative workup for surgery was carried out. Coronary angiogram revealed severe proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis and diffuse mild disease in the left circumflex and right coronary artery. He was started on secondary prevention for coronary artery disease. He underwent surgery for myxoma resection and coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery. Electrical cardioversion was done for postoperative atrial fibrillation. The patient was discharged home following restoration of sinus rhythm. His biopsy report confirmed left atrial myxoma.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Transthoracic echocardiogram showing a large elongated mobile mass in the left atrium.</u>\n\n【7】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【8】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【9】2D and 3D transoesophageal echocardiogram images showing a multilobulated, mobile left atrial mass attached to the interatrial septum. 删除9：<u>2</u>D, two dimensions; 3D, three dimensions.</u>\n\n【10】删除11：<u>Video 1 Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiogram revealing a large left atrial mass.</u>\n\n【11】Myxomas represent the most common benign primary cardiac tumours.

She had been taking olmesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), for about 8 years to treat hypertension. Prior workup, including stool culture, abdominal computed tomography (CT), and upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, was negative per her previous physician. She was treated with probiotics and antibacterial agents, but there was no improvement in her symptoms. After hospitalisation, blood test findings showed hypoalbuminaemia (albumin 2.7 g/dL (reference range 4.1–5.1)) and electrolyte abnormalities (sodium 127 mEq/L (reference range 138–145), potassium 4.6 mEq/L (reference range 3.6–4.8), chloride 96 mEq/L (reference range 101–108) and calcium 8.0 mg/dL (reference range 8.8–10.1)) reflecting poor oral intake and severe malabsorption. Slightly elevated inflammatory response was noted (white blood cell count 10.7×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (reference range 3.3×10 <sup>9 </sup> –8.6×10 <sup>9 </sup> ) and C reactive protein 0.24 mg/dL (reference range <0.14)), but all of the various infections were negative. Antinuclear antibodies were positive (1280 times (reference range <40)). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed again. It revealed multiple granular protrusion in the duodenal bulb and mucosal atrophy from descending to transverse part of the duodenum . Antegrade double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) revealed diffuse villous atrophy throughout the duodenum and ileum with patchy reddening and erosions . Endoscopic findings did not rule out malignant lymphoma with diffuse changes, and capsule endoscopy was performed to further examine the anorectal side. There was diffuse villous atrophy, a finding similar to that seen on antegrade DBE . A biopsy from duodenum showed villous atrophy and disappearance of the crypts , and cytomegalovirus or tuberculosis infection and lymphoma of the small intestine were ruled out by immunohistochemistry. Olmesartan-associated sprue-like enteropathy or coeliac disease was suspected. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) testing was HLA-DQ6/6, and she did not have HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes, which are strongly associated with coeliac disease. After discontinuation of olmesartan, her symptoms rapidly improved, although her diet was not gluten-free. Based on all these results, a diagnosis of olmesartan-associated sprue-like enteropathy was confirmed. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and antegrade DBE were performed after 3 and 8 months, respectively. They showed that mucosal atrophy was largely healed .\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals multiple granular protrusion in the duodenal bulb (A) and mucosal atrophy from descending to transverse part of the duodenum (B).</u>\n\n【7】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【8】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【9】Antegrade double-balloon enteroscopy reveals diffuse villous atrophy (A) throughout the duodenum and ileum with patchy reddening and erosions (B).</u>\n\n【10】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【11】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【12】Capsule endoscopy shows diffuse villous atrophy (A), erosions (B) and patchy reddening (C).</u>\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【15】A biopsy from duodenum is performed.

The patient is a butcher by profession and works in a fish market. Initially, the swelling was small and painless, not associated with fever, night sweats, cough, weight loss and trauma, and the patient had no contact with anyone with tuberculosis. But in due course of time over the last 4 years, it increased in size involving the wrist, hypothenar eminence and little finger base. The patient had intermittent mild pain and discomfort with restriction in the little finger’s terminal flexion (distal interphalangeal joint). He had tingling sensation and paraesthesia over the distribution region of the median nerve. It was more in the night. On examination of the swelling, it was an hourglass swelling, soft and doughy, cross-fluctuant and strong; gritty crepitus was palpable on the movement of fingers . The X-rays of the wrist, hand and chest were normal with only local soft tissue shadow and no bony abnormality. The patient had a scar over the ulnar aspect of palm because before presenting to us, he had undergone a needle aspiration somewhere else. The culture report was sterile. We did an MRI scan of the hand, which showed thickened synovium with internal T2 hypointense foci surrounding the flexor tendon . Haematological work-up revealed normal counts. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 20. The total leucocyte count was 8200. Mantoux test was negative.\n\n【5】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【6】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【7】(A) Clinical images showing ganglion on either side of wrist (arrow marked).

Under a tourniquet, through a volar approach, the ulnar aspect’s flexor tenosynovium was explored after incising the subcutaneous tissue and aponeurosis . Gross swollen tenosynovium was found ulnarly at the wrist, hypothenar area, and the swelling was continuing until the fifth finger’s base. Carpal tunnel was cut and released in view of median nerve decompression. After careful dissection and taking care of the neurovascular structures, radical excision of the synovial sheath of tendons was done. Caseating fibrinous materials, amber-coloured fluids with melon seed bodies and rice bodies were found in abundance. The flexor superficialis tendon of the little finger was found adherent to the inflamed synovium, so it was sacrificed. The tissue was sent for biopsy . Intraoperative findings were corroborative of compound palmar ganglion. The wound was closed in layers after thorough washing. A volar cock-up splint was applied for 2 weeks. Finger movements were encouraged from day 2. Histopathology examination confirmed tuberculosis, and anti-tubercular therapy was started. At 6 months of follow-up, the patient did not have a recurrence in swelling, and the wrist and finger movements were normal.\n\n【9】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【10】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【11】(A) Intraoperative findings showing the two ends of dumbbell ganglion (arrow marked); the rice bodies are seen in situ (B) and after excision (C) with cyst wall.</u>\n\n【12】Extrapulmonary tuberculosis involves mainly lymph nodes, bones, joints, gastrointestinal tracts, tendon sheaths, etc. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Tuberculosis of the synovial sheath of flexor tendons of hands involving the radial or ulnar bursa is rare but not uncommon. 删除9：<u>4 6 </u>Dominant upper limb is most commonly involved. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Men are affected more and those who are generally farmers, labourers or involved in animal husbandry. 删除9：<u>1 8 </u>Tuberculous tenosynovitis is caused due to haematogenous spread from a primary focus of infection or by direct inoculation from adjacent infected tissue. 删除9：<u>9 </u>The progression of disease is slow and insidious.

The lesion measured 320 µm in depth and 1780 µm in width . Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) showed flow void areas within the lesion in the deep choroidal layer segmentation and a normal vascular pattern in the outer retina segmentation . As the lesion was flat, ultrasound B-scan was not done. Based on the findings of the multimodal imaging, we inferred that the lesion was a deep, flat choroidal lesion lacking vasculature and melanin pigment.

It has been widely used to describe the findings in various retinal and choroidal pathologies. Choroidal nevi are benign lesions and most of them contain melanin and appear pigmented. They show hyperreflectance on the infrared channel and appear ‘salmon pink’ on the multicolour image. 删除9：<u>3 </u>This is in contrast to the current case where the lesion appeared dark (hyporeflective) on the infrared reflectance channel. This can be explained based on the light absorption properties of melanin. The melanin present in the choroidal melanocytes absorbs the shorter wavelength blue and green wavelength light while reflects the longer wavelength infrared light. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Hence, a pigmented choroidal nevus lesion appears white on the infrared reflectance while an amelanotic choroidal lesion appears dark. On the other hand, OCTA is a non-invasive tool to study the blood flow in the retinal and choroidal vessels. Absence of intralesional choroidal vessels and a normal overlying deep retinal vascular plexus suggests the avascular and benign nature of the lesion.

A small lesion size, plateau configuration and absence of secondary retinal changes warrant no further intervention except for regular follow-up as in the present case.

While he was forced to deal with social conflict caused by aspects of his job, he came across reports of floods in other parts of Japan. Consequently, he began experiencing symptoms of PTSD and major depressive episodes.\n\n【10】The COVID-19 pandemic is, at the time of writing, wreaking havoc around the globe in what is a major health disaster. During the pandemic, many people, including healthcare workers, are expected to work in appalling conditions for extended periods. Therefore, understanding how the experience of a long-term, complex and severe disaster affects the mental health of essential responders (who are engaged in essential services) is important in guiding future policies and practices.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】The patient was a male in his 40s when he first visited our clinic. He was born and grew up in a town in Fukushima Prefecture (within 20 km of the nuclear power plant). After he graduated from a college in another city, he returned to his hometown and started working in a town office. He has no medical history of note. After the accident at the nuclear power plant in 2011, an evacuation order covering his hometown was issued. The order was lifted in July 2017.\n\n【13】### Summary of the patient’s traumatic experience\n\n【14】He was working at the town office at the time of the earthquake. Later, while conducting a tour of the coastal area to check for earthquake damage and to ensure that people had evacuated, he experienced the tsunami near his childhood home. He and his colleague evacuated the lower floor of the house, moved upstairs with his family and watched as the surrounding houses were swept away, fearing that, along with his family and his colleague, he would also be swept away at any moment. Eventually, the water receded, but the area around the house was flooded, preventing any movement. Mobile phone services collapsed. In the evening, he carried his grandmother on his back and waded through the waters to take refuge on a nearby hill, where about 40 people had gathered. He barely slept during the night. At daylight the next day, he was rescued—along with the other people who were with him—by a Self-Defence Forces helicopter.\n\n【15】On the afternoon of the second day, he began engaging in relief work throughout the area. Among the tasks and efforts he undertook was aiding the local fire brigade and he was involved in housing the corpse of a man whom he had known since childhood. He would go on to help recover six or seven bodies in half a day. With nowhere to go, he slept that night wrapped in a blanket by his desk in his office. He heard a rumour of a nuclear power plant being in danger and fell asleep in a daze.\n\n【16】By the morning of the third day, it was clear that the nuclear power plant was in danger. Evacuation orders for everyone within a 5 km radius, followed by a 10 km radius, from the nuclear power plant, were conveyed. On the night of the fourth day, the town office was closed. On the morning of the fifth day, he told his family to flee, although he decided to stay and aid in the relief work being carried out. On the morning of the seventh day, 删除13：<u>200–300 </u>people—taking refuge at a junior high school—were transported to another prefecture aboard seven or eight buses. There were only three staff members remaining, including himself. Initially, he felt a strong sense of urgency and was in high spirits. He carried on working for 3 months with the local authorities, which included visiting evacuees. One of the evacuees once made him kneel for 2 hours, scolding him and saying, ‘You're here too late’. Even after he returned to his hometown, he continued to work as a local government employee. He was involved in a lot of heartbreaking work—such as catching and slaughtering the growing number of untended or escaped cattle and pigs within the evacuation area.\n\n【17】### Medical history\n\n【18】In August 2014, after watching the news of the flood damage in another area of Japan, he experienced flashbacks of scenes from the tsunami during the GEJE; these flashbacks made him anxious and made sleeping difficult. This affected his work severely. At that time, he was working in a department of the town and frequently attended briefings in his hometown. He notes that there was a lot of shouting at these briefings. In the same month, he visited a clinic in the city and was diagnosed with PTSD and depression. He was given leave from the time of his initial visit for a duration of about 8 months. His symptoms subsequently improved, and he decided to discontinue treatment. During this time, while taking antidepressant medication, he experienced an uptick in his mood and spent a lot of money on mail order goods besides elated feelings with increased energy, decreased need for sleep and an increase in goal-directed activity.\n\n【19】Two-and-a-half years later, he became depressed again and visited another psychiatric hospital in the city. This visit began a second leave of absence from his work; he returned to work after 4 months. Three months later, he took a third leave of absence after suffering a worsening of his anxiety and depression. His physician, at the time, determined that he needed specialised treatment for PTSD and referred him to our clinic for the purpose of implementing trauma-focused psychotherapy.\n\n【20】### Treatment history\n\n【21】His first visit to our clinic was 7 years and 7 months after the GEJE. Although outwardly he appeared well groomed, his speech was sluggish. His alcohol consumption increased after the disaster, but he had been abstaining from alcohol for a month and a half before his visit, so we told him to continue. The previous doctor's prescriptions were escitalopram (20 mg), mirtazapine (30 mg), ethyl loflazepate (4 mg) and diazepam (10 mg). Although we considered this prescription inappropriate for a bipolar patient, we continued this treatment first then started to taper it down. After two general outpatient meetings, a total of 10 sessions of trauma-focused psychotherapy were conducted twice a week.\n\n【22】Weekly outpatient visits continued for a month. Whenever he heard news about an earthquake on the TV, he became anxious; however, he had learnt to respond by practising breathing techniques. The psychotropic drugs were gradually reduced.\n\n【23】He returned to work the next month, on a half-day basis, and began working full time after 3 weeks. At that time, he was still taking escitalopram (10 mg) and ethyl loflazepate (1 mg).\n\n【24】### Trauma-focused psychotherapy\n\n【25】We conducted prolonged exposure therapy. 删除9：<u>16 17</u>\n\n【26】In the first session, we listened in detail to comprehend all aspects of his trauma. Because he had experienced multiple traumatic events, we asked him to evaluate the degree of subjective distress he felt about the different events. He expressed the following: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> on the tsunami: ‘I feel like blaming nature, wondering why this once-in-a-thousand-year event happened at this time’; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> in reference to the harsh complaints emanating from residents after the disaster: ‘It's not just my fault’ and ‘There's only so much I can do’; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> concerning the scene where corpses were taken: ‘Why did it have to be this way?’\n\n【27】In the second session, he expressed survivors’ guilt: ‘There was some fear in the trauma part, but I wondered if the loss of an acquaintance was greater. The village where I was born and raised was gone. The person I told immediately after the earthquake to “get out of here fast” also died. I am wondering why I didn't tell them more forcefully. Images of the disaster and \\[the sound of\\] sirens on fire trucks and ambulances trigger my anxiety. There were other times when we were all talking about the disaster and everyone was normal, and I was the only one who froze’.\n\n【28】In the third session, he recalled that he was near his childhood home soon after the earthquake when the tsunami hit and how he had escaped by taking shelter on the second floor. He further recalled that he was left with others on high ground until the following day.\n\n【29】In the fourth session, he described the first few days in detail. The moment the tsunami came, he was told: ‘There's a tsunami coming, run away quickly’. He recalled that ‘The waves were really black, and \\[that\\] the water was extremely powerful’, and that he ‘was rescued by a helicopter with \\[his\\] colleagues and \\[that he\\] went back to the town office crying’. In addition, on the afternoon of the 12 <sup>th </sup> , he was tasked with helping recover the deceased; the first person he found and carried was a fire brigade worker who he knew.\n\n【30】In the fifth session, he remembered that, after recovering bodies on the afternoon of the 12th, he received the news that the nuclear power plant was in danger. In addition, after the evacuation order was issued, he had to help evacuate local residents while his family was evacuated to another area. There were times when he was subjected to abuse. He stated that: ‘There's so much going on, so much work, it makes me just laugh’.\n\n【31】In the sixth session, he was asked to explain, in detail, the scenes when the lifeless body of someone he knew was recovered. He had received a call from the fire brigade, telling him that a body had been found; subsequently, he was sent to pick it up. On recognising the corpse as someone he knew, he thought, ‘I could have been dead, that could well have been me rather than him’.\n\n【32】In the seventh session, he could recall and express his memories more easily than previously. He said, ‘It's over, but why did it take so long?’\n\n【33】In the eighth session, we dealt with the tsunami scene again and he recalled the episodes in greater detail.\n\n【34】In the ninth session, he was asked to speak about his recollections of the first 3 months after the earthquake and how he lost 15 kg of weight during that period, resulting in a colleague telling him that he looked completely different.\n\n【35】In the tenth session, he was asked to repeat his recollections of those first 3 months. He responded by saying that ‘it's great that I've been able to organize the memories in my head. Before, they were all jumbled up. I have been able to cut out some of the worst traumatic experiences, organize others, and accept the result. So, I've come to understand that it's all in the past’.\n\n【36】The patient continued his visits to the outpatient clinic as well as his medication—mainly the mood stabiliser lamotrigine (25 mg: in Japan, the dosage of each psychotropic drug is usually set lower than in Western countries) used for the treatment of bipolar disorder. He voluntarily practised coping techniques, such as breathing exercises, in situations where he felt stressed. Every year, emotional instability emerged around 11 March, the day the earthquake struck. In October 2019, the area where the disaster occurred suffered from flooding and water damage due to a major typhoon. He was involved in the management and operation of the evacuation centre that was set up at that time, but later became unwell and needed to take a leave of absence for about a month. Trauma-focused psychological interview sessions were conducted following this event, and two traumatic memories were treated, which were left unaddressed in the prolonged exposure method interviews conducted. One recollection concerned the times when he was angrily abused by some evacuees during the period after the GEJE. The second was about the scene when he was verbally abused at his job. After the two sessions, he recovered and has returned to work and continues to be well.\n\n【37】The COVID-19 outbreak, which began in January, has caused intense and extensive fear and anxiety. The patient has reported that the outbreak has brought back memories of the GEJE, as well as that of the atmosphere of the people at the time, causing him to experience some heightened emotions of fear. He has also realised, however, that for a long time he was too absorbed in and preoccupied by his GEJE experiences; because of this awareness and acceptance, he was mindful not to be like that this time round.\n\n【38】Global health problem list\n--------------------------\n\n【39】How do the complex and harsh experiences of the GEJE disaster and its aftermath affect disaster-relief workers?\n\n【40】The GEJE was a complex disaster that involved an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power plant accident, followed by a series of compulsory evacuations.\n\n【41】What are the crucial aspects of the trauma caused by complex disasters?\n\n【42】What kind of response does such trauma provoke in the short term and what are the long-term consequences?\n\n【43】What kind of measures should be taken to deal with mental health problems caused by complex disasters, including nuclear disasters?\n\n【44】Global health problem analysis\n------------------------------\n\n【45】Important characteristics of the traumatic events experienced by disaster-relief workers in complex disasters, including nuclear accidents, and as demonstrated throughout this case, are as follows:\n\n【46】1.  They intermittently experience multiple traumatic events over an extended period.\n\n【47】2.  The impact of being caught up in social conflicts over nuclear power and radiation exposure is significant, as is receiving strong condemnation and attacks from residents. 删除9：<u>14 15\n\n【48】    </u>Considering these two points, two further observations can be made:\n\n【49】3.  In addition to the magnitude of the trauma or loss experienced, there may be a mildly manic reaction to dealing with persistent crisis situations in the community at large. In this psychological defence reaction, there is a risk that mental health problems, such as depression and PTSD, would appear or develop a few years after the disaster.\n\n【50】4.  Anxiety concerning the health effects of radiation exposure, which is generally considered to be a problem following nuclear disasters, 删除13：<u>8 10 18 19 </u>might be neglected.\n\n【51】This patient experienced the GEJE as a local government employee and had an extremely harsh and traumatic time in the months following the disaster. These included the recovery operations, a fear of exposure to radiation, harsh living conditions following the evacuation, separation from his family, and strong condemnation and reprimands as a result of postdisaster social strife and conflicts.\n\n【52】Despite this strong psychological burden, this individual continued to work diligently for the recovery and reconstruction of the community, which illustrated the strength of his resilience. It is believed that participation in the altruistic activity of contributing to the recovery of the community boosted that resilience. 删除9：<u>20 </u>At the same time, it is worth noting that in the present case, the patient demonstrated a hypomanic state. The hypomanic state is pathological, as it involves the avoidance of realistic anxiety. 删除9：<u>21 </u>Denial of self-damage or fatigue can make self-care more difficult to implement. However, in the short term, it produces desirable effects by maintaining social activity, which can protect people from being overwhelmed by practical challenges in a disaster situation. This may be an adaptive response which enhances resilience.\n\n【53】We would like to draw attention to the fact that the patient did not complain of anxiety concerning the adverse health effects of radiation exposure, which is generally expected in mental health problems associated with nuclear disasters. 删除9：<u>8 10 18 19 </u>As in the present case, this may be due to the fact that residents who choose to live in relatively close proximity to the accident site can be seen as a biassed group that does not take the possible damage of radiation exposure seriously. It is also possible to think that a manic avoidance of anxiety 21 may be at work here. Alternatively, it could be an outcome of the risk communication 22 that took place after the disaster. People living in the area had learnt that the levels of radiation that they were exposed to while living in close proximity to the plant were not the kind that would actually have serious consequences.\n\n【54】Three years and 5 months after the disaster, the PTSD symptoms—including flashbacks—suddenly flared up after the patient was exposed to news of another disaster in Japan. In addition, during this period, the patient endured a situation in which he was required to negotiate, as a representative of the local government (being an employee himself), with residents who were affected by the nuclear accident. However, communication and negotiations did not go well, resulting in strong admonishment. In the case of an elderly woman with symptoms of PTSD caused by the tsunami, as reported by Hori _et al_ , the recurrence was also caused by being involuntarily blamed for being involved in a severe conflict among residents in the communal dwelling where she was living. 删除9：<u>23</u>\n\n【55】Although our patient recovered from his mood disorder by using medication, he had two repeated flare-ups which led to the implementation of prolonged exposure therapy 16 17 —a psychotherapy focused on PTSD. North and Pfefferbaum have argued that less invasive treatments should be prioritised in the immediate aftermath of a disaster as an intervention for post-disaster PTSD, and specialised trauma-focused treatments should be provided only when depression and PTSD symptoms persist. 删除9：<u>24 </u>Our treatment is consistent with this argument. The actual psychotherapy process involved sorting out a situation in which multiple traumatic events were intricately intertwined, in addition to habituation through the recall of traumatic memories. We also discussed the destruction of his hometown and the loss of his relatives and acquaintances. 删除9：<u>16</u>\n\n【56】Although improvement was observed following the treatment described previously, emotional instability was sometimes caused by increased stress in daily life; as such, it was necessary to continue the outpatient treatment, including the prescription of lamotrigine (25 mg). We also provided psychological education about stress coping. Although trauma reactions and feelings of depression may intensify on the anniversary of the GEJE, he gradually became able to care for himself. In addition, we discussed his tendency to be manically uplifted in crisis situations and overly immersed in his community contributions. However, the traumatic experience of receiving strong condemnation from residents 14 15 —that could not be addressed in the initial PTSD treatment—necessitated additional psychotherapeutic interviews later on. On the other hand, we should not rely solely on improving the coping skills of patients. Because experiencing multiple disasters would increase the suicide rate, 删除13：<u>25 </u>the same person should not be repeatedly burdened as a relief worker.\n\n【57】The following lessons can be drawn from this case:\n\n【58】1.  The recovery and reconstruction of the community, including a medical system that allows general psychiatric treatment, such as treatment for mood disorders, should be ensured as quickly as possible after a disaster.\n\n【59】2.  It is not easy for those who have an important role in the affected community to reduce their responsibilities in the community during the postdisaster phase. There is also a prejudice against psychiatric issues. Awareness-raising activities related to mental health, including psychoeducation about symptoms of mood disorders and PTSD, should be carried out widely in the community, even though this could be difficult after the disaster. The medical facilities where the current treatment was provided also existed in the areas affected by the disaster. 26 27\n\n【60】3.  A system that allows access to specialised treatment focused on PTSD should be developed 16 17 23 when necessary.\n\n【61】4.  The public should be made aware that they should refrain from unwarranted severe criticism of local government officials in the wake of a disaster, 删除13：<u>14 15 </u>as it would increase the risk of mental health problems for those who are criticised.\n\n【62】### Learning points\n\n【63】*   For the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake who experienced the earthquake, tsunami, nuclear accident and subsequent evacuation, there are two highly significant points: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the persistence of the crisis situation over a long period (weeks, months or even years) and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the emergence of social conflicts over radiation exposure from an early stage.\n\n【64】*   In particular, disaster-relief workers are at a high risk of mental health problems because they are repeatedly exposed to other victims' tragic situations and are prone to be strongly criticised or attacked, even though they themselves are victims of the disaster.\n\n【65】*   With respect to postdisaster mental health, both depression and hypomania may emerge. Since hypomania is a partial disavowal of difficult realities, decrease in anxiety and increasing physical activity can represent an adaptive response to difficult situations arising after a complex disaster, including a nuclear disaster where the threat is invisible.\n\n【66】*   Exposure to radiation after a nuclear accident can damage mental as well as physical health, both or either of which may not manifest for some considerable time after the initial disaster, or which may appear following various trigger events.\n\n【67】*   In postdisaster patients, mood disorders that are combined with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may not be controlled without PTSD-focused treatment.\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank all those who contributed to the recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": ", 删除13：200–300 p", "content": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】The global threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to accurately identify the immediate and long-term postdisaster impacts on disaster-relief workers.

Therefore, understanding how the experience of a long-term, complex and severe disaster affects the mental health of essential responders (who are engaged in essential services) is important in guiding future policies and practices.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】The patient was a male in his 40s when he first visited our clinic. He was born and grew up in a town in Fukushima Prefecture (within 20 km of the nuclear power plant). After he graduated from a college in another city, he returned to his hometown and started working in a town office. He has no medical history of note. After the accident at the nuclear power plant in 2011, an evacuation order covering his hometown was issued. The order was lifted in July 2017.\n\n【13】### Summary of the patient’s traumatic experience\n\n【14】He was working at the town office at the time of the earthquake. Later, while conducting a tour of the coastal area to check for earthquake damage and to ensure that people had evacuated, he experienced the tsunami near his childhood home. He and his colleague evacuated the lower floor of the house, moved upstairs with his family and watched as the surrounding houses were swept away, fearing that, along with his family and his colleague, he would also be swept away at any moment. Eventually, the water receded, but the area around the house was flooded, preventing any movement. Mobile phone services collapsed. In the evening, he carried his grandmother on his back and waded through the waters to take refuge on a nearby hill, where about 40 people had gathered. He barely slept during the night. At daylight the next day, he was rescued—along with the other people who were with him—by a Self-Defence Forces helicopter.\n\n【15】On the afternoon of the second day, he began engaging in relief work throughout the area. Among the tasks and efforts he undertook was aiding the local fire brigade and he was involved in housing the corpse of a man whom he had known since childhood. He would go on to help recover six or seven bodies in half a day. With nowhere to go, he slept that night wrapped in a blanket by his desk in his office. He heard a rumour of a nuclear power plant being in danger and fell asleep in a daze.\n\n【16】By the morning of the third day, it was clear that the nuclear power plant was in danger. Evacuation orders for everyone within a 5 km radius, followed by a 10 km radius, from the nuclear power plant, were conveyed. On the night of the fourth day, the town office was closed. On the morning of the fifth day, he told his family to flee, although he decided to stay and aid in the relief work being carried out. On the morning of the seventh day, 删除13：<u>200–300 </u>people—taking refuge at a junior high school—were transported to another prefecture aboard seven or eight buses. There were only three staff members remaining, including himself. Initially, he felt a strong sense of urgency and was in high spirits. He carried on working for 3 months with the local authorities, which included visiting evacuees. One of the evacuees once made him kneel for 2 hours, scolding him and saying, ‘You're here too late’. Even after he returned to his hometown, he continued to work as a local government employee. He was involved in a lot of heartbreaking work—such as catching and slaughtering the growing number of untended or escaped cattle and pigs within the evacuation area.\n\n【17】### Medical history\n\n【18】In August 2014, after watching the news of the flood damage in another area of Japan, he experienced flashbacks of scenes from the tsunami during the GEJE; these flashbacks made him anxious and made sleeping difficult. This affected his work severely. At that time, he was working in a department of the town and frequently attended briefings in his hometown. He notes that there was a lot of shouting at these briefings. In the same month, he visited a clinic in the city and was diagnosed with PTSD and depression. He was given leave from the time of his initial visit for a duration of about 8 months. His symptoms subsequently improved, and he decided to discontinue treatment. During this time, while taking antidepressant medication, he experienced an uptick in his mood and spent a lot of money on mail order goods besides elated feelings with increased energy, decreased need for sleep and an increase in goal-directed activity.\n\n【19】Two-and-a-half years later, he became depressed again and visited another psychiatric hospital in the city. This visit began a second leave of absence from his work; he returned to work after 4 months. Three months later, he took a third leave of absence after suffering a worsening of his anxiety and depression. His physician, at the time, determined that he needed specialised treatment for PTSD and referred him to our clinic for the purpose of implementing trauma-focused psychotherapy.\n\n【20】### Treatment history\n\n【21】His first visit to our clinic was 7 years and 7 months after the GEJE. Although outwardly he appeared well groomed, his speech was sluggish. His alcohol consumption increased after the disaster, but he had been abstaining from alcohol for a month and a half before his visit, so we told him to continue. The previous doctor's prescriptions were escitalopram (20 mg), mirtazapine (30 mg), ethyl loflazepate (4 mg) and diazepam (10 mg). Although we considered this prescription inappropriate for a bipolar patient, we continued this treatment first then started to taper it down. After two general outpatient meetings, a total of 10 sessions of trauma-focused psychotherapy were conducted twice a week.\n\n【22】Weekly outpatient visits continued for a month. Whenever he heard news about an earthquake on the TV, he became anxious; however, he had learnt to respond by practising breathing techniques. The psychotropic drugs were gradually reduced.\n\n【23】He returned to work the next month, on a half-day basis, and began working full time after 3 weeks. At that time, he was still taking escitalopram (10 mg) and ethyl loflazepate (1 mg).\n\n【24】### Trauma-focused psychotherapy\n\n【25】We conducted prolonged exposure therapy. 删除9：<u>16 17</u>\n\n【26】In the first session, we listened in detail to comprehend all aspects of his trauma. Because he had experienced multiple traumatic events, we asked him to evaluate the degree of subjective distress he felt about the different events. He expressed the following: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> on the tsunami: ‘I feel like blaming nature, wondering why this once-in-a-thousand-year event happened at this time’; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> in reference to the harsh complaints emanating from residents after the disaster: ‘It's not just my fault’ and ‘There's only so much I can do’; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> concerning the scene where corpses were taken: ‘Why did it have to be this way?’\n\n【27】In the second session, he expressed survivors’ guilt: ‘There was some fear in the trauma part, but I wondered if the loss of an acquaintance was greater. The village where I was born and raised was gone. The person I told immediately after the earthquake to “get out of here fast” also died. I am wondering why I didn't tell them more forcefully. Images of the disaster and \\[the sound of\\] sirens on fire trucks and ambulances trigger my anxiety. There were other times when we were all talking about the disaster and everyone was normal, and I was the only one who froze’.\n\n【28】In the third session, he recalled that he was near his childhood home soon after the earthquake when the tsunami hit and how he had escaped by taking shelter on the second floor. He further recalled that he was left with others on high ground until the following day.\n\n【29】In the fourth session, he described the first few days in detail. The moment the tsunami came, he was told: ‘There's a tsunami coming, run away quickly’. He recalled that ‘The waves were really black, and \\[that\\] the water was extremely powerful’, and that he ‘was rescued by a helicopter with \\[his\\] colleagues and \\[that he\\] went back to the town office crying’. In addition, on the afternoon of the 12 <sup>th </sup> , he was tasked with helping recover the deceased; the first person he found and carried was a fire brigade worker who he knew.\n\n【30】In the fifth session, he remembered that, after recovering bodies on the afternoon of the 12th, he received the news that the nuclear power plant was in danger. In addition, after the evacuation order was issued, he had to help evacuate local residents while his family was evacuated to another area. There were times when he was subjected to abuse. He stated that: ‘There's so much going on, so much work, it makes me just laugh’.\n\n【31】In the sixth session, he was asked to explain, in detail, the scenes when the lifeless body of someone he knew was recovered. He had received a call from the fire brigade, telling him that a body had been found; subsequently, he was sent to pick it up. On recognising the corpse as someone he knew, he thought, ‘I could have been dead, that could well have been me rather than him’.\n\n【32】In the seventh session, he could recall and express his memories more easily than previously. He said, ‘It's over, but why did it take so long?’\n\n【33】In the eighth session, we dealt with the tsunami scene again and he recalled the episodes in greater detail.\n\n【34】In the ninth session, he was asked to speak about his recollections of the first 3 months after the earthquake and how he lost 15 kg of weight during that period, resulting in a colleague telling him that he looked completely different.\n\n【35】In the tenth session, he was asked to repeat his recollections of those first 3 months. He responded by saying that ‘it's great that I've been able to organize the memories in my head. Before, they were all jumbled up. I have been able to cut out some of the worst traumatic experiences, organize others, and accept the result. So, I've come to understand that it's all in the past’.\n\n【36】The patient continued his visits to the outpatient clinic as well as his medication—mainly the mood stabiliser lamotrigine (25 mg: in Japan, the dosage of each psychotropic drug is usually set lower than in Western countries) used for the treatment of bipolar disorder. He voluntarily practised coping techniques, such as breathing exercises, in situations where he felt stressed. Every year, emotional instability emerged around 11 March, the day the earthquake struck. In October 2019, the area where the disaster occurred suffered from flooding and water damage due to a major typhoon. He was involved in the management and operation of the evacuation centre that was set up at that time, but later became unwell and needed to take a leave of absence for about a month. Trauma-focused psychological interview sessions were conducted following this event, and two traumatic memories were treated, which were left unaddressed in the prolonged exposure method interviews conducted. One recollection concerned the times when he was angrily abused by some evacuees during the period after the GEJE. The second was about the scene when he was verbally abused at his job. After the two sessions, he recovered and has returned to work and continues to be well.\n\n【37】The COVID-19 outbreak, which began in January, has caused intense and extensive fear and anxiety. The patient has reported that the outbreak has brought back memories of the GEJE, as well as that of the atmosphere of the people at the time, causing him to experience some heightened emotions of fear. He has also realised, however, that for a long time he was too absorbed in and preoccupied by his GEJE experiences; because of this awareness and acceptance, he was mindful not to be like that this time round.\n\n【38】Global health problem list\n--------------------------\n\n【39】How do the complex and harsh experiences of the GEJE disaster and its aftermath affect disaster-relief workers?\n\n【40】The GEJE was a complex disaster that involved an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power plant accident, followed by a series of compulsory evacuations.\n\n【41】What are the crucial aspects of the trauma caused by complex disasters?\n\n【42】What kind of response does such trauma provoke in the short term and what are the long-term consequences?\n\n【43】What kind of measures should be taken to deal with mental health problems caused by complex disasters, including nuclear disasters?\n\n【44】Global health problem analysis\n------------------------------\n\n【45】Important characteristics of the traumatic events experienced by disaster-relief workers in complex disasters, including nuclear accidents, and as demonstrated throughout this case, are as follows:\n\n【46】1.  They intermittently experience multiple traumatic events over an extended period.\n\n【47】2.  The impact of being caught up in social conflicts over nuclear power and radiation exposure is significant, as is receiving strong condemnation and attacks from residents. 删除9：<u>14 15\n\n【48】    </u>Considering these two points, two further observations can be made:\n\n【49】3.  In addition to the magnitude of the trauma or loss experienced, there may be a mildly manic reaction to dealing with persistent crisis situations in the community at large. In this psychological defence reaction, there is a risk that mental health problems, such as depression and PTSD, would appear or develop a few years after the disaster.\n\n【50】4.  Anxiety concerning the health effects of radiation exposure, which is generally considered to be a problem following nuclear disasters, 删除13：<u>8 10 18 19 </u>might be neglected.\n\n【51】This patient experienced the GEJE as a local government employee and had an extremely harsh and traumatic time in the months following the disaster. These included the recovery operations, a fear of exposure to radiation, harsh living conditions following the evacuation, separation from his family, and strong condemnation and reprimands as a result of postdisaster social strife and conflicts.\n\n【52】Despite this strong psychological burden, this individual continued to work diligently for the recovery and reconstruction of the community, which illustrated the strength of his resilience. It is believed that participation in the altruistic activity of contributing to the recovery of the community boosted that resilience. 删除9：<u>20 </u>At the same time, it is worth noting that in the present case, the patient demonstrated a hypomanic state. The hypomanic state is pathological, as it involves the avoidance of realistic anxiety. 删除9：<u>21 </u>Denial of self-damage or fatigue can make self-care more difficult to implement. However, in the short term, it produces desirable effects by maintaining social activity, which can protect people from being overwhelmed by practical challenges in a disaster situation. This may be an adaptive response which enhances resilience.\n\n【53】We would like to draw attention to the fact that the patient did not complain of anxiety concerning the adverse health effects of radiation exposure, which is generally expected in mental health problems associated with nuclear disasters. 删除9：<u>8 10 18 19 </u>As in the present case, this may be due to the fact that residents who choose to live in relatively close proximity to the accident site can be seen as a biassed group that does not take the possible damage of radiation exposure seriously. It is also possible to think that a manic avoidance of anxiety 21 may be at work here. Alternatively, it could be an outcome of the risk communication 22 that took place after the disaster. People living in the area had learnt that the levels of radiation that they were exposed to while living in close proximity to the plant were not the kind that would actually have serious consequences.\n\n【54】Three years and 5 months after the disaster, the PTSD symptoms—including flashbacks—suddenly flared up after the patient was exposed to news of another disaster in Japan. In addition, during this period, the patient endured a situation in which he was required to negotiate, as a representative of the local government (being an employee himself), with residents who were affected by the nuclear accident. However, communication and negotiations did not go well, resulting in strong admonishment. In the case of an elderly woman with symptoms of PTSD caused by the tsunami, as reported by Hori _et al_ , the recurrence was also caused by being involuntarily blamed for being involved in a severe conflict among residents in the communal dwelling where she was living. 删除9：<u>23</u>\n\n【55】Although our patient recovered from his mood disorder by using medication, he had two repeated flare-ups which led to the implementation of prolonged exposure therapy 16 17 —a psychotherapy focused on PTSD. North and Pfefferbaum have argued that less invasive treatments should be prioritised in the immediate aftermath of a disaster as an intervention for post-disaster PTSD, and specialised trauma-focused treatments should be provided only when depression and PTSD symptoms persist. 删除9：<u>24 </u>Our treatment is consistent with this argument. The actual psychotherapy process involved sorting out a situation in which multiple traumatic events were intricately intertwined, in addition to habituation through the recall of traumatic memories. We also discussed the destruction of his hometown and the loss of his relatives and acquaintances. 删除9：<u>16</u>\n\n【56】Although improvement was observed following the treatment described previously, emotional instability was sometimes caused by increased stress in daily life; as such, it was necessary to continue the outpatient treatment, including the prescription of lamotrigine (25 mg). We also provided psychological education about stress coping. Although trauma reactions and feelings of depression may intensify on the anniversary of the GEJE, he gradually became able to care for himself. In addition, we discussed his tendency to be manically uplifted in crisis situations and overly immersed in his community contributions. However, the traumatic experience of receiving strong condemnation from residents 14 15 —that could not be addressed in the initial PTSD treatment—necessitated additional psychotherapeutic interviews later on. On the other hand, we should not rely solely on improving the coping skills of patients. Because experiencing multiple disasters would increase the suicide rate, 删除13：<u>25 </u>the same person should not be repeatedly burdened as a relief worker.\n\n【57】The following lessons can be drawn from this case:\n\n【58】1.  The recovery and reconstruction of the community, including a medical system that allows general psychiatric treatment, such as treatment for mood disorders, should be ensured as quickly as possible after a disaster.\n\n【59】2.  It is not easy for those who have an important role in the affected community to reduce their responsibilities in the community during the postdisaster phase. There is also a prejudice against psychiatric issues. Awareness-raising activities related to mental health, including psychoeducation about symptoms of mood disorders and PTSD, should be carried out widely in the community, even though this could be difficult after the disaster. The medical facilities where the current treatment was provided also existed in the areas affected by the disaster. 26 27\n\n【60】3.  A system that allows access to specialised treatment focused on PTSD should be developed 16 17 23 when necessary.\n\n【61】4.  The public should be made aware that they should refrain from unwarranted severe criticism of local government officials in the wake of a disaster, 删除13：<u>14 15 </u>as it would increase the risk of mental health problems for those who are criticised.\n\n【62】### Learning points\n\n【63】*   For the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake who experienced the earthquake, tsunami, nuclear accident and subsequent evacuation, there are two highly significant points: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the persistence of the crisis situation over a long period (weeks, months or even years) and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the emergence of social conflicts over radiation exposure from an early stage.\n\n【64】*   In particular, disaster-relief workers are at a high risk of mental health problems because they are repeatedly exposed to other victims' tragic situations and are prone to be strongly criticised or attacked, even though they themselves are victims of the disaster.\n\n【65】*   With respect to postdisaster mental health, both depression and hypomania may emerge. Since hypomania is a partial disavowal of difficult realities, decrease in anxiety and increasing physical activity can represent an adaptive response to difficult situations arising after a complex disaster, including a nuclear disaster where the threat is invisible.\n\n【66】*   Exposure to radiation after a nuclear accident can damage mental as well as physical health, both or either of which may not manifest for some considerable time after the initial disaster, or which may appear following various trigger events.\n\n【67】*   In postdisaster patients, mood disorders that are combined with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may not be controlled without PTSD-focused treatment.\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank all those who contributed to the recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake.</u>", "index": 8005, "show": true, "start": 8005, "end": 8021, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【16】"}], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:49:06", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:49:46", "cost": 39.383}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:24", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:49:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:49:06"}

The persistent swelling led to loss of self-esteem and lack of confidence. My family consulted many doctors in the last 15-20 years, but we failed to arrive at any conclusive diagnosis. This led to a lot of apprehension as to whether this condition was life threatening or only a cosmetic problem.

This was accompanied by near-complete loss of hair from all over the body. A wide-based gait was present with bowing of legs. He had protuberant eyes, decreased facial fat and wrinkled, shiny skin over the dorsae of hands and feet . Prominent veins were evident on the scalp. Teeth, nails, palms and soles were normal. There was mild global developmental delay and failure to thrive (weight for age, height for age and weight for height <−3SD). There was no history of photosensitivity, recurrent infections, ocular or any other systemic complaints. The family history was unremarkable. Radiographs of hands revealed bilateral acro-osteolysis and scannogram showed bilateral coxa valga, but no evidence of rickets or osteopenia . Routine investigations were normal except for mild anaemia (Hb=111 g/L). Trichoscopy and trichogram showed unmedullated normal hair shaft with pigment dilution. With these clinical features, a diagnosis of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) was considered.

To overcome these difficulties, there has been a significant advance in the methods of fixation and minimally invasive approaches, with the latest advances being locked anatomical plating, retrograde nailing and distal femoral replacement. Retrograde nails are mainly indicated in type A and in type C fractures with an intrarticular line capable of undergoing open reduction and fixation with interfragmentary screws. Lateral anatomical plates are mainly indicated for types A and C fractures. Distal femoral replacements are used in comminuted distal femoral fractures in low demand patients with poor bone stock.

The patient was placed in the supine position, with a tourniquet on the thigh. A medial parapatellar approach was used. After temporary reduction with Kirshner wires, the lateral fragment was fixed using two interfragmentary screws, from inferior-medial to superior-lateral direction, perpendicular to the fracture line. Initially, the preoperative plan was the placement of indirect, cartilage saving screws in the lateral fragment, perpendicular to the fracture line but had to be revised to a direct position due to the lack of adequate distal bone stock observed during surgery. Due to the unexpected change of plans, headless compression screws were not available during surgery, as such, regular compression screws were used, with the heads buried beneath the cartilage to prevent secondary joint damage.\n\n【40】The medial fragment was reduced and compressed under direct and radiological visualisation using pointed reduction forceps and fixed with a buttress plate and standard screws . Intraoperative and postoperative X-ray imaging was obtained, confirming the reduction . The usage of CT scan would be more accurate for evaluating the construct, but it is not routinely used at our institution.\n\n【41】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【42】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 5\n\n【43】Intraoperative image of the osteosynthesis.

A flexion contracture of around 20° is present.</u>\n\n【53】Discussion\n----------\n\n【54】There is no universally accepted classification for fractures of the distal femur, with the majority differentiating between extra-articular, intra-articular and isolated condylar fractures. These anatomical classifications fail to describe the conditions associated with fractures of the distal femur, namely the degree of deviation, comminution, degree of joint involvement, soft tissue damage, neurovascular structures, associated fractures, the degree of osteopenia and the presence of polytrauma, factors that determine the ‘personality’ of the fracture, which influence treatment and prognosis. The fracture pattern presented does not fit into any existing classification.\n\n【55】According to the AO criteria, a partial articular fracture, type B ‘involves part of the articular surface while the remainder of the joint remains intact and is solidly connected to the supporting metaphysis and diaphysis’ while in a complete articular fracture, type C ‘there is a disruption of the articular surface and the articular surface is completely separated from the diaphysis’. Based on the criteria presented, the fracture is classified as 33B2.3, a fragmentary, partial articular fracture, because of the anterior lateral articular surface segment that maintains continuity with the diaphysis . However, given the fact that the articular surface contiguous with the diaphysis is small in size and does not contribute to the load distribution of the lower limb, it makes the fracture personality similar to a fully articular, multifragmentary fracture, 删除9：<u>33</u>C3.3, consisting of two large fragments: a medial fragment with an oblique fracture line, equivalent to an isolated fracture 33B2 and a lateral Hoffa-like fragment, in the axial plane similar to a Salter Harris type 3 fracture in paediatric patients. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【56】Despite the similarities, the lateral fragment cannot be considered a true Hoffa fracture because the line is in the axial and not in the coronal plane. Letournel’s classification defines oblique features as type III Hoffa fractures; however, it does not classify horizontal features. 删除9：<u>10</u>\n\n【57】Recently, new classifications have been proposed for Hoffa’s fractures, based on CT images; however, these classifications also do not contemplate the existence of fractures in the horizontal plane.\n\n【58】According to Li _et al_ classification, the lateral fragment is classified as I abc and although this classification is useful in assessing fracture comminution, it is not informative relative to the fracture configuration. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【59】According to Bagaria _et al_ classification, the lateral fragment is classified as type I, according to size, but again, the classification is insufficient to describe the complexity of the fracture. 删除9：<u>13</u>\n\n【60】Applying the Xie _et al_ mapping technique, we obtained an alpha angle of −28° (the results described vary between −8.4 and 52.7) and a beta angle of 89° (the results described vary between −10.8 and 58.6) . 删除9：<u>12 </u>Comparing the measurements, we confirm that the presented fracture is roughly parallel to the axial plane, unlike Hoffa fractures that are perpendicular. The fracture also presents an obliquity that is the reverse to the ones seen in Hoffa fractures, that is, the fracture extends from inferior-lateral do superior-medial, unlike usual Hoffa fracture lines that extend from superior-lateral to inferior-medial, as seen in the coronal plane.\n\n【61】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【62】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 8\n\n【63】CT scan of the distal femur angle measurements. Left—alpha-angle of −28°. Right—beta-angle of 89°.</u>\n\n【64】Of the clinical cases consulted, none had similar fracture traits as the one presented above. 删除9：<u>14 19–35</u>\n\n【65】The treatment option chosen for this case is also debatable. In a regular Hoffa fracture, given the considerable sheer forces, it is subjected to during weight bearing, we would consider a three-screw construct, possibly with the addition of a buttress plate. The lateral condylar ‘Hoffa like’ fracture is horizontal in nature. Most of the forces applied during weight bearing are compressive, as such, a two-screw construct was considered sufficient. The small fragment size was also a concern regarding the placement of a third screw. Typical medial compression screws were not used to fix the medial fragment because of concerns regarding secondary fracture displacement with additional compression. A locking plate may have provided angular stability and a stiffer construct, but it is not mandatory for the buttress technique.\n\n【66】Some authors advocate the use of lateral precontoured locking plates regardless of the fracture line, arguing in favour of the mechanical advantage of the devices, that provides angular stability and the biological advantage of using less invasive stabilisation systems. 删除9：<u>16 </u>However, this position is not consensual. Some studies indicate that the rigid construction of a locked plate impairs bone consolidation causing delay of consolidation and non-union. 删除9：<u>36 37</u>\n\n【67】In our case, the authors opted to dismiss the lateral locking plate for the following reasons:\n\n【68】1.  The lateral fracture line is distal, which would compromise the placement of the distal screws.\n\n【69】2.  The position of the plate would interfere with the placement of the interfragmentary screws necessary for fixation of the lateral fragment to the metaphysis of the distal femur.\n\n【70】3.  The fracture line is perpendicular to the plate, the use of a rigid osteosynthesis with locking plating could impair fracture consolidation.\n\n【71】The obtained osteosynthesis fulfilled the objectives of the surgical treatment. An anatomic reduction of the articular surface was achieved with stable internal fixation, which allowed early mobilisation of the limb and an acceptable functional result. 删除9：<u>16 </u>Nevertheless, it has to be pointed out that certain treatment methods should be standard in the therapy of such fractures, namely, the usage of headless screws, intraoperative 3D imaging and postoperative CT scan to evaluate fracture reduction and implant placement. 删除9：<u>38 39</u>\n\n【72】In conclusion, fractures of the distal femur can be complex and difficult to manage. The currently available classifications are insufficient to describe the complexity of the patterns found in clinical practice, and the surgical techniques currently used are unable to overcome all the problems associated with these fractures. More research is needed to evaluate the best treatment options and standardise patient care.\n\n【73】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【74】I am pleased to be able to do my daily life with the help of my family and my walking cane.\n\n【75】### Learning points\n\n【76】*   Distal femoral fractures may be a surgical challenge as the fracture patterns are diverse.\n\n【77】*   Parapatellar approach is a good alternative for complex intraarticular fractures as it allows good visualisation of the fracture and enables anatomic reduction.\n\n【78】*   3D modelling of the fracture pattern may aid in the preoperative planning.\n\n【79】*   Even after obtaining anatomic reduction, full recovery of the limb function may not be achieved.\n\n【80】*   The usage of headless screws, intraoperative 3D imaging and postoperative CT scan to evaluate fracture reduction and implant placement should be standard in the therapy of such fractures.\n\n【81】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【82】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【83】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:42:32", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:42:58", "cost": 26.393}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:42:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:42:32"}

While reviewing the initial chest CT, a partial venous infarction of the left lower lobe associated with severe left inferior pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) was diagnosed. Stenting of the left inferior pulmonary vein with a vascular bare metal stent was performed, guided by fluoroscopy and transoesophageal echocardiography. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin/clopidogrel) was introduced for 3 months, followed by long-term aspirin monotherapy. The treatment resulted in relief of his symptoms and the resolution of pulmonary opacities on chest CT. Despite low frequency, AF ablation remains the most common cause of acquired PVS.

An inflammatory syndrome (C reactive protein 124 mg/L) was later noticed, with a negative nasopharyngeal SARS-COV2 PCR (PCR). In total, three chest CT scans were performed in 2 months. On the first CT, ground glass opacities of the left inferior lobe suggesting viral pneumonia were found. The second imaging study showed a progression of the ground glass opacities in addition to the development of heterogeneous condensation, suggesting bacterial pneumonia. Despite the introduction of co-amoxicillin, a third CT scan revealed worsening of the opacities, leading to a switch of antibiotics to levofloxacin. Clinical and biological evolution was transiently favourable, but pulmonary symptoms persisted for more than 1 month. A fourth chest CT showed improvement of the condensations but the persistence of ground glass opacities of the left inferior lobe, compatible with a partial venous infarction of the left lower lobe . After reviewing the first chest CT scan with contrast, an opacification delay was observed in the left inferior pulmonary vein suggestive of stenosis or thrombotic occlusion . A pulmonary CT angiography was performed, showing a residual flow and confirming severe stenosis of the left inferior pulmonary vein without complete occlusion . Transoesophageal echocardiography showed a normal ejection fraction and no significant valvulopathy. The mean gradient was measured at 4.3 mm Hg (maximal gradient of 10 mm Hg) in the left inferior pulmonary vein systolodiastolic flow.\n\n【12】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【14】Chest CT scan showing ground glass opacities of the left inferior lobe, compatible with a partial venous infarction of the left lower lobe .</u>\n\n【15】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【16】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【17】Chest CT scan with contrast showing an opacification delay in the left inferior pulmonary vein (yellow arrow) suggestive of stenosis or thrombotic occlusion.</u>\n\n【18】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【19】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【20】Pulmonary CT angiography showing severe stenosis of the left inferior pulmonary vein without complete occlusion (red arrow on the left figure) and three-dimensional reconstruction (yellow arrow on the right figure).</u>\n\n【21】Treatment\n---------\n\n【22】A pulmonary vein angiography was performed under general anaesthesia by way of right femoral veinous access, followed by transseptal puncture and injection of the pulmonary veins. The stenosis of left inferior pulmonary vein was predilated by a 5 mm (EUPHORA 5×15 mm, Medtronic) balloon. A vascular balloon-expandable bare metal stent (over the wire OMNI ELITE 8.0×19 mm, Abbott Vascular) was then implanted from the ostium to above the first bifurcation. The stent was postdilated by an 8 mm (Powerflex PRO 8×40 mm, Cordis) balloon in the distal part and a 10 mm (Powerflex PRO 10×40 mm) balloon in the proximal part of the pulmonary vein. The intervention was guided by fluoroscopy and transoesophageal echocardiography . The treatment resulted in a decrease in the mean and maximal gradient of the left inferior pulmonary vein systolodiastolic flow from 4.3 to 2 mm Hg and from 10 to 7 mm Hg, respectively. A 3-month dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was introduced, followed by long-term aspirin monotherapy.\n\n【23】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【24】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【25】Stenting of left inferior pulmonary vein (LIPV) (A): severe stenosis of LIPV in fluoroscopy (yellow arrow on upper figure) and transoesophageal echocardiography (red arrows on lower figure): LIPV systolodiastolic flow mean gradient 4.3 mm Hg and maximum gradient 10 mm Hg.

At 6-month follow-up, the patient had no cardiorespiratory symptoms. A chest CT confirmed stent patency and a near complete resolution of the pulmonary opacities.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】The presentation of PVS is variable and the symptomatology depends on the severity of the PVS and the number of pulmonary veins affected. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Symptoms are not specific, including shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, chest pain, haemoptysis and recurrent pulmonary infection, and appear after a mean of 4.0±3.0 months after the most recent ablation procedure. 删除9：<u>7 </u>The average delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of PVS was 4.4±5.4 months in a prospective, observational study that included 124 patients with severe PVS between 2000 and 2014. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Diagnosis delay can lead to useless or even harmful exams, such as bronchoscopy or pulmonary biopsy. Furthermore, PVS can progress to total occlusion of the pulmonary vein, which would complexify or prevent its treatment.\n\n【30】PVS can be diagnosed by CT or MRI. These modalities help define the severity of PVS, ranging from mild (<50%), moderate (50%–70%) to severe (>70%), depending on the percentage reduction of the luminal diameter according to the 2017 expert consensus. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Perfusion scans and transoesophageal echocardiography constitute alternative imaging modalities. In addition, pulmonary venography is particularly useful when total occlusion of the pulmonary vein is suspected on CT scan as it may reveal a residual channel allowing the introduction of a catheter for invasive treatment.\n\n【31】Intervention should be considered when the patient is symptomatic. Patients with asymptomatic PVS should be monitored by imaging every 3–6 months and angioplasty should be considered when PVS is severe, especially in presence of ipsilateral PVS. 删除9：<u>8 </u>The treatment consists of angioplasty of the pulmonary vein and provides a significant improvement of symptoms. 删除9：<u>9 </u>However, according to a recent meta-analysis, the overall incidence of restenosis remains high, up to 46% at 32 months, but is higher with balloon angioplasty alone (62.0%) compared with stenting (28.5%, risk ratio RR 2.18 (95% CI 1.64 to 2.89), p=0.001), with a comparable safety. 删除9：<u>10 </u>Some studies suggest that long-term patency could be superior with stent sizes larger than 9 mm in diameter. 删除9：<u>9 11 </u>Continuing follow-up is therefore recommended.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【33】PVS is a serious complication of AF ablation that can be easily misdiagnosed. Although the incidence of this complication decreased due to technical improvements, it is important to mention the diagnosis of PVS when a patient presents with suggestive symptoms post AF ablation. The longer the diagnosis is delayed, the greater the vascular and parenchymal lung damage, and in turn the more difficult it is to treat the PVS. Currently, the treatment of choice is angioplasty with stenting, preferably with a stent larger than 9 mm in diameter. A successful angioplasty can significantly relieve symptoms.\n\n【34】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【35】My story starts with an ablation procedure to treat atrial fibrillation which initially started 7 months prior to the intervention. As part of the standard post-operative medication, I was put on apixaban for 3 months. 2 days after stopping the apixaban I started experiencing severe pain in my left lung, coughing blood. After visiting emergency department I was initially diagnosed with suspected pneumonia and put on a course of antibiotics. After 7 days, and with my condition not improving, I was put on another type of antibiotic. After another 10 days with no progress, I was admitted to hospital again for further scans and tests which revealed a stenosis in one of my pulmonary veins.\n\n【36】Immediately after the procedure to reopen this pulmonary vein with a stent the lung pain and coughing of blood completely stopped. I have not had any reoccurrence of the lung issues since the procedure.\n\n【37】### Learning points\n\n【38】*   Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) should be suspected when suggestive symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, chest pain, haemoptysis and recurrent pulmonary infection) develop after atrial fibrillation ablation procedure.\n\n【39】*   Treatment is indicated when symptomatic.\n\n【40】*   Treatment consists of angioplasty of the pulmonary vein.\n\n【41】*   The overall incidence of restenosis after angioplasty alone is high, up to 46% at 32 months, but is lower with stenting (especially with stent sizes larger than 9 mm in diameter) compared with balloon angioplasty alone.\n\n【42】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【43】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【44】Not applicable.\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We acknowledge the patient for his consent to publish the case.

During the 10-month chemotherapy, HRCT revealed a recurrent pattern of a partly appearing and disappearing organising pneumonia pattern without clinical symptoms. Bronchoalveolar lavage analysis revealed lymphocytosis, while transbronchial lung biopsy revealed alveolitis with epithelial cell injury. Based on the diagnosis of drug-induced pneumonitis due to abemaciclib, the discontinuation of abemaciclib and administration of prednisolone were effective. Abnormal shadow on HRCT disappeared gradually, while elevated Krebs von den Lungen (KL)-6 and surfactant protein (SP)-D levels were restored to normal range. This is the first case report of abemaciclib-induced pneumonitis with histology findings. Since the severity of abemaciclib-induced pneumonitis ranges from mild to fatal, regular monitoring of pneumonitis with radiography, HRCT, and measurement of KL-6 and SP-D levels should be considered.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   Drug interactions\n*   Breast cancer\n*   Pathology\n*   Interstitial lung disease\n*   Radiology\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

In Japan, post-marketing surveillance reported the occurrence of pulmonary toxicity in 82 of 4700 cases and mortality in 13 cases. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Thus, the severity of toxicity varies, with few reports of drug-induced pneumonitis due to abemaciclib. We treated a case of abemaciclib-induced pneumonitis with a recurrent pattern of a partly appearing and disappearing ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of drug-induced pneumonitis due to abemaciclib supported by lung biopsy findings.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A woman in her late 40s was referred to our department with multiple abnormal findings on high-resolution CT (HRCT). She had undergone abemaciclib treatment for 10 months to prevent breast cancer recurrence following surgery and chemoradiation therapy and had no history of respiratory symptoms. She had also received a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and fulvestrant, which is an estrogen receptor downregulator, as part of a 13-month-long endocrine therapy.\n\n【10】She was an ex-smoker (8 pack-years), did clerical work, had no pets and received no other medications. Her percutaneous oxygen saturation was 98% and physical examination did not reveal any rales or other abnormal findings.\n\n【11】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【12】Chest radiography revealed consolidation and reticular shadow in the lower left field , while chest HRCT revealed bilateral multiple non-segmental GGOs and consolidation with an organising pneumonia (OP) pattern . During the 10-month treatment, HRCT revealed recurrence of a partly appearing and disappearing GGO and consolidation . Laboratory data showed no active inflammation (white cell count in 3.7x10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and C reactive protein 0.1 mg/dL), but Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) and surfactant protein (SP)-D were positive (756 U/mL and 139.4 ng/mL, respectively); no infections were evident. Autoantibodies for collagen vascular diseases were also negative. From these findings, drug-induced pneumonitis due to abemaciclib was considered as the first differential diagnosis. We then discontinued abemaciclib and planned the bronchoscopic examination for 10 days later. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from the left S通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>8 </sup></u> b bronchi revealed lymphocytosis (47%), but there was no evidence of infection or malignancy. A transbronchial lung biopsy from the left B通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>9 </sup></u> a and B通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>8 </sup></u> b bronchi revealed alveolitis along with epithelial cell injury. Several lymphocytes had infiltrated into the alveolar walls and surrounding peripheral vascular vessels; the alveolar epithelial cells were swollen and regenerated with cuboidal metaplasia . These changes were distinguished clearly from the normal alveolar tissue. The drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test for abemaciclib was negative.\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【15】Chest radiography and high-resolution CT (HRCT) at the time of consultation.

At high-power field (B,C), several lymphocytes had infiltrated into alveolar walls and surrounding peripheral vascular vessels. Alveolar epithelia changed into the cuboidal-shaped cells. Elastica van Gieson (EVG) stain (D) showed no fibrotic changes in interstitial tissue.</u>\n\n【22】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【23】For the differential diagnosis for multiple non-segmental GGOs and consolidation, drug-induced pneumonitis, radiation-induced pneumonitis, connective tissue disease-associated interstitial disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, infection, and sarcoidosis were considered.\n\n【24】The patient was treated for insomnia and seasonal allergic rhinitis with flunitrazepam and antihistamine for several years. Abemaciclib had been administered most recently. We could not identify any cause for hypersensitive pneumonitis based on her medical history and living environment. Her laboratory data, analysis of BAL and histology from lung biopsy were unlikely for eosinophilic pneumonia or infection. Her physical findings and autoantibodies for collagen vascular diseases did not suggest complication of collagen vascular diseases. Her chest CT did not reveal mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and no granuloma was seen in lung biopsy. Although the drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test was negative, it was performed during the treatment with prednisolone and under the effect of prednisolone on lymphocytes; therefore, the result could have been false negative.\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】Consequently, we diagnosed with a mild form of drug-induced pneumonitis due to abemaciclib administration, which was graded as grade 1 according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>However, since HRCT yielded remarkable findings, we administered moderate-dose prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day).\n\n【27】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【28】The previously observed abnormal radiographic shadows rapidly disappeared; consequently, we tapered and discontinued prednisolone after 6 weeks. KL-6 and SP-D decreased to within the normal range. The aromatase inhibitor letrozole was used to further treat breast cancer. Chest HRCT revealed no pneumonitis recurrence post-steroid therapy .\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】Abemaciclib has been approved for hormone receptor-positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced or recurrent breast cancer. A post-marketing surveillance in Japan reported pulmonary toxicity (1.7%) and mortality (0.3%) after abemaciclib administration, 删除13：<u>1 </u>which led to the issuance of the Dear Healthcare Professional Letters of Rapid Safety Communications (Blue Letter). The drug-induced pneumonitis onset in these cases began mostly within 5 months of treatment initiation, with concurrent dyspnoea, cough, fever and general fatigue. The chest HRCT findings showed the following patterns: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), OP, a faint GGO and a non-specific interstitial pneumonia pattern. The DAD pattern was dominant in fatal cases. Steroid hormones were administered in 68% of cases, following which 56% of them improved; however, no improvements were observed in 12%, whereas 30% exhibited fatality. Age (>70 years), pre-existing interstitial disease and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status >2 were identified as risk factors for mortality. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Furthermore, abemaciclib is reportedly associated with a 4.7-fold greater risk of drug-induced pneumonitis than other cancer agents. 删除9：<u>4 </u>From the evaluation of the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database, treatment with abemaciclib is associated with drug-induced pneumonitis regardless of age. 删除9：<u>5 </u>For management of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis as adverse events, HRCT, BAL and/or biopsy are indicated. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Our patient was considered a mild case of pneumonitis without clinical symptoms. However, since extensive abnormal shadows appeared during abemaciclib administration, a steroid hormone was administered instead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of drug-induced pneumonitis due to abemaciclib administration with lung biopsy findings. In one report of drug-induced pneumonitis due to abemaciclib administration, biopsy was impossible due to the severity of pneumonitis. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Another case of drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia due to abemaciclib administration was diagnosed by only BAL. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Upon comparing the HRCT and histological findings, it was concluded that HRCT alone could not predict the histological pattern. 删除9：<u>9 </u>HRCT in the present case exhibited an OP pattern, but histological analyses confirmed the presence of alveolitis along with epithelial cell injury, which suggested a good prognosis following steroid treatment. Although no interstitial changes were seen before treatment with abemaciclib, follow-up CT during treatment with abemaciclib revealed the recurrence of GGOs and consolidation without clinical symptoms. Had abemaciclib treatment been continued without steroid administration, the epithelial damage might have led to DAD, resulting in severe pneumonitis. In this case, follow-up CT during treatment and transbronchial lung biopsy were useful for the diagnosis and decision-making in the treatment of drug-induced pneumonitis due to abemaciclib administration.\n\n【31】KL-6 and SP-D levels were positive during treatment with abemaciclib prior to consultation with us and improved with treatment . KL-6 is an MUC1 mucin protein and has been observed in adenocarcinoma of various cancer cell lines, including breast cancer, 删除13：<u>10 </u>whereas SP-D is considered a useful marker of drug-induced pneumonitis. 删除9：<u>11 </u>Since the severity of abemaciclib-induced pneumonitis ranges from mild to fatal, monitoring these multiple diagnostic arms and collaborative consultation with pulmonologists may be highly effective in preventing drug-induced pneumonitis.\n\n【32】In conclusion, when abemaciclib is administered, monitoring drug-induced pneumonitis with regular chest radiographs and HRCT imaging, along with KL-6 and SP-D assessment, is necessary for the prevention of extensive pneumonitis. Histological findings from lung biopsy are also useful for diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【33】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【34】I was totally asymptomatic and so surprised that I’ve got pneumonitis from abemaciclib administration. From the beginning of treatment with abemaciclib, the doctors and pharmacists told me to be aware of dyspnea, fever, and cough, which suggest abemaciclib-induced pneumonitis.\n\n【35】Monitoring HRCT and consultation to respiratory medicine could help me from advance to severe pneumonitis without notice.\n\n【36】I hope my experience and clinical course will help safe and effective treatment with abemaciclib in future.\n\n【37】### Learning points\n\n【38】*   Abemaciclib-induced pneumonitis can range from mild to fatal.\n\n【39】*   When abemaciclib is administered, monitoring drug-induced pneumonitis with regular chest radiographs and high-resolution CT imaging, along with Krebs von den Lungen-6 and surfactant protein-D assessment, is necessary for the prevention of extensive pneumonitis.\n\n【40】*   If possible, histology from lung biopsy also helps to improve treatment outcome of abemaciclib-induced pneumonitis.\n\n【41】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【42】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【43】Obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:47:15", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:50:15", "cost": 180.783}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:50:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:47:14"}

The resulting mesenteric window was then closed with interrupted 3–0 coated VICRYL sutures . An appendicectomy was then performed as for a standard Ladd’s procedure as well as a caecopexy to reduce the chance of future caecal volvulus.\n\n【17】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【18】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【19】Intraoperative image showing the duodeno-jejunal flexure reduced to its normal position to the left of the midline and the mesenteric window closed to avoid re-herniation.</u>\n\n【20】The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 3 when he was eating and drinking normally, and his bowels had opened. At the 6-week follow-up, he remained well and was symptom free.\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】Congenital midgut malrotation can be undiagnosed until adulthood. Some patients may present acutely with a mid-gut volvulus, whereas others might present with a vague chronic abdominal pain due to intermittent volvulus and internal herniation. In our case report, the most challenging area was the diagnosis.\n\n【23】CT scan (with oral and intravenous contrast) is the best non-invasive diagnostic modality to diagnose malrotation. It allows the visualisation of the position of the duodenojejunal flexure in relation to the midline. The normal anatomical location of the duodenojejunal flexure is left to the midline. If it is found to be positioned right to the midline, then this is a diagnostic sign of malrotation . The CT will also show the position of the ascending colon, which is usually very mobile in patients with malrotation and lies in the left side of the abdomen. This excessive mobility of the colon puts it at risk of volvulus. CT scan could also be used in acute presentations as it is good to diagnose complications, which could arise in patients with malrotation (eg, small bowel internal hernias and colonic volvulus).\n\n【24】In this case, intraoperative inspection confirmed the site of the duodenojejunal flexure right to the midline . It also showed the ascending colon being very mobile and positioned to the left of the midline . Once the duodenojejunal junction was reduced back to its position, we closed the mesenteric defects to prevent the small bowel herniating through these windows postoperatively .\n\n【25】It is important to note here that the position of the appendix in patients with malrotation could be in the left of the abdomen.

Best corrected visual acuity was 20/32 and 20/25 in her right eye and left eye, respectively. Intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg in both eyes, and anterior segment evaluation was unremarkable. Fundus examination revealed multiple neurosensory retinal detachments in the posterior pole and optic disc hyperemia bilaterally. Enhanced depth imaging–optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) showed large areas of subretinal fluid (SRF), bacillary layer detachment (BALAD) and markedly thickened choroidal layers in both eyes . There were no integumentary, neurological or auditory complaints. A diagnosis of presumptive Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) was made and the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3 days and mycophenolate mofetil. Approximately 20 min after the first pulse of methylprednisolone, there was remarkable improvement of SRF and BALAD already visible on EDI-OCT , which went on to resolve completely by week 1. In the following 8 months, there was a decrease in choroidal thickness and also progressive and continued reconstitution of the ellipsoid zone on EDI-OCT . Mycophenolate was increased to 2 g/day over 8 weeks, and oral steroids were tapered gradually to 7.5 mg/day over 7 months. At 8 months’ follow-up, patient remains stable with 20/20 vision in both eyes and sustained remission clinically and on optical coherence tomography (OCT). VKH disease is a primary stromal choroiditis, coursing with exudative retinal detachments and usually mild anterior and vitreous inflammation. Inflammation is thought to originate primarily from the choroid, affecting nearby structures in a spill-over fashion. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>Progression to chronic recurrent granulomatous anterior uveitis and sunset glow fundus with chorioretinal atrophy is likely, unless early and aggressive immunosuppression is implemented. 删除9：<u>3 </u>It has been previously suggested that there may be a window of therapeutic opportunity, between 2 and 4 weeks of disease onset, where starting aggressive immunosuppression as soon as possible may modify the disease course, 删除13：<u>3 4 </u>allowing for progression to sunset glow fundus to be altogether avoided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report wherein objective and remarkable improvement just minutes after a first pulse of intravenous steroid was documented, contributing to the existing body of evidence on the benefit of this approach. Steroid-sparing agents should also be introduced within the first few days to help prevent disease recurrence 3 and provide the best chances for true disease course modification. 删除9：<u>5 </u>The ongoing improvement of the outer retinal layers on OCT through to last follow-up at 8 months brings further ultrastructural detail in support of this strategy.\n\n【4】### Learning points\n\n【5】*   Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease is a primary stromal choroiditis that can progress to chronic illness with a poor visual prognosis if not treated promptly.\n\n【6】*   On the first 2–4 weeks of presentation, treatment with systemic steroids and early immunosuppression may cure the disease.\n\n【7】*   Response to pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone may be extremely fast, starting within minutes.\n\n【8】*   Early pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone and/or early immunosuppression may promote continued restoration of outer retinal layers even after 6 months.\n\n【9】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【10】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【11】Right eye: (A) Multiple, macular SRF pockets (yellow arrow) and BALAD (red arrow) nasal to the fovea at baseline.

Dental implants have been used actively for the past 30–40 years for dental rehabilitation of patients with partial secondary absence of teeth. The most popular criteria for success at the implant level are mobility, pain, radiolucency and loss of peri-implant tissues (>1.5 mm), as well as the absence or presence of peri-implantitis, suppuration and bleeding. The main success factors at the prosthetic level were technical complications/prosthetics, adequate function and aesthetics for 5 years. Patient satisfaction criteria included discomfort and paraesthesia absence, satisfaction with appearance and ability to experience/taste. Success in implant dentistry should ideally measure the long-term primary outcomes of the implant prosthetic complex. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【6】However, due to the technogenic impact and world environmental situation, this type of treatment is becoming less effective, leading to the increasing risk of dental implant failure, mainly because of associated metabolic disturbances such as osteopenia and osteoporosis. 删除9：<u>2–4 </u>The number of people who were not previously at risk of osteoporosis, such as menopausal women with decreased oestrogen levels, is increasing, and the association with age and gender is becoming less obvious.\n\n【7】Currently there are no contraindications for dental implants in patients with osteoporosis. However, the implant stabilisation process may be different for patients with this pathology. A longer implant stabilisation period is noted compared with healthy patients. A more thorough study of bisphosphonate use is required since there is currently insufficient information. There is also evidence of patients with osteoporosis taking bisphosphonates. Intravenous administration of these drugs increases the risk of developing osteonecrosis compared with oral administration. The presence of osteoporosis does interfere with the mechanical stability of dental implants, although this does not adversely affect their osseointegration. 删除9：<u>5–8 </u>It can be assumed that, if the primary mechanical stability in patients with osteoporosis is longer, then it is worth revising the terms of orthopaedic treatment and the load on the implant. Here, we will focus on osteoporosis caused by an imbalance of vitamin D. There are studies that prove a direct link. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium is considered an important component in treating osteoporosis. 删除9：<u>10 </u>The deficit is especially pronounced in women older than 50 years, which is also confirmed by studies. 删除9：<u>11 </u>It can be concluded that the imbalance of vitamin D indirectly affects the implant engraftment. In the Russian Federation and other countries, more and more scientists are paying attention to the need for an integrated approach for treating patients with secondary partial absence of teeth and metabolic disturbances, by adding endocrinologists to the medical team and working closely with them.\n\n【8】An analysis of the current situation in Russia and the scientific literature revealed the need for further randomised and multicentre studies to develop a comprehensive algorithm for examining and treating patients in this category.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A 51-year-old woman presented at a private dental clinic in 2013 with complaints of recurrent pain in the left temporomandibular joint (TMJ), difficulty chewing solid food and a prolonged absence of teeth in the lower jaw.\n\n【11】On examination, the facial configuration was unchanged, the opening of the mouth was not limited. There was an S-shaped deviation of the lower jaw, with an amplitude of more than 2.5 cm, and a click in the region of the left TMJ, in which hypermobility and slight pain were noted during palpation.\n\n【12】From the side of the oral cavity, the patient lacked teeth at positions 3.6, 3.7 and 4.6. The mucous membrane was pale pink and moderately moist. Palpation was painless. The width of the alveolar ridge when measured with a surgical caliper was 8 mm (area 3.6), 8.2 mm (area 3.7) and 7.8 mm (area 4.6).\n\n【13】An initial intraoral photo of 3.6, 3.7 and 4.6 tooth was taken. According to available clinical data, a preliminary diagnosis was made by a parallel method. A provisional diagnosis of TMJ dysfunction was made. To clarify the diagnosis, we proposed performing an MRI and condylography, but the patient refused.\n\n【14】When conducting cone beam CT, the mandible parameters were as follows: the height and width of the alveolar ridge (to the canal of the lower alveolar nerve) for 4.6 tooth was 6×12 mm, for 3.6 tooth was 6.5×14 mm and for 3.7 tooth was 6.8×13.5 mm .\n\n【15】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【16】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【17】Cone beam CT of the patient before dental implantation.</u>\n\n【18】At the preoperative stage, haematology, biochemistry, haemoglobin A1c, coagulogram, parathyroid hormone (PTH), antibodies to thyroid peroxidase, triiodothyronine and thyroid stimulating hormone lab tests were performed.\n\n【19】According to the results, the patient’s indicators were within the reference values for haematology and biochemistry. However, the coagulation system result indicated the PTH level was above normal (7.36 compared with normal values for a given age and gender, which do not go beyond 6.9 pg/L).\n\n【20】She had a history of long-term use of oral contraceptives and had not reached menopause at the time of dental implant installation.\n\n【21】To verify the diagnosis and further examination, the patient was referred to a gynaecologist–endocrinologist. As an additional assessment, a skeleton densitometry was performed, which revealed decreased bone density in the lumbar vertebrae to 0.831 and the left femoral head to 0.71. The patient was diagnosed with osteopenia. Then, a sequential treatment was carried out. After investigation, the endocrinologist prescribed 70 mg of alendronic acid orally once a week, along with daily calcium 500 mg two times per day and Alpha D3-Teva at 1 µg.\n\n【22】After the targeted treatment began, a series of dental measurements were performed. Therapeutic and surgical sanitation of the oral cavity was complete.\n\n【23】Alfa Bio DFI implants (Alpha-Bio Tec, Israel) with dimensions of 3.75×10 mm (position of missing 4.6 tooth), 3.75×11.5 mm (position of missing 3.6 and 3.7 teeth) were installed.\n\n【24】Antibacterial (Augmentin 625 mg three times per a day for 7 days), anti-inflammatory and analgesic therapy (nimesulide for pain) were prescribed, along with antiseptic baths of the oral cavity (water solution of chlorhexidine 0.05%).\n\n【25】The postoperative period was unremarkable. During the first postoperative follow-up, the gingiva in the surgical field were slightly swollen, without pathological changes. According to the patient, there was no pain. Sutures were removed on the seventh day, and the patient was given individual hygiene recommendations.

This condition, including osteoporosis, causes an imbalance in remodelling and bone resorption, and can lead to increased risk of bone fractures. Today a connection has been established, not only with somatic diseases but with changing lifestyles of people around the world. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【60】According to the WHO statistics, osteoporosis has become an important public health problem worldwide. One in three women and one in five men over the age of 50 years will have an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetime. 删除9：<u>10</u>\n\n【61】According to You _et al_ , today, the risk for osteoporosis is significantly associated with age, vitamin D intake, metabolic equivalent of task scores, weight, neck and hip circumference, waistline in the population. Also, the role of fat distribution, erectile dysfunction, menopause and alcohol abuse in osteoporosis should be given more consideration in clinical practice. 删除9：<u>11 </u>There is an increasing number of patients with a history of osteoporosis. This forces us to seek the best treatment options in oral surgery.\n\n【62】Currently, more and more factors affect long-term dental implantation, resulting in patients with partial secondary absence of teeth, including various disorders affecting bone mineral metabolism that were previously associated with an increase, for one reason or another, of the thyroid hormone, and found in postmenopausal women. In the last 5 years, endocrinologists have correlated vitamin D deficiency and PTH concentration, and therefore, the status of mineral metabolism. 删除9：<u>12–14 </u>Moreover, we want to note that, in recent years, this relationship has been less and less characteristic of the risk group for osteoporosis (white women older than 50 years with established menopause), and has become more and more characteristic of young and middle-aged patients, which may be associated with lifestyle (prolonged stay in enclosed spaces, low insolation, diet and nature and so on). Against the background of such changes, the risk of an unfavourable outcome of surgical treatment of patients with partial secondary absence of teeth naturally increases when dental implants are installed. 删除9：<u>4–8 </u>Therefore, a close cooperation between the dental surgeon and endocrinologist is now required, since timely antiresorptive therapy can increase the 5-year survival of implants to 100%, regardless of the patient’s age and gender.\n\n【63】Thus, considering the growth of hormonal imbalance in patients with partial secondary absence of teeth, the collaboration with endocrinologists to correct the existing metabolic disorders to increase the survival time of dental implants and surgical treatment, in general, remains relevant.\n\n【64】Recent scientific works are aimed at assessing bone tissue changes during dental operations. For example, some patients take constant hormone replacement therapy, or have hyperparathyroidism, thyrotoxicosis and hyperprolactinemia. The surplus of glucocorticoid hormone induces osteoporosis, and patients have poor primary stability of the implants due to osteogenesis inhibition\n\n【65】Oki _et al_ investigated the effects of continual intermittent influence of PTH on dental implant stability in the presence of osteoporosis, using rabbit models and creating artificial osteoporosis with the use of PTH in different forms before and after implantation. 删除9：<u>15 </u>The authors measured the implant stability coefficient immediately and after 2 and 4 weeks. According to a histological study, the quality and quantity of bone around dental implants were better in the groups of animals with adequate compensating therapy for osteoporosis.\n\n【66】Recent studies show the success of additional substances for covering dental implant surfaces, like lithium chloride application, increases osseointegration. Tests have shown that the properties of this material can improve its primary component. Lithium chloride stimulates osteogenesis and differentiation of osteoblasts. 删除9：<u>16 </u>Thus, this material can be used to treat patients with osteoporosis.\n\n【67】Dentists do not have clear guidelines on managing patients with disturbance of mineral balance. This may impair the treatment with dental implants, as these patients take bisphosphonates on an ongoing basis. For example, one article reveals a problem, dentists hesitate to help people with osteoporosis. In this group of patients, the risk of developing osteonecrosis increases; dental manipulations can provoke its development if there is no clear sequence of actions. 删除9：<u>17 </u>Several known risk factors are associated with the development of antiresorptive-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, including invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction, dental implant or apical/periodontal surgery. 删除9：<u>18 </u>This study recommends focusing on the prevention of odontogenic infection to reduce the number of invasive open bone manipulations. However, even when all attempts to avoid surgery have been made, the chance of its need remains. The resumption of antiresorptive therapy is recommended 2 months after implantation. Discontinuation of medicines is recommended for 2 months with the consultation of an endocrinologist.\n\n【68】Summarising all data presented in the article, the method of temporararily stopping bisphosphonates before implantation is widespread to achieve bone healing, but there are no clear recommendations for oral surgeons in case of other diseases or conditions connected with the disturbance of mineral balance. That is why the risk of complications after dental implantation increases in these patients. Dentists should be aware of the manifestations of osteoporosis, and know how to assess the laboratory test results and risk factors that cause complications during manipulation and how to treat them in collaboration with an endocrinologist.\n\n【69】Schwarz _et al_ analysed the studies and considered osteoporosis, osteopenia, thyroid disease, hepatitis, BMI as well as radiation and chemotherapy as potential risk factors for implant loss, but observed no association with peri‐implantitis. They decided that it could be questioned whether existing studies evaluating risk factors/indicators for peri‐implantitis were adequately powered to detect associations with rare disorders, and that evidence suggesting systemic conditions (other than diabetes) to be a risk factor/indicator for peri‐implantitis was limited. 删除9：<u>19</u>\n\n【70】### Learning points\n\n【71】*   Patients with a partial secondary loss of teeth must be recommended to get blood test performed for key signs of mineral imbalance and other diseases before dental implantation (this analysis should be performed only for patients at risk: women over 50 years, and patients with endocrine pathology, mineral imbalance and osteoporosis).\n\n【72】*   If bone mineral metabolism disorder is detected, patient should consult an endocrinologist for further investigations and, if necessary, special therapy with vitamin D for the indication.\n\n【73】*   Timely and adequate therapy prescribed by endocrinologist increases the 5-year success rate of dental implants to 100%, regardless of the patient’s age and gender.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:20:05", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:20:21", "cost": 16.647}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:20:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:20:04"}

Major causes of syncope are reflex-mediated, such as vasovagal or carotid sinus hypersensitivity, orthostatic hypotension and cardiogenic 1 . Although it results from brain hypoperfusion, stroke is only rarely the true cause of syncope, as the brain has a very redundant blood supply. One notable exception is the subclavian steal syndrome, which results in vertebrobasilar ischaemia during arm exercise due to subclavian artery stenosis. Stroke should be considered a cause of syncope when persistent and significant neurological changes occur before the episode or during the recovery period.\n\n【14】WS, also known as lateral medullary syndrome, is the most prevalent posterior ischaemic stroke syndrome. It commonly results from occlusion of the PICA or one of its branches. It is characterised by crossed thermoalgic hypoesthesia, ipsilateral cerebellar ataxia, vertigo, bulbar palsy and Horner’s syndrome. Clinical presentation varies, often resulting in any combination of these symptoms.

These conditions may occur simultaneously or sequentially. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>The condition is thought to have a prevalence of 1–9 per million people per year, with up to 50% of cases occurring secondary to an underlying disease process such as infection, primary immunodeficiencies, autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, haematopoietic stem cell transplants and lymphoproliferative disorders. 删除9：<u>3–5 </u>Evans syndrome is thought to be more difficult to treat than immune cytopenias in isolation, and a recent multicentre observational and retrospective study has shown it to be highly relapsing and commonly marked by severe complications. 删除9：<u>5 </u>In this case, we present a case of Evans syndrome in a young male patient who was the recipient of a liver transplant due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with a recent diagnosis of Crohn’s disease.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A man in his early 20s presented with a 1-day history of painless jaundice, lethargy and shortness of breath. He stated that his urine was dark with no changes noted in his stools. He detailed no symptoms suggestive of infection, although his temperature was recorded at 38.3°. He had a complex medical history composed of a liver transplant indicated for PSC in 2016, previous ITP treated with rituximab also in 2016 and he had recently been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease with terminal ileal involvement and patchy inflammation throughout the colon identified through colonoscopy. An earlier CT of the abdomen had shown evidence of ileitis and small bowel disease. His normal immunosuppressive regimen composed of tacrolimus and azathioprine, although the azathioprine had recently been held by his liver transplant team due to his taking of moderate doses of oral steroids for his active Crohn’s disease.\n\n【10】On examination, he appeared markedly jaundiced with scleral icterus and pallor with pale conjunctivae. His spleen was palpable 4 cm below the diaphragm. There was no obvious hepatomegaly.\n\n【11】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【12】Haemoglobin at presentation was 66 g/L, with a drop to 52 g/L 2½ hours later. White blood cell count was 13.7×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, with neutrophils at 8.4×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Mean corpuscular volume was 108 fL, with percentage hypochromic cells at 6%. Percentage reticulocytes were elevated at 27.4% identifying a regenerative anaemia. LDH and haptoglobin were also suggestive of haemolysis with lactate dehydrogenase raised to 881 IU/L and haptoglobin low at <0.08 g/L. Conjugated bilirubin was normal at <1 µmol/L. D-dimer was significantly elevated to 1308 ng/mL. Platelets were at normal levels at 220×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Blood film identified the presence of spherocytes, stomatocytes and polychromasia. Direct antiglobulin test was positive for IgG antibodies.\n\n【13】Chest X-ray and ECG were both unremarkable.\n\n【14】Given the history of prior ITP with the clinical picture and blood results strongly suggestive for AIHA, he was treated for Evans syndrome. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【15】Treatment\n---------\n\n【16】Initial treatment composed of two units of red blood cells, with a subsequent increase in red blood cells to 82 g/L. He was transferred to the care of haematology following discussion with his liver transplant primary team. He was continued on tacrolimus and was treated with steroids. Despite this, he required a further transfusion with one unit of blood. He was discharged home with tapering steroids and underwent four cycles of rituximab.\n\n【17】### Outcome and follow-up\n\n【18】The patient had an initial improvement in his haemoglobin as an outpatient which had increased to 115 g/L with platelet count of 189×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L one month following discharge. Three months after discharge, he was readmitted once more with haemolytic anaemia with a haemoglobin of 73 g/L. An ultra sound scan of the abdomen performed had shown a shrunken left liver lobe with a query of echogenic material in the portal vein. Thrombus was confirmed in the right posterior portal vein on CT of the abdomen, which also identified progression of splenomegaly from 16 to 20 cm when compared with a scan done one year previously. He was transferred to the care of his primary liver team to assess for graft rejection.\n\n【19】Discussion\n----------\n\n【20】Our patient was not diagnosed with conditions most typically associated with the development of Evans syndrome; however, he had an extensive autoimmune history having developed PSC, Crohn’s disease and ITP independently at various points in his life. These conditions are not commonly associated with Evans syndrome.\n\n【21】Little is known about Evans syndrome in adult patients with solid-organ transplants. However, a review of the literature has identified multiple case reports of Evans syndrome in paediatric patients following liver transplant. 删除9：<u>7–11 </u>It is therefore possible that Evans syndrome as a complication of solid-organ transplant, and in particular liver transplant, is potentially overlooked in adults.\n\n【22】Furthermore, there is also not a strong association between Evans syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with only a single case study identifying an association between ulcerative colitis and the condition and none found regarding Crohn’s disease. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Our case may be the first published case of Evans syndrome in an adult with Crohn’s disease. Additionally, PSC and concurrent Crohn’s disease represent approximately 7%–10% of PSC-IBD patients. 删除9：<u>13–15</u>\n\n【23】The combination of PSC and Crohn’s disease may increase the risk of further autoimmune disease, with 50% of cases in one review having been complicated by autoimmune phenomenon, including AIHA. 删除9：<u>16</u>\n\n【24】It should be stated that isolated AIHA without ITP is frequently associated with IBD. It is more common with ulcerative colitis than Crohn’s disease, and it is associated with greater disease severity and the presence of concurrent extraintestinal manifestations. 删除9：<u>17–20 </u>In the two case reports found regarding AIHA and Crohn’s disease; both patient’s had ileal disease like the patient presented here. 删除9：<u>15 16</u>\n\n【25】Evans syndrome is considered harder to treat than isolated warm AIHA, with a study of 68 patients finding only 32% in remission at a mean follow-up of 4.8 years. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Although a single reported case of a 40-month complete remission of postliver transplant Evans syndrome in a paediatric patient has been reported. In this instance, the patient underwent a splenectomy and cessation of tacrolimus, with tacrolimus thought to underpin the disease presentation. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【26】### Learning points\n\n【27】*   This is a classic case of Evans syndrome with sequential occurrence of cytopenias in a young patient. However, it is notable as he has multiple autoimmune conditions that may have predisposed to it but are not commonly associated with it.\n\n【28】*   This case report adds to the increasing number of reports centred around Evans syndrome occurring in patients following solid-organ transplant.\n\n【29】*   Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) in inflammatory bowel disease is associated most with ulcerative colitis; however, we present evidence that suggests it can be associated with Crohn’s disease and PSC and that the combination of both may confer increased risk for AIHA.\n\n【30】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【31】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【32】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:51:05", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:51:19", "cost": 13.823}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:51:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:51:05"}

A meticulous clinical examination supplemented with investigations can facilitate differentiation of retinal hamartomas from retinocytomas. A multilobulated dome-shaped elevated/semitranslucent flat lesions with lack of pigment epithelial alteration and optically empty spaces on OCT appearance suggests a diagnosis of astrocytic hamartoma. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Unfortunately, the only definitive way of differentiating retinocytomas from retinoblastomas are subsequent follow ups for any progressive lesional changes and investigations play little, if any, effect to the same. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【20】In their descriptions, Gallie _et al_ described retinocytomas as grey, translucent lesions of the posterior pole with intralesional calcification, pigment epithelial alteration, and areas of chorioretinal atrophy harbouring mutations in both the alleles of the RB1 gene (Rb-/-). 删除9：<u>3 4 </u>The mutated protein, pRb, disrupts the normal checkpoint inhibition of the cell cycle affecting unchecked cell proliferation. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Despite the common RB-/- genotype as shared with retinoblastomas, retinocytomas are benign, well-differentiated mass lesions sharing common origins in the retinocyte precursors. 删除9：<u>1 6 </u>The benign nature of these lesions was earlier attributed to a late-stage hit of the second allele, varying retention of wild-type protein function, and associated low penetrance. 删除9：<u>3 7–9 </u>Recent genetic analysis of patients with retinocytoma, however, suggests mutated RB1 gene-induced genomic field instability with high expression of senescence-associated proteins as the mutations underpinning the benign attribute of retinocytoma.

Epidermis showed increased melanisation of basal layer . Immunohistochemistry was not performed due to lack of facilities. CT delineated a well-defined soft tissue attenuation mass extending into subcutaneous plane  and also confirmed absence of chest metastases . Based on the radiological delineation of the tumour, a wide excision with 2 cm margins was performed and the wound closed primarily.

The trunk, shoulders and pelvic region are frequently involved. Other forms include morphea-like, atrophoderma-like and angioma-like DFSP. Majority of the patients exhibit a t(17;22)(q22;q13) translocation predisposing tumour formation following trauma. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>Common dermoscopic features in DFSP include pink background, hypopigmented or depigmented areas, arborizing telangiectasia, linear vessels, shiny white structures and pigment network. 删除9：<u>3 </u>We observed similar features. The homogeneous white areas correspond to diffuse fibroblast aggregates, telangiectasia to the dilated vessels and pigment network to the increased basal layer melanisation.\n\n【12】Microscopically, DFSP is a tumour localised to deep dermis and subcutis showing diffuse infiltration of monomorphic cells in whorled or storiform patterns. The cells show small oval or spindle-shaped nuclei with scanty cytoplasm and low mitotic rate. Immunohistochemically, majority show positivity with CD34 and negativity with FXIIIa, SMA, desmin, S100 and cytokeratins. Histological variants include a fibrosarcomatous type (showing high mitotic index and marked nuclear atypia) and a pigmented variant (Bednar tumour). 删除9：<u>1 2 4 </u>On CT imaging, DFSP commonly shows well-defined isodense cutaneous or subcutaneous nodule without calcification. We noted similar features. MRI usually shows a well-defined isodense nodule compared with muscle on T1-weighted images, and on ultrasound, as a low echogenic mass with rich vascularity. 删除9：<u>5</u>\n\n【13】Although metastasis and fibrosarcoma transformation are rare, being locally infiltrative, DFSP has a high postoperative relapse rate. Hence, the principal aim of surgery is to ensure clean tumour-free resection margins. Mohs micrographic surgery is hence considered ideal. Wide excision with at least 2 cm margin is recommended if the latter is not possible. For recurrent lesions requiring wide and deep resection and/or for facial lesions, ensuring complete excision to achieve tumour-free resection margins and achieving best possible aesthetic outcomes are necessary. In this regard, pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap and anterolateral thigh perforator free flap reconstructions have been employed to good effect. 删除9：<u>6 7 </u>Most of the recurrences after primary excision tend to occur within the first 3 years with a median of 32 months noted in a study. 删除9：<u>1 8 9 </u>Hence, a quarterly to half-yearly follow-up during this period and a lifelong annual follow-up thereafter is recommended.

Some other findings evident in our patient were a midline liver, presence of the stomach in the right upper quadrant. The intestines were malrotated with the caecum in the midline and terminal ileum in the right lower quadrant. The inferior vena cava was interrupted with azygos continuation.

It is a broad term with many different variants. Our patient had visceral heterotaxy which can be classified into heterotaxy with asplenia or polysplenia, as was in our case. Polysplenia syndrome usually involves the presence of multiple small splenules without a parent spleen. Other associations include midline liver, intestinal malrotation, bilateral hyparterial bronchi, bilobed lungs, bilateral left atria, and azygos or hemiazygos continuation of the inferior vena cava. Polysplenia syndrome typically does not involve congenital cyanotic heart defects and thus patients with this syndrome have better outcomes. Asplenia syndrome is characterised by the absence of a spleen. It also involves a midline liver and intestinal malrotation but in contrast to the polysplenia syndrome these patients typically have bilateral right atria, trilobed lungs and eparterial bronchi. Asplenia syndrome typically involves severe cyanotic congenital heart defects. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【11】The exact incidence of this syndrome and its variants is not known due to underdiagnosis.

Patients with cardiac involvement usually require surgery early in childhood. Patients with heterotaxy involving the abdominal viscera may also develop complications after birth like bowel obstruction.

However, patients can present intense pain in the immediate postoperative period, resulting in immobility, increased risk of complications and greater opioid consumption, generating adverse effects and prolonged hospitalisation. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【8】The difficult management of pain is explained by the complex innervation of the hip joint, in which the articular branches of the femoral, obturator and accessory obturator nerves are responsible for the sensory innervation of the anterior capsule. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【9】Additional anaesthetic techniques, such as peripheral nerve blocks, are part of a multimodal analgesic strategy and are often used to allow better management of acute pain. _The_ inadequate treatment can lead to persistent painful status. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【10】Despite of innumerous nerve blocks for this purpose, some may fail because they do not cover the entire innervation of the anterior hip capsule. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Our hypothesis is that the pericapsular nerve group block (PENG block), described in 2018, 删除13：<u>4 </u>by allowing the deposition of local anaesthetic between the psoas muscle tendon plane and the iliopubic eminence, associated with the lateral cutaneous nerve block thigh, would enable efficient analgesia, without causing motor block. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【11】In addition, the application of continuous infusion systems could provide prolonged postoperative analgesia, with little interference in the routine of the service, due to the use of elastomeric pumps with local anaesthetic coupled to the perineural catheter, through single injection. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【12】In this paper, we report the case of a patient who underwent total hip arthroplasty, with a history of thrombophilia, in which the PENG block was performed, with a continuous technique, and _a single shot block of_ the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A man, with thrombophilia (Factor V Leiden mutation) and recurrent episodes of deep vein thrombosis, on Rivaroxaban 20 mg/day (suspended 2 days before) was admitted to the operating room for right hip arthroplasty due to coxarthrosis and aseptic necrosis of the head of the femur, resulting in an important functional limitation of the hip. The preoperative pain score was 8/10 on the verbal numerical scale (VNS).\n\nAfter standard multiparametric monitoring and installation of venoclysis with J18G in the left upper limb, simple spinal anaesthesia was performed with a 25G Quincke needle, L2–L3, via median, with 15 mg of isobaric bupivacaine, sensitive level at T10. He was sedated with propofol in an infusion pump (Terumo), controlled target in plasma ( _Fast Marsh model_ ), of 1.5 µg mL <sup>−1 </sup> . At the end of surgery, the PENG block was performed with an 18G Tuohy needle, guided by ultrasound, under aseptic technique. Proper positioning of the catheter was checked using the ultrasound (USG) colour Doppler feature . Bolus with 15 mL ropivacaine 0375%+10 mg dexamethasone was performed and coupled to the elastomeric infusion system (EasyPump II LT B|Braun), filled with ropivacaine 0,2% at 2 mL/hour . Then, the region around the left lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was infiltrated with 6 mL ropivacaine 0.375%, guided by ultrasound, to contemplate the incised region. The postoperative pain score was 3/10 on the VNS .\n\n【16】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【17】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【18】(A) Needling through the technique in plane with Tuohy 18G needle and linear USG probe.

There was no opioid consumption.\n\n【26】The patient was followed by the anaesthesiology service until the time of hospital discharge (2 days), and the perineural catheter was then removed with no signs of infection. Lower limb muscle strength remained preserved throughout the hospital stay.\n\n【27】The analgesic strategy used allowed an efficient control of pain, besides having ensured that the patient sat out of bed the next morning, underwent physiotherapy and walked 48 hours after surgery.\n\n【28】The patient continues in rehabilitation, with good clinical evolution, without pain complaints in the operated limb and functional improvement, progressing in motor physiotherapy.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】In this study, we demonstrate a case in which continuous PENG block (using a perineural catheter and elastomeric infusion system) was performed, associated with the lateral cutaneous nerve block of the thigh, in total hip arthroplasty surgery, in a patient with thrombophilia.\n\n【31】In this context, the nerve supply of the hip joint has been described in detail in various studies. The hip capsule is divided into two parts: anterior and posterior, with nociceptive fibres mostly present on the anterior part while the posterior part has mechanoreceptors. An anatomic study by _Gerhardt et al._ 5 demonstrated that proximal branches of both the femoral and obturator nerves provide innervations to the anterior hip capsule. The accessory obturator nerve was found to innervate the medial capsule, which has sensory fbers. 删除9：<u>6 </u>In a cadaveric study of the PENG block, injected dye stained the entire anterior hip capsule area innervated by the articular branches of femoral, obturator, and accessory obturator nerves area. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【32】Since total hip arthroplasties are a highly complex procedure, it can present an enormous challenge in adequate pain management. 删除9：<u>7 8 </u>Pain is a risk factor for increased postoperative complications, such as immobility (risk for deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolic complications) and risk of delirium, especially in the elderly. 删除9：<u>9 10</u>\n\n【33】Due to this technique, it was achieved pain control for a longer time, without motor impairment, ensuring early walking and recovery. In addition, patient was considerably content with minimal interference in the service’s routine.\n\n【34】Thus, peripheral nerve blocks are part of an arsenal of multimodal analgesic strategies in the perioperative context of orthopaedic surgery. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【35】Dulaney-Cripe demonstrated that the fascia iliac compartment block continuous infusion was effective in controlling pain and reducing opioid consumption in elderly patients undergoing corrective surgery for hip fracture. 删除9：<u>12 </u>However, some studies discuss the fact that there are possible failures of one of the nerve branches in this approach, requiring larger volumes of local anaesthetic for better efficacy. 删除9：<u>13 </u>This point must be taken into account, as motor blockade in the quadriceps muscles (femoral nerve territory) is possible, resulting in a delay in postoperative walking.\n\n【36】O’Reilly _et al_ showed that, despite chemical and physical thromboprophylaxis, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis was still high (around 8.9% in hip surgeries). Therefore, early ambulation is a very important factor for these patients. 删除9：<u>14</u>\n\n【37】The continuous PENG block technique, associated with the lateral cutaneous nerve block of the thigh, appears as an efficient and safe perioperative analgesic approach, allowing an upstanding coverage of the hip joint territory, acting specifically on sensitive branches, which enables walking and recovery precocious. 删除9：<u>15</u>\n\n【38】Nevertheless, some precautions must be taken with the continuous technique: the procedure must be performed using aseptic technique, associated with ultrasonography; confirmation of the proper positioning of the catheter must be done through the colour doppler ultrasound feature; perform catheter aspiration, aiming at detecting eventual migrations of the catheter tip; the catheter should preferably be tunnelled and fixed to the patient’s skin. 删除9：<u>16</u>\n\n【39】As the infusion system is automatic and does not require periodic handling, it can be a point to be discussed as a strategy to reduce the risk of catheter-related contamination. However, all the care inherent in handling these longer-lasting devices must be taken. It is noteworthy that although the literature is still limited, there are few reports of complications resulting from the performance of PENG block, such as injury to nerve structures, intravascular injection and toxicity by local anaesthetics.\n\n【40】More studies should be carried out on the technique in question, in order to provide a better dimension of its real risks and benefits. However, we encourage the use of the technique, mainly because it is easy to perform and has a fast learning curve.\n\n【41】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【42】A month after hospital discharge, I attended the return appointment, extremely grateful and satisfied with the pain control and the evolution of the case. At the present moment, I am in physical rehabilitation, progressing in motor physiotherapy and awaiting surgery on the opposite hip.\n\n【43】### Learning points\n\n【44】*   Major orthopaedic surgeries can cause difficult-to-treat pain, delaying hospital discharge.\n\n【45】*   Peripheral nerve blocks are highlighted as an efficient analgesia strategy within the multimodal therapeutic arsenal.\n\n【46】*   The hypothesis is that continuous pericapsular nerve group block, when combined with the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, can provide excellent analgesic coverage for total hip arthroplasty surgeries.\n\n【47】*   The result of this case report demonstrates that the use of a continuous infusion system, through an elastomeric pump and perineural catheter, is an effective and safe method for analgesia, after total hip arthroplasty, enabling early ambulation and recovery, in addition to lower consumption of opioids.\n\n【48】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【49】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【50】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【51】### Ethics approval\n\n【52】This research was approved by institutional human ethics committee number 51917421.8.3001.5259 (dated 21 October 2021).\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We are grateful for the efforts of the entire team in carrying out this attempt, in the search for better clinical results for our patients.

Its wall is formed entirely of organised haematoma and surrounding pericardium with no myocardial component. The neck of pseudoaneurysmal sac is smaller than body. Mural thrombus with peripheral calcification is frequently noted.\n\n【19】Cardiac pseudoaneurysms have a high propensity to rupture, even many years after its formation 1 and needs surgical repair. They need to be differentiated from true aneurysms which have less tendency to rupture at chronic stages and are treated conservatively.\n\n【20】There are few studies differentiating pseudoaneurysm from true aneurysms.

Original figure created by author Lee.</u>\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】Autoantibodies are the archetypal autoimmune biomarkers for systemic autoimmune disorders like SS. For the latter, they form part of the diagnostic criteria making them important laboratory parameters for the disease. 删除9：<u>2 </u>IgG antibodies towards the Ro/La RNP complex (anti-Ro52/anti-Ro60 and anti-La) can be found in up to 73% and 45% of cases, respectively, in large cohort studies. 删除9：<u>3 </u>The Ro/La RNP complex is a cytoplasmic conglomeration of non-coding RNAs (Y RNAs) and several proteins including Ro52, Ro60 and La, to which autoantibodies are commonly found towards in diseases like SS and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【23】In the diagnostic laboratory, these autoantibodies may be measured by line immunoassays and (ELISAs). Other key autoantibodies that are usually measured, but not part of the latest diagnostic criteria, include the ANA test and RhF. These are positive in 79% and 49% of patients, respectively; however, these are not specific for SS. 删除9：<u>3 </u>The ANA is commonly measured by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on the HEp-2 substrate (or variations thereof). Positivity rate is dependent on the laboratory’s dilution cut-off and the definition of ‘nuclear’ staining. In around 15% of SS patients, these autoantibodies are not detectable 5 and are termed seronegative SS, requiring other supportive evidence—such as minor salivary gland biopsies—to diagnose SS. Seronegative SS patients may also be positive for novel autoantibodies that are not routinely measured in the diagnostic laboratory, including antisalivary protein 1 and antiparotid secretory protein. 删除9：<u>6 </u>These autoantibodies are thought to be early autoantibodies and typically appear before the anti-Ro/La autoantibodies. Other novel, specific autoantibodies, such as antienolase, are associated with severe pathologies or end-organ manifestations and therefore may be helpful in identifying subsets of patients. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【24】Ro/La autoantibodies are thought to be persistent from long-lived memory B-cell responses. 删除9：<u>7 8 </u>Despite minor fluctuating titres of autoantibodies, the Ro52/Ro60 autoantibodies in SS tend to persist and once positive, remains so. 删除9：<u>9 10 </u>Likewise, it is unusual to develop new autoantibodies such as anti-Ro60 in patients tracked longitudinally. 删除9：<u>11 </u>This points to an immune response and autoantibodies that is likely ‘hard-wired’ and reliant on adaptive memory responses.\n\n【25】However, what occurs in human disease is in stark contrast to experimental mice models that show spontaneous and rapid epitope spreading of autoantibodies from Ro52 to Ro60 and La autoantigens after immunisation. 删除9：<u>12 13 </u>To our knowledge, no other case of SS in the literature has documented the epitope spreading of Ro52 to Ro60 and La. In spite of the immunological maturation, this did not coincide with an appreciable evolution of her disease with relatively stable EULAR SS disease activity indices (ESSDAI) throughout the last few years of observation .\n\n【26】It is also conceivable that other SS patients follow a similar trajectory yet be overlooked in the clinic as they may not have had autoantibodies serially tested. Serial autoantibody (antiextractable nuclear antigen) testing is currently dissuaded as there is little clinical benefit and it is costly. 删除9：<u>14 </u>Furthermore, Ro/La autoantibodies may appear many years before the onset of clinical symptoms and diagnosis in SS. 删除9：<u>15 </u>Thus, epitope spreading and development of autoantibodies at the start of failed immunological tolerance may be occurring in this predisease phase which may continue in the symptomatic phase. As support for this theory, SS patients who also have more Ro/La autoantibodies also tend to have autoantibodies of other specificities and higher ANA titres, indicating likely antigen epitope spreading. 删除9：<u>16</u>\n\n【27】One factor that may influence the tendency to develop autoantibodies is the patient’s HLA genotype. Interestingly, our patient did not harbour any recognised SS HLA class II risk alleles 删除10：<u>( online supplemental table 1 )</u>, particularly HLA-DRB1\\*0301. 删除9：<u>17 </u>These HLA risk alleles are also associated with SS patients that tend to have greater serological activity and epitope spread to Ro/La autoantigens, as opposed to remain singularly positive for anti-Ro52 or anti-Ro60. 删除9：<u>18 19 </u>At a pathophysiological level, these risk HLA alleles probably relate to the T cells’ abilities to recognise and engage in Ro/La autoantigens. 删除9：<u>19 </u>This is supported in part by the recent observations of a higher diversity of T cell clonotypes associated with Ro/La positivity in SS patients. 删除9：<u>20</u>\n\n【28】The natural molecular evolution and the pathogenesis of autoantibodies is still poorly understood. It is conceivable that dying or apoptotic cells cause the exposure of these RNP autoantigens. 删除9：<u>21 </u>The defective clearance of these cells and autoantigens coupled with other stimulatory factors such as Toll-like receptor signalling contributes to the autoantibody pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. 删除9：<u>22 </u>In addition, molecular mimicry between pathogens and these autoantigens may provide a mechanism for the development of autoantibodies and in SLE, it is hypothesised that key cross-reactive, ‘driving’ epitope sequences, to which autoantibodies appear early to, can help promote diversification of the immune response. 删除9：<u>23</u>\n\n【29】Autoantibodies may hold prognostic information in SS. Seropositive SS patients with anti-Ro/La autoantibodies are more likely to be younger and develop extraglandular manifestations including haematological, neurological and immunological complications. 删除9：<u>24 25 </u>Although isolated anti-Ro52 SS patients have rarely been studied, a recent study found that patients with isolated anti-Ro52 (which was initially the case for our patient) may represent a severe subset of SS patients with higher disease activity over patients with additional autoantibodies. 删除9：<u>26 </u>Among seropositive SS patients, those with isolated anti-Ro52 are rarer (around 11%) compared with those with anti-Ro60 and/or anti-La. Anti-Ro52 autoantibodies are found in a range of autoimmune diseases (38% in a diagnostic laboratory cohort) and non-autoimmune diseases such as malignancies and interstitial lung disease (ILD). 删除9：<u>27 </u>By themselves, the autoantibodies are non-specific; yet hold distinct clinical utility from anti-Ro60, warranting separating detection in the diagnostic laboratory. 删除9：<u>28 </u>One recognised utility for anti-Ro52 is in the identification of ILD patients that have poorer prognoses over anti-Ro52-negative patients. 删除9：<u>29</u>\n\n【30】These observations support the accurate serological phenotyping of patients with SS. Whether there is clinical benefit to periodic monitoring of autoantibodies to the Ro/La RNP remains to be decided in longitudinal studies. Although autoantibody titres may fluctuate longitudinally, it is rare for there to be the acquisition or loss of a particular autoantibody. 删除9：<u>7 11 30 </u>It may not be unreasonable, however, to consider rechecking these Ro/La autoantibodies if there has been a clinical change; for example, if the patient has developed features of a secondary autoimmune disorder. In our department, rechecking of autoantibodies are variable, are clinician-dependent and may occur every 6–12 months at their regular follow-up, or only once at baseline.\n\n【31】In brief, we describe an interesting case of clinically stable SS despite molecular evolution. Given that serological manifestations including autoantibodies may precede the onset of clinical features and SS diagnosis by many years and appear in otherwise healthy individuals, 删除13：<u>15 31 </u>it is reasonable for us to continue periodically monitoring the patient to check for the development of severe extraglandular manifestations. However, SS is a disease that generally sees clinical stability in longitudinal studies, 删除13：<u>1 </u>providing some reassurance. Autoantibody profiles tend to also remain very stable and to our knowledge, we provide the first described instance of an SS patient longitudinally developing new autoantibodies to the Ro/La RNP complex. It is possible that we have captured the early stages of our patient’s disease. Future studies are required to unearth the origins and mechanisms of autoantibodies and epitope spreading, as this will likely lead to insights into the immunopathogenesis of autoimmunity and possible targeted therapeutics.\n\n【32】### Learning points\n\n【33】*   Autoantibodies are key by-products of failed immune tolerance in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS).\n\n【34】*   The serostatus (detected/not detected) of autoantibodies to ribonucleoproteins tend to remain stable longitudinally and yield prognostic clinical information.\n\n【35】*   Further research to unearth the origins and mechanisms of failed humoral tolerance and hence, the development of autoantibodies, will be instrumental in developing appropriate, targeted therapies in SS.\n\n【36】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【37】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【38】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:41:39", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:41:58", "cost": 19.28}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:41:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:41:39"}

Both systemic and local conditions can contribute to macrocheilia, which may even reveal a systemic disease. Granulomatous disease, as orofacial granulomatosis, is defined as a pattern of disease characterised by granulomatous inflammation with persistent and/or recurrent labial swelling, oral ulcers and a variety of other orofacial features, which is localised to orofacial region. The aetiopathogenesis of orofacial granulomatosis remains debate: it includes hypersensitivity to food or food additives or various dental materials, hereditary and genetic predisposition, inflammatory/immunological and microbiological factors, sarcoidosis, Crohn’s disease (CD) and Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. 删除9：<u>1 </u>A detailed history and physical examination may help narrow the differential, but a biopsy of the lesion is often necessary for diagnosis. Handa _et al_ presented a clinic-pathological study of 28 patients having chronic macrocheilia. Out of 28 patients, 删除13：<u>13 </u>patients (46.4%) had granulomatous cheilitis and diagnosis was made by histological examination. Miest _et al_ presented a retrospective study of 76 patients complaining lip swelling which had biopsies performed, 40 (47%) had granulomatous inflammation. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Granulomatous cheilitis is considered a rare manifestation of metastatic CD (MCD) which is known as a great mimicker and is often misdiagnosed. 删除9：<u>3 </u>In this situation, diagnosis is confirmed by a colonoscopy usually showing gastrointestinal involvement. In the absence of bowel disease, it may be difficult to distinguish Crohn’s cheilitis from Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, cutaneous sarcoidosis, tuberculosis or other granulomatous disorder. Tuberculin skin test could also be done to exclude mimickers of MCD.\n\n【6】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【7】A late adolescence presented to his family physician with a pronounced swelling on his right upper lip over the past 3 months. He was otherwise healthy. During the assessment, he stated that the lesion was usually pale pink, but on occasion became bright red. On skin examination, a 2 cm, not well-demarcated pink-coloured oval nodule was observed on his cutaneous central upper lip; the neoformation presented a median skin fissure . First of all, tuberculin skin was done to exclude mimickers of MCD. Then, due to the inconsistency of the pathological features, it was necessary to schedule an MRI, followed by a punch biopsy. MRI reported superior macrocheilia with orbicular muscle component identifiable, incorporated and thickened with oedematous manifestations of the bundles ; these findings were not typical of CD-related cheilitis. Histological examination with H&E stain showed well-formed granulomas surrounded by mixed chronic inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, Langhans giant cells and plasma cells present throughout the dermis extending into the superficial fat. Focal spongiosis and exocytosis were also noted. Examination by polarisation and stains for fungi and mycobacteria (periodic acid–Schiff staining), acid and alcohol-fast bacilli testing, Grocott’s methenamine silver stain, were negative. Suspecting granulomatous cheilitis as a metastatic Crohn localisation, a colonoscopy was scheduled showing coarsening involvement of the mucosal pattern in the terminal ileum . A biopsy from the terminal ileum was taken, confirming the same pattern of the previous one. Given the clinical history and biopsy results, the diagnosis was made. Considering the clinical situation, various treatment options were discussed with the patient which opted to treat just the cheilitis lesion. This conservative approach imposed a strict and scheduled follow-up cooperating with the gastroenterology equipment. Marked improvement of the lesion was observed at his 3-month follow-up appointment .\n\n【8】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【9】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【10】Clinical appearance at the first visit.</u>\n\n【11】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【12】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【13】MRI.</u>\n\n【14】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【15】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【16】Colonoscopy showing hyperaemic ileal mucosa with sores and erosions.</u>\n\n【17】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【18】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【19】Three months control.</u>\n\n【20】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【21】Macrocheilia is often misdiagnosed.

For example, hidradenitis suppurativa, impetigo, erysipelas present peculiar clinical features: erythematous boils, scabs in the context of an oedematous generally tender tissue. Orofacial granulomatosis is defined as recurrent or persistent facial soft tissue swelling in the absence of a specific previously diagnosed local or systemic disease. When it is associated with fissured tongue, lip swelling and facial palsy, the condition is more specifically associated as Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. On the other hand, isolated swelling or enlargement of the lip is known as granulomatous cheilitis which can be associated with sarcoidosis, CD (as a manifestation of MCD) and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【26】Due the inconsistency of the pathological clinical features and considering the importance of a biopsy in same case, it is necessary to schedule an MR to characterise the lesion.

Unfortunately, there is no consensus on standard treatment as no clinical trials have been done to guide treatment. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Several methods have been trialled varying in treatment length and response.

This choice was supported by the patient but imposed a strict and scheduled follow-up cooperating with the gastroenterology equipment.\n\n【36】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【37】After the diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis has been made, the patient was assessed also by gastroenterology equipment. Colonoscopy showed coarsening of the mucosal pattern in the terminal ileum even any kind of symptoms were not already present. A conservative approach with doxycycline 100 mg and deltacortene 25 mg daily was chosen. This choice was supported by the patient but imposed a strict and scheduled follow-up with periodic check every 6 months with a medical examination and evaluation of the global disease activity by blood chemistry tests (ESR, PCR, blood count, sideremia, liver and kidney function). A control colonoscopy was scheduled after a year or wherever necessary. Marked improvement of the lesion was observed at his 3-month follow-up appointment. The patient follow-up is still ongoing.\n\n【38】Discussion\n----------\n\n【39】Macrocheilia is a descriptive term commonly used to describe a variety of conditions that exhibit similar microscopic and clinical features. It usually describes persistent enlargement of the soft tissues of the oral and maxillofacial region especially upper and lower lips. Clinical presentation is very changeable but usually recurrent facial swelling, mainly in the lips with or without intraoral manifestations, is the single most common clinical feature at onset. The association with systemic conditions such as CD or sarcoidosis has been widely reported in literature. Moreover, it may precede CD by several years, frequently remaining the only evident active focus of the disease, and it may frequently represent an extraintestinal manifestation of CD in which oral lesions can be the first sign of an unknown intestinal disease. 删除9：<u>12 13</u>\n\n【40】The detection of specific oral manifestations often preceded by painless gingival enlargement (diffuse lip and buccal mucosal swelling, oral cobblestoning, buccal sulcus ulceration and mucosal tags) and/or unspecific or ancillary ones (cheilitis, scaly perioral erythematous rashes and frank intraoral abscess formation, labial and tongue fissuring, glossitis and aphthous stomatitis) is mandatory for the early diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis as a form of MCD.\n\n【41】Hence, the inflammatory bowel disease is a common illness that gastroenterologists encounter, about 40% of patients with CD have cutaneous symptoms, making the skin the most common site of extraintestinal involvement. 删除9：<u>14 </u>This association between gut and skin can be classified into three broad groups described in table 2 .\n\n【42】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【43】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 2\n\n【44】Classification of cutaneous manifestation of Crohn’s disease</u>\n\n【45】No clear correlation between the development of MCD and severity of underlying Crohn’s has been established. In fact, the skin lesions may be present during, after and in rare cases before the presence of the inflammatory bowel disease. Cutaneous findings tend to occur more often with CD that involves the large bowel. Granulomatous cheilitis, such as other forms of oral CD, may precede, coincide with or follow the onset of gastrointestinal disease as in the case presented. In the absence of bowel disease, it may be difficult to distinguish granulomatous cheilitis from the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.\n\n【46】Diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis starts with clinical investigations but a biopsy of the lesion is always necessary.\n\n【47】As regards clinical examination, cutaneous manifestations of MCD have fairly variable morphology, 删除13：<u>3 </u>for example, lesions present in intertriginous areas tend to have an ulcerated appearance; while lesions on the extremities tend to be erythematous and sometimes painful. Other morphological features include violaceous perifollicular papules and lichenoid papules found on the neck and lower limbs and erythematous plaques on the face and the extremities. In the situation presented, a 2 cm, not well-demarcated usually pink-coloured oval nodule was observed on his cutaneous central upper lip; the neoformation presented a median skin fissure. As mentioned, diagnosis is based on histological examination; microscopically, the dominant histological features of MCD are similar to the primary Crohn’s bowel lesions. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【48】MRI could be more useful than an ultrasound scan even in this case MRI findings were not typical of CD-related cheilitis.\n\n【49】Colonoscopy with a biopsy is always recommended: they will confirm diagnosis especially in the absence of clinical bowel manifestations as in this situation. In this situation, as in the most cases, biopsy confirmed the same pattern of the previous obtained from the lip.\n\n【50】Considering the clinical situation, various treatment options were discussed with the patient which opted to treat just the cheilitis lesion. This conservative approach imposed a strict and scheduled follow-up cooperating with the gastroenterology equipment. This choice was supported by the patient but imposed a strict and scheduled follow-up with periodic check every 6 months with a medical examination and evaluation of the disease activity by blood chemistry tests. A control colonoscopy was also scheduled after a year or wherever necessary. Patients with asymptomatic CD often develop complications during their clinical course because the absence of symptoms does not imply an absence of inflammation. The prognostic value and objectivity of endoscopy remains irreplaceable. Together with endoscopy, the role of less invasive techniques such as imaging tests (MR enterography, CT enterography and even echography, with and without contrast agent) and faecal markers (faecal calprotectin) has been reaffirmed in the literature in order to follow up the disease course. White blood cells, procalcitonin, PCR (C reactive protein), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), anti-TNF and its antibodies are precious indicators of inflammation. It is also mandatory to do periodic check of complete blood count, iron and ferritin, folate, transferrin, group B vitamins looking for anaemia. Finally is recommended to exclude faecal occult blood and a possible cancer degeneration.\n\n【51】Even treatment options remain underwhelming due to the lack of randomised control studies and varying responses of reported therapeutic methods, marked improvement of the lesion was observed after 3-month follow-up.\n\n【52】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【53】‘I’m very happy about my situation now. I was very scared because I did not find any kind of help and the lesion on the face was growing up. A correct diagnostic and therapeutic approach gave me the opportunity to improve my health and prevent complications. I could choose from various treatment options and I opted for a conservative approach to treat just the cheilitis lesion which resulted very useful. After just 3 months, the upper lip lesion has improved. I am sure that gastroenterology equipment will manage in the best way any kind of systemic manifestation of my pathology.’\n\n【54】### Learning points\n\n【55】*   Macrocheilia is a descriptive term commonly used to describe a variety of conditions that exhibit similar microscopic and clinical features.\n\n【56】*   Granulomatous cheilitis is a possible option in differential diagnoses of macrocheilia and is the rarest manifestation of metastatic Crohn’s disease.\n\n【57】*   Cutaneous findings may precede, develop concurrently with or follow gastrointestinal involvement.\n\n【58】*   A biopsy is always required for a definitive diagnosis.\n\n【59】*   A correct diagnosis and a well-targeted therapeutic approach led to an improvement of the clinical status.\n\n【60】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【61】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【62】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:27:49", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:28:05", "cost": 15.755}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:28:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:27:49"}

It was developed by Donald Nuss in 1987 and implemented as primary treatment in the late 1990s. 删除9：<u>1 </u>This minimally invasive surgery achieves improvement of thoracic anatomy, aesthetics and cardiopulmonary function. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>However, early and late complications of the Nuss procedure often occur.

Fortunately, due to the introduction of stabilisers and fixation techniques, the incidence has decreased over the years from 15% to 3%–7%. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【8】In this report, we present a patient with an abdominal location of a bar due to the extraordinary occurrence of subdiaphragmatic migration following the Nuss procedure.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】The patient is an adolescent boy with a history of mild scoliosis and epilepsy, without any seizures or medication in the 7 years prior to surgery. To remedy cosmetic problems of PE, he underwent a thoracoscopic-guided Nuss procedure. During the procedure, no unexpected events occurred and the patient completed his admission without complications. Perioperative images showed a good intrathoracic placement of the Nuss bar. One month after surgery, he presented with thoracic pain, which was interpreted as persistent postoperative pain. Physical examination and a thoracic X-ray showed no abnormalities and an unaltered position of the Nuss bar. Eight months after surgery, he presented with position-dependent discomfort and a recurrence of the PE, for which bar revision was indicated. During surgery, subdiaphragmatic and intra-abdominal migration of the bar were seen. Subsequently, the bar was removed, and a new bar was placed intrathoracically.\n\n【11】Initial Nuss bar placement\n--------------------------\n\n【12】The initial bar placement by video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) was done under both general and epidural anaesthesia, with the patient placed in supine position. The bar was measured and bent to fit size. An incision was made on both sides of the thorax, followed by submuscular tunnelling. A 5 mm trocar was introduced in the anterior section of the axillary region on the right side, followed by insufflation of carbon dioxide and tunnelling under thoracoscopic vision. A precordial tunnel from side to side was created. A silicon tube was secured to the tunneler, after which the previously bent bar was pulled back through the precordial tunnel . The bar turned with good result, and haemodynamic changes were not noted. A fixation plate was introduced on the left side, on which the lateral part of the bar was bent to prevent slip-off of the plate. Haemostasis of the precordial tunnel and operative wounds was achieved. The wounds were closed in layers. The procedure was carried out without any complications and with minimal blood loss. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3.\n\n【13】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【14】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【15】Intraoperative view of first bar placement.</u>\n\n【16】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【17】The first postoperative X-ray showed a good position of the bar .

Incisions were made at the same level as during the previous surgery and scar tissue was excised. Subsequently, the bar and fixation plate on the left side were mobilised. Led by palpable movement, localisation of the bar was attempted on the right side without any success. A 5 mm trocar was introduced in the frontal axillary region on the right side, followed by creating thoracoscopic vision. Under direct vision, the bar could not be identified on the right side of the thorax. Migration to the subdiaphragmatic region appeared to have occurred, as movement of the bar was seen below the diaphragm. There were no signs of damage to the diaphragm or surrounding tissues . The left thoracic incision site was extended, and the Nuss bar was manually removed through the left side, without any haemodynamic changes. A precordial tunnel from side to side was created again. A silicon tube was secured to the tunnelling instrument, after which the newly bent bar was retracted through the precordial tunnel. The bar turned with good result and without any haemodynamic changes. A fixation plate was introduced; this time on the right side, on which the lateral part of the bar was bent to prevent slip-off of the plate. Haemostasis of the precordial tunnel and operative wounds was achieved. The wounds were closed in layers. The operation was carried out without any complications and with minimal blood loss.

Simon _et al_ have reported an intra-abdominal migration of a bar into the stomach in a man in his 20s. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Tahmassebi _et al_ reported a case of a man in late adolescence, in which VATS failed to view an intrathoracic bar. 删除9：<u>6 </u>By instrumental palpation, subdiaphragmatic position of the bar was concluded. Via an incision in the diaphragm, the bar was successfully removed without complications.\n\n【37】Moreover, Tahmassebi _et al_ present 12 other bar migration cases from literature, in most of which the aetiology remained unclear. Migration sites included peritoneum, ascending aorta, left ventricle of the heart and liver. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【38】Among other types of displacement, Hoel _et al_ reported a life-threatening laceration of the ascending aorta in a young boy 2 months after a Nuss procedure. A cardiac tamponade was the consequence of this laceration, which was relieved by immediate needle aspiration from the pericardium and subsequent median sternotomy for removal of the bar. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Furthermore, Yang _et al_ presented a similar case in which displacement of the bar caused cardiac tamponade 6 months after the Nuss procedure. 删除9：<u>8</u>\n\n【39】Kanegaonkar and Dussek presented a case report of three bar migration cases. One case was a patient in early adolescence who at the age of 2 years had received a lower lobectomy for an unresolving lobar consolidation. Because of sternal depression, the patient underwent resection of the costal cartilages from the third rib downwards and a partial transverse sternotomy followed by a bar placement. During elective bar removal after 2 years, a part of the bar was seen buried into newly formed bone of the sixth rib. The other two cases presented by Kanegaonkar and Dussek concerned bar migration into the thoracic cavity. One was observed during elective bar removal, the other was seen on CT after a failed attempt to remove the bar because it could not be located during surgery. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【40】While bar displacement may occur in 3%–7% of cases, bar migration is a rather extraordinary occurrence with an unknown prevalence. It could be defined as passage of foreign material through organs or tissues without any damage to those organs or tissues. 删除9：<u>6 </u>In our case, indeed, damage to the diaphragm was seen neither during the initial procedure nor during the second procedure. Several mechanisms have been proposed that could cause such migration events, including cardiac and lung activity, patient rotation activities, narrow thickness of the bar and unilateral fixation of the bar where the movement of the contralateral side is not limited. Furthermore, in the case of bar migration to the subdiaphragmatic region, self-healing of the diaphragm could conceal the extrathoracic position of the bar during surgery.\n\n【41】If migration of a Nuss bar is suspected, thorough examination through X-rays and, if necessary, CT scans are advocated to be the first course of action. Furthermore, an ultrasound could confirm whether the bar is located above or below the diaphragm. In addition, MRI could assess if the bar has penetrated diaphragmatic structures. When bar migration or displacement of the bar is highly suspected, but not seen on imaging techniques, a second look through thoracoscopic surgery is indicated.\n\n【42】When intra-abdominal migration is seen on additional imaging, a revision through endoscopic surgery is necessary to safely remove the bar. Furthermore, VATS or laparoscopy may be insufficient to locate and remove the migrated bar, such as in the case described by Tahmassebi _et al_ . In such circumstances, an open approach through laparotomy may be the best option for correct and safe removal of the Nuss bar. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【43】Nevertheless, novel methods have been proposed for reducing the risk of bar migration or displacement. For instance, Tam _et al_ recently presented the ZipFix stabilisation method in 20 patients without any recurrence or bar displacement, by using a biocompatible cable-tie implant. 删除9：<u>10 </u>However, these methods are yet to be further studied for their success rates.\n\n【44】In conclusion, bar migration following the Nuss procedure is a rare occurrence with an unknown aetiology. On occurrence or suspicion of bar migration, cautious action through X-ray, CT scan and VATS is essential. New methods that could reduce the risk of bar migration or displacement are yet to be studied.\n\n【45】### Learning points\n\n【46】*   Extrathoracic or intra-abdominal migration of a Nuss bar is a rare but potential appearance.\n\n【47】*   The aetiology of this type of migration is unknown.\n\n【48】*   Low-threshold X-thorax, CT of the thorax and possibly revision are essential when new thoracic symptoms present in patients with a Nuss bar.\n\n【49】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【50】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【51】Obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:52:01", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:53:03", "cost": 62.189}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:53:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:52:01"}

XGI is characterised by an intense collection of foamy histiocytes, plasma cells, lymphocytes, a few polymorphonuclear cells, with or without the presence of multinucleated giant cells, which are seen surrounding and/or destroying the normal structures of the tissue affected. 删除9：<u>3–5 </u>XGE can mimic endometrial carcinoma clinically and on imaging studies. It may lead to a fatal outcome if not treated in time. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Till date, there have been very few cases reported in the world literature with varied presentations. Here, we report a case of XGE with salpingo-oophoritis presenting as pyometra causing a dilemma in diagnosis and management.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A postmenopausal woman in her 70s, with past history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, presented with pain in the suprapubic and left iliac regions with minimal white discharge per vaginum for 6 weeks. She didn’t reveal any significant previous gynaecological history. On examination, the patient was afebrile and vitals were stable. General physical examination was normal and systemic examination revealed the scar of previous sterilisation. On abdominal examination she had mild tenderness in the suprapubic region but no mass was palpable. On speculum examination, parous external os with purulent yellowish discharge was noted which was non-foul smelling. Erosion was noted in the posterior lip of the cervix. On bimanual examination the uterus was retroverted, enlarged to 8–10 weeks size, and bilateral forniceal tenderness was present.\n\n【10】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【11】Blood investigations were done. The total and differential leucocyte counts were normal and the random blood sugar was 195 gm/dL with an glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C) level of 7.8. Pap smear showed dense sheets of neutrophils and numerous coccobacilli. Culture of high vaginal swab showed growth of _Klebsiella pneumonia_ sensitive to various antibiotics. Ultrasonography of abdomen and pelvis showed hypoechoic fluid collection of 4.5×4.5 cm <sup>2 </sup> size with internal echoes, in the upper uterine cavity suggestive of pyometra/serometra. A mixed echoic structure of 4.5×4 cm <sup>2 </sup> abutting the left lateral body of uterus was also seen. MRI of the pelvis showed hyperintense, irregular, heterogenous, predominantly solid, tubo-ovarian mass in the left adnexa and fluid collection of 4×3×3 cm <sup>3 </sup> distending the endometrial cavity suggestive of pyometra/haematometra . She was evaluated for ovarian cancer and CA125 level was normal (24.8 IU/mL) giving an risk of malignancy index(RMI) Score of 74.4.\n\n【12】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【13】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【14】MRI showing hyperintense tubular fluid-filled lesion in the left adnexa, displacing the uterus right laterally and altered signal intensity fluid collection distending the endometrial cavity.</u>\n\n【15】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【16】Infectious conditions like Gram-negative bacterial infections, fungal infections, malakoplakia and granulomatous infections like endometrial tuberculosis can present with vaginal discharge.\n\n【17】Carcinoma of endometrium was considered due to the advanced age and presence of pyometra on ultrasound.\n\n【18】Carcinoma of endocervix was another differential diagnosis, as there was history of vaginal discharge with cervical erosion. However pap smear revealed absence of intraepithelial malignancy.\n\n【19】Carcinoma of ovary was another possibility due to the presence of tubo-ovarian mass on imaging, however RMI showed a low risk for malignancy.\n\n【20】Treatment\n---------\n\n【21】The patient was given antibiotics according to the culture and sensitivity report of the swab. Blood sugars were optimised. She underwent pyometra drainage along with endometrial biopsy . Histopathology of the endometrial sample revealed sheets of foamy histiocytes with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates suggestive of XGE . As there was involvement of the tube and ovary, she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy. Intraoperatively the uterus appeared atrophic, the bilateral tubes were normal, the right ovary was atrophic and the left ovary showed a 5×4 cm <sup>2 </sup> sized tubo-ovarian mass adherent to the underlying sigmoid colon and a 1×1 cm <sup>2 </sup> hard yellowish nodule was seen in the left mesosalpinx. The cut surface of the tubo-ovarian mass was solid and yellowish in colour . Histopathology of the hysterectomy specimen confirmed chronic XGE with intramural leiomyoma and chronic xanthogranulomatous salpingitis . The nodule from the mesosalphinx showed chronic xanthogranulomatous oophoritis. The right ovary was unremarkable and there was no evidence of malignancy on histopathology.\n\n【22】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【23】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【24】Histopathology showing sheets of foamy histiocytes replacing the endometrium.</u>\n\n【25】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【26】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【27】Gross specimen of uterus with bilateral tubes and left tubo-ovarian (arrow marked) mass with yellowish discolouration.</u>\n\n【28】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【29】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【30】Histopathology showing sheets of foamy histiocytes replacing the endometrium.</u>\n\n【31】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【32】The patient came for follow-up 6 weeks after surgery and was reassured about her histopathology report. She was asymptomatic and advised to maintain blood sugars within normal range with diet and medications.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】XGE with salpingo-oophoritis is a rare disease characterised by chronic inflammation of the endometrium, tubes and ovary. The first case in the Indian population was reported by Barua _et al_ in 1978. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Not many cases have been reported so far in the Indian literature. The age of incidence ranges from 45 years to 88 years. The clinical features include lower abdominal pain, excessive vaginal discharge, pyometra and haematometra. 删除9：<u>7 8 </u>One case of primary infertility with endometriosis and premature ovarian insufficiency has also been reported. 删除9：<u>9 10 </u>Our case was a postmenopausal woman aged 70 years who also presented with lower abdominal pain and pyometra with Klebsiella infection. In a case report by Patel _et al_ , ultrasound imaging showed unilateral tubo-ovarian mass of xanthogranulomatous salpingo-oophoritis which was similar to our case. 删除9：<u>11 </u>The pathogenesis of XGE is not well understood. Russack _et al_ described that XGE involves a complex interaction of multiple factors, including cervical obstruction, inflammation and the presence of lipid, resulting in generation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation.通用删除4(英):<u> <sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> Other contributing features include necrosis and haemorrhage. Previous authors have also identified cervical stenosis as a risk factor for XGE. However it was not found in our case. Du _et al_ , have reported diabetes mellitus as a possible risk factor for the development of XGI. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Other possible risk factors include pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, intrauterine contraceptive device and antibiotic treatment. Our case did not have any other risk factors apart from diabetes. Different bacteria like _Escherichia coli_ and _Proteus vulgaris_ have been recognised as contributing factors. Klebsiella subspecies was found in our case which is not reported so far as an aetiological organism. Histopathology is characterised by granulation tissue with foamy histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, haemosiderin and calcium. Immunohistochemistry is found helpful in cases of diagnostic difficulty. As the diagnosis was evident in our case by histopathology, immunohistochemistry was not done.\n\n【35】Various granulomatous conditions such as tuberculosis and fungal infection are known to present as XGE. In our case all these conditions were excluded by histopathology. One- fourth of the cases reported so far were associated with malignancy. The non-specific symptoms and presentation makes the differentiation between XGE and malignancy difficult. Sampling of the entire endometrium is important to diagnose and eliminate the risk of endometrial carcinoma. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Early diagnosis and treatment of urogenital infection with appropriate antibiotics can prevent the development of chronic XGE. Surgery is sometimes the appropriate management especially when relapse occurs following antibiotic treatment. Surgical management was done in our case due to tubo-ovarian involvement and the suspicion of coexisting malignancy. Rarely death can occur secondary to systemic inflammation. 删除9：<u>5</u>\n\n【36】### Patients perspective\n\n【37】I was told that there is a suspicion of malignancy of my womb and following surgery, it was a relief to know that i had a benign condition.\n\n【38】### Learning points\n\n【39】*   Xanthogranulomatous endometritis (XGE) is a pathological diagnosis and Gram-negative bacteria including _Klebsiella pneumonia_ can cause XGE.\n\n【40】*   Most of the cases of XGE may need hysterectomy and other granulomatous conditions like tuberculosis and fungal infections have to be ruled out. Early diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antibiotics may prevent the need for hysterectomy.\n\n【41】*   Knowledge of this rare inflammatory condition is important for the gynaecologist and general physician so that the patient can be properly counselled.\n\n【42】*   Frozen section can be done as there is a high chance of coexisting malignancy and if found positive one can proceed with pelvic lymphadenectomy.\n\n【43】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【44】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【45】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:32:27", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:47:47", "cost": 919.371}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:47:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:32:27"}

This followed detection of bilateral renal artery stenosis during investigation for severe hypertension refractory to medical therapy. CT angiography revealed diffuse wall thickening of the abdominal aorta, in keeping with an aortitis. However, there was no serological or clinical evidence suggestive of a vasculitic process. Medical history included cranial diabetes insipidus, subclavian artery stenosis and spinal stenosis requiring surgery, over the course of 8 years. These findings led to consideration of Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), a form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, where there is abnormal proliferation of histiocytes which causes tissue fibrosis and sclerosis of the long bones. Subsequent plain radiographs of the long bones revealed appearances consistent with a diagnosis of ECD. Thus, a diagnosis of an LCH/ECD overlap syndrome was made.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   hypertension\n*   interventional radiology\n*   renal medicine\n*   rheumatology\n*   vasculitis\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

ECD belongs to a group of conditions known as rare histiocytoses and has been recently recognised as a neoplastic disease. The hallmark of ECD is symmetric osteosclerosis of the long bones due to the build up of CD68+ and CD1a− histiocytes, which manifests as bone pain, with leg pain being the most common symptom. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>ECD is a heterogeneous disease, a great mimicker and is underdiagnosed. 删除9：<u>1 </u>As ECD is multisystemic, vascular involvement may mimic large vessel vasculitis (eg, Takayasu’s arteritis). We report the case of a male patient investigated for large vessel vasculitis, who was eventually diagnosed with an ECD and LCH overlap syndrome, 删除13：<u>8 </u>years after initial presentation. This case was particularly thought-provoking due to the challenge and complexity of the diagnosis and the multiple and varied complications.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】This report describes a male lawyer in his 50s, presenting with a history of hypertension, cranial diabetes insipidus (DI), subclavian stenosis, spinal stenosis and a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH).\n\n【10】Medications included bisoprolol 10 mg daily, amlodipine 5 mg daily, doxazosin 8 mg daily, simvastatin 20 mg nocte and minoxidil 400 mg daily. He was a non-smoker, who drank less than 20 units of alcohol per week. Family history was unremarkable.\n\n【11】The initial diagnosis of cutaneous LCH was made following presentation with alopecia and patchy erythema affecting the head, neck and torso. Skin biopsy findings were consistent with LCH and he was treated with immunosuppression, using azathioprine, which was continued for several years. That same year he was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus (DI) and prescribed desmopressin. The DI was complicated by intermittent severe hyponatraemia, which on one occasion induced an epileptiform seizure. In the following year, he developed back pain, which was related to dural thickening and a tumour involving the cranial dura and spine, which required spinal decompression surgery. Biopsy of the spinal tumour demonstrated inflammatory changes only. Cladribine chemotherapy was commenced, after the spinal cord histiocytic process was operated on.\n\n【12】Seven years after the initial diagnosis of cutaneous LCH, the patient was noted to have developed refractory hypertension. The refractory hypertension was investigated with CT imaging which revealed changes suggestive of aortitis, with arterial wall thickening and bilateral renal artery stenosis, leading to a rheumatology referral. On review, the patient did not have weight loss, fevers or night sweats. There were no symptoms of claudication, but mobility had declined since the operations for spinal stenosis. He did not have bony pain, chest pain or dyspnoea.\n\n【13】On examination, blood pressure (BP) was raised in both arms. The left arm BP measured 140/100 mm Hg and the right arm BP was 180/110. The patient remained hypertensive despite medical management with: bisoprolol 10 mg daily, amlodipine 5 mg daily, doxazosin 8 mg daily and minoxidil 400 mg daily. ACE inhibitors were not used in light of the severe renal artery stenosis, as they may precipitate deteriorating renal function. The subclavian pulse on the left was weaker than the right, in keeping with previous subclavian stenosis. Pedal pulses were palpable. The peripheries were warm and well perfused with no trophic changes. There was no detectable lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】Review of the CT angiography revealed diffuse wall thickening of the abdominal aorta , a left subclavian artery stenosis, severe stenosis of a single right renal artery and severe ostial stenosis of the superior left renal artery , with complete occlusion of the inferior left anomalous branch, with stenoses also affecting the coeliac axis and inferior mesenteric artery. Laboratory investigations demonstrated normal liver function. Renal function showed urea 7.4 mmol/L, creatinine 112 mmol/L, eGFR 61 mL/min, which was the baseline. The C reactive protein (CRP) level was mildly raised at 19 g/L. Since the chemotherapy treatment there was a chronic normocytic normochromic anaemia, haemoglobin 82 g/L and thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 34×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, attributable to the cladribine chemotherapy. ANA, ANCA, complement factors 3 and 4, rheumatoid factor, immunoglobulins, cryoglobulins and a full virology screen were normal or negative. Urinalysis was negative in all parameters. Bone marrow biopsy revealed trilineage dysplastic features; no excess of blasts were seen. The myeloid lineage cells showed shift to the left and mature myeloid cells were reduced. CD34 positive cells were mildly increased in numbers.\n\n【16】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【17】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【18】CT angiogram showing (A) diffuse wall thickening of the abdominal aorta .

(C) Marked improvement in the calibre of the left renal artery 6 months after left renal artery angioplasty.</u>\n\n【19】To further investigate the aortic wall thickening, an通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> F-FDG PET/CT was performed which revealed no evidence for FDG avidity in the vasculature.\n\n【20】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【21】A number of factors made the diagnostic process complicated. The presence of aortic wall thickening, left subclavian and visceral artery stenoses with a raised CRP left open the diagnosis of a large vessel vasculitis. However, the absence of systemic symptoms or other signs of chronic inflammation including a normal serum albumin level made this diagnosis less likely. However, interpretation of the blood tests was complicated by the previous chemotherapy. The latter was held responsible for the normochromic normocytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia and this was confirmed following bone marrow analysis. Arterial wall thickening on a CTA scan does not necessarily equate to active inflammation and to investigate this further an通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> F-FDG-PET/CT scan was performed. The lack of any evidence for FDG avidity in the arterial wall at sites of thickening or elsewhere, while not completely excluding a large vessel vasculitis, suggested there was no detectable arterial wall inflammation. As a consequence of these findings and the pre-existing diagnosis of LCH the possibility of ECD was considered. ECD is a known mimic of large vessel vasculitis. Plain radiographs of the long bones (femurs, tibia and fibula) were performed and demonstrated irregular thickening of the cortices, a marked striated appearance of the lower femora, with areas of sclerosis and patchy lucency, a classic finding in ECD . A diagnosis of LCH/ECD overlap, with xanthogranulomatous tissue inﬁltration affecting multiple systems including: the long bones, central nervous system (CNS) and dura, skin, arterial tree and the retroperitoneum was subsequently made.\n\n【22】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【23】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【24】Plain radiographs showing irregular thickening of the cortices, a striated appearance of the lower femora, with areas of sclerosis and patchy lucency.</u>\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】Following a multidisciplinary team discussion involving rheumatologists, radiologists and haematologists, the treatment priority was considered to be control of the refractory hypertension. The patient underwent successful angioplasty of both the right renal artery stenosis and that involving the superior left renal artery. The arteries were balloon-dilated (to 6 mm on the left and 5 mm on the right), resulting in much improved angiographic appearances postintervention . Although attempts were made to cross the occluded segment involving the proximal portion of the left lower pole anomalous renal artery, these were unsuccessful. Following the procedure the blood pressure fell from 241/122 mm Hg to 130/80 mm Hg. The reduction in blood pressure was noted in the right arm, and was not measured in the left arm due to the left subclavian artery stenosis. Following the renal artery angioplasty the dose of doxazosin and bisoprolol were reduced prior to discharge. He was subsequently withdrawn from antihypertensive medication at the follow-up appointment.\n\n【27】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【28】Although blood pressure control remained satisfactory, 删除13：<u>1 </u>year postprocedure hypertension returned and a repeat CT angiogram scan revealed recurrent right renal artery stenosis. Angiography confirmed wide patency of the left renal artery branches and a recurrent tight stenosis of the ostium of the right renal artery. Angioplasty allowed dilatation of the artery to 6 mm with excellent antegrade flow into the right kidney. However, a small number of filling defects in the periphery of the right upper pole were consistent with thrombus. A 3-month follow-up MRA showed no restenosis and the blood pressure remains well controlled currently at 132/82.\n\n【29】Ongoing care is provided by haematology, dermatology and rheumatology for the ECD and LCH overlap syndrome. The BRAF V600E mutation found in 50% of ECD patients was not detected. Our patient has evidence of LCH on histology, accompanied by imaging findings pathognomonic of ECD. Coexistence of both conditions is rare but some cases have been reported. 删除9：<u>4 </u>It has been suggested that overlap cases typically present with LCH and later progress to ECD. 删除9：<u>5 </u>This would be in keeping with our patient’s course.\n\n【30】The patient remains well. A follow-up cardiac-gated通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18 </sup></u> F-FDG-PET scan excluded cardiac involvement. Ongoing issues include mild thrombocytopenia, related to the cladribine chemotherapy. In the event that the LCH relapses, interferon-α and/or other biological therapy will be considered.\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】ECD is a very rare disease and considered to be a form of non-LCH, resulting from the overproduction of histiocytes. 删除9：<u>1 </u>First identified by Jakob Erdheim, an Austrian pathologist, and William Chester, an American cardiologist, in 1930, they referred to it as ‘lipoid granulomatosis’. Dr Ronald Jaffe reported a third case in 1972, naming the condition Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD). 删除9：<u>4 </u>The current prevalence of ECD is unknown. The disease is poorly recognised, diagnosis is complicated and hence ECD is likely under diagnosed. 删除9：<u>1 </u>ECD has a male to female ratio of 2.4 to 1 and typically presents between 50 and 70 years of age. 删除9：<u>1 6</u>\n\n【33】Although the exact aetiology of ECD is unknown, it has been proposed that proliferation of CD68+ and CD1a− histiocytes results in infiltration and accumulation in organs, resulting in tissue fibrosis. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【34】BRAF V600E gene deregulation has been implicated in ECD, with BRAF V600E mutations detected in 54% of those with ECD and 38% with LCH, while the mutation was absent in those with the other histiocytoses. 删除9：<u>7 </u>The mutation results in uncontrolled generation of histiocytes via activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. 删除9：<u>7 </u>ECD predominantly affects the skeleton (95%), CNS (40%), skin, the retroperitoneum including kidneys (40%–50%) and the cardiorespiratory organs (40%–60%). 删除9：<u>1 3</u>\n\n【35】Definitive diagnosis of ECD is through biopsy, demonstrating abnormal proliferation and accumulation of CD68+ and CD1a− histiocytes. 删除9：<u>1 </u>In this case, biopsy was unattainable, and the diagnosis was made on circumstantial evidence.

I remember early xanthelasma appearing (‘high cholesterol’) and excessive thirst first (‘dehydration’). Subsequently, my skin also started to redden in places. It very slowly worsened and holes had appeared in the skin on my head, middle back and my ear canals were weeping and gooey. This was attributed to ‘work stress’, ‘exposure to the sun’ and ‘diet’. There was a dermatological breakthrough with a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. ‘Mission accomplished’, my skin started clearing up with medication and my diabetes insipidus was under control. However, new adverse symptoms accumulated afterwards, causing multiple problems. These required running repairs and treatments with the help of brilliant medical support and my extraordinary wife that never gave up striving for an answer. Diagnosis, while welcome, always leaves me flat in comparison with the efforts, care and expertise of others to keep me on the road during the difficult time. I would sum the experience as: bafflement, blind alleys, uncertainty, complexity, resolve, perseverance, near misses, luck, inspiration, hope and recovery.\n\n【43】### Learning points\n\n【44】*   Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD) is an extremely rare condition and a form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, characterised by an accumulation and infiltration of histiocytes in tissue.\n\n【45】*   ECD with vascular involvement may mimic large vessel vasculitis.\n\n【46】*   CT/MRI/PET scans, although helpful, cannot definitively differentiate ECD and large vessel vasculitis.

Thus, the patient underwent palliative chemoradiation therapy approximately 4 months later.\n\n【37】Discussion\n----------\n\n【38】Cancer metastasis to the testis has a prevalence of approximately 0.04%, with bilateral metastasis occurring in up to 15% of patients. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>The average age range at the time of diagnosis of primary testicular cancer is 50–69 years. 删除9：<u>9 </u>The rarity of secondary cancer metastasis to the testis may be attributable to the low temperature of the scrotum or the blood–testis barrier. 删除9：<u>8 10</u>\n\n【39】The most common cancers to metastasise to the testes are leukaemia, lymphoma, renal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and prostate, lung and colorectal cancers. Rarely do thyroid cancer, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, gastric carcinoma, upper tract urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma or bladder cancer metastasise to the testis. In children, neuroblastoma, Wilms’ tumour and rhabdomyosarcoma are common origins of metastasis. 删除9：<u>3–8</u>\n\n【40】Zhang _et al_ analysed the literature on pancreatic and ampullary tumours with metastasis to the testis from the last 40 years. A total of 15 cases were reported, predominantly among Japanese men. Typical disease presentation was one slowly enlarging (painless or painful) palpable mass in the scrotum and no specific gastrointestinal symptoms. The incidence of metastasis to the right and left testes from pancreatic cancer was the same. Among the 15 cases, 删除13：<u>8 </u>and 7 patients’ carcinoma, respectively, originated from the pancreatic tail and from the pancreatic head or ampulla. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【41】The underlying path of pancreatic tumour metastasis to the scrotum remains unknown, although several studies have proposed local invasion of adjacent organs by pancreatic cancer, implicating their vasculature in pseudoaneurysms and subsequent distant hematogenous metastasis. 删除9：<u>12–14 </u>Other studies have proposed lymph node metastasis or direct transperitoneal seeding from peritoneal carcinomatosis through the tunica vaginalis. 删除9：<u>12</u>\n\n【42】In our case, immunohistochemical staining was performed, and CK7, CK20 and SMAD4 were positive in the testicular tumour tissue, which is compatible with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Physical examination of the patient revealed hardness of the left spermatic cord but no mass lesion in the left testis. No specific abnormal finding, such as a testicular tumour, was observed in the scrotal sonography.\n\n【43】Chemotherapy is suggested for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, although the literature does not specify an exact regimen to follow. At our multidisciplinary team conference, the specialist, by referring to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines , 删除13：<u>15 </u>advised that modified FOLFIRINOX with (or without) subsequent chemoradiation therapy was the best approach for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, our patient had poor response to chemoradiation therapy.\n\n【44】Although atypical metastatic tumours in the male genital tract from pancreatic cancer are rare, thorough examination to elucidate tumour origin is warranted in men of an advanced age.\n\n【45】### Learning points\n\n【46】*   For older men with testicular tumours, retroperitoneal tumour metastasis and pancreatic tumour should be considered, and comprehensive study should be performed to support a diagnosis.\n\n【47】*   Atypical metastatic tumours in the male genital tract from pancreatic cancer are rare.\n\n【48】*   Both physical examination and imaging, including sonography, are needed to make a diagnosis for patients such as ours, especially when they present with a metastatic testicular mass.\n\n【49】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【50】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【51】Obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:33:41", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:34:15", "cost": 34.344}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:34:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:33:41"}

Blood analysis performed by the local hospital showed leucocytosis and high serum C reactive protein (CRP) level. A thorough clinical history revealed that the patient had fed a stray cat in her yard, and that it had scratched her approximately 2 weeks prior to the onset of the fever. A repeat abdominal ultrasound was performed in our hospital. The ultrasound examination, when performed using an 8.5 MHz high-frequency linear probe, revealed multiple hypoechoic lesions in the spleen ; however, these were not evident when a standard 3 MHz convex probe was used . Further findings included a white cell count of 7.0×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (neutrophils, 40.5%), CRP level of 46.4 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 66 mm/hour.

Following inoculation by _B. henselae_ , CSD typically presents with localised lymphadenitis. However, patients may have a systemic clinical manifestation with prolonged fever and micro-abscesses in the liver and/or spleen. 删除9：<u>1 </u>In a prospective study of 146 children with FUO, CSD was the third most common infectious cause, accounting for seven (4.8%) cases. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Another study showed organ involvement (liver and spleen) in 35 (8%) out of 437 paediatric CSD hospital admissions. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Thus, CSD should always be included in the differential diagnoses for children with prolonged fever, and investigation for liver and spleen lesions is critical. Although CT scans or MRI may help detect hepatosplenic lesions in adult patients, 删除13：<u>4 </u>radiation exposure is a concern in paediatric patients, and children usually require sedation for MRI. Thus, ultrasound screening should be a priority in children, especially those with a history of exposure to a cat. Abnormal findings on abdominal ultrasound in paediatric CSD are common, and according to a previous study, abdominal ultrasound findings showed that 82.4% of these patients had splenic granulomas. 删除9：<u>5 </u>However, as demonstrated in this case, hypoechoic lesions may be missed if a standard convex probe is used for children because of their smaller body size. Thus, if available, a high-frequency linear probe should be used to screen for splenic lesions.\n\n【11】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【12】Patient’s father: It was great to have the cause of my daughter’s fever discovered using ultrasound imaging.\n\n【13】### Learning points\n\n【14】*   Cat-scratch disease (CSD) should be included in the differential diagnoses for fevers of unknown origin. Ultrasound can be used for diagnostic imaging to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure from CT scans and sedation risk with MRI.\n\n【15】*   Visceral organ involvement is a rare, but important, manifestation of CSD.\n\n【16】*   A standard convex probe may miss small lesions in children; therefore, a high-frequency ultrasound probe should be used to screen for hypoechoic lesions in the spleen.\n\n【17】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【18】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【19】Parental/guardian consent obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:38:25", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:39:35", "cost": 69.838}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:39:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:38:25"}

He had no history of coagulopathy and was not taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications. During the procedure, sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones from the common bile duct were performed. However, biliary cannulation posed a challenge due to an impacted stone above the ampulla of Vater, requiring more than five contacts with the papilla and more than 10 min for successful cannulation. As a result, the procedure was time consuming with inadvertent pancreatic injection, leading to the placement of a prophylactic pancreatic stent. Following ERCP, the patient experienced mild abdominal pain, bilious vomiting and melaena. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the upper abdomen but was otherwise unremarkable. The patient was subfebrile and remained haemodynamically stable with a normal heart rate. Urine output was within normal limits. Blood tests showed a 40 g/L decrease in haemoglobin, along with a moderate rise in pancreatic enzyme levels. An urgent duodenoscopy detected a huge bulging mass in the second segment of the duodenum, located on the opposite side of the papilla, congestive and swelling, conditioning luminal obstruction, suggestive of haematoma . An abdominal angio-CT scan confirmed the presence of a massive duodenal wall haematoma, measuring at least 10 cm, without signs of active bleeding . The patient was managed conservatively with close clinical assessment. Four days later, an upper endoscopy was performed to extract the pancreatic stent and showed a less haemorrhagic bulge, although the duodenum was still severely swollen . The patient presented a favourable global evolution and was discharged 12 days later. An abdominal CT scan 4 weeks later revealed complete resorption of haematoma .

Symptoms had started on postoperative day 2. No signs of wound dehiscence or cutaneous leakage of CSF were found. Lumbar spine CT suggested a CSF leak, and the patient was admitted to a neurosurgery ward, where she remained on bed rest. Lumbar spine MRI on postoperative day 12 revealed two CSF leaks with associated bilateral pseudomeningoceles, and an unforeseen intradural CSF collection extending from the conus medullaris to the L5 vertebral body . The latter caused the anterior displacement of the conus medullaris and compaction of the cauda equina nerve roots, which were displaced anteriorly but also seen residing centrally within the thecal sac, acquiring what has been dubbed the ‘flying bat’ sign for lumbar subdural hygroma. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【8】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【9】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【10】Postdiscectomy day 12 lumbar spine MRI.

Seven years earlier, she had visited the Department of Haematology for hyper-γ-globulinaemia and hypercalcaemia with malaise. Eventually, the patient was diagnosed with polyclonal hyper-γ-globulinaemia rather than multiple myeloma. Multiple lung lesions were detected, and the patient was referred to the Department of Respiratory Medicine. CT showed multiple centrilobular granular shadows of the lobules and nodular shadows in both lungs, as well as swelling of the mediastinal lymph nodes . In addition, she had elevated levels of IgG <sub>4 </sub> and IL-6.

Three years earlier, a transbronchial lung biopsy was performed. Dense inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in areas thought to be bronchial vascular bundles and alveolar septa . The infiltrating cells were mostly lymphocytes, along with a limited number of plasma cells. Individual cells did not show signs of dysplasia, and there was no evidence of a lymphoepithelial lesion. Immunostaining revealed a mixture of B and T cells, with predominance of the former type. There was no light chain restriction, and chain-positive cells were mixed. There were more CD43-positive cells than CD3-positive cells, and there was positivity for cells other than lymphocytes; hence, it was not possible to determine the malignancy. The IgG <sub>4 </sub> /IgG-positive cell ratio was 10%–20%. Clonal cell proliferation was not demonstrated, and the low IgG <sub>4 </sub> /IgG-positive cell ratio was not suggestive of malignant lymphoma or IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease. Based on the above results, multicentric Castleman’s disease was strongly suspected.

The spaces between the follicles were slightly reddish and enlarged. Most of the inflammatory cells were plasma cells, and numerous Russell bodies were found. A large amount of immunoglobulins was produced. In immunostaining, the IgG/IgG <sub>4 </sub> ratio was approximately 40%–50%. Both IgG <sub>4 </sub> and IL-6 levels were elevated; therefore, it was necessary to distinguish between multicentric Castleman’s disease and IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease. The serum CRP levels were increased to 5.45 mg/dL (reference value: 0.80 mg/dL); the levels of IgA were 881 mg/dL (reference value: 330 mg/dL). There was no atopy predisposition observed, and lesions were distributed in both lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes. However, they were not found in the eyes, lacrimal glands/salivary glands or pancreas. PCR testing using whole blood did not detect human herpesvirus-8 DNA. There was positivity for cryptococcal antigen in the serum, but not in the cerebrospinal fluid; moreover, the cerebrospinal fluid culture was negative. Consequently, this patient was diagnosed with multicentric Castleman’s disease complicated by cryptococcal pneumonia.\n\n【26】Treatment\n---------\n\n【27】Oral treatment with fluconazole (400 mg/day) was initiated as treatment for lung-only infection.

IL-6 differentiates B cells into plasma cells to produce immunoglobulins, resulting in elevated serum IgG <sub>4 </sub> levels and IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-positive plasma cell infiltration. The histological findings of IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease are similar to those of Castleman’s disease (type I). 删除9：<u>6 </u>Hence, it is necessary to differentiate IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease with lymph node lesions from the plasma cell type of Castleman’s disease. For the reasons stated above, it is difficult to distinguish between multicentric Castleman’s disease and IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease using the IgG <sub>4 </sub> /IgG ratio. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【36】Clinical studies have examined markers that could be useful for the differentiation of these diseases. Despite increases in IgG and IgE, CRP or globulins are not increased in IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease. According to the results of a study, 删除13：<u>8 </u>the presence of the following findings are indicative of multicentric Castleman’s disease: serum CRP >0.8 mg/dL; IgA >330 mg/dL, absence of atopy predisposition, and no involvement of the eye, lacrimal gland/salivary gland, or pancreas in the lesion.\n\n【37】In immunocompromised patients, cryptococcal pneumonia can cause diffuse lung disease. Furthermore, in the absence of response to steroid therapy, it is important to distinguish _C. neoformans_ infection from exacerbation of multicentric Castleman’s disease. In a study of 151 patients without HIV with pulmonary cryptococcosis in Japan, 删除13：<u>84 </u>patients had underlying disease; diabetes was found in 32.1% of the patients; moreover, steroid users accounted for 37% of the population. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Steroids suppress T cells, particularly CD4+ T helper cells. 删除9：<u>10 </u>T helper 1 cells control immunity against intracellular parasites by producing interferon-γ, and steroids exert a marked effect on these cells. Thus far, there are few reports of multicentric Castleman’s disease associated with cryptococcal infection. A search conducted using the MEDLINE database yielded only disseminated cases that occurred during treatment with tocilizumab and cases of cryptococcal tendonitis. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【38】_C. neoformans_ lung lesions are generally more extensive in immunocompromised individuals versus immunocompetent individuals. 删除9：<u>12 13 </u>These are characterised by multiple nodules located immediately below the peripheral lung and pleura, infiltrative shadows, cavity shadows, bilateral pneumonia and occasionally diffuse granular shadows; in addition, histological analysis may not reveal a granulomatous reaction.\n\n【39】_C. neoformans_ lung disease is classified into four patterns based on the formation of granuloma and the degree of inflammation. 删除9：<u>14 </u>Granulomatous inflammation controls the growth of _C. neoformans_ in static lesions. However, there is no inflammatory response in patients with severe cellular immunodeficiency (eg, HIV), and a large amount of _C. neoformans_ is present in the alveoli, interstitium and capillaries. In the present case, cellular immunodeficiency was noted following the administration of steroid therapy, diabetes was present and there was no observation of granuloma formation. Granulomatous pneumonia with immunodeficiency owing to inflammatory cell infiltration and polynuclear mobility was considered.\n\n【40】### Learning points\n\n【41】*   The serum levels of IgG <sub>4 </sub> are elevated in some cases of multicentric Castleman’s disease; differentiation from IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease using case clinical data is necessary.\n\n【42】*   Cryptococcosis in immunocompromised individuals presents with a variety of imaging findings.\n\n【43】*   Differential diagnosis (eg, _Cryptococcus neoformans_ pneumonia) for diffuse parenchymal lung disease, such as multicentric Castleman’s disease, should be considered.\n\n【44】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【45】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【46】Parental/guardian consent obtained.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": " 删除13：84 p", "content": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】A woman in her 60s with suspected multicentric Castleman’s disease, who was receiving treatment with oral prednisolone, presented to our hospital with mild cough and malaise.

The spaces between the follicles were slightly reddish and enlarged. Most of the inflammatory cells were plasma cells, and numerous Russell bodies were found. A large amount of immunoglobulins was produced. In immunostaining, the IgG/IgG <sub>4 </sub> ratio was approximately 40%–50%. Both IgG <sub>4 </sub> and IL-6 levels were elevated; therefore, it was necessary to distinguish between multicentric Castleman’s disease and IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease. The serum CRP levels were increased to 5.45 mg/dL (reference value: 0.80 mg/dL); the levels of IgA were 881 mg/dL (reference value: 330 mg/dL). There was no atopy predisposition observed, and lesions were distributed in both lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes. However, they were not found in the eyes, lacrimal glands/salivary glands or pancreas. PCR testing using whole blood did not detect human herpesvirus-8 DNA. There was positivity for cryptococcal antigen in the serum, but not in the cerebrospinal fluid; moreover, the cerebrospinal fluid culture was negative.

IL-6 differentiates B cells into plasma cells to produce immunoglobulins, resulting in elevated serum IgG <sub>4 </sub> levels and IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-positive plasma cell infiltration. The histological findings of IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease are similar to those of Castleman’s disease (type I). 删除9：<u>6 </u>Hence, it is necessary to differentiate IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease with lymph node lesions from the plasma cell type of Castleman’s disease. For the reasons stated above, it is difficult to distinguish between multicentric Castleman’s disease and IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease using the IgG <sub>4 </sub> /IgG ratio. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【36】Clinical studies have examined markers that could be useful for the differentiation of these diseases. Despite increases in IgG and IgE, CRP or globulins are not increased in IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease. According to the results of a study, 删除13：<u>8 </u>the presence of the following findings are indicative of multicentric Castleman’s disease: serum CRP >0.8 mg/dL; IgA >330 mg/dL, absence of atopy predisposition, and no involvement of the eye, lacrimal gland/salivary gland, or pancreas in the lesion.\n\n【37】In immunocompromised patients, cryptococcal pneumonia can cause diffuse lung disease. Furthermore, in the absence of response to steroid therapy, it is important to distinguish _C. neoformans_ infection from exacerbation of multicentric Castleman’s disease. In a study of 151 patients without HIV with pulmonary cryptococcosis in Japan, 删除13：<u>84 </u>patients had underlying disease; diabetes was found in 32.1% of the patients; moreover, steroid users accounted for 37% of the population. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Steroids suppress T cells, particularly CD4+ T helper cells. 删除9：<u>10 </u>T helper 1 cells control immunity against intracellular parasites by producing interferon-γ, and steroids exert a marked effect on these cells. Thus far, there are few reports of multicentric Castleman’s disease associated with cryptococcal infection. A search conducted using the MEDLINE database yielded only disseminated cases that occurred during treatment with tocilizumab and cases of cryptococcal tendonitis. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【38】_C. neoformans_ lung lesions are generally more extensive in immunocompromised individuals versus immunocompetent individuals. 删除9：<u>12 13 </u>These are characterised by multiple nodules located immediately below the peripheral lung and pleura, infiltrative shadows, cavity shadows, bilateral pneumonia and occasionally diffuse granular shadows; in addition, histological analysis may not reveal a granulomatous reaction.\n\n【39】_C. neoformans_ lung disease is classified into four patterns based on the formation of granuloma and the degree of inflammation. 删除9：<u>14 </u>Granulomatous inflammation controls the growth of _C. neoformans_ in static lesions. However, there is no inflammatory response in patients with severe cellular immunodeficiency (eg, HIV), and a large amount of _C. neoformans_ is present in the alveoli, interstitium and capillaries. In the present case, cellular immunodeficiency was noted following the administration of steroid therapy, diabetes was present and there was no observation of granuloma formation. Granulomatous pneumonia with immunodeficiency owing to inflammatory cell infiltration and polynuclear mobility was considered.\n\n【40】### Learning points\n\n【41】*   The serum levels of IgG <sub>4 </sub> are elevated in some cases of multicentric Castleman’s disease; differentiation from IgG <sub>4 </sub> \\-related disease using case clinical data is necessary.\n\n【42】*   Cryptococcosis in immunocompromised individuals presents with a variety of imaging findings.\n\n【43】*   Differential diagnosis (eg, _Cryptococcus neoformans_ pneumonia) for diffuse parenchymal lung disease, such as multicentric Castleman’s disease, should be considered.\n\n【44】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【45】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【46】Parental/guardian consent obtained.</u>", "index": 13162, "show": true, "start": 13162, "end": 13172, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【37】"}], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:59:36", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:00:34", "cost": 57.845}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:00:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:59:35"}

Histopathology was suggestive of adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder with tumour infiltrating the deep muscle. Contrast enhanced CT scan revealed 7.2×6.5 cm mass arising from the dome and the right posterolateral wall of the urinary bladder and extending into right ureter for a length of 3.5 cm causing gross hydroureteronephrosis . The mass was seen extending into the small bowel mesentery and the mesorectal fascia and seminal vesicles. An enhancing tumour thrombus was also seen for a length of 5.2 cm in the distal IVC extending into bilateral common iliac veins and the right internal and external iliac veins. Metastatic work up revealed extensive lesions in the lungs and the skeleton . Creatinine clearance of the patient improved to 70 mL/min post insertion of the nephrostomy tube.

The most common age range at presentation is 3 months to 36 months. 删除9：<u>2 </u>If intussusception develops in a patient outside this age range, a pathological lesion should be sought as the lead point. In our patient, PCI developing in the caecum acted as the lead point, telescoping the caecum into the transverse colon. Although most PCI cases can be managed conservatively, complications, including intussusception, are sometimes known to occur. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【16】In the present case, abdominal radiography played a major role in diagnosing intussusception because the intramural air in the large intestine hampered ultrasonographic evaluation.

He had a history of corrosive oesophageal injury with surgery done to the oesophagus 30 years ago, details were unknown. On examination, he had a palpable bowel loop on the anterior chest wall . A barium swallow study showed a proximally dilated oesophagus with narrowing of the distal oesophagus and gastro-oesophageal junction, likely due to a stricture. An oesophageal bypass reconstruction is also seen in the anterior midline with bowel connecting the cervical oesophagus and stomach showing free flow of barium . A CT scan with oral contrast confirmed a distal stricture in the native oesophagus with a patent oesophageal bypass reconstruction/conduit showing no abnormal wall thickening or enhancement . Endoscopy showed a side-to-side anastomosis just below the upper oesophageal sphincter. The native lumen  had narrowing at the distal end while the reconstructed lumen  showed a colonic loop opening into the distal stomach with normal appearing gastric mucosa. The patient was treated with oral proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and had symptomatic improvement. True incidence of corrosive gastrointestinal injuries is unknown worldwide. Prevalence is higher in children due to accidental ingestion and in developing countries. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Ingestion of alkalis causes rapid and extensive oesophageal injury due to liquefactive necrosis compared with acids where upper respiratory tract and distal stomach injuries are common. 删除9：<u>2 </u>The transmural nature of injury in alkalis predisposes to stricture formation, usually in 3–8 weeks duration. Endoscopic dilation using Savary–Gilliard (SG) dilators or ‘through-the-scope’ (TTS) balloon dilator is the mainstay of these oesophageal strictures. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Risk of complications like perforation is slightly higher in dilatation of caustic strictures (0.4%—32%) compared with other benign causes (0.1%—0.4%). 删除9：<u>4 </u>Surgery is generally limited to patients who have failed endo-therapy. Routinely performed surgery includes gastric pull-up (GPU) and colonic interposition (CI). GPU is the most widely performed with least complications and failure rates, but avoided in cases where stomach is injured due to the corrosive agent. Colon is next preferred organ due to its vascular anatomy, long length and resistance to acid injury. 删除9：<u>5 </u>CI surgery involves using a colonic segment as the conduit and is performed through posterior mediastinal, retrosternal or antesternal approaches. The preferred is grafting the colon in the posterior mediastinum after excising the diseased oesophagus, this is advantageous as it is the shortest route; however, this space is not available in conditions with scarred mediastinum. The retrosternal approach is preferred when the oesophageal bed is not available and it is easy for dissection. Disadvantages include long route, angulations at thoracic inlet and xiphoid level and cannot be performed with prior cardiac surgery. The antesternal approach (subcutaneous route) without oesophagectomy is not technically very demanding, quicker and does not require a thoracotomy. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Although antesternal approach is easy to perform, the function of the colon is poor in the subcutaneous position and patients often have to massage food down to improve colonic conduit emptying. Also, it is less popular as it leaves behind diseased oesophagus with a very small risk of malignancy, 删除13：<u>7 </u>available case reports in literature mention squamous cell carcinoma after approximately 40–50 years postcorrosive ingestion and is less cosmetic. This case was unique as antesternal CI surgeries are rarely encountered in modern clinical practice. Performing endoscopy was technically challenging because of the difficulties encountered in negotiating the endoscope into the native and reconstructed lumens. Both lumens were carefully intubated under vision through the side-to-side anastomosis just distal to the upper oesophageal sphincter.\n\n【4】### Learning points\n\n【5】*   Endoscopic management is the current standard of care in treatment of postcorrosive oesophageal strictures.\n\n【6】*   In spite of advancements in the management of corrosive oesophageal injury, a few sections of patients need oesophageal replacement surgery.\n\n【7】*   The three routes of the colic interposition include the following:\n\n【8】    *   Oesophageal bed approach after oesophagostomy.\n\n【9】    *   Retrosternal tunnel.\n\n【10】    *   Antesternal approach.\n\n【11】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【12】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【13】Large antesternal mass with a bowel loop as contents.</u>\n\n【14】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【15】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【16】Barium swallow study showing native oesophageal lumen (arrow-head) and reconstructed lumen with side-to-side anastomosis (asterisk) parallel to each other at (A) proximal and (B)mid-oesophageal levels with free flow of barium suspension.</u>\n\n【17】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【18】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【19】Barium swallow study demonstrating oesophageal bypass reconstruction with large bowel showing haustral folds (arrow) connecting the distal stomach (asterisk).</u>\n\n【20】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【21】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【22】Ct sagittal view showing antesternal colonic loop (white arrow) with haustral folds and narrowed native oesophagus (red arrow).</u>\n\n【23】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【24】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 5\n\n【25】Endoscopic images of native oesophageal lumen showing (A)distal narrowing secondary to stricture and (B)creconstructed colonic conduit containing few solid food residues (STAR) entering into the distal stomach (arrow).</u>\n\n【26】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【27】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【28】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:47:42", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:47:52", "cost": 10.539}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:47:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:47:42"}

Contrast-enhanced CT revealed traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage, liver injury and fractures of the rib, right clavicle, right scapula and right femur. The coronal view of the enhanced CT showed that the continuity of the diaphragm was maintained. The motor and sensory deficits in the right upper extremity were not explained by direct injury.

Contrast-enhanced CT revealed no pulmonary embolism, diaphragm injury or severe pneumonia.

Although he had dyspnoea for approximately a month after extubation, the arterial blood gas showed no hypoxaemia or carbon dioxide retention. The frequency of dyspnoea decreased over time. The patient was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation, and nerve grafting was considered for brachial plexus injury treatment.\n\n【36】Discussion\n----------\n\n【37】In our case, the brachial plexus avulsion injury was associated with diaphragm paralysis, and POCUS aided in the diagnosis.\n\n【38】In general, diaphragmatic dysfunction is difficult to diagnose with certainty without direct observation, either by laparoscopy or laparotomy. For example, diaphragmatic injury is one of the differential causes of diaphragmatic dysfunction and requires special attention because it may be asymptomatic immediately after injury. Chest X-ray fails to reveal abnormalities in 20%–50% of patients with diaphragmatic injury.\n\n【39】The gold standard for diagnosis is an examination by CT, which has been reported to have high diagnostic accuracy with a sensitivity of 61%–87% and a specificity of 72%–100%. A segmental diaphragmatic defect is a common finding, with a reported sensitivity of 95.7%, and accuracy is further improved by combining sagittal and coronal views.\n\n【40】However, slight abnormalities in diaphragm thickness or small diaphragmatic defects cannot be noted, especially when a major distracting abnormality is nearby. Furthermore, in ventilated patients, positive pressure may mask diaphragm elevation, which can make diagnosis difficult. 删除9：<u>5 </u>In our case, the initial CT and follow-up CT images over time did not show any findings suspicious of diaphragmatic injury.\n\n【41】The diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve, which originates from the C3 to C5 nerve roots. In most cases, the C4 root is integral to diaphragmatic function. 删除9：<u>4 </u>The brachial plexus is composed of the C5-Th1 nerve roots, and the C4 and C5 roots are fibrously connected . 删除9：<u>6 </u>When the C5 root is avulsed and damaged, C4 is also damaged, resulting in diaphragmatic dysfunction.\n\n【42】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【43】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【44】Anatomical schematic diagram of the brachial plexus.

CECT, contrast-enhanced CT; IVR, interventional radiology; POCUS, point-of-care ultrasound.</u>\n\n【45】Phrenic nerve injury has reportedly occurred in 10%–20% of brachial plexus injuries. 删除9：<u>7 8 </u>However, to the best of our knowledge, only Franko _et al_ have reported a case of diaphragm paralysis following brachial plexus injury who developed acute respiratory failure. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Although chest radiography revealed unilateral diaphragm elevation on hospital day 5, pleural effusion was primarily suspected. The diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis was not made until an ultrasound was performed to evaluate the pleural effusion.\n\n【46】In our case, the diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis was also difficult because the radiologic finding of diaphragm elevation was not always apparent. The reason for the rarity of similar case reports may suggest that diaphragm paralysis may have been overlooked because of the difficulty of diagnosis.\n\n【47】The sniff test on fluoroscopy and X-ray was reportedly helpful in diagnosing unilateral diaphragm paralysis. 删除9：<u>3 </u>However, its application to critically ill patients remains controversial. The sniff test requires the patient to control spontaneous breathing and move to the examination room. Unilateral diaphragm elevation on radiography is a suggestive finding, but it has low specificity (sensitivity: 0.90, specificity: 0.44). 删除9：<u>4 </u>In our case, unilateral diaphragm elevation was occasionally seen on radiography. However, the respiratory symptoms had only occurred just before the patient required reintubation. Although diaphragm paralysis lacks specific findings, it is essential to diagnose it immediately because it has serious consequences.\n\n【48】Point-of-care diaphragmatic ultrasound was reportedly useful in evaluating critically ill patients. Ultrasonography is noninvasive and highly reproducible, allowing bedside assessment within approximately 5–15 min, 删除13：<u>10 11 </u>which can simultaneously assess findings of abnormalities in the thorax that may cause respiratory failure. The ultrasound findings of diaphragm paralysis are documented as a loss of diaphragmatic excursion, paradoxical excursion during deep breathing and sniffing, and a respiratory variation of diaphragm thickness of <20%. 删除9：<u>10</u>\n\n【49】In this patient, the right diaphragm motion was significantly less than that of the left diaphragm, and the right diaphragm excursion disappeared 删除10：<u>( video 1 )</u>, which led to the rapid diagnosis of diaphragm paralysis. Video 1 shows that there was little respiratory variability on the right diaphragm despite tachypnoea, while the left diaphragm moves along with the breathing. Moreover, no other abnormal findings could have caused the respiratory failure. Therefore, even a rare disease like this case could be diagnosed easily. This case highlighted that POCUS plays an important role in diagnosing the cause of severe respiratory failure.\n\n【50】### Learning points\n\n【51】*   Diaphragm paralysis associated with brachial plexus injury is rare but can cause severe respiratory failure.\n\n【52】*   The specificity of hemidiaphragmatic elevation on X-ray is low, and diaphragm paralysis may be overlooked and mistaken for pleural effusion or atelectasis.\n\n【53】*   Point-of-care ultrasound provided a clear visualisation and rapid diagnosis for causes of respiratory failure at the bedside.\n\n【54】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【55】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【56】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:28:35", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:29:17", "cost": 41.826}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:23", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:29:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:28:34"}

Neonates who present with this diagnosis generally do not undergo genetic testing. Therefore, the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta(OI) type VIII rests solely on the clinical features. Since it is prevalent, this is a wake-up call for more surveys to be undertaken for the same genetic variant and to identify potential couples who may transmit the gene to their offspring, especially among those who have relatives diagnosed with Osteogenesis Imperfecta.\n\n【9】Type VIII OI is autosomal-recessive, characterised by white sclerae, severe growth deficiency, extreme skeletal under-mineralisation and bulbous metaphysis. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Its prevalence is approximately 1 in 10 000–20 000 births. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【10】We report a case that required genetic testing for confirmation, the results of which helped greatly in counselling the baby's parents. The case in question required a multidisciplinary approach to management.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】The term neonate was born to non-consanguineous parents. He was the second born- with an 18 month older female sibling. The mother’s pregnancy was uneventful, and she had attended all her antenatal clinic appointments. She was given routine haematinics and folic acid, and the tetanus vaccine as per standard of care. She progressed well, although she noted poor weight gain in the third trimester.\n\n【13】Antenatal ultrasound was not done. The baby was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery and admitted to the neonatal unit with severe respiratory distress and malformed limbs, both upper  and lower . The head circumference was 35 cm at birth. Clinically, the features appeared similar to OI, but a possible metaphysical dysplasia was considered because the sclerae were not blue .\n\n【14】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【15】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【16】(A) Right upper limb with shortened humerus and curved ulna .

There were signs of severe pneumonia with severe chest drawing and nasal flaring.\n\n【21】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【22】A plain X-ray of the chest and a whole-body scout X-ray were done .

A homozygous, likely pathogenic variant was identified in the _P3H1_ gene. The result is consistent with the genetic diagnosis of autosomal-recessive OI type VIII. The variant coordinate was NM\\_001243246.1: c.1095C>G p with amino acid change: (Tyr365\\*), recessive homozygous, nonsense, likely pathogenic (class 2).\n\n【31】Echocardiography revealed a structurally normal heart.\n\n【32】Ultrasound of the abdomen showed normal renal and hepatic morphology.\n\n【33】Serum alkaline phosphatase was 652 mmol/dL (normal level up to 125 mmol/dL).\n\n【34】Lactate dehydrogenase was also raised to 585 mmol/dL.\n\n【35】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【36】The differential diagnosis was metaphysial dysplasia on account of the symmetrical short bones, macrocephaly and absence of blue sclerae.\n\n【37】Treatment\n---------\n\n【38】The baby was treated with appropriate antibiotics for pneumonia and paracetamol for pain. Supportive care was given, including feeding by tube and providing oxygen during the pneumonia episode.\n\n【39】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【40】The baby was discharged after 3 weeks when his condition was stable. He was readmitted at 8 weeks with severe pneumonia. At this time the highest saturations (sPaO2) were in the mid-70s, and he was acidotic with a blood pH of 7.27 and carbon dioxide retention. The baby succumbed to severe pneumonia aged 10 weeks.\n\n【41】The results of genetic analysis were available prior to the baby's death. The mother was counselled, and both parents returned after 6 weeks (the customary period of bereavement) to discuss the test results in more detail.\n\n【42】Discussion\n----------\n\n【43】OI, an inherited connective tissue disorder, is recognised by excessive brittleness of the bones. It is the most common genetic disorder of bones with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 10 000–20 000 births. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>It has several classification types, and infants with the worst form of the disease die in the perinatal period.\n\n【44】Type VIII OI, a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterised by white sclerae, severe growth deficiency and bone fragility, was added to the classification in 2007 as a severe and lethal type. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Type VIII OI accounts for fewer than 10% of patients with OI. DNA analysis is considered a definitive test for confirming the diagnosis. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【45】A similar case of type VIII OI due to a homozygous mutation of c.1914+1G>C (NM\\_001243246.1) in _P3H1_ exhibited retinal detachment, emphasising the need for fundoscopic examination as part of a multidisciplinary approach. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【46】The variant P3H1, and variant coordinate _1095C>G p.(Tyr365\\*)_ , create a premature stop codon. 删除9：<u>5 6 </u>Pathogenic P3H1 variants are causative for autosomal-recessive OI type VIII. In 2007, Cabral _et al_ described a form of autosomal-recessive OI that they designated OI type VIII, characterised by white sclerae, severe growth deficiency, extreme skeletal under-mineralisation and bulbous metaphysis. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【47】However, this variant coordinate is rare, as compared with the _c.1080+1G>T_ described in West Africa and the descendants of West Africans in the USA. 删除9：<u>5 </u>In Cabral _et al’_ s study, the screening of contemporary cohorts in West Africa revealed that nearly 1.5% of West Africans are carriers for this mutation and 0.4% of African Americans of Western African descent are carriers. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【48】The carrier rate in our setting is not known and the variant coordinates are different from what was found in our case. As this is a homozygous-recessive variant, there is a need for genetic counselling and further survey of the families. Although the parents in our case were non-consanguineous, the recessive nature of this condition indicates the need for further screening of the families after genetic counselling in the familial context if possible, similar to the scenario in individauls of Karen descent. Due to resource constraints, however, this is not possible. 删除9：<u>1 8</u>\n\n【49】Type VIII OI patients present with severe to lethal OI, recessive inheritance, white sclerae, rhizomelia, and poor trabeculation of long bones, with most of the affected individuals dying early from respiratory causes, as in our case. Those who survive into childhood have extremely low bone mineral density, severe growth deficiency and bulbous metaphysis.\n\n【50】A multidisciplinary team approach is essential for management, with the aim of providing the maximum long-term function and autonomy that the disease allows. 删除9：<u>3 9 </u>Clinical management encompasses physical rehabilitation and surgical procedures, and management of hearing, dental and pulmonary abnormalities.\n\n【51】Fratzl-Zelman _et al_ studied five individuals with type VIII OI. 删除9：<u>9 </u>All the patients had white sclerae, normal dentition, relative macrocephaly, triangular facies, and skeletal findings that included rhizomelia, radiographic “popcorn” calcifications at epiphyses, and extremely low bone density. Bisphosphonate treatment was initiated, but progressive skeletal deterioration with age was observed.\n\n【52】Our case demonstrates the importance of genetic testing, which revealed typical _P3HI_ gene mutations. _P3H1_ , cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and cyclophilin B (CyPB) assemble into a 1:1:1 complex within the endoplasmic reticulum that post-translationally modifies specific proline residues in unfolded collagen alpha chains. 删除9：<u>10 </u>Recessive OI (types VII and VIII) is caused by deficiency of any of the three collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex components, increasing modification of the collagen helix, supporting delayed collagen folding. In type VIII OI there is the absence of alpha1 (I)Pro986 3-hydroxylation and over-mediation of the collagen helical region, supporting delayed folding. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【53】A multidisciplinary approach to management was used in our case, which included neonatologists, medical officers, endocrinologists and geneticists. This case demonstrates the challenge in confirming the diagnosis in our setting due to limited resources, and the possibility that most cases of type VIII OI are missed.\n\n【54】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【55】Although my baby died, I am very grateful to the doctors that took care of him. I am glad that it was possible to do a genetic test, despite this being expensive and not available in our country. The test was done for free. The doctors told me that my baby had a rare condition for which there is no cure, and I thank God for the few weeks I spent with my baby before his death.\n\n【56】### Learning points\n\n【57】*   Pathogenic P3H1variants are causative for autosomal-recessive OI type VIII.\n\n【58】*   Genetic testing is important for the diagnosis of Type VIII OI.\n\n【59】*   A multidisciplinary approach in management is important to maximise the long-term survival of the patient.\n\n【60】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【61】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【62】Consent obtained from parent(s)/guardian(s)\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to thank the parents and also the doctors and nurses in the Neonatal Unit and General Pediatrics.

On admission, she was afebrile (temperature: 98°F), her pulse rate was 104 beats /minute, blood pressure was 108/78 mm Hg and peripheral oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Examination revealed ulcerated, coated tongue and oral mucosa along with the formation of slough (paraquat tongue) . Basic blood parameters revealed raised urea (96 mg/dL; reference range, 5–20) and creatinine (5.4 mg/dL; reference range, 0.6–1.2). Initial radiography of the chest did not reveal anything unusual. She was put on injection N-acetyl-cysteine and was managed conservatively. Haemodialysis was started for the management of oliguric acute kidney injury. The patient responded well to this management and urine output gradually increased. However, on day 7 of admission, she reported cough and shortness of breath. At that point, the patient was tachypneic (respiratory rate 30 breaths /minute) and hypoxemic (peripheral oxygen saturation was 78% on room air) with associated bi-basal crackles. Arterial blood gas analysis showed features of type I respiratory failure. Radiography of the chest revealed bilateral opacities in the lower zone. A high-resolution CT scan of the thorax was performed, which showed areas of bilateral ground-glass opacities along with patchy fibrosis, predominantly in the lower lobes.

A systematic review of data extracted from 2006 to 2015 concluded that pesticides were responsible for almost 20% of global suicides leading to approximately 150 000 fatalities per year over the afore-mentioned period. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Unfortunately, this is a less commonly researched topic. Although organophosphate accounts for the majority of the hospital admissions, poisoning by paraquat compounds is a major medical problem as it is associated with a very high mortality (case fatality rate of 50%–70%) and morbidity. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Paraquat is a toxic bipiridyl compound, and it is lethal even in very small amounts (15–20 mL of 20% w/v). The mode of poisoning is usually suicidal or accidental; and it should always be suspected in cases of corrosive oral and oesophageal ulcerations along with features of hepatic, renal or pulmonary involvement. 删除9：<u>3 </u>Paraquat is incompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and mainly exerts its toxicity through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which causes cell damage by several mechanisms, such as mitochondrial toxicity, lipid peroxidation, oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), activation of nuclear factor kappa B and apoptosis. 删除9：<u>4 </u>It targets both type I and II pneumocytes in the lung, leading to acute alveolitis. The initial ‘destructive alveolitis’ is followed by a ‘proliferative’ or ‘cellular’ phase, which ultimately leads to lung fibrosis. 删除9：<u>5 6 </u>Hepatorenal involvement in the form of acute tubular injury and hepatocelluar damage is also common. Mucosal ulceration in the oral cavity and tongue, also known as ‘paraquat tongue’ is seen within the first few days of poisoning. No specific antidote is available for this poisoning, and there is also dearth of evidence-based recommendation for the treatment. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Management is mainly supportive. Gastric decontamination with activated charcoal is recommended in those presenting within 1–2 hours of ingestion; however, gastric lavage should not be done due to the corrosive nature of paraquat. Routine use of supplemental oxygen is not recommended in patients with mild-to-moderate hypoxia, as the hypoxemic strategy will reduce the production of ROS. Immunosupressive agents such as cyclophosphamide, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone, along with antioxidants such as N-acetyl-cysteine and ascorbic acid, have been investigated in its management without significant success.\n\n【12】### Learning points\n\n【13】*   Paraquat is a toxic bipyridylium herbicide and its ingestion in very small amount can be fatal with toxic effects on kidney, liver, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and other organs.\n\n【14】*   There is no specific antidote.

He denied any fever or chills, nausea or vomiting. Physical examination revealed right-sided costovertebral angle tenderness with an ill-defined mass. His laboratory workup showed leucocytosis with a white cell count (WBC) of 18.6×10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL with 85% neutrophils and baseline creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL. Urine analysis was cloudy with elevated WBC, red blood cells, positive nitrite and leucocyte esterase. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast demonstrated a markedly enlarged right kidney with ‘bear paw sign’, multiple, low-density areas suggestive of necrosis or abscess corresponding with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) . He was started on a piperacillin/tazobactam combination as empirical therapy for UTI. Urine culture grew 100 000 CFU/mL pansensitive _Pseudomonas_ . He was discharged on an oral antibiotic regimen of levofloxacin for 6 weeks and scheduled for a follow-up on an outpatient basis. On his follow-up after completion of antibiotic therapy, he reported total resolution of his symptoms, and an elective right nephrectomy was planned after counselling. XGP is a rare severe chronic inflammatory disease of the renal parenchyma, which is characterised by the destruction of the renal parenchyma and granulomatous inflammation, with lipid-laden foamy macrophages as well as inflammatory infiltration and extensive renal fibrosis. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Although the aetiology of XGP remains unclear, it is commonly associated with recurrent UTIs and obstructive nephropathy. Other proposed aetiologies include altered immune response, congenital urinary anomalies, lipid metabolism abnormalities, malnutrition and lymphatic blockage. 删除9：<u>2 </u>XGP might occur in all age groups, but predominantly affects adults. XGP often occurs unilaterally, and bilateral cases are extremely rare, mostly diffuse and occupationally focal. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Typical clinical manifestations of XGP are fever of unknown origin, abdomen/flank pain, weight loss, anaemia or palpable renal mass. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Commonly isolated pathogenic bacteria are _Escherichia coli_ , _Klebsiella_ and _Proteus_ . Differential diagnosis of XGP includes a large variety of conditions such as Wilms tumour, renal cell carcinoma, renal abscess, infected renal cystic disease and tuberculosis; therefore, CT scan is essential for diagnosis and preoperative evaluation, but a tissue biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis, especially in suspected cases. 删除9：<u>3 </u>XGP can be classified based on CT features to either diffuse or focal.

While in focal XGP, CT frequently shows a well-defined hypoattenuated localised intrarenal lesion. Depending on the extent of inflammation, XGP can be classified into three stages: nephric XGP (stage I: confined localised disease to the renal parenchyma), perinephric XGP (stage II: the inflammation extends to the perirenal fat) and perinephric XGP (stage III: the lesion extending into perinephric spaces). 删除9：<u>4 5 </u>The standard management is antibiotic therapy and total nephrectomy, but focal XGP can be treated with antibiotics or nephron-sparing surgery. 删除9：<u>1 3</u>\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Coronal plane of CT of the abdomen and pelvis showing ‘bear paw sign’: multiple, low-density areas suggestive of necrosis or abscess suggestive of stage II xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.</u>\n\n【7】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【8】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【9】Axial plane of CT of the abdomen and pelvis suggestive of stage II xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.</u>\n\n【10】### Learning points\n\n【11】*   Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a rare chronic granulomatous inflammation of the renal parenchyma due to recurrent urinary tract infections or obstructive uropathy.

The two main subclasses of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) inhibitors including programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors and second subclass cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors. ICIs reverse negative immune regulation and promote the immune response towards targeting cancer cells. However, they can also lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in any organ system, with endocrinopathies being among those more commonly reported. 删除9：<u>1 </u>ICI-induced diabetes mellitus (ICI-DM) is one such endocrinopathy and has particular clinical significance as the majority of patients present in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and require lifelong treatment with insulin therapy. 删除9：<u>2 </u>ICI-DM has been reported with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors and rarely with CTLA-4 inhibitors. 删除9：<u>2 3</u>\n\n【8】Nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma and head, neck and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. This report details a case of ICI-DM identified due to hyperglycaemia without ketoacidosis in a patient receiving nivolumab immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma.\n\n【9】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【10】A man in his 40s presented to the emergency department of a regional hospital with a 2-day history of generalised urticarial rash.\n\n【11】He was diagnosed with a melanoma on his upper back a year prior and had metastases in the left axillary, subpectoral and bilateral cervical lymph nodes identified on PET scan at the time of diagnosis. The melanoma was BRAF positive and the primary was unresectable. He was referred to medical oncology and commenced on nivolumab/ipilimumab, a combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. His baseline endocrine workup prior to initiation of treatment, which included morning cortisol, thyroid function tests (TFTs) and random blood glucose, was unremarkable.\n\n【12】His initial combination therapy involved four doses of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) with nivolumab (1 mg/kg), and he was subsequently continued on monthly nivolumab, receiving 13 doses prior to presentation. He experienced a localised erythematous rash 2 weeks after his first dose of immunotherapy, however had no rashes with subsequent doses. Throughout his immunotherapy, his routine monitoring blood results remained stable (including TFTs, cortisol, monthly random blood glucose) and within normal limits.\n\n【13】His other medical history included rectal adenocarcinoma for which he had undergone local resection, hypertension, obesity class 3 with BMI of 39 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> and sinusitis. Aside from the monthly nivolumab, his only other medication was amlodipine, which had been commenced a week prior to presentation. He had a documented adverse drug reaction to valsartan, which was an acute kidney injury.\n\n【14】On examination, he appeared generally well with a Glassgow Coma Scale of 15. He was afebrile, heart rate was 100 bpm, blood pressure was 150/90 mm Hg, respiratory rate was 16/min, oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. He was obese with weight of 125.5 kg, height of 180 cm and BMI of 39 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . He had a widespread, blanching, erythematous maculopapular rash across his axillae, chest, back, face and arms. His examination was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n【15】Investigations and diagnosis\n----------------------------\n\n【16】Bedside investigations showed a blood glucose level of 18.1 mmol/L and ketones 0.4 mmol/L. His urinalysis showed large glycosuria (>1000 mg/dL) but was otherwise unremarkable.

He was admitted for further investigation and commenced on antihistamines and topical steroid cream. Oral steroids were withheld due to concerns of dampening the effects of immunotherapy, as requested by medical oncology.\n\n【21】Due to the abrupt onset of hyperglycaemia, ICI-DM was considered, and this was supported by an haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) that was disproportionate to the level of hyperglycaemia 删除10：<u>(results in table 2 )</u>. C-peptide level, islet autoantibodies and an endocrinopathy screen were also performed.\n\n【22】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【23】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 2\n\n【24】Additional laboratory results</u>\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】Dermatology was consulted and the rash was thought to be a drug reaction to amlodipine. Biopsies were taken and a dermatology clinic referral was made. The biopsies were later found to be consistent with the clinical suspicion of a lichenoid drug eruption. Candesartan replaced amlodipine for the management of the patient’s hypertension.\n\n【27】For his new diagnosis of diabetes, metformin and insulin glargine were commenced, and the patient was referred to the outpatient endocrinology clinic and diabetes educator. The patient continued nivolumab therapy as scheduled the following week.\n\n【28】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【29】On further endocrine follow-up, the patient’s HbA1c has remained persistently elevated (11.6% at 3 months and 8.4% at 12 months). His insulin regimen was escalated accordingly and he continues on a basal-prandial regime with insulin glargine and insulin aspart. Metformin was also continued and semaglutide was commenced for his central adiposity and inadequate glycaemic control.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】PD-1 is expressed on T lymphocytes and when activated by its ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2, inhibits cell proliferation as part of ‘self-tolerance’. 删除9：<u>4 </u>Cancer cells can express PD-L1 to exploit this self-tolerance, hence the role of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in reactivating the antitumour immune response. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【32】The pathogenesis of ICI-DM has not been fully elucidated; however, the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in the development of T1DM in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse models is well established. 删除9：<u>5 </u>NOD mice with a knockout of PD-1 or PD-L1, or those exposed to PD-1 or PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, are predisposed to developing T1DM with lymphocytic infiltration of pancreatic islets. 删除9：<u>6 </u>PD-L1 upregulation in islet cells has been found in NOD mice during the progression of diabetes, and in human islets from T1DM organ donors. 删除9：<u>7 </u>This is thought to represent a self-tolerance mechanism to reduce autoimmune destruction of islet cells and may explain why PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor therapy can induce diabetes mellitus. 删除9：<u>2</u>\n\n【33】The incidence of immune-related endocrinopathies with ICI has been reported to be approximately 10% in systematic reviews. Among these, thyroid toxicities are the most common, and while new onset diabetes mellitus was initially thought to be rare, cases have increasingly reported resulting in variable prevalence up to 2%. 删除9：<u>3 4 8 </u>Primary thyroid dysfunction is common with both PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors, whereas ICI-DM and hypophysitis are more commonly associated with PD1 immunotherapy. 删除9：<u>9 10 </u>In our case, the patient had completed initial PD-1/CTLA-4 dual therapy and continued on PD1-monotherapy. 删除9：<u>9 10</u>\n\n【34】There have been wide discrepancies in the time from ICI initiation to diabetes onset, with a systematic review by Liu _et al_ reporting a median onset time of 12 weeks (range 0–122). 删除9：<u>4 11 </u>Another systematic review by Akturk _et al_ reported a median of 10.5 weeks (range 0.71–64) for nivolumab. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Lo Preiato _et al_ noted that approximately half of the reported ICI-DM cases occurred within the third cycle or 8th week, and 16.5% after the 12th cycle. 删除9：<u>4 </u>In our case, ICI-DM was detected approximately 1 year (51 weeks) after initiation of treatment.\n\n【35】Significant hyperglycaemia is suggested to occur rapidly and the majority of reported cases of ICI-DM have been in patients presenting in DKA. 删除9：<u>4 11 12 </u>HbA1c is generally lower than 10% at time of diagnosis and C-peptide levels are either undetectable or inappropriately low for the degree of hyperglycaemia. 删除9：<u>2 4 13 </u>There are increasing articles evaluating the role of C-peptide in aiding diagnosis and monitoring of ICI-DM given the proposed mechanism of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells. Some authors have suggested interval testing of C-peptide level to confirm which patients will require lifelong insulin therapy and one longitudinal study reported no difference in C-peptide level from baseline to diagnosis of ICI-DM between patients with and without ICI-DM. 删除9：<u>4 14 15 </u>Insulin therapy was eventually ceased in a few cases where C-peptide levels were normal, B-cell function was preserved and ICI therapy was discontinued indefinitely. 删除9：<u>16 17</u>\n\n【36】ICI-DM has been reported with both positive and negative T1DM-associated autoantibodies, with at least one autoantibody being present in 40%–50% of cases. 删除9：<u>4 12 13 </u>Of these, GAD antibody positivity is the most common and has additionally been correlated with a shorter time to onset of ICI-DM. 删除9：<u>8 11 18 </u>Similarly, the relevance of T1DM-associated human leucocyte antigen (HLA) loci to ICI-DM requires further clarification. 删除9：<u>4 13 </u>HLA DR4 was only detected in 49.3% of cases, and in some cases, protective phenotypes for T1DM were present. 删除9：<u>4 </u>There is insufficient data to determine whether a family history of diabetes or an elevated BMI is associated with an increased risk of ICI-DM. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【37】There is variability in the recommended endocrinopathy monitoring investigations for patients receiving immunotherapy, however blood glucose level monitoring, thyroid function testing and assessment for adrenal insufficiency are generally advised. 删除9：<u>19 20 </u>Additionally, it has been recommended that patients are informed about symptoms of hyperglycaemia to promote early recognition of ICI-DM. 删除9：<u>2 4 </u>Clinician awareness of this potential irAE is also important, given our patient did not present with such symptoms and hyperglycaemia was an incidental finding.\n\n【38】Once identified, management of ICI-DM should follow standard local guidelines for DKA and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. PD-1 immunotherapy can often be restarted once an insulin regimen is instituted and stabilised. 删除9：<u>19–21</u>\n\n【39】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【40】In conclusion, with the increasing use of ICIs in cancer management, it is anticipated that the incidence and prevalence of ICI-DM will continue to rise. Further research is required to identify the most appropriate screening tests for early identification of ICI-DM, with an aim to prevent acute complications such as DKA, and to guide optimal long-term management of this condition. Current guidelines recommend discussion with patients around the potential for ICI-DM prior to initiation of therapy, and regular blood glucose monitoring while patients are receiving ICIs.\n\n【41】### Learning points\n\n【42】*   Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes mellitus (ICI-DM) has increasingly been reported with prevalence up to 2%, and the majority of patients present in diabetic ketoacidosis and require lifelong insulin therapy.\n\n【43】*   Clinicians should be aware of this immune-related endocrinopathy to prompt early identification with appropriate testing (eg, blood glucose level, haemoglobin A1c, C-peptide), to reduce the risk of patients presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis and facilitate appropriate initiation of insulin treatment and subsequent monitoring.\n\n【44】*   ICI-DM may present atypically without overt signs or symptoms of hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis.\n\n【45】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【46】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【47】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:32:36", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:33:03", "cost": 27.361}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:22", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:33:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:32:35"}

Remdesivir was stopped after 9 days and she was later discharged at day 25 of symptoms with very little distal paresthesia, a complete resolution of her urinary incontinenceand a slight tetraparesis at 4+/5. At 2-week follow-up visit, there was a near-complete neurological recovery with minimal pronator drift in upper limbs and no paresthesia.\n\n【37】Discussion\n----------\n\n【38】To our knowledge, this is the first encephalitis case identified with the Omicron strain and positive RT-PCR in CSF. The emergence of this variant is associated with an increase in infection rate but whether this new variant would result in different neurological involvements remains unknown. Another case presenting with conscious disturbance and myoclonus was reported by Kato _et al_ , although her CSF RT-PCR was negative. 删除9：<u>6 </u>In the pre-Omicron era, factors commonly associated with SARS-CoV-2-related encephalopathy include older age, critical illness with delirium, seizures, impaired consciousness and mechanical ventilation, none of which was present in our case. 删除9：<u>7 </u>SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis manifests most frequently with decreased level of consciousness (77%) and around a quarter present without systemic symptoms like fever or headache. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Motor weakness is even rarer and only present in around 15% of cases. 删除9：<u>8 </u>The symptoms in our patient are therefore atypical, although given the extreme rarity and novelty, it is not yet possible to define a clear clinical picture of this condition.\n\n【39】Our case met the confirmed diagnostic criteria set for SARS-CoV-2-associated encephalopathy/encephalitis proposed by Ellul _et al_ , with evidence of myeloencephalitis based on CSF pleocytosis, MRI findings, presence of the virus in CSF and absence of other explanatory pathogens or causes. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Specific intrathecal antibodies for SARS-CoV2 were not tested. The negative diagnostic workup further suggests SARS-CoV-2 as the primary causative agent. The simultaneous documentation of SARS-CoV2 virus in both CSF and nasal swab and the temporal relationship between clinical and virological progression supports a direct mechanism as well . The topography of lesions in our case predominates in the grey matter of the paramedian cortex suggesting a viral encephalitis. A similar pattern can be observed in the distribution of ACE2 receptors, which were highly expressed in the frontal cortex and brainstem. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Recent postmortem studies show that SARS-CoV2 RNA was also most frequently detected in brainstem region. 删除9：<u>10 </u>Demirci Otluoglu _et al_ described a case with lesions in the posterior medial temporal cortex and upper cervical spinal cord and a documented positive RT-PCR in CSF, although there were noticeable respiratory symptoms. 删除9：<u>11</u>\n\n【40】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【41】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【42】Chronology of microbiological, clinical and radiological findings: Negativisation of RT-PCR in nasal swab and later in CSF precedes clinical and radiological improvement.

A regimen of corticosteroid, intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange is suggested regardless of mechanism. 删除9：<u>12 </u>In case of an active systemic infection, antiviral could be considered for at least 5–10 days. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Agents such as remdesivir or favipiravir were used in several case reports, however, their efficacy in encephalitis is uncertain. 删除9：<u>11 13 </u>In our institution, remdesivir is the only viable option despite a penetration rate in CSF of less than 5% in animal models. 删除9：<u>14</u>\n\n【44】The absence of respiratory symptoms and risk factors for CNS involvement in an otherwise healthy young patient is noteworthy. The classical view that SARS-CoV-2 is an airborne virus with predilection for respiratory system could narrow neurologists’ suspicion in the aetiological workup of an acutely presenting encephalopathy. The variant identified is the Omicron strain, the dominant variant responsible for more than 90% of cases worldwide. 删除9：<u>15 </u>As the number of cases grows exponentially on a global scale, SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis or myelitis could be encountered more frequently and investigations should be directed toward this pathogen regardless of respiratory presentations. Appropriate and timely testing by either intrathecal antibodies or RT-PCR in CSF could be contributory to the diagnosis of this under-recognised pathogen.\n\n【45】### Learning points\n\n【46】*   On an epidemiological basis, SARS-CoV-2 should be considered in the aetiological workups of acute viral myeloencephalitis.\n\n【47】*   Acute myeloencephalitis could be the only presentation of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection without respiratory prodrome.\n\n【48】*   Efficacy of antiviral and corticosteroid are uncertain due to the lack of high-quality evidence and agent with good cerebrospinal fluid bioavailability\n\n【49】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【50】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【51】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to acknowledge all of the healthcare team who selflessly and courageously took part in caring for SARS-CoV-2 patients in this pandemic.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:22:21", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:22:36", "cost": 15.71}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:22", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:22:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:22:21"}

She denied history of sexually transmitted infections, intravenous drug use, contact with animals or recent travel abroad. Differential diagnosis may be considered: primary syphilis usually begins with a single, painless, well-demarcated ulcer with a clean base and indurated border.

There was a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for double-vessel blockage 2 days prior to the onset of these symptoms. Physical examination revealed dusky-red to dark brown macules extending linearly over lateral aspects of the neck, upper back, shoulders and axilla, outlining the ECG electrodes originally placed during the surgery . There were scattered vesicles and bullae especially around the ankle areas . Their linear configuration including bizarre dribbling marks on convexities was suggestive of a liquid as the cause of the presentation. Further probing revealed that a 5% solution (w/v) of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) (containing 0.5% iodine with purified water as excipient) had been painted profusely from neck to toes preoperatively, and the CABG, which had lasted close to 7 hours, had been performed in supine position with abducted arms. There was no history of any exposure to iodine-containing topical preparations. With a diagnosis of severe irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) to PVP-I, lesions were treated with fluticasone propionate 0.05% cream and H1-antihistamines. They resolved completely in a week with slight post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Following the resolution, the patient was offered repeat open application test (ROAT) to confirm the diagnosis but he refused owing to the severity of the reaction.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Dark brownish plaques with linear configuration over neck, shoulders and upper back with circular areas around the placement of ECG electrodes.</u>\n\n【7】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【8】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【9】Plaques in the form of dribbling of povidone-iodine during draping.</u>\n\n【10】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【11】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【12】Fluid-filled blisters present over the ankle areas.</u>\n\n【13】PVP-I solution is used worldwide as a surgical paint because of its potent germicidal activity. 删除9：<u>1 </u>In most of the reported cases of ICD secondary to PVP-I, the clinical presentation resembled chemical burns, showing clearly marginated infiltrative erythema often accompanied by bullae, vesicles and erosions. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Other observed patterns are lesions beneath the cotton or gauze pads used to protect the medical devices (eg, beneath the tourniquet) or around the device glued to the skin of the patient, as reported in dermatitis occurring after spinal anaesthesia that follows the folds or grooves of surgical drapes. 删除9：<u>2 </u>The outlining of adherent ECG electrodes in our patient was similar to the above presentation.\n\n【14】Iodine of PVP-I is broadly divided into two major types: the effective iodine (nhi3, I3 and I2) with oxidative and bactericidal effect and the inert iodine (I <sup>− </sup> ). 删除9：<u>3 </u>Irritation is due to iodine with oxidative capacity. Because of the low free iodine concentration in PVP-I, skin irritation is usually less marked for short contact. When oxidation process of PVP-I continues, cutaneous irritation increases, as long as PVP-I remains liquid. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Thus, PVP-I solution in the wet condition can continuously release free iodine. As a result, when the skin is exposed to the solution over a long period, it continuously causes chemical and oxidative damage to the skin.\n\n【15】In order to confirm the diagnosis of ICD to PVP-I solution, ROAT is a test of choice as the conventional patch test can yield false positive reactions due to occlusion. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【16】Our patient had the classic yet severe clinical presentation of ICD secondary to PVP-I following a prolonged surgery.

Image acquisition was done using Planmeca ProMax 3Ds machine (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) with standard operating specifications. Planmeca Romexis software V.3.01 R was used for viewing and analysing the images. CBCT slices were analysed in axial, coronal and sagittal sections. Sagittal section showed extraction socket in tooth 15 region. Sagittal section showed a well-defined radiopacity within the right maxillary sinus with perforation of floor of right maxillary sinus . Axial section confirmed presence of root fragment within the antrum suggestive of root fragment, measuring about 4.22 mm . Mucosal thickening was evident in the right maxillary sinus suggestive of sinusitis . Radiographically, a diagnosis of oroantral communication (OAC) was given.

Examination of the oral cavity revealed a small non-pigmented tumour at the gingival margin of the right maxilla, unknown to the patient . The vascularised tumour measured 5×6 mm and was slightly elevated from the underlying tissue. The lesion was excised with a margin of 1 mm. Histological examination showed a broad-based, epithelium-lined outgrowth, with ulceration in the most prominent region. The epithelium was atrophic, but with some elongated rete pegs with keratin pearls, compatible with pseudoepithelial hyperplasia. The diagnosis of malignant melanoma was confirmed with HMB-45, S100, SOX-10 and Melan A staining . Ki-67 staining showed high mitotic activity. Staining with Schmorl was negative, confirming an absence of melanin pigmentation. In the connective tissue, there was a dense infiltrate of tumour cells, with relatively large, mainly spindle-shaped cells, partly organised in nests. Malignant cells were also invading epithelium . Next, the patient was referred to a regional university hospital where clinical examination of the oral cavity revealed an additional non-pigmented ulcer of the hard palate , as well as diffuse pigmentation of the soft palate . Incisional biopsies were performed, and histological diagnoses of malignant melanoma were confirmed for both lesions. Further investigation included positron emission tomography-CT and MRI, where no other primary tumours or metastases could be detected. The final diagnosis was set to be multifocal malignant melanoma isolated to the oral cavity. Due to the multifocal location of the tumours, immunotherapy was initiated. However, the patient developed autoimmune toxicity following treatment, and the immunotherapy had to be discontinued. The patient was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and surgical treatment with a hemimaxillectomy and reconstruction with a radial forearm flap. She has no signs of recurrency 1 year after surgery and 18 months after the initial diagnosis.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Clinical photos: (A) amelanotic melanoma of the gingiva (arrow); (B) amelanotic melanoma of the hard palate (arrow); (C) multifocal melanotic melanoma of the soft palate .</u>\n\n【7】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【8】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【9】Histology.

Her history of poorly controlled T2DM was exacerbated by challenges in continuity of healthcare due to her rural location and further compounded by socioeconomic factors, including poverty and access to appropriate nutritional support. The patient first noticed the lump on her arm 4 years before attending her family physician with this complaint . The lump was situated at the site of where she injected herself with insulin. The patient described the lump as soft, non-painful and had been gradually increasing in size. At that point, a clinical diagnosis of lipoma was made by the primary care physician without biopsy or histological confirmation to exclude malignancy or infection. Due to a combination of lack of resources in the rural setting and limited patient health literacy, no further action was taken at that time. Subsequently, the mass increased in size and rapidly enlarged becoming firm and painful. Imaging was ultimately obtained, with an ultrasound and MRI revealing a mass suspicious for neoplasia. The patient attributes this delay from presentation to diagnostic imaging to limited access to quality healthcare resources in her rural community due to financial constraints, physical accessibility and miscommunication between members of her healthcare team.\n\n【11】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【12】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【13】Prior to rupture of the tumour due to intralesional pressure (A, B), postrupture (C) and postsurgical resection (D).</u>\n\n【14】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【15】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【16】Timeline outlining the patient’s clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes.</u>\n\n【17】The mass grew to approximately 12×15 cm, causing purple discolouration and skin breakdown . The patient’s pain had become more pronounced, radiating up her neck, with additional numbness and tingling in the tips of her four fingers and thumb. Open biopsy followed, confirming a high-grade pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma. The mass was Murine Double Minute 2 (MDM2) negative, which indicated it was not a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The patient’s care team, which is not involved in the production of this case report, did not perform any additional IHC to further characterise the tumour at that time. Copious hematoma-like fluid was also obtained, and reaccumulated in the surgical cavity at the primary tumour site. A CT pulmonary angiogram was negative for metastases, and she received a course of preoperative radiotherapy. Shortly after radiotherapy, the tumour filled with fluid and erupted due to pressure, prompting urgent surgical resection of the mass .\n\n【18】The histopathology report of the resection described a 12.5×8.3×5.4 cm tumour, of which 60% was considered postradiation necrotic material. Microscopically, the tumour was pleomorphic, with spindle cell features and high-grade cytological atypia and high mitotic activity. CD34 levels were not assessed. Malignant samples were strongly positive for SMA and desmin, and negative for S-100, CD31, AE1/AE3, CD10 and MNF116, classifying the tumour as a high-grade LMS, with pathological staging of ypT3. The margins were uninvolved, but the surrounding soft tissue was oedematous and fibrotic, with areas of haemorrhage and necrosis.\n\n【19】The patient engaged in postoperative outpatient occupational therapy (OT), where an occupational analysis and subsequent care plan addressing the patient’s barriers to postsurgical care was conducted. The care plan involved the person, environment and occupation by addressing the underlying diseases of T2DM and obesity. The focus of OT was her activities of daily living as well as supportive services needed to address the patient’s current concerns relative to engaging in daily life. Moreover, the OT provided physical rehabilitation including lymphoedema management, scar mobilisation and strengthening of the affected arm. On discharge postoperative outpatient OT, the patient obtained satisfactory strength and range of motion in the affected arm which allowed her to return to work and maintain independent living.\n\n【20】Multiple MRI and CT imaging postresection demonstrated no recurrence of disease. Since her last primary care visit, the patient developed a similar mass on her contralateral shoulder and it has yet to be evaluated, imaged, or biopsied. The patient continues to reside in a rural, medically underserved area, with the nearest urban healthcare resources approximately 225 km (140 miles) away. Her ongoing socioeconomic and medical access barriers have been compounded by COVID-19 and continued to delay her follow-up care. The patient endured psychosocial despair and limited social support during COVID-19. As a result, the patient was unable to again obtain timely follow-up diagnostics.\n\n【21】Global health problems list\n---------------------------\n\n【22】1.  Increase of T2DM and obesity in rural USA and low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC).\n\n【23】2.  Lack/delay of accessible medical care in rural USA and LMIC.\n\n【24】3.  Health literacy and agency for patients living in rural areas.\n\n【25】### Global health problem analysis\n\n【26】#### Increase of T2DM and obesity in rural USA and LMIC\n\n【27】Rates of obesity continue to rise in the USA and globally. Initially, urbanisation was thought to be an important root of this increase; however, higher obesity prevalence is seen in rural communities when compared with urban areas in the USA as well as many other countries. 删除9：<u>17 18 </u>Consequently, there is a rising disparity in the incidence and treatment of obesity-related disorders, including T2DM, in rural communities as compared with urban communities. The rate of T2DM in rural America is about 17% higher than in urban areas. 删除9：<u>19 </u>In addition, mortality related to T2DM is almost 3–5 times higher in rural areas. 删除9：<u>20 </u>Factors contributing to this increased mortality include being on LMI, limited access to endocrinology specialists, mistrust of larger urban healthcare facilities and providers, and lack of transportation. 删除9：<u>21 22 </u>Globally, T2DM and T2DM-related morbidity and mortality rates in rural communities increased markedly, especially with COVID-19. 删除9：<u>23 24 </u>The COVID-19 pandemic underscored how the combination of being on LMI, diabetic, rural, low health literacy and obesity are a recipe for worsening clinical outcomes in LMIC compared with rural areas in high-income countries (HIC). 删除9：<u>25</u>\n\n【28】The patient described in this case report attended her primary care clinic every 6 months for the management of her diabetes. She had a different provider every visit, which limited her continuity of care. She obtained her insulin from her local pharmacy, outside of the clinic she was seen for her diabetes. Furthermore, the patient lived alone and was solely responsible for injecting herself. The patient’s mass was first noticed by a phlebotomist during a routine blood test. The phlebotomist recommended that the patient seek medical evaluation of the non-healing mass.\n\n【29】#### Lack/delay of accessible medical care in rural USA and LMIC\n\n【30】The aetiology of the LMS should not be the focal point of this case study. The focus here is on differentiating a lipoma versus LMS using standardised approaches. Correct diagnosis and effective treatment were delayed in this patient because of the multifactorial failures in US healthcare system and lack of support for people on LMI. According to the World Bank and WHO, half of the world’s population does not have access to essential health services. 删除9：<u>26 </u>In addition, rural US communities experience other barriers to healthcare disproportionally, including increased distance travelled to access healthcare services, lack of reliable transportation, poor health literacy, social stigma and privacy concerns. 删除9：<u>27 </u>Rural areas are often medically underserved lacking both primary and specialist care clinicians and other healthcare workers. 删除9：<u>28 29 </u>Brouns _et al_ reported doctor delay occurred in 27 of 100 patients with the most frequent reason being a misdiagnosis from the start, leading to no or inadequate investigation. 删除9：<u>30 </u>The main reason for patient delay in STSs was attributed to the lack of specific and severe symptoms. Of the total incorrect initial diagnoses of lipoma, none were misdiagnosed as LMS. Those initially diagnosed as a lipoma were finally diagnosed as a liposarcoma and synovial sarcoma. 删除9：<u>30</u>\n\n【31】##### Histopathology services\n\n【32】Cutaneous LMS can only be confirmed via histopathological examination, making IHC an instrumental tool in arriving at a definitive diagnosis. 删除9：<u>31 </u>Histopathology is an essential part of healthcare and must be accessible to ensure effective medical care. From diagnosis and staging through guiding and monitoring treatment, every step requires the support of histopathology investigations. Many regions, however, including those considered HIC, face an extreme shortage of histopathology services. 删除9：<u>32 </u>Rural US communities are faced with closing rural hospitals and their associated laboratory medicine and histopathology support. While a few centres in LMIC have adequately equipped laboratories, most have poor infrastructure, are inadequately equipped and experience shortages of trained personnel and pathologists. 删除9：<u>33 34 </u>Pathologist availability in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, is less than one per 500 000–1 million people, compared with more than 60 per million in the USA. 删除9：<u>35 </u>Scarcity of histopathology services in these regions results not only in frequent misdiagnoses but also long turn-around times, both of which may hinder appropriate and timely treatment of patients. Thway and Fisher found that most of the major discrepancies were due to differing opinions in categorisation, suggesting that unfamiliarity of pathologists with certain tumours is a major contribution to diagnostic discrepancies; whereas no discrepancies were reported between a lipomas and LMS. 删除9：<u>36</u>\n\n【33】Our patient’s mass was not biopsied at initial or subsequent presentation, but ultimately addressed when the mass began causing symptoms secondary to mass-effect and severely compromising her quality of life. In the medically underserved community this patient resides in, there are no STS specialists, nor are histopathological services readily available.\n\n【34】##### Radiological imaging\n\n【35】Even in LMICs, ultrasound scan is often the first modality used when imaging a soft tissue lipoma because it is inexpensive, available and relatively sensitive and specific. However, the fibrous capsule in superficial lipomas cannot be appreciated on ultrasound of intramuscular lipomas because the capsule cannot be distinguished from the muscle that envelops it. 删除9：<u>37 </u>Studies have shown that access to radiology services are disproportionally lower in rural and small hospitals in the USA. One contributing factor is related to difficulty in recruiting and retaining radiologists. The lack of rural radiologists can lead to an inability to meet the service demands when compared with non-rural healthcare centres. 删除9：<u>38 39 </u>To address this issue, significant effort is being placed on developing teleradiology services in rural areas. Interestingly, the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed institutions to explore teleradiology, evaluate the technological limitations, and address regulatory concerns that appear to be the main barriers to using technology more widely in rural communities. 删除9：<u>40</u>\n\n【36】The patient resides in a rural, medically underserved community, where radiology services are limited due to the overall patient burden on the healthcare system. The patient reported that scheduling her radiology appointments and the limited technical skill of radiology technicians in obtaining adequate imaging served as additional barriers to her diagnostic workup and ultimately delay in her care. These additional barriers to care exacerbate the social determinants of health that already had complicated her access to healthcare.\n\n【37】##### Access to specialist care\n\n【38】Just as access to radiology and pathology healthcare providers creates challenges for rural patients, access to specialised oncology care is also an issue. Approximately 20% of the US population resides in rural areas, but only 3% of oncologists practice in these areas, and over 70% of USA counties do not have oncologists. 删除9：<u>41 </u>Rural patients with cancer tend to be diagnosed later and have higher mortality. 删除9：<u>42 </u>In 2019, the American Society of Clinical Oncology found that rural patients are less likely to receive stand-of-care treatment, follow-up or supportive services than urban patients. 删除9：<u>43 </u>This disparity can further compound the treatment of rare cancers such as STSs.\n\n【39】There is one comprehensive cancer centre with a multidisciplinary sarcoma team to serve five states in the Pacific Northwest. While this centre is only 150 miles from our patient’s location, poverty, lack of transportation, poor health literacy and difficulty navigating urban areas precluded her from readily taking advantage of the expertise at this centre.\n\n【40】##### Interaction between STS specialist centres and rural healthcare providers\n\n【41】There have been several strategies purposed to address the challenges of rural cancer care. Rural oncology clinics can partner with larger urban cancer centres to provide access to oncologists and allow patients to receive treatments, such as chemotherapy, closer to home. 删除9：<u>44 </u>Again, telehealth options for conferencing with cancer specialists or having virtual tumour boards may allow rural oncology clinics to provide an elevated level of care. 删除9：<u>45–47 </u>These solutions often require complex coordination, training, access to broadband internet and differing state regulations. Finally, while reimbursement for telemedicine services is possible through Medicare and Medicaid, the payments may be limited and it may be unclear as to how to divide the payments to collaborating institutions. 删除9：<u>48</u>\n\n【42】#### Health literacy and agency for patients living in rural areas\n\n【43】This case report focuses on an LMS clinically misdiagnosed as a lipoma. While LMSs are rare malignant sarcomas, the reasons for a delay in diagnosis are regrettable. The barriers of rural medicine and access to care for patients with LMI, T2DM, and obesity are crucial global concerns. The emotional and stressful toll of the patient not being believed that something was seriously wrong independently worsened the quality of her life. This case clearly demonstrates the need for accountability to standardised protocols and a call to action for all members of the healthcare team as bestowers of quality care for all.\n\n【44】Health literacy is seen as the cognitive and social skills that motivate and enable individuals to gain access to healthcare and allow them to understand and use information to maintain good health. 删除9：<u>49 </u>If the patient had a high level of health literacy and was engaged in patient-centred care regarding her T2DM practices, the attending physician would have ascertained that the patient rotated injection sites, rested the affected site and performed the injection technique accurately. 删除9：<u>50</u>\n\n【45】Several studies have found that rural populations have a lower health literacy than urban populations. 删除9：<u>51 </u>However, there is a debate as to whether lower health literacy is related to living in a rural location or related to other factors. For example, when known confounders were controlled for, some studies no longer found a difference in health literacy between urban and rural individuals. 删除9：<u>52 </u>Factors that can negatively impact an individual’s health literacy include living in poverty, lower level of education, race/ethnicity, age and disability. 删除9：<u>53</u>\n\n【46】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【47】Before I was diagnosed with cancer, my local doctors were not quite sure what was wrong. The tumour on my arm kept growing for 3 years and my doctors kept telling me it was a fatty tumour. Finally, the nurse who draws my blood said I needed to see a specialist because the tumour was becoming large and hard. She told another co-worker at that time and I got a call the same day referring me to Seattle to see a cancer specialist but it is very hard for me to travel there. In order to travel the 3 hours to Seattle, I need to take time off work, save money for gas, and schedule a ride with my sister and brother-in-law. Once I was seen by the cancer specialist, I felt like I was treated very well. They gave me many tests and a treatment plan. My treatment took place at my local cancer centre, so I did not need to travel to Seattle. The cancer teams in Yakima and Seattle worked really well together. I received radiation first to try to shrink the tumour before surgery. While receiving radiation, my tumour filled with fluid and it burst. The cancer doctor in Yakima quickly communicated with my doctor in Seattle and they scheduled my surgery immediately.\n\n【48】The hardest part of this whole process has been a lack of follow through with insurance, imaging departments, other medical professionals, office workers, and schedulers. More than once, I would have an MRI, ordered by my cancer doctor, only to find out it was incorrect or incomplete. I would then have to have another MRI to make up for the incorrect one. Each time, I would have to wait for results, take time off from work, wait for an open appointment, and pay out-of-pocket for the co-payments. In terms of scheduling, often weeks would go by without an appointment or I would be scheduled with another doctor who did not know anything about me. Sometimes it felt like the office helpers had an attitude and did not want to work with other schedulers or offices. I think everyone needs to remember that patients trust receptionists and other healthcare members and everyone should work together.\n\n【49】My advice to doctors and medical students is: know who your helpers are. Know who works for you and know what they do and do not do for your patients. Those that are working with you need to follow through otherwise your patients will suffer. Also, it is really hard to keep switching primary care doctors. I felt like I fell through the cracks, so please know your workers and trust that they will follow through for your patients when you leave. The whole team needs to work together, like the body, if one part is not working, the whole thing will not work right. People who are in charge of medications, nurses who take blood pressure, and people who clean the exam rooms are all equally important and their role should be recognised. If I can inspire somebody else about the importance of continuity of care, then I will be happy.\n\n【50】### Learning points\n\n【51】*   In differentiating a lipoma versus leiomyosarcoma using standardised approaches, imaging, pathological analysis and subsequent immunohistochemistry proved to be critical in the correct diagnosis for this patient.\n\n【52】*   While biopsies carry risk, there are specific markers, including CD34, that quickly discern lipomas from a rarer soft tissue sarcoma.\n\n【53】*   This case report illustrates how a person with a low or moderate income, type 2 diabetes mellitus, low health literacy, obesity and reduced access to quality healthcare agency may unnecessarily increase a patient’s morbidity and mortality.\n\n【54】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【55】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【56】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thank you, Dr. Michele McCarroll, for your invaluable contribution to this team in the process of compassionately capturing this patient’s story.

The authors present a case of acyclovir-resistant HSV reactivation in a 26-year-old woman 7 days post T-deplete sibling allograft on a background of combined cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation myeloablative conditioning, successfully treated with foscarnet and cidofovir therapy and discuss the differential diagnoses for early/late engraftment oral disease.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   haematology (incl blood transfusion)\n*   malignant and benign haematology\n*   dentistry and oral medicine\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-247109\n\n【3】Statistics from Altmetric.com\n-----------------------------</u>\n\n【4】删除12：<u>*   haematology (incl blood transfusion)\n*   malignant and benign haematology\n*   dentistry and oral medicine\n</u>\nBackground\n----------\n\n【5】Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative treatment option for the management of haematological malignancy, and non-malignant haematological dyscrasias—including myelodysplastic disorders and haemoglobinopathies. From an oral perspective, HSCT can be associated with both acute and chronic complications, either secondary to pre-engraftment conditioning regimens or directly resulting from transplant. 删除9：<u>1</u>\n\n【6】Acute oral complications are seen in up to 70% of patients receiving HSCT and include oral mucositis, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and infection. The incidence of oral mucositis is in the region of 73%–86%, 删除13：<u>2 </u>with the severity of its presentation directly correlated to the intensity of the conditioning regimen implemented. The incidence of severe mucositis (WHO Oral Mucositis Grading Scale II–IV) is higher in patients receiving total body irradiation (TBI), 删除13：<u>3 </u>however, other determinants such as the use of methotrexate in GvHD prophylaxis have also been identified. 删除9：<u>4</u>\n\n【7】GvHD is a common complication of HSCT and remains a leading cause of non-relapse post-transplant mortality. Acute GvHD is reported in up to 50% of HSCT recipients with human leucocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch, a well-documented risk factor for its development. 删除9：<u>5</u>\n\n【8】Post-HSCT infection is the leading cause of post-transplant morbidity in the pre-engraftment, immediate and late postengraftment periods, with a number of transplant factors influencing immune reconstitution _—HLA disparity, T cell depletion, GvHD._ 6 Pre-engraftment is characterised by aplasia, with recovery of neutrophil counts by week 2–3. The postengraftment immunodeficient state is secondary to reduced number of natural killer cells of the innate immune system and T cells of the adaptive immune system, which can take up to 24 months to normalise. 删除9：<u>7</u>\n\n【9】The combination of neutropenia and disrupted mucosal barrier protection, secondary to mucositis, in the early pre-engraftment period is associated with a high risk of HSV infection. Reactivation was seen in up to 80% of HSV-seropositive HSCT recipients prior to the introduction of routine antiviral prophylaxis. Routine prophylactic use of acyclovir following allogeneic HSCT has reduced the incidence of HSV reactivation to 0%–3%. 删除9：<u>8 </u>The recent emergence of acyclovir-resistant HSV, particularly among immunocompromised patients, poses a challenge in the acute management of HSCT patients postengraftment.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 26-year-old woman diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome with multi-lineage dysplasia received a T-deplete sibling allograft on a background of combined cyclophosphamide and TBI myeloablative conditioning. She was referred to the oral medicine department secondary to the onset of oral ulceration which developed day 7 postengraftment. As per protocol, the patient was receiving prophylactic oral acyclovir (200 mg, three times a day) at this stage.\n\n【12】Examination revealed diffuse irregular ulceration of the keratinised and non-keratinised oromucosae, with no dermatomal confinement.

The lack of classical cutaneous ‘target’ lesions and the failure of the oral symptoms to self-resolve made this diagnosis less likely.\n\n【31】In combination with the history of blistering of the left dorsal foot, the suspicion of PAMS was raised following the failure of improvement seen with initial treatment dose intravenous antiviral therapy. A close haematology–oncology review was carried out and confirmed successful graft, negating this possible diagnosis.\n\n【32】The final diagnosis reached was HSV-1 recrudescence. This was initially considered somewhat unlikely given both the severe presentation and concomitant antiviral prophylaxis. In view of this differential, HSV-1 drug resistance testing was carried out and demonstrated HSV-1 UL23 mutation, associated with acyclovir resistance.\n\n【33】Treatment\n---------\n\n【34】Prior to HSV-1 drug resistance testing, treatment was escalated to intravenous treatment dose acyclovir (10 mg/kg three times a day) for 10 days, with partial clinical response . Subsequent switch to oral valacyclovir (500 mg two times per day) resulted in rebound disease activity.\n\n【35】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【36】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 5\n\n【37】Evident healing of vermillion ulceration following escalation of intravenous acyclovir to treatment dose.</u>\n\n【38】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【39】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 6\n\n【40】Limited intra-oral clinical improvement following escalation of intravenous acyclovir to treatment dose.</u>\n\n【41】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【42】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 7\n\n【43】Limited intra-oral clinical improvement following escalation of intravenous acyclovir to treatment dose.</u>\n\n【44】The limited disease modifying action of acyclovir and analogues was later attributed to HSV-1 UL23 mutation acyclovir resistance.

The resultant triphosphate metabolite is a competitive inhibitor for viral DNA polymerase, resulting in viral inactivation and DNA chain termination. 删除9：<u>9 </u>Resistance derives from mutations to either DNA polymerase or the thymidine kinase enzyme—with three distinct phenotypes identified in terms of TK activity—absent, reduced or altered. 删除9：<u>10 </u>Unlike acyclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet do not require enzymatic phosphorylation and act as direct inhibitors/alternative substrates for HSV DNA polymerase—thus are effective second-line agents in treating acyclovir-resistant isolates.\n\n【58】Literature review demonstrates a prevalence of acyclovir resistance of 14%–46.5% within HSCT recipients with clinically confirmed HSV infection, 11–13 —which is markedly higher than in immunocompetent patients. Concomitant GvHD is reported to be an additional significant risk factor for the development of antiviral resistance. 删除9：<u>14</u>\n\n【59】This case report demonstrates successful treatment of HSV resistance with both cidofovir and foscarnet, however, there are case reports of cross-resistance to acyclovir and foscarnet. 删除9：<u>15 </u>Escalation to cidofovir in this isolated example has proven clinically effective. 删除9：<u>16 </u>Both medications show a similar adverse side effect profile in terms of nephrotoxicity.\n\n【60】Risk factors for infection postallograft are multifactorial—relating to impaired innate and acquired immune responses. These include the underlying host disease, type of conditioning regime implemented, the type of graft and presence/absence of GvHD. 删除9：<u>17 </u>In this case, infection occurred in the early engraftment phase (<30 days), with evident neutropenia and disruption of mucosal barriers underlying susceptibility. Both acute leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome as underlying host diseases result in profound preallograft neutropenia and risk factors for infection. The myeloablative conditioning regimens used in this case, with cytotoxic chemotherapy and TBI, result in mucositis and neutropenia which further exacerbate the risk of infection over reduced intensity regimens. 删除9：<u>18 </u>HLA matching is also a contributory factor to the development of GvHD and risk of superinfection.\n\n【61】### Learning points\n\n【62】*   An understanding of conditioning regimens and the timeline of immune reconstitution can aid clinicians in identifying likely causes of acute and/or chronic complications in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients during these distinct clinical phases.\n\n【63】*   Despite routine antiviral prophylaxis regimens post-HSCT, viral recrudescence should be considered in cases of oromucosal ulceration due to increasing resistance.\n\n【64】*   Prodromal phenomena, irregular lesion borders and vesicular phenotype are often diagnostic features of viral ulceration. Direct methods for specimen collection of suspected herpes simplex virus lesions include de-roofing of vesicles and use of a Rayon swab, rotated firmly of the lesion base. For older lesions, the Tzanck test can be used for diagnosis, by scraping the base of the lesion with the edge of a scalpel blade.\n\n【65】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【66】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【67】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>UCLH Haematology Department, Dr Ben Carpenter and Dr Arian Laurence, for their care of the study patients.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:45:42", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:46:20", "cost": 38.297}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:22", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:46:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:45:42"}

She had no headache, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysuria, arthralgia or skin rash. She was alert, and her vital signs were normal except for a body temperature of 37.8°C. Physical examination revealed splenomegaly, generalised pitting oedema and gait instability; neurological examination was normal except for gait instability. Laboratory testing revealed anaemia (haemoglobin, 删除13：<u>88 </u>g/L), thrombocytopaenia (platelet count, 删除13：<u>92</u>x10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) and liver dysfunction (aspartate aminotransferase, 删除9：<u>51 </u>U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 删除9：<u>36 </u>U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 删除9：<u>716 </u>IU/L; total bilirubin, 0.4 mg/dL). Her serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor and ferritin levels were high at 12 800 U/mL and 3121 ng/mL, respectively. Non-contrast-enhanced CT revealed mild splenomegaly. The blood and urine cultures were normal. Bone marrow examination demonstrated hypocellularity, haemophagocytosis and the presence of large abnormal lymphoid cells. However, there was no evidence of an abnormal cell population on flow cytometry of the bone marrow. Brain MRI performed to determine the cause of the fever and unexplained gait instability revealed a hyperintense lesion in the central pons on T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging . Cerebrospinal fluid cytology and culture revealed no abnormality. Random skin biopsies revealed atypical lymphocytes within the small vessels of the dermis and hypodermis . The immunophenotype of these cells was consistent with B-cell phenotype, showing CD20 and CD79a . Accordingly, intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) was diagnosed. She was treated with R-THP-COP (rituximab, tetrahydropyranyl adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone) for eight cycles. Hyperintense lesion in the pons was almost undetectable on MRI after 5 months of chemotherapy , and complete remission was achieved after eight cycles of chemotherapy.\n\n【4】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【5】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【6】Brain MRI shows a hyperintense lesion in the central pons (white arrow) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (A) that was almost undetectable after 5 months of chemotherapy (B).</u>\n\n【7】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【8】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【9】H&E staining of skin biopsy shows exhibited large, scattered abnormal cells clustered in the small vessels (A).

However, it has been reported that approximately half of the patients who showed these imaging findings were asymptomatic; hence, these imaging changes in lymphoma patients may not be consistent with their symptoms. The most important differential diagnosis for this imaging finding is osmotic demyelination syndrome, which can be excluded in this case because there was no rapid correction of hyponatraemia. Pons infarction and other central demyelinating diseases are also differential diagnoses, but these are less likely to be associated with thrombocytopaenia and splenomegaly.\n\n【11】In patients with undiagnosed fever with neurological symptoms, the presence of this specific MRI finding may contribute to reduce the time to diagnose IVLBCL, thereby providing a positive impact on the early initiation of treatment and improving prognosis.\n\n【12】### Learning points\n\n【13】*   Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma manifests abnormal MRI findings in approximately 90% of patients, and high-intensity lesions in the pons, which are found in about 60% of patients.\n\n【14】*   Osmotic demyelination syndrome, pons infarction and other central demyelinating diseases are also differential diagnoses, but these are less likely to be associated with thrombocytopaenia and splenomegaly.\n\n【15】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【16】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【17】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:23:57", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:24:19", "cost": 22.143}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:22", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:24:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:23:57"}

The portosystemic gradient was reduced from 19 to 10 mm Hg. His volume status significantly improved. He was discharged on oral furosemide and spironolactone. Repeat imaging showed resolution of ascites and a smaller, 1.7 cm loculated pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology.\n\n【15】Two years prior, the patient experienced viral pneumonia complicated by pericarditis, cardiac tamponade and inflammatory pleural effusions, which resolved after pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement and thoracentesis.

Pericardiectomy was performed 4 months prior to the current admission. Pathology demonstrated chronic inflammation and fibrosis.\n\n【16】Hepatic hydropericardium represents a rare complication of end-stage liver disease. Fistulous tracts between the peritoneal cavity and the pericardium allow the development of pericardial effusions catalysed by portal hypertension and hypervolemia. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Typically, patients with cirrhosis have preceding hepatic hydrothorax associated with fistula formation; however, trauma, cardiothoracic surgery and inflammatory pericarditis have also been implicated. 删除9：<u>1–4 </u>The patient’s presentation is unique since a fistula formed without evidence of hepatic hydrothorax. Rather, his prior cardiothoracic surgeries and inflammatory pericardial disease likely contributed to fistula development. The progression of his liver disease then likely caused the pericardial effusion via portal hypertension.\n\n【17】Traditionally, radionucleotide scan demonstrating a connection between the peritoneal cavity and pericardium diagnoses hepatic hydropericardium. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case where pericardiocentesis with bubble study provided visual diagnosis via bubble transit. The identical fluid studies confirmed the connection. Temporising procedures for hepatic hydropericardium include pericardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement; however, definitive management requires either TIPS or liver transplant. 删除9：<u>3 4 </u>Loculation of the pericardial effusion, due to chronicity or inflammation, likely prevented complete resolution.\n\n【18】### Learning points\n\n【19】*   Hepatic hydropericardium is a rare decompensation of cirrhosis caused by portal hypertension and peritoneal–pericardial fistula formation potentiated by inflammatory pericardial and pleural diseases, cardiothoracic surgery and trauma.\n\n【20】*   When conducted with bubble study, pericardiocentesis can identify peritoneal–pericardial fistula formation.\n\n【21】*   Transhepatic portosystemic shunt placement can alleviate hepatic hydropericardium via reduction in portal pressure.\n\n【22】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【23】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【24】Consent obtained from next of kin.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:24:32", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:24:41", "cost": 8.748}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:22", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:24:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:24:32"}

We successfully performed minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting with a proximal graft anastomosis of the descending aorta. A thoracotomy was performed to extend the lateral approach to the descending aorta. We performed a minithoracotomy using three-dimensional endoscopy for internal thoracic artery harvesting. Endoscopic internal thoracic artery harvesting minimises incision length. The combination of endoscopic and lateral thoracotomy incisions in minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting enabled small and lateral thoracotomy incisions.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   Ischaemic heart disease\n*   Cardiothoracic surgery\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n【3】This is an open access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

MICS CABG surgery reduces several complications, including wound infection and length of stay in the hospital. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Although MICS CABG is less invasive, this technique has rarely been adopted as a surgical approach for patients with multivessel lesions, likely owing to the surgical challenges and difficulties inherent in this procedure. Proximal anastomoses at the ascending aorta and harvesting the internal thoracic artery (ITA) by direct vision are technically difficult in MICS CABG. 删除9：<u>2 3 </u>When used through the limited left posterior thoracotomy employed for lateral MICS CABG surgery, manipulation of the ascending aorta is difficult because of the poor visual field. A stepwise approach and several materials are necessary to perform proximal anastomoses directly off the ascending aorta safety. 删除9：<u>4 </u>A posterolateral thoracotomy incision provides excellent exposure to the lateral surface of the heart. Therefore, we chose the descending aorta to be used as a proximal source for lateral thoracotomy, which is safe and easy to approach. Pain is a major problem with this method because the incision must be extended laterally for anastomosis of the descending aorta. Previously, a minithoracotomy was performed using minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting (MIDCAB’s) three-dimensional (3D) endoscopy. 删除9：<u>5 </u>The endoscopic ITA harvesting enables us to minimise the incision length and perform lateral thoracotomy. The combination of endoscopic ITA harvesting and small thoracotomy incision led to a reduction in the pain issue.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】The patient was a male in his 60s who underwent haemodialysis. He had a history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the right coronary artery due to unstable angina. Preoperative angiography revealed 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and circumflex artery (Cx) including a left main lesion (LMT) . The cardiologist hesitated to perform PCI due to the complexity of the anatomy. The lesions were not suitable for PCI because the LMT lesion and LMT bifurcation angle were wide . Thus, for this reason, the patient was advised to undergo CABG. Since the patient required early recovery, we planned minimally invasive cardiac surgery.\n\n【10】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【11】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【12】(A) Coronary angiogram showing stenosis of left anterior descending coronary artery and stenosis in LMT extending to left circumflex artery (white arrow) (B) coronary angiogram showing wide angle of LMT bifurcation.

CAU, caudal; CRA, cranial; LAO, left anterior obliquee; LMT, left main coronary trunk.</u>\n\n【13】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【14】Preoperative chest-enhanced CT was necessary to decide the strategy of the proximal anastomoses. When atherosclerosis precluded anastomosis to the ascending or descending aorta, we also considered using subclavian artery as an alternative. Enhanced CT revealed calcification and debris around the aortic arch. In contrast, the level of the descending aorta under the pulmonary hilum was smooth. We determined the proximal anastomoses on the descending aorta and total endoscopic ITA harvesting .\n\n【15】Treatment\n---------\n\n【16】The patient was placed in the supine position with the left side raised at 30°. After the induction of anaesthesia, a double-lumen endotracheal tube for single-lung ventilation was used. A major incision was made in the fifth intercostal space lateral to the mid-axillary line. A 3D endoscope was inserted through the fifth intercostal space, and a 5 mm instrumental port was positioned in the fourth intercostal space . We removed the left ITA (LITA) with the harmonic scalpel using the skeletonised technique. The entire length of the LITA was harvested with total endoscopic vision using 3D endoscopy . We harvested the saphenous vein for the Cx. Thereafter, the main incision was extended to the 10 mm camera port to gain additional exposure. The inferior pulmonary ligament of the left lung was released, and the deflated left lung was packed into the apex of the left pleural cavity. Heparin (10 000 U) was administered, and active clotting time was maintained for longer than 300 s. A side-biting clamp is placed in the descending aorta. Proximal vein graft anastomoses were completed by running 6-0 polypropylene under direct vision . The traction sutures were positioned on the pericardium to expose the lateral wall of the heart. The pericardium was then retracted using stay sutures. The pericardium was opened just anterior to the left phrenic nerve and the marginal branches of the Cx were identified. The vein graft is routed beneath the pulmonary hilum. Distal anastomoses to the Cx with 8-0 polypropylene were performed using a stabiliser. The LITA-LAD anastomoses were then performed using a continuous 8-0 polypropylene suture. At the end of surgery, protamine was administered to fully reverse the effect of heparin. The chest tube was positioned at a distance from the bypass graft. The mean operative time was 248 min.\n\n【17】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【18】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【19】Diagram of the surgical incision and port access position.</u>\n\n【20】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【21】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【22】(A) Total endoscopic ITA harvesting.

(B) Curved-multiplanar reconstruction image demonstrates the patent graft at the descending aorta.</u>\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】MICS CABG involves CABG via a small anterolateral thoracotomy. Lapierre _et al_ noted excellent MICS CABG procedural outcomes and freedom from complications, including revascularisation, major morbidity and wound infection. 删除9：<u>1 </u>Nevertheless, it was difficult for MICS CABG to gain good exposure of the vessel to be grafted, which proved difficult or associated with haemodynamic instability, especially in the posterolateral circumflex branch, during positioning of the heart. A greater rate of cardiopulmonary bypass was noted in MICS CABG. 删除9：<u>1 </u>From the experience of the 450 cases of MICS CABG, McGinn _et al_ 6 reported that the approach of incising to the left side of the midclavicular line is anatomically superior and highly safe for the approach to the left coronary artery region. More lateral thoracotomy allows for rib spreading with less risk of rib injury and for the use of the space normally occupied by the left lung to work within the chest. A lateral thoracotomy incision provides excellent exposure of the lateral surface of the heart. On the major issue, the ascending aorta is difficult to access from the left side. Aortic bleeding complications are difficult to manage in lateral thoracotomy. Although Vincent reported that handsewn proximal anastomoses onto the ascending aorta were enabled through a small left thoracotomy, several setups were necessary to perform safely. 删除9：<u>4 </u>In addition, manipulation of the ascending aorta is an independent risk factor for postoperative stroke. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Because of these characteristics, we considered that manipulation of the ascending aorta was inappropriate in MICS CABG. Therefore, we decided to perform proximal anastomoses on the descending aorta.\n\n【30】Enhanced CT is necessary to determine where to put the proximal anastomoses. We evaluated the aortic wall condition whether calcification and debris were present. In this case, there were calcification around the ascending aorta; whereas, the descending aorta had smooth wall. So, we determined the proximal anastomoses on the descending aorta. The lateral thoracotomy with the anastomoses onto the descending aorta for circumflex coronary disease was reported for both primary and reoperative revascularisation. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Lateral thoracotomy approach was safely performed in 34 patients with isolated coronary artery disease of the circumflex system with lower early and late morbidities. 删除9：<u>9 </u>However, there are few reports of this technique for MICS CABG with multivessel. We believe that the reason for hesitation of anastomosis at the descending aorta in MICS CABG is that it requires an extended large incision, especially in the case of ITA harvesting with direct vision. To access the descending aorta, extension of the incision to the lateral side is necessary. In ITA harvesting using direct vision, the incision is centred over the mid-clavicular line. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Pain and cosmetics are major issues due to the increasing incision length. We previously reported a technique for total endoscopic ITA harvesting using 3D endoscopy without a robotic system. 删除9：<u>5 </u>The 3D endoscope has an enhanced ability for image analysis and enables a more reliable visualisation of the branches of the ITA than direct vision. 删除9：<u>3</u>D endoscopy offers the advantage of a lower running cost than robotic systems. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Thoracoscopic ITA takedown can minimise incision length and locate the thoracotomy laterally. Endoscopic ITA harvesting compensates for the disadvantages of large lateral thoracotomy.\n\n【31】Apart from MICS CABG, a hybrid treatment combining PCI and minimally invasive direct CABG is an emerging alternative in coronary artery treatment. However, PCI has reported poor results in treating LMT complex lesions of coronary arteries. 删除9：<u>10 </u>Therefore, in this case, we decided that MICS CABG was the appropriate treatment due to the complexity of the coronary lesion. We confirmed the graft patency and uneventful course at 6 months follow-up. Fonger _et al_ reported that the free graft was routed inferior to the hilum of lung to prevent kinking when the lung is re-expanded to its native position. 删除9：<u>8 </u>One of the reasons for the better result may be due to following that strategy. Although further experience and long turn outcome will serve to define the ultimate capabilities of this approach, this result suggests that the technique is effective in MICS CABG, especially in the case of unavailability of the ascending aorta.\n\n【32】In conclusion, endoscopic ITA harvesting is a useful technique when performing proximal anastomosis of the descending aorta, which requires lateral thoracotomy.\n\n【33】#### Patient's perspective\n\n【34】*   I appreciate the doctor for the minimally invasive treatment and giving me strong hope. After surgery, I was advised to follow-up every 6 months. Currently, I am living comfortably without any symptoms.\n\n【35】#### Learning points\n\n【36】*   Lateral thoracotomy is an ideal approach for minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting owing to its excellent exposure of the lateral surface of the heart.\n\n【37】*   Proximal anastomoses onto the descending aorta is a suitable technique anatomically, and enables to avoid embolic stroke.\n\n【38】*   Total endoscopic internal thoracic artery harvesting can minimise incision length and locate the thoracotomy laterally.\n\n【39】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【40】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【41】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 10:21:35", "endTime": "2024/09/23 10:23:06", "cost": 91.107}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:22", "update_time": "2024-09-22 18:23:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 18:21:35"}

This comprised a joint surgical procedure between otolaryngology, cardiothoracic and upper gastrointestinal teams. The otolaryngology team extended the retro-oesophageal space via an open right collar incision, and the pen was identified and safely removed. Blunt dissection into the left retro-oesophageal space revealed a broken wooden paintbrush which was also removed, and the wound cavity thoroughly washed out. Upper gastrointestinal surgeons carried out an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and placement of nasogastic tube into the stomach. The cardiothoracic surgical team subsequently utilised video-assisted thoracic surgery via the fifth intercostal space to remove the remaining foreign bodies within the chest as well as washout the mediastinal cavity. On day 2 following surgery, the patient was transferred to a specialist upper gastrointestinal surgery unit for monitoring and to commence a feeding regime until safe to feed orally.\n\n【24】It has been reported that 12%–16% of cases of foreign body ingestion require surgical intervention for retrieval, 删除13：<u>1 2 </u>and that following the paediatric population, adults with psychiatric disorders, developmental delay and intoxication with alcohol are among the most common to present with intentional true foreign body ingestion. 删除9：<u>3 4 </u>An assessment and management algorithm for upper aerodigestive tract foreign body ingestion has been suggested by the authors of this communication , which takes these important aspects into account that those suggested by existing literature findings. 删除9：<u>5</u>\n\n【25】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【26】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 7\n\n【27】Upper aerodigestive tract foreign body ingestion management algorithm.</u>\n\n【28】In such challenging anatomical cases, it is imperative for specialty teams to align their approaches in a multidisciplinary fashion in order to achieve an optimal and safe outcome for the patient. In this particular case, clear communication between specialist surgical teams, the medical doctors as well as psychiatric teams were essential in determining the surgical strategy, guiding perioperative care as well as aiding patient recovery.

The patient presented with memory deficits including loss of short-term memory based around handling of his finances, not knowing who his children were and what they were doing for him, and not recognising his wife whom at times he would mistake for his mother. He was becoming disorientated daily to place and directions and had been getting lost in his own neighbourhood. These memory symptoms were accompanied by episodes of significant suspicion focused mainly on his finances and as a result of his concerns, he would become very agitated and at times verbally and physically aggressive. He was experiencing auditory hallucinations in which he thought he heard his family talking about his finances. He was having persecutory delusions and accusing his son-in-law of stealing his pension, as well as trying to murder him. He would often physically and verbally attack his eldest daughter for not protecting him and would become agitated towards his wife for not supporting him. He also stopped engaging with his friends and neighbours and had stopped musical and gardening activities which he previously enjoyed.\n\n【11】The patient had no previously diagnosed chronic conditions, medical or psychiatric history and no known cardiovascular risk factors. He was not taking any regular medications prior to his diagnosis of dementia. In 2014, he was diagnosed with a mixed form of dementia (Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia), by his local physician who then prescribed donepezil, as well as Ginkgo Biloba and multivitamins. The patient was a non-smoker and drank no alcohol. He was formerly a teacher of chemistry and mathematics as well as a primary school principal. According to his family, he was of a very high intellect during his years of active teaching. He previously had hobbies such a listening to and playing music, and gardening.\n\n【12】The patient’s eldest daughter visited his apartment three times a week to provide some care support and was the main spokesperson for the family. His younger daughter worked overseas. The family had employed a male care worker to stay and care for the patient full time. After 10 days, the male care assistant resigned because of the stress of caring for the patient. The patient would consistently wake up during the night causing carer fatigue. The care assistant’s departure resulted in the need to employ a new care assistant. The patient’s wife had to be moved into a separate one bedroom flat in the same building due to her own significant and increasing medical care needs and to minimise disruption of her care.\n\n【13】In early April 2018, the family contacted our dementia service team requesting help in dealing with the patient’s worsening suspicion, agitation, aggression, disorientation and increased isolation.

The in-home dementia programme service is provided as an adjunct to the patient’s ongoing clinical care provided by the physician.\n\n【27】Treatment\n---------\n\n【28】In April 2018, the dementia service team which included a social worker and a social care manager initiated a systematic, non-pharmacological approach to treatment, involving the family members and community at the onset of treatment. A plan was devised to identify strategies and therapeutic interventions to meet the patient’s needs and reduce the family’s stress and burden of care.\n\n【29】Following initial assessment, key treatment goals were established as follows:\n\n【30】1.  Build a trustful relationship between the male patient and his care providers and family members.\n\n【31】2.  Develop coping mechanisms and strategies for the suspicion, persecutory delusions and to reduce the aggressive behaviour towards his family members and carers.\n\n【32】3.  Improve the patient’s orientation to familiar surroundings and people.\n\n【33】4.  Improve his socialisation and support system within the community.\n\n【34】5.  Relieve carer stress and burden.\n\n【35】A care plan was implemented from Monday to Friday for an hour a day which included:\n\n【36】1.  Assessment of triggers behind the patient’s delusions and suspicion, verbal and physical aggression.\n\n【37】2.  Relevant non-pharmacological interventions, including daily reality orientation.\n\n【38】3.  Provision of family education.\n\n【39】4.  Rebuilding connections with ex-colleagues and neighbours.\n\n【40】Within the first few visits, the social worker was able to build a trusting relationship with the patient. She discovered that the patient’s loss of short-term memory, lack of recognition of family members and impaired ability to manage his finances resulted in him becoming suspicious of what was happening to his money as he did not see any of the cash from his pension at home. He also became accusatory of his wife and daughter over ownership of his property. The intersection of memory loss and impaired ability resulted in perceived stress for the patient which triggered delusions, agitation and aggression. The social worker initiated a reality orientation approach by explaining to the patient that his pension was deposited monthly into the bank where there were safety measures in place to protect his money and that only he, with his identity card, could withdraw the money from the bank tellers. The social worker immediately involved the family in this approach to show him his automatic teller machine card and property ownership certificate regularly as a daily reminder of his financial security, and they would take him to the bank to be reassured by the bank officials if his concerns relapsed significantly. Further training was provided for the caregiver and the family on ways to manage the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia and the associated manifestations.\n\n【41】The patient also had episodes when he could not recognise himself in the mirror as soon as he stepped out of the bathroom and would then become verbally aggressive towards his wife. These episodes were reduced after the social worker and the family covered the mirror up with specific dated newspapers during the time he would be in the bathroom, thereby helping the patient to keep orientated to date. A reality orientation board was implemented with the patient to help him recognise his family members, especially his wife, as well as his home address and directions. The social worker showed the patient photos of different people and his wife from past to present and helped him to recognise his wife. The social worker periodically conducted group activities with the patient as well as his wife to help with their relationship and interactions. With the aim of helping reduce the patient’s frequent disorientation, the patient was brought into the community with his family, as this helped show him the way back home to reinforce the patient’s memory of the home address and directions.\n\n【42】The social worker and caregivers also explored better ways to communicate and care for the patient. Talking therapy was applied to help rebuild family relationships with the patient. Reminiscence therapy, a reality orientation board and cognitive training were implemented with the aim of helping to strengthen the patient’s memory and cognition. Music therapy and gardening therapy were intended to help reduce changes in mood, encourage positive engagement and help restore his former hobbies.

The social worker and eldest daughter persuaded the patient to communicate with his ex-colleagues on a social media (WeChat) group chat on his phone. They also arranged for the patient to attend a party held by the patient’s ex-colleagues. In addition, the care manager approached the local neighbourhood residential committee spokesperson and provided education on dementia to better understand patient’s condition and requested them to visit the patient once a month.\n\n【47】Throughout the programme, the team members provided caregiver support and training during the sessions in the patient’s home, such as sharing with care assistant how to deal with client’s behaviour, improve communication between the family members and the patient and further educate the caregivers on the dementia.\n\n【48】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【49】By July 2018, 删除13：<u>3 </u>months after initiation of the programme, a significant reduction was noted in verbally and physically aggressive incidents as well as fewer episodes of suspicion and delusions as demonstrated in table 2 . Since the end of August 2018, there have been no further episodes of verbal or physical aggression. The patient has a better understanding of his finances and how his daughter is helping him manage them. While his financial understanding and memory of his financial affairs is not always perfect, the recurring reality orientation strategies are able to be implemented by his family and carers as frequent reminders of how his financial affairs are managed and protected. Along with the observed improvements in neuropsychiatric symptoms, there was no deterioration in the patient’s levels of dementia, depression, functionality and quality of life as displayed in the scores in table 3 . It was noted that the while the Global Deterioration Scale/Functional Assessment Staging system scores of 5 showed moderately severe cognitive decline for cognition due to the significance of his memory loss and moderate functional impairment in that the patient occasionally needed help selecting clothing; however, in terms of physical ability to complete activities of daily living, the patient was able to physically dress and groom himself independently and had no other impairments on the Barthel parameters resulting in the Barthel index score of 100.\n\n【50】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【51】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 2\n\n【52】Frequency of episodes of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia experienced by the patient</u>\n\n【53】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【54】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 3\n\n【55】Results of relevant dementia, depression and quality of life scales in the patient over 8 months</u>\n\n【56】The QoL-AD was based on patient input with some caregiver input when required and we were surprised not to see the score improve despite the reduced frequency of the neuropsychiatric symptoms. A speculative reason for this could be based on the fact the quality of life assessment is primarily based on the person’s subjective opinion on their own intrinsic sense of well-being within physical health, mood, relationships, cognition, domestic life and tasks like financial management. It is possible that the patient’s perception of his life situation had not changed as he continued to receive support in managing daily life and he may not have recognised improvement in his neuropsychiatric symptoms in relation to his quality of life. In considering this aspect, we have recognised that for future cases, use of both the self-rated QoL-AD and proxy-rated QoL-AD questionnaire versions may be more able to demonstrate improvement in quality of life when taking into account both patient and family perspectives equally; however, it is has been noted that self-rated and proxy-rated questionnaires may not be inter-reliable for score levels. 删除9：<u>32</u>\n\n【57】An increase in socialisation with neighbours and the community was also noted. The patient’s relationships with family members have improved. His wife now comes down to have a meal with the patient every day and joins in with therapy sessions from time to time. The patient likes to chat with the neighbours and enjoyed attending a party held by ex-colleagues. So far, the second care assistant has been managing well for the last 3 months since his employment in August 2018. The family decided to stop the dementia service at the end of November 2018 because of the significant improvements in the patient’s neuropsychiatric symptoms and level of overall improvement. The family’s plan was to see what would happen thereafter under the family and care assistant’s care. As part of our usual approach to care in this situation, our team advised the patient’s family they would be available if the patient was to require the services in the programme again in the future.\n\n【58】Discussion\n----------\n\n【59】There are international efforts to promote the use of non-pharmacological interventions as first-line treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, 删除13：<u>3 9 33 </u>supported by a growing body of evidence for benefit. 删除9：<u>3 6 8–10 12 </u>However, most of the studies assessed focus on patients in long-term care facilities rather than community-based or home-based strategies. There have been some home-based intervention studies focused on potential triggers of patient behaviours and behaviour modification strategies, 删除13：<u>13 </u>interventions around environment and patient abilities, 删除13：<u>14 </u>and tailored activities, 删除13：<u>15 </u>which were delivered in person and telephonically by occupational therapists and nurse practitioners. 删除9：<u>13–15 </u>The studies were carried out over 16 weeks or 4 months of the applied intervention period during which there was a demonstrated reduction in the frequency of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and associated caregiver distress. 删除9：<u>13–15 </u>Models of care that focus on individualised approaches to promote self-determination have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. 删除9：<u>3 </u>With regards to the patient in this case report, we observed the reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms within 3 months of starting the programme, which would be in line with the expected time frame based on the noted studies. 删除9：<u>13–15 </u>The dementia service programme and interventions provided to the patient in this case report differ in that they are all delivered in person and can be delivered in resource-poor settings by other allied healthcare professionals such as social workers and healthcare assistants who receive relevant training. The programme has a multicomponent, structured approach which includes initial person-centred assessment on needs, environment and potential behaviour triggers; education of the family, caregivers and community on dementia care and management; and a personalised, one-on-one programme of selected non-pharmacological intervention sessions. We acknowledge that the observation of associated improved neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia in one patient without a control case does warrant speculation; however, these observations have prompted the initiation of further methodological research into this approach.\n\n【60】While clinically, there is a lack of available definitive testing and confirmation of dementia subtype in China, the programme of dementia services discussed in this case can be implemented for symptom-based management in resource-poor settings. This case demonstrates that using an individualised approach to implementing non-pharmacological interventions in the patient’s own home can have a noticeable associated improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. In turn, there was a related perceived improvement in family dynamics and caregiver stress based on verbal reports from the family and care assistant. At the time of this programme was provided to this patient, the team did not have any instruments in place to specifically measure caregiver burden. However, there was a daily behaviour record maintained and the social worker included in the service notes feedback from the family members and care assistant on how the changes were affecting them. The environment and stressors in the patient’s home had improved to such an extent that the wife who had previously had to move upstairs to a different flat due to the challenges posed by his neuropsychiatric symptoms, was able to move back downstairs to be with her husband again. However, it was a valuable lesson to learn at the time that we should monitor the caregiver burden both qualitatively and quantitatively. Subsequent to this case, our programmes now include instruments to measure caregiver stress and burden and additional tools to monitor behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.\n\n【61】With the anticipated increased burden of dementia on healthcare facilities and long-term care, 删除13：<u>34 35 </u>there is a crucial need for further trials and guidance on the effective implementation of non-pharmacological interventions, particularly in the patient’s own home. We recognise the need for further such research and future trials to document the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for dementia such as the programme presented in the context of this case. As the work worldwide in the context of this structured approach to non-pharmacological dementia care is in developmental stages, and no trials are yet available, the observation and monitoring of outcomes on a case by case basis could provide a useful stepping stone to further development and rigorous trials in non-pharmacological dementia interventions.\n\n【62】### Learning points\n\n【63】*   A non-pharmacological intervention programme for symptoms of dementia implemented in the patient’s own home can help improve neuropsychiatric symptoms.\n\n【64】*   Education of family members and caregivers on dementia and practical, simple ways to implement daily reality orientation can help manage neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia.\n\n【65】*   Monitoring dementia programme outcomes should include parameters for both the patient and the caregivers in order to qualitatively and quantitatively measure behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, quality of life and caregiver burden and stress.\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Charles Young and Zara Quail for their editorial oversight and input.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【18】*   Mini-Mental State Examination. 23\n\n【19】*   Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. 24\n\n【20】*   Global Deterioration Scale/Functional Assessment Staging. 25–27\n\n【21】*   Geriatric Depression Scale. 28\n\n【22】*   Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living. 29", "content": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】More than 90% of people with dementia experience neuropsychiatric symptoms which are often distressing and can result in early institutionalisation, diminished quality of life, increased frequency of emergency department visits along with stress and ill-health in caregivers.

The care is paid for privately by the individual or their family.

The patient presented with memory deficits including loss of short-term memory based around handling of his finances, not knowing who his children were and what they were doing for him, and not recognising his wife whom at times he would mistake for his mother. He was becoming disorientated daily to place and directions and had been getting lost in his own neighbourhood. These memory symptoms were accompanied by episodes of significant suspicion focused mainly on his finances and as a result of his concerns, he would become very agitated and at times verbally and physically aggressive. He was experiencing auditory hallucinations in which he thought he heard his family talking about his finances. He was having persecutory delusions and accusing his son-in-law of stealing his pension, as well as trying to murder him. He would often physically and verbally attack his eldest daughter for not protecting him and would become agitated towards his wife for not supporting him. He also stopped engaging with his friends and neighbours and had stopped musical and gardening activities which he previously enjoyed.\n\n【11】The patient had no previously diagnosed chronic conditions, medical or psychiatric history and no known cardiovascular risk factors. He was not taking any regular medications prior to his diagnosis of dementia. In 2014, he was diagnosed with a mixed form of dementia (Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia), by his local physician who then prescribed donepezil, as well as Ginkgo Biloba and multivitamins. The patient was a non-smoker and drank no alcohol. He was formerly a teacher of chemistry and mathematics as well as a primary school principal. According to his family, he was of a very high intellect during his years of active teaching. He previously had hobbies such a listening to and playing music, and gardening.\n\n【12】The patient’s eldest daughter visited his apartment three times a week to provide some care support and was the main spokesperson for the family. His younger daughter worked overseas. The family had employed a male care worker to stay and care for the patient full time. After 10 days, the male care assistant resigned because of the stress of caring for the patient. The patient would consistently wake up during the night causing carer fatigue. The care assistant’s departure resulted in the need to employ a new care assistant. The patient’s wife had to be moved into a separate one bedroom flat in the same building due to her own significant and increasing medical care needs and to minimise disruption of her care.\n\n【13】In early April 2018, the family contacted our dementia service team requesting help in dealing with the patient’s worsening suspicion, agitation, aggression, disorientation and increased isolation. The family described that they felt a significant burden in caring for the patient and the related stress was having a negative impact on the patient’s relationship with family members.\n\n【14】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【15】At the time of diagnosis of mixed dementia in June 2014, there was no further formal cognitive screening, diagnostic imaging or pathology done to further confirm the diagnosis or stage of illness due to financial constraints and barriers to definitive dementia diagnosis in China. 删除9：<u>16–21 </u>It should be noted that our dementia service organisation does not conduct the dementia diagnosis process.

Along with the observed improvements in neuropsychiatric symptoms, there was no deterioration in the patient’s levels of dementia, depression, functionality and quality of life as displayed in the scores in table 3 . It was noted that the while the Global Deterioration Scale/Functional Assessment Staging system scores of 5 showed moderately severe cognitive decline for cognition due to the significance of his memory loss and moderate functional impairment in that the patient occasionally needed help selecting clothing; however, in terms of physical ability to complete activities of daily living, the patient was able to physically dress and groom himself independently and had no other impairments on the Barthel parameters resulting in the Barthel index score of 100.\n\n【50】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【51】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 2\n\n【52】Frequency of episodes of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia experienced by the patient</u>\n\n【53】删除6：<u>View this table:\n\n【54】删除12：<u>*   View inline\n*   View popup\n</u>\n</u>删除4：<u>Table 3\n\n【55】Results of relevant dementia, depression and quality of life scales in the patient over 8 months</u>\n\n【56】The QoL-AD was based on patient input with some caregiver input when required and we were surprised not to see the score improve despite the reduced frequency of the neuropsychiatric symptoms. A speculative reason for this could be based on the fact the quality of life assessment is primarily based on the person’s subjective opinion on their own intrinsic sense of well-being within physical health, mood, relationships, cognition, domestic life and tasks like financial management. It is possible that the patient’s perception of his life situation had not changed as he continued to receive support in managing daily life and he may not have recognised improvement in his neuropsychiatric symptoms in relation to his quality of life. In considering this aspect, we have recognised that for future cases, use of both the self-rated QoL-AD and proxy-rated QoL-AD questionnaire versions may be more able to demonstrate improvement in quality of life when taking into account both patient and family perspectives equally; however, it is has been noted that self-rated and proxy-rated questionnaires may not be inter-reliable for score levels. 删除9：<u>32</u>\n\n【57】An increase in socialisation with neighbours and the community was also noted. The patient’s relationships with family members have improved. His wife now comes down to have a meal with the patient every day and joins in with therapy sessions from time to time. The patient likes to chat with the neighbours and enjoyed attending a party held by ex-colleagues. So far, the second care assistant has been managing well for the last 3 months since his employment in August 2018. The family decided to stop the dementia service at the end of November 2018 because of the significant improvements in the patient’s neuropsychiatric symptoms and level of overall improvement. The family’s plan was to see what would happen thereafter under the family and care assistant’s care. As part of our usual approach to care in this situation, our team advised the patient’s family they would be available if the patient was to require the services in the programme again in the future.\n\n【58】Discussion\n----------\n\n【59】There are international efforts to promote the use of non-pharmacological interventions as first-line treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, 删除13：<u>3 9 33 </u>supported by a growing body of evidence for benefit. 删除9：<u>3 6 8–10 12 </u>However, most of the studies assessed focus on patients in long-term care facilities rather than community-based or home-based strategies. There have been some home-based intervention studies focused on potential triggers of patient behaviours and behaviour modification strategies, 删除13：<u>13 </u>interventions around environment and patient abilities, 删除13：<u>14 </u>and tailored activities, 删除13：<u>15 </u>which were delivered in person and telephonically by occupational therapists and nurse practitioners. 删除9：<u>13–15 </u>The studies were carried out over 16 weeks or 4 months of the applied intervention period during which there was a demonstrated reduction in the frequency of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and associated caregiver distress. 删除9：<u>13–15 </u>Models of care that focus on individualised approaches to promote self-determination have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. 删除9：<u>3 </u>With regards to the patient in this case report, we observed the reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms within 3 months of starting the programme, which would be in line with the expected time frame based on the noted studies. 删除9：<u>13–15 </u>The dementia service programme and interventions provided to the patient in this case report differ in that they are all delivered in person and can be delivered in resource-poor settings by other allied healthcare professionals such as social workers and healthcare assistants who receive relevant training. The programme has a multicomponent, structured approach which includes initial person-centred assessment on needs, environment and potential behaviour triggers; education of the family, caregivers and community on dementia care and management; and a personalised, one-on-one programme of selected non-pharmacological intervention sessions. We acknowledge that the observation of associated improved neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia in one patient without a control case does warrant speculation; however, these observations have prompted the initiation of further methodological research into this approach.\n\n【60】While clinically, there is a lack of available definitive testing and confirmation of dementia subtype in China, the programme of dementia services discussed in this case can be implemented for symptom-based management in resource-poor settings. This case demonstrates that using an individualised approach to implementing non-pharmacological interventions in the patient’s own home can have a noticeable associated improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. In turn, there was a related perceived improvement in family dynamics and caregiver stress based on verbal reports from the family and care assistant. At the time of this programme was provided to this patient, the team did not have any instruments in place to specifically measure caregiver burden. However, there was a daily behaviour record maintained and the social worker included in the service notes feedback from the family members and care assistant on how the changes were affecting them. The environment and stressors in the patient’s home had improved to such an extent that the wife who had previously had to move upstairs to a different flat due to the challenges posed by his neuropsychiatric symptoms, was able to move back downstairs to be with her husband again. However, it was a valuable lesson to learn at the time that we should monitor the caregiver burden both qualitatively and quantitatively. Subsequent to this case, our programmes now include instruments to measure caregiver stress and burden and additional tools to monitor behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.\n\n【61】With the anticipated increased burden of dementia on healthcare facilities and long-term care, 删除13：<u>34 35 </u>there is a crucial need for further trials and guidance on the effective implementation of non-pharmacological interventions, particularly in the patient’s own home. We recognise the need for further such research and future trials to document the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for dementia such as the programme presented in the context of this case. As the work worldwide in the context of this structured approach to non-pharmacological dementia care is in developmental stages, and no trials are yet available, the observation and monitoring of outcomes on a case by case basis could provide a useful stepping stone to further development and rigorous trials in non-pharmacological dementia interventions.\n\n【62】### Learning points\n\n【63】*   A non-pharmacological intervention programme for symptoms of dementia implemented in the patient’s own home can help improve neuropsychiatric symptoms.\n\n【64】*   Education of family members and caregivers on dementia and practical, simple ways to implement daily reality orientation can help manage neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia.\n\n【65】*   Monitoring dementia programme outcomes should include parameters for both the patient and the caregivers in order to qualitatively and quantitatively measure behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, quality of life and caregiver burden and stress.\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Charles Young and Zara Quail for their editorial oversight and input.</u>", "index": 9455, "show": true, "start": 9455, "end": 9710, "province": ["文本干净度", "页码/数字"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "句末的无关数字"}], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:32:54", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:42:11", "cost": 557.512}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:22", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:42:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:32:54"}

We describe the case of a 49-year-old woman, on immunsuppressive therapy for multiple sclerosis, who presented with a 3-month history of debilitating back pain. She had a recent episode of periodontitis, and was under regular dental review. Her MRI scan demonstrated findings suggestive of L2–L3 spondylodiscitis. Her CT-guided biopsy yielded negative cultures and the patient failed two courses of empirical antibiotic treatment. With clinical and radiological disease progression, she underwent a percutaneous disc washout and biopsy, which subsequently grew _F. nucleatum_ . Treatment with clindamycin and metronidazole was commenced orally for 6 weeks. She improved gradually, and at 1 year follow-up was asymptomatic. The diagnosis of spondylodiscitis caused by _F. nucleatum_ is challenging. The perseverance on identification by surgical biopsy, minimally invasive washout and targeted antibiotics are the mainstay of effective treatment.\n\n【2】删除12：<u>*   multiple sclerosis\n*   bone and joint infections\n*   dentistry and oral medicine\n</u>\n删除1：<u>http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-239664\n\n【3】Statistics from Altmetric.com\n-----------------------------</u>\n\n【4】删除12：<u>*   multiple sclerosis\n*   bone and joint infections\n*   dentistry and oral medicine\n</u>\nBackground\n----------\n\n【5】The last three decades have seen a significant increase in the incidence of pyogenic spondylodiscitis due to a number of multifactorial reasons—most importantly increased life expectancy, chronic diseases, rise in the prevalence of immunosuppressed patients, intravenous drug abuse and an increase in spinal surgery with instrumentation. 删除9：<u>1 </u>On the other hand, improved radiological investigative sensitivity and techniques with microbiological diagnoses contribute to greater accuracy. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>The common causative organisms of spontaneous pyogenic spondylodiscitis are _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Enterococci_ , _Streptococcus_ species and gram negative bacilli.

Patients with multiple sclerosis and more importantly, those on immunomodulators, are at a higher risk of developing a spinal infection, which may be caused by atypical pathogens spread haematogenously from the oral source. Such low-virulent organisms present a diagnostic challenge to clinicians and require a keen eye of suspicion, acknowledgement of dental history and more aggressive invasive methods of diagnosis and treatment with surgical biopsy and appropriate antibiotic therapy. We hereby present a rare case of _F. nucleatum_ spondylodiscitis in an immunosuppressed patient known to have multiple sclerosis with a background of chronic periodontitis.\n\n【8】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【9】A 49-year-old female patient was admitted to a medical ward in our hospital, with chest pain and severe back pain of mechanical nature. The pain was worse while mobilising, with a visual analogue score of 10/10. There was no neurological deficit and her bladder and bowel function was intact. Her body temperature was normal and the blood samples taken on admission showed normal white blood cells, normal liver and renal function; C reactive protein (CRP) was mildly raised to 48 mg/L (0–10 mg/L).\n\n【10】The patient had been diagnosed 8 years previously with multiple sclerosis and had been on dimethyl fumarate 240 mg two times per day (Tecfidera, Biogen, Cambridge, MA, USA) for many years, a disease modifying medication. Further, only 25 days earlier, she had been admitted to another hospital because of severe back pain and fever. The blood cultures taken at previous hospital were negative but her CRP was raised to more than 200 mg/L. An MRI of her lumbar spine showed an infective/inflammatory process involving the L2/L3 disc space . She was treated empirically with intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g once a day and 220 mg of gentamicin every other day. Her fever, degree of pain and inflammatory markers responded to the treatment. A new MRI before discharge from the previous hospital showed some improvement in the radiological appearance of her infective/inflammatory process and after 2 weeks of inpatient antibiotics she was discharged home with co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) 625 mg, three times a day.\n\n【11】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【12】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【13】(A) Sagittal T2 STIR 通用删除1(英):<u>(Short-TI Inversion Recovery)</u>-weighted sequence and (B) sagittal T1 sequence of the initial lumbar spine MRI performed at another hospital, showing mild involvement of the L2/3 disc space but significant prevertebral collection.</u>\n\n【14】As a result of the presence of her chest pain and shortness of breath, she was referred to the respiratory and cardiology teams in our hospital. An echocardiogram revealed of mild pericardial effusion of 0.4 cm but ruled out the presence of endocarditis. The cardiologists recommended 400 mg of ibuprofen three times a day. However, a lumbar MRI did confirm a worsening radiological picture of the L2/L3 disc space pathology and increased prevertebral collection  with a CRP of 16 mg/L. Her case was discussed with the spinal and microbiology teams and a CT-guided biopsy of L2/L3 disc space was recommended . Despite a good sample by a senior musculoskeletal radiologist, the result was negative for bacteria, fungi and _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ . Further, the histological examination did not reveal the presence of any infection (including granulomas).\n\n【15】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【16】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【17】(A) Sagittal T2 STIR通用删除1(英):<u>(Short-TI Inversion Recovery)</u>-weighted sequence and (B) sagittal T1 sequence of the lumbar spine MRI performed at our hospital before the CT-guided biopsy, showing an increase of the disc involvement as well as expansion of the infective process to the vertebral bodies.</u>\n\n【18】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【19】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【20】CT-guided biopsy showing optimal positioning of the needle in the involved area of the L2/L3 intervertebral disc.</u>\n\n【21】Subsequently, her clinical presentation did improve and she was sent home on ibuprofen as per the advice of the cardiologists without antibiotic therapy because of the lack of evidence of a confirmed infection and only a mildly raised level of CRP to 20 mg/L. Unfortunately, she re-presented 3 weeks later with worsening back pain and this time was admitted to our spinal unit. A new MRI scan showed progression of the L2/L3 spondylodiscitis with bone destruction, an increase in size of the prevertebral collection and bone marrow oedema involving the majority of the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies . Her CRP was markedly raised at 62 mg/L but her white cell count remained normal. This time the decision was to take a more aggressive approach with a percutaneous minimal invasive intervertebral disc biopsy at L2/L3 and washout. Before the procedure, the presence of endocarditis, lung and urinary tract infection or any recent traumatic/invasive procedure was ruled out. _F. nucleatum_ was isolated from the sample and to the patient was administrated clindamycin 450 mg oral four times a day and metronidazole 400 mg three times a day for 6 weeks orally.\n\n【22】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【23】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【24】(A) Sagittal T2 STIR通用删除1(英):<u>(Short-TI Inversion Recovery)</u>-weighted sequence and (B) axial T2 sequence of the preoperative MRI showing an increase in size of the intervertebral abscess and the involvement of almost the entire vertebral bodies of L2 and L3.</u>\n\n【25】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【26】The combination of the raised CRP value and the radiological investigations were crucial to understand the dynamics of the spinal low-grade infection. The progression from her initial MRI scan  performed in another hospital to the subsequent MRI  performed in our hospital confirmed disease progression but we believe that the administration of ibuprofen from the cardiologists kept her CRP levels down to 16 mg/L.\n\n【27】From the diagnostic point of view, biopsy is the gold standard procedure to obtain microbiological and histopathological diagnoses in spinal infections. In our opinion, the negative result after a technically correct CT-guided biopsy  was likely due to the recent usage of antibiotics as well as to the smaller amount of abscess which reduced bacterial load in the sample.\n\n【28】Fluoroscopic and CT-guided spinal biopsies have been shown to have comparable accuracy ranging from 16.1% to 92.3%. 删除9：<u>7 </u>This variability is probably related to multiple factors such as local anatomy, spinal level, operator experience, biopsy approaches and needle sizes as well as the timing and the accuracy of the microbiological workup. 删除9：<u>8 </u>In a very recent prospective study, the accuracy of spinal biopsy for fluoroscopic-guided spinal biopsy and CT-guided spinal biopsy for spinal infections was similar at 59% and 61%, respectively. 删除9：<u>9</u>\n\n【29】The last MRI scan before the surgical treatment scan showed bone destruction, an increase in size of the prevertebral collection progression  making the microbiological diagnosis mandatory and the surgical intervention inevitable in order to establish diagnosis and facilitate her treatment.\n\n【30】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【31】The presence of back pain with rapidly progressive radiological vertebral end-plate changes is highly suggestive of an infective process in the lumbar spine. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>The main differential diagnosis considerations are aseptic or necrotic changes, but rapid progression combined with the lack of chemotherapy or radiotherapy minimise such a possibility. Thus, the infective process was the main working diagnosis and our challenge was to obtain a good sample and to isolate the causative agent. The history of dental cleaning 4–5 weeks before the onset of the back pain, the negative blood cultures, the low levels of CRP and the fact that the patient had been on long-term immunomodulators and recently on ibuprofen highlighted the possibility of dealing with a rare microbial agent with low virulence, causing atypical spondylodiscitis and even pericardiditis.\n\n【32】Treatment\n---------\n\n【33】Our patient underwent a percutaneous minimal invasive intervertebral L2–L3 disc biopsy and disc washout.\n\n【34】Under general anaesthesia, the patient was placed prone on a radiolucent table and the C-arm fluoroscope was positioned to clearly identify the L2–L3 disc space. The discographic approach was used to percutaneously insert two Jamshidi biopsy needles, one either side, directed into the disc space . Care was taken to position both needles in the centre of the involved L2–L3 disc. A 20 mL luer lock syringe was attached to both the Jamshidi needles and used to aspirate the disc content sequentially. The aspirated sample, consisting of a white-yellowish colour high viscosity fluid, was sent for microbiological analysis. The aspirated disc material was sent for histological examination.\n\n【35】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【36】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 5\n\n【37】(A) Intraoperative C-arm imaging Antero-Posterior (AP) and (B) lateral projections showing good placement of the Jamshidi needles to the targeted lesion in both antero-posterior and lateral view. (C) Intraoperative picture with good positioning of the Jamshidi needles during the process of washout highlighting the different colours of the syringes due to the saline flow (right needle for injection of saline and left for aspiration).</u>\n\n【38】Following this, a new 20 mL syringe containing normal saline was attached to the Jamshidi needle on one side and an empty syringe on the opposite side. The disc was then washed out with normal saline solution from one needle, which was aspirated and collected in the empty syringe on the opposite side . The first 10 mL of saline disc washout was sent for an additional microbiological evaluation, and the remaining washout fluid was discarded. Interestingly, active suction with the empty syringe was not required as the injected saline pressure from one side filled up the empty syringe on the other side. This process was then repeated and reversed until the fluid ran clear and at least 500 mL of normal saline has been flushed through the disc space. The needles were withdrawn, the stab incisions were closed with 3–0 ethilon sutures and sterile dressings applied. There were no perioperative surgical complications.\n\n【39】This technique (not too dissimilar to a discography approach) can be performed under local anaesthesia or conscious sedation and is very cost effective as only a C-arm image intensifier and two Jamshidi needles are required. The access to the disc space through soft tissue provides more freedom and better positioning of the needle to the disc space, allowing debridement of the disc space and decrease of the bacterial load through the continuous washout. The aspiration on one side is performed while saline is injected from the opposite side. Further, the discographic approach avoids the penetration of the bone elements of the posterior arch and the spinal canal, reducing the risk of posterior spread of the infection and other complications. If considered appropriate, local antibiotics can be injected at the end of the procedure. Finally, this simple technique is technically less demanding and can be easily adapted to different hospital settings. 删除9：<u>10</u>\n\n【40】The microbiological samples isolated _F. nucleatum_ and based on the drug sensitivity patterns, with advice from the microbiology team, the patient was started on clindamycin 450 mg orally four times a day and metronidazole 400 mg orally three times a day for 6 weeks.\n\n【41】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【42】Immediately after the surgery, the patient’s pain improved by more than 50%. The CRP decreased to half its preoperative value 2 days after the procedure, and was back to normal at 2 weeks postoperatively. She was discharged from the hospital on oral antibiotics. She was subsequently seen regularly at 6 weeks, 删除13：<u>6 </u>months and a year after the procedure. Her symptoms gradually improved, with no back pain and her inflammatory markers all remained within the normal range throughout the course of treatment and follow-up. A follow-up MRI performed at the end of the 1 year follow-up  showed excellent resolution of the infection, with only a minimal residual marrow oedema; our patient was entirely asymptomatic and discharged from the spinal team.\n\n【43】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【44】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 6\n\n【45】(A) Sagittal T2 STIR通用删除1(英):<u>(Short-TI Inversion Recovery)</u>-weighted and (B) sagittal T1 sequence of the lumbar spine MRI performed one year postoperatively, showing excellent response with significant resolution of the reactive oedema and improvement of the infective process affecting the L2/L3 intervertebral disc.</u>\n\n【46】Discussion\n----------\n\n【47】We speculated that, during the process of professional dental cleaning, our patient sustained some bleeding from her gum and this most likely caused a temporary bacteremia, which was then propagated to a distant intervertebral space. In fact, her back pain started 4–5 weeks after the oral cleansing. Moreover, the patient suffered from a concomitant pericarditis and is not unlikely that, both her spondylodiscitis and pericarditis to have been caused by the same pathogen. The pericarditis caused by anaerobic bacteria is a rare but well-known entity with the first case of pericarditis caused by _Fusiform nucleatum_ reported by Truant _et al_ . 删除9：<u>11 12</u>\n\n【48】Our patient was on dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera, Biogen, USA), a pleiotropic immunomodulatory medication of the immune system. The main adverse effect is the reduction in the amount of lymphocytes, although only about 4% (1 in 25) of patients treated with Tecfidera develop a more serious drop in lymphocyte count, resulting in lymphopenia. The most serious adverse effect are progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and Fanconi syndrome, which are considered very rare. 删除9：<u>13 </u>Dimethyl fumarate which had not caused lymphopenia, but in any case was stopped after the suspicion of infection.\n\n【49】More than 700 bacterial species or phylotypes, of which over 50% have not been cultivated, have been detected in the oral cavity. 删除9：<u>14 </u>Among them, _Fusobacterium_ is a genus of anaerobic filamentous gram-negative rods that are members of the phylum _Fusobacteria_ .

Medical treatment remains the first-line management but the presence of neurological compromise with or without vertebral collapse and failure of conservative management are the two main indications for surgical treatment.\n\n【52】In the majority of cases, the treatment of the spondylodiscitis caused by _F. nucleatum_ is medical, with a combination of antibiotics. In only 4 out of 18 cases, the treatment was surgical with open surgery to drain the abscess and/or to stabilise the spine performed. 删除9：<u>16–18</u>\n\n【53】We preferred the minimal invasive percutaneous biopsy and washout because of several reasons. 删除9：<u>19 </u>First, the amount of the pus in the most recent MRI was greater, giving us a confidence in achieving a good representative sample. Second, in immunocompromised patients, a minimal access approach is advantageous to reduce the chances of postoperative complications associated with larger (open) surgeries. Finally, alongside the biopsy, we performed surgical irrigation and debridement in order to maximise the treatment.\n\n【54】### Learning points\n\n【55】*   _Fusobacterium nucleatum_ , although a normal commensal of oral flora, can cause pyogenic spondylodiscitis especially in susceptible immunocompromised population.\n\n【56】*   Taking an accurate history of oral hygiene and possible dentistry procedures is crucial when dealing with the possibility of distant infections such as spondylodiscitis and cardiac infections.\n\n【57】*   Accurate microbiological diagnosis and drug-sensitive antibiotic therapy are effective in treating infection in the absence of neurological symptoms.\n\n【58】*   CT-guided biopsy may be insufficient in providing adequate sample to isolate the pathogen and a low threshold for a surgical biopsy should be maintained. This enables an adequate sample for microbiological and histopathological diagnoses to be obtained, reduces the bacteriological load providing immediate postoperative relief of symptoms and improves the antibiotic penetration and efficacy.\n\n【59】*   The importance of a multidisciplinary team effort and awareness is highlighted. Dentists should be aware of the risk of haematogenous spread of commensal oral flora in patients suffering with periodontitis; neurologists should recognise the possibility of atypical distant systemic infections in patients with multiple sclerosis on immunomodulators; microbiologists should maintain a high index of suspicion for low-grade atypical infective pathogens and ensure adequate culture techniques are employed to isolate these organisms; lastly, spinal surgeons should persist in obtaining an accurate sample from the infective site, and in the presence of low-virulent infections, adopt a more aggressive approach with minimally invasive methods of percutaneous disc biopsy and washout.\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors are particularly grateful to Dr Vivienne Weston, consultant microbiologist and Dr Yuriy Arlachov, consultant radiologist for their crucial help throughout the treatment of this challenging case.

Diagnosing an obturator hernia clinically is a challenging one and nearly impossible. These hernias usually present as an intestinal obstruction as more than 50% of obturator hernias goes in for strangulation. Here, we report an unusual presentation of an obturator hernia in a 70-year-old woman who presented to emergency room with acute abdomen and uncomplicated reducible inguinal hernia. Radiological imaging showed obstructed inguinal hernia while on diagnostic laparoscopy, a strangulated and perforated obturator hernia of Richter’s type was seen in addition to an uncomplicated inguinal hernia. Obturator hernia, although very rare, is associated with high morbidity and mortality as it is often underdiagnosed as in our case.

Pain was severe, gripping in character and constant which was relieved partly on flexion of the thigh. No history of any medical illness nor any previous surgeries.

On further release, 1.5×1.0 cm defect was noted in the obturator canal with perforation of entrapped bowel loop of Richter’s type seen. Laparotomy was done and a 1 cm perforation in terminal ileum with unhealthy edges was noted 20 cm from ileocaecal junction as seen in figure 3 . Thorough lavage was given.

Orals were started on postoperative day 4 after good bowel sounds, escalated to soft solids and discharged on postoperative day 7. The patient was periodically followed up for a period of 1 year who remained asymptomatic.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Obturator hernia is the protrusion of abdominal viscera through obturator canal in which the obturator nerve and vessels pass. This hernia is about six to nine times more common in women than men due to their broader triangular pelvis and greater transverse diameter. It affects women of around 70–90 years of age, the reason being attributed to atrophy of the preperitoneal fat around the obturator vessels in the canal thereby predisposing hernia formation and hence the name ‘little old woman’s hernia’. 删除9：<u>3 </u>The major risk factors for obturator hernia are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic constipation and ascites. Diagnosing an obturator hernia at the earliest is very difficult as it usually presents with non-specific signs and symptoms. Although it is a rare abdominal hernia, the mortality rate is as high as 70%. Major clinical symptoms are due to intestinal obstruction like abdominal pain, distension, nausea, vomiting and constipation. They may also have recurrent attacks of intestinal obstruction in the past with or without a palpable mass in the groin. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【30】Emergency CT scanning could lead to rapid diagnosis and early surgical intervention and thus optimising the outcome. The use of CT scan in detecting obturator hernia was first reported by Meziane _et al_ in 1983. 删除9：<u>7 </u>The common CT scan finding is herniated loop of distal small bowel extending through the obturator foramen between the pectineus and obturator externus muscles. In incarcerated hernia, CT scan shows associated bowel loop dilatation in the abdomen. Since the use of CT scan, preoperative diagnosis rate was improved from 43% to 90% in some reports. 删除9：<u>8 </u>However, it is not always possible to diagnose all obturator hernias using CT of the abdomen as seen in our case. Diagnostic laparoscopy serves as a tool in diagnosing and treating occult, suspected and missed obturator hernias on imaging. In our institution, we routinely practice and advocate laparoscopic method for uncomplicated groin hernias including suspected obturator hernias without bowel complications due to advantages like diagnostic accuracy of occult hernias, lesser postoperative pain and other complications. But in this case scenario, due to perforated ileum with peritonitis on laparoscopy and the need for resection and anastomosis, we converted to open surgical approach. Open approach with lower midline is considered the most preferred by many authors as it gives good exposure to the obturator ring and also aids in performing bowel resections when required. 删除9：<u>9 </u>In view of peritonitis in this case, mesh (non-absorbable or absorbable) was not employed for further reinforcement as non-absorbable meshes have higher chances of mesh rejection and absorbable meshes can get dissolved in the presence of bacterial infection.\n\n【31】### Learning points\n\n【32】*   Obturator hernia, although very rare, is associated with high morbidity and mortality.\n\n【33】*   It is often underdiagnosed as in our case; the preoperative finding of hernia was because of the inguinal hernia with no bowel obstruction and it was an obturator hernia which did not show up clinically was strangulated with a perforated bowel of Richter’s type within it. The same could have been easily missed if an inguinal approach had been followed. Laparoscopy bailed us out from missing out a perforation from an occult obturator hernia.\n\n【34】*   Laparoscopy should be considered as a tool of choice in cases of an occult obturator hernia and unclear hernias arising from the myopectineal orifice of Fruchaud.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:23:02", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:23:15", "cost": 13.506}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:22", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:23:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:23:02"}

No complications from the surgery or treatment were noted at follow-up appointments 3 years after the surgery, and the patient was able to return to work following the procedure.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】AGCTT are rare neoplasms that are not commonly found in the medical literature. The first case of AGCTT was reported by Laskowski in 1952. 删除9：<u>6 </u>One of the first literature reviews of AGCTT cases occurred in 2014, when 32 unique AGCTT cases were recorded by Cornejo and Young. 删除9：<u>8 </u>After this literature review, more instances of AGCTT were published and in 2020, Grogg _et al_ found 73 well-documented cases of AGCTT. 删除9：<u>5 </u>This growth in the reported number of AGCTT cases can be attributed to the lower misclassification rate of AGCTT due to increased medical knowledge, the addition of immunohistochemical markers and an increase in publication mediums through which new instances of the tumours can be documented. 删除9：<u>6</u>\n\n【31】The patient discussed in this case report is in his late 20s and is younger than many of the patients found in the previous literature. Age is of considerable importance in the study of AGCTT, and a recent review by Grogg _et al_ found the mean age at the time of diagnosis to be 42 years (±19 SD). 删除9：<u>5 </u>Among recorded cases, the youngest patient to be diagnosed with AGCTT presented to the hospital, in early adolescence, after a 5-year history of left scrotal mass enlargement. 删除9：<u>9 </u>However, the majority of AGCTT presented later in adulthood with the oldest recorded patient diagnosed at the age of 87. 删除9：<u>8 </u>Among the 91 AGCTT cases examined by Dieckmann _et al_ , only 26 patients presented with AGCTT before the age of 30. Furthermore, of these 26 patients, only 14 patients have recorded documented follow-up visits. 删除9：<u>6 </u>Thus, this case advances knowledge regarding AGCTT cases in younger patients with documented follow-ups.\n\n【32】The differentiation of metastatic and nonmetastatic AGCTT cases has proved challenging due to the rarity of recorded literature about metastatic tumors. Grogg _et al_ showed that the majority of recorded AGCTTs were non-metastatic (66/73, 90%), while the remaining cases were identified as metastatic (7/63, 10%). 删除9：<u>5 </u>Of these cases, the mean age of diagnosis for non-metastatic AGCTT patients was 42 years (±19 SD), and the mean age of diagnosis for metastatic AGCTT patients was 45 years (± 14 SD). 删除9：<u>5 </u>Of the metastatic AGCTT tumours in literature, the longest duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 8 years, and the shortest time frame was 7 months. 删除9：<u>10 11 </u>Additionally, AGCTT tumours have presented as incidental findings following metastatic spread to the liver, bones and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. 删除9：<u>5 </u>For non-metastatic tumours, the longest recorded time frame of symptoms before diagnosis was approximately 37 years with the shortest duration after just 2 weeks of pain. 删除9：<u>12 13 </u>As of now, age has not been found to be a predictive variable for differentiation between benign and metastatic AGCTT, and this case can be used to bolster existing cases regarding non-metastatic tumours.\n\n【33】Another possible differentiator between metastatic and non-metastatic tumours is the size of the tumour. Grogg _et al_ found metastatic tumours are usually larger than non-metastatic tumours. The metastatic tumours had a median size of 70 mm (IQR 51–90 mm) compared with non-metastatic tumours, with median size of 24 mm (IQR 14–42 mm). 删除9：<u>5 </u>The tumour described in this case measured 23×15×15 mm, bolstering the existing literature suggesting that a smaller mass may indicate non-metastatic disease. 删除9：<u>5</u>\n\n【34】Additionally, among the AGCTT cases identified by Grogg _et al_ , only 41 of the 73 cases had summaries of the various clinical presentations of the disease. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Of these recorded cases, testicular enlargement was the most common symptom (21/41, 51%) followed by a palpable testicular mass (15/41, 37%) and scrotal pain (6/41, 15%). 删除9：<u>5 </u>In this case, the patient presented with a testicular mass, but he also experienced pressure during urination, in addition to left abdominal, back and scrotal pain, which is relatively uncommon among recorded cases. Few recorded cases of AGCTT have presented with abdominal or back pain, and we hope this case draws attention to these uncommon symptoms.\n\n【35】After treatment with a radical orchiectomy—the intervention most used in cases analysed by Grogg _et al_ (68/73, 93%)—histological analysis of the tumour revealed findings consistent with the previous literature. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Like other non-metastatic AGCTT tumours, this case contained a solid growth pattern with occasional microfollicular (Call-Exner bodies) and palisading patterns. Characteristic of this particular tumour, nuclear grooves imparting what is often referred to as ‘coffee bean-like’ tumour cells were apparent. 删除9：<u>7 </u>Inhibin A has been shown to be the best marker to establish a tumour as a sex cord–stromal tumour, which was positive in this case. 删除9：<u>14</u>\n\n【36】Furthermore, ruling out a GCT with germ cell markers such as OCT3/4 or SALL4 can be helpful in the immunohistochemical workup. 删除9：<u>14 </u>Ultimately, with this staining pattern, the differential diagnosis includes other sex cord–stromal tumours. However, these can be ruled out based on epidemiological factors and histopathological features. For example, a juvenile granulosa cell tumour most commonly occurs in patients under 6 months of age and lacks nuclear grooves and a microfollicular pattern. In addition, a Leydig cell tumour classically contains tumour cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and enlarged nuclei with prominent nucleoli while also lacking nuclear grooves and a microfollicular pattern. Finally, Sertoli cell tumours are characterised by the presence of well-formed tubules, a pattern that is not seen in AGCTT; however, occasional nuclear grooves may be present. Ultimately, proper morphological and immunohistochemical evaluation should produce an accurate diagnosis in most cases.\n\n【37】The rarity of AGCTT cases increases the complexity of diagnosis in a clinical setting, and this case highlights the common and uncommon features of this presentation of AGCTT. Many cases that have been previously presented do not provide the in-depth clinical descriptions and symptoms that are needed to advance the knowledge of AGCTT. Most of the cases reported in the literature do not metastasise; however, there are limited data to accurately predict the clinical course based on clinical and pathological features.

She reported difficulty in clenching her fists and was unable to wear her wristwatch or shoes because of oedema. She also experienced paroxysmal urticaria in the distal extremities, including the palms and soles, and mild weight gain. She denied fever, facial oedema, exertional dyspnoea and arthralgia. She had no personal or family history of hereditary angioedema or any allergic diseases and was receiving no medications. Physical examination revealed symmetrical, non-pitting oedema in both hands and lower legs . There was no facial swelling. An examination denied any skin rash. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory findings revealed an elevated white blood cell count (13.9 ×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with 47% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count, 6533 /µL) and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase value of 257 (reference range: 124–222) IU/L. Serum IgM and IgE, liver enzymes, urinalysis, serum complement and serum vitamin B12 level were normal. An ECG, X-ray of the chest and serum cardiac troponin were normal. Nephrotic syndrome, thyroid disease and parvovirus B19 infection were ruled out. Based on these findings, non-episodic angioedema associated with eosinophilia (NEAE) was clinically diagnosed. Her symptoms spontaneously improved without treatment, and her oedema almost completely resolved 2 weeks after her first visit .

The prevalence of NEAE remains unknown although at least 100 cases have been reported mostly in women from Japan, Korea and Thailand. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Although the precise pathophysiology remains unknown, NEAE is thought to stem from an aberrant immune response to some exogenous stimulus, such as an infection, environmental factor, genetic susceptibility or the influence of sex hormones. 删除9：<u>2 </u>Several cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin 5, thymus-regulated and activation-regulated chemokine/C-C motif chemokine ligand-17, tumour necrosis factor-a and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are involved in generating the symptoms. 删除9：<u>3</u>\n\n【8】NEAE can usually be diagnosed clinically despite the absence of established diagnostic criteria because its clinical features are quite characteristic. The oedema is usually non-pitting and occurs only from the wrists and knees down, and the eosinophilia is usually severe despite the patient’s good general health.\n\n【9】NEAE resembles EAE in some respects, including having a predominantly peripheral distribution, eosinophilia and a benign prognosis without internal organ involvement. 删除9：<u>1 4 </u>However, there is a crucial difference between the two conditions; while EAE frequently recurs and usually requires steroid therapy, patients with NEAE usually experience only a single episode, which frequently remits spontaneously within a few weeks to months without specific therapy despite the severe type possibly requiring low-dose steroid or antihistamine therapy. 删除9：<u>1 5 </u>Therefore, distinguishing the two conditions is of value. Several characteristics are helpful in distinguishing NEAE from EAE: first, NEAE occurs predominantly in young women of East Asian descent 2–6 ; second, NEAE has no facial involvement and almost always shows a normal serum IgM level 4 5 ; and third, about half of patients with NEAE experience transient arthralgia, whereas no patients with EAE do. 删除9：<u>5 </u>Moreover, around 70% of reported cases of NEAE, including the present case, occurred in the autumn, a potentially useful diagnostic clue whose pathological significance, if any, remains unknown. 删除9：<u>5</u>\n\n【10】### Learning points\n\n【11】*   A young, Asian woman with acute-onset peripheral oedema, marked eosinophilia without internal organ involvement and normal serum IgM levels should have a high index of suspicion for non-episodic angioedema associated with eosinophilia (NEAE).\n\n【12】*   When NEAE is suspected, patients should be closely observed without treatment to avoid using potentially harmful steroid therapy.\n\n【13】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【14】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【15】Consent obtained directly from patient(s)\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank James R.

While secondary osteomyelitis of the sternum is most commonly seen as a complication after a surgical intervention or trauma, primary osteomyelitis of the sternum occurs secondary to bacteraemia. Intravenous drug abuse, diabetes mellitus or immune deficiency are known predisposing factors. 删除9：<u>1 2 </u>Most commonly, primary osteomyelitis is caused by a single pathogen, and _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ being the most common pathogens. 删除9：<u>3 4 </u>Only a limited number of case reports have reported about particular osteomyelitis due to _Parvimonas micra_ , for example, in the distal phalanx of the thumb 5 or hip joint, 删除13：<u>6 </u>but no article has been found about osteomyelitis of the sternum caused by _P. micra_ or _Campylobacter rectus_ .\n\n【8】_P. micra_ are anaerobic, gram-positive cocci, formerly described as _Peptostreptococcus micros_ and _Micromonas micros_ . 7 _P. micra_ has been associated with meningitis, 删除13：<u>8 </u>cervical and brain abscess, 删除13：<u>9 10 </u>spondylodiscitis 11 as well as endocarditis 12 and native joint infections. 删除9：<u>13 </u>In 2018, van Duijvenbode _et al_ performed a systematic review where four cases of spondylitis and nine cases of spondylodiscitis were identified. 删除9：<u>14</u>\n\n【9】_C. rectus_ is also a member of the oral flora. 删除9：<u>15 </u>An investigation of selected bacterial species in endoperiodontal lesions, performed in 2012 by Didilescou _et al_ , revealed extremely high bacterial loads in endodontic samples for _P. micra_ together with _C. rectus_ . 16 17 _C. rectus_ is a straight, non-spore forming and motile gram-negative rod, which has first been described in 1981 as _Wolinella recta_ . 删除9：<u>15 </u>In 1991, the organism was transferred to the genus _Campylobacter_ based on phylogenetic studies. 删除9：<u>18 </u>Invasive infections with _C. rectus_ have rarely been reported in the literature, and to our knowledge, only one case of clival osteomyelitis has been noted so far. 删除9：<u>19 </u>One fatal case of thoracic empyema involving _C. rectus_ is reported. 删除9：<u>20 </u>Although little is known in regard to pathogenic potential of _C. rectus_ , dental caries, periodontitis, poor oral hygiene or malignancies have been identified as predisposing factors of invasive _C. rectus_ infections. 删除9：<u>18 21</u>\n\n【10】To our knowledge, no similar case report of osteomyelitis of the sternum caused by _P. micra_ or _C. rectus_ has been described in literature before. Therefore, we hereby present a rare case of destructive osteomyelitis of the sternum caused by _P. micra_ and _C. rectus_ infection; both are members of the oral flora and associated with chronic periodontitis.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A female patient in her mid-40s presented to the emergency department (ED) of a regional hospital in Switzerland due to a spontaneous rupture of an abscess located on the mid-frontal chest wall. The patient was of Tanzanian origin and had lived in Switzerland for the past 30 years. Medical history was unremarkable. The patient did not take any medication. Due to good health, the patient rarely visited her general practitioner. No regular check-ups were performed in the last decade.\n\n【13】Detail history taking revealed that the patient had noticed a progressive swelling of the chest wall over the past 4 weeks. Furthermore, the patient experienced some general discomfort and loss of appetite. She did not notice any fever, and the pain was bearable without taking any painkillers or had the need to seek medical help. At the day of presentation, the abscess ruptured spontaneously with discharge of a remarkable amount of pus, which is why the patient visited the ED.\n\n【14】At the time of ED presentation, the patient had no fever (36.3°C). The blood pressure was within the normal range (137/92 mm Hg), but mild tachycardia was noted (113 beats per minute). Physical examination revealed a significant swelling of 20×10 cm on the chest wall reaching from the processus xyphoideus up to the upper border of the sternum. Under the left clavicle, the abscess had perforated the skin with discharge of bad-smelling purulent fluid and blood . The remaining examination was unremarkable. There were no signs of intravenous drug abuse. No entry point of infection could be determined on physical examination.\n\n【15】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【16】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 1\n\n【17】Patient on emergency department presentation.</u>\n\n【18】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【19】Laboratory testing showed elevated C reactive protein (CRP) levels (402 mg/L, normal range <10 mg/L), elevated white cell count (15.4 G/L; normal range 4.5–10.5 G/L), elevated thrombocyte count (429 G/L; normal range 150–350 G/L) and slightly elevated serum creatinine (102 µmol/L; normal range 46–92 µmol/L). Measured procalcitonin also was significantly elevated (44 µg/L; normal range <0.1 µg/L).\n\n【20】CT was performed to assess the extent of the abscess formation of the chest wall . Imaging revealed osteomyelitic erosion of the sternum with abscess formation reaching from the processus xyphoideus of the sternum up to the left side of the glandula thyreoidea, compromising the sternoicleidomastoid muscle. The abscess measured 20×13.5 cm. No abscess formation was seen in the intrathoracic or mediastinal space.\n\n【21】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【22】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 2\n\n【23】CT scan of the abscess at the level of the neck.</u>\n\n【24】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【25】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 3\n\n【26】CT scan of the abscess at the level of the sternoclavicular joint.</u>\n\n【27】Cultures of the blood were asserted, and the patient was referred to prompt surgical debridement where diagnostic investigation was completed by taking deep tissue and blood samples for microbiological assessment. In cultures taken from the sternal bone tissue and deep tissue, _P. micra_ and _C. rectus_ were isolated. There were no antimicrobial resistances reported neither to _P. micra_ nor to _C. rectus_ . Mycobacterial cultures were negative.\n\n【28】Since _P. micra_ and _C. rectus_ are both members of the oral flora, a dental origin of infection was considered. The patient reported to not have seen a dentist for more than 10 years, while dental hygiene seemed rather poor. Our patient therefore was referred to the dental department where a chronic periodontitis was diagnosed. Tooth 47 was not vital, and loss of previous cavity occlusion was reported in tooth 36. Remaining dental examination remained unremarkable.\n\n【29】In conclusion, the patient was diagnosed with primary osteomyelitis of the sternum with abscess formation most likely due to chronic periodontitis.\n\n【30】Differential diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【31】Primary osteomyelitis of the sternum is rare. In literature intravenous drug abuse, diabetes mellitus or immune deficiency is described as predisposing factors. However, our patient appeared to be previously healthy. Anamnesis and clinical examination did not reveal any indication of intravenous drug abuse. HbA1c was normal, underlying diabetes mellitus could be therefore excluded. An underlying immunodeficiency such as HIV-infection could be excluded by serological testing, and our patient did not take any immunosuppressive medication.\n\n【32】The patient was of Tanzanian origin and had lived in Switzerland for more than 30 years. Her last visit to Tanzania dated back to 7 years. On presentation, an extrapulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis could not be excluded. However, cultures on mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as PCR testing were repeatedly negative.\n\n【33】A malignant cause of bone manifestation with secondary infection was considered; however, a primary tumour could not be detected on CT scans, and a gynaecological examination including Papanicolaou-test remained normal. The patient refused a gastroscopic and colonoscopic examination. The collected samples from the sternum did not show any malignancies, and due to good response on antibiotic treatment and detection of pathogenic bacteria, a malignant cause of the sternal lesion was considered highly unlikely.\n\n【34】In our case, detection of microorganisms belonging to the oral flora was the crucial factor in finding a dental entrance point. However, a thorough oral examination took place only after receiving the indicative microbiological test results.\n\n【35】Treatment\n---------\n\n【36】Emergent treatment with extensive surgical debridement was performed, and empiric antibiotic treatment was initiated with piperacillin/tazobactam after surgery. Already after 24 hours of treatment, CRP levels were decreasing notably, so antibiotic treatment was de-escalated to clindamycine and doxycycline. After blood and deep tissue cultures revealed infection with _P. micra_ and _C. rectus,_ antibiotic treatment was adjusted to co-amoxicillin. The patient furthermore underwent sequential surgical debridement with vacuum-assisted closure therapy and finally with split-skin grafting .\n\n【37】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【38】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 4\n\n【39】Intraoperative image following surgical resection.</u>\n\n【40】删除2：<u><img/>\n\n【41】删除12：<u>*   Download figure\n*   Open in new tab\n*   Download powerpoint\n</u>\n</u>\n删除3：<u>Figure 5\n\n【42】Four weeks postoperative following split-skin grafting.</u>\n\n【43】Outcome and follow-up\n---------------------\n\n【44】The patient made a quick recovery with normalisation of blood parameters and well-healing wound of the chest wall. Four weeks after hospital admission, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation centre and returned home 2 weeks later. On discharge, the patient did not need any further pain medication.\n\n【45】The patient was followed up in the outpatient clinic for infectious diseases . She reported a full recovery with no remaining complaints. Antibiotic therapy was planed to be continued for an overall period of 6 weeks according to the guidelines of antibiotic treatment of osteomyelitis. 删除9：<u>22 23 </u>Due to a delay in follow-up visits, the antibiotic therapy was continued for an overall period of 8 weeks and thereafter could be stopped.\n\n【46】To prevent further infections, periodontitis treatment including plaque removal and surgical pocket removal was recommended by our in-house dentists. Furthermore, extraction of the non-vital tooth 47 was indicated just as restoration of the lost cavity occlusion restoration of tooth 36. The patient preferred to perform the dental procedures at her own dentist. Therefore, the patient finally was discharged to further follow-up appointments at her own general practitioner and dental treatment at her own dentist. During a consultation 6 months after discharge, patient reported good health with no remaining deficits.\n\n【47】Discussion\n----------\n\n【48】Invasive infections, especially osteomyelitis, with _P. micra_ as well as _C. rectus_ are rare. 删除9：<u>5 15 19 </u>In our patient, diagnosis could be confirmed by growth in standard cultures of the sternum as well as in standard cultures from the surrounding tissue. However, the detection of _P. micra_ as well as _C. rectus_ in the standard media is difficult, 删除13：<u>24 </u>but nevertheless, _P. micra_ was identified in standard cultures.\n\n【49】In August 2020, a systematic literature review of _P. micra_ in spondylodiscitis identified 16 cases. 删除9：<u>12 </u>In 50% of all cases, a dental cause or preceding dental was reported. 删除9：<u>12 </u>Another systematic review also published in August 2020 could show that _P. micra_ bacteraemia was associated with spondylodiscitis, oropharyngeal infection, abdominal abscess and septic pulmonary emboli. 删除9：<u>25 </u>However, sternal osteomyelitis was not reported. 删除9：<u>25</u>\n\n【50】A systematic literature review published in July 2021 on invasive infections with _C. rectus_ revealed 20 cases, and no case showed a sternal osteomyelitis. 删除9：<u>26 </u>In 55% of all patients, dental health issues were documented as the aetiology of infections. 删除9：<u>26 </u>Furthermore, in 2007, a large study performed in southern Finland detected _C. rectus_ in 31.3% of healthy adults, supporting the theory of dental origin of infection with _C. rectus_ . 删除9：<u>16</u>\n\n【51】In our patient, the poor oral status was not documented at admission. In clinical practice, an oral focus may be missed, especially in the acute setting of the ED, where the primary focus lies on haemodynamic and respiratory stabilisation of the patient. Only after identification of _P. micra_ or _C. rectus,_ an oral focus was considered, which highlights the importance of pathogen identification to guide adequate treatment. It also shows how important it is, despite overcrowded ED, to perform a complete physical examination, including oral examination. This is also the only way to be sure not to miss an infectious focus, leaving us here to emphasise above all the importance and necessity of a complete physical examination.\n\n【52】Concerning treatment, _P. micra_ is highly susceptible to antibiotics, and some studies showed only low rates of antimicrobial resistance. 删除9：<u>27 28 </u>Murdoch _et al_ found _P. micra_ to be most susceptible to penicillin, followed by metronidazole and clindamycin. 删除9：<u>29 </u>There is few literature on antibiotic treatment of _C. rectus,_ so far, no beta-lactamase activity has been described and other than oxifloxacin, _C. rectus_ appears to be sensitive to antibiotic treatment. 删除9：<u>22 29 30 </u>The culture results in this case report did not show any antimicrobial resistances too, so that antibiotic therapy with the usual drugs could be prescribed. In overall, the prognosis of _P. micra_ and _C. rectus_ infections are good following an appropriate treatment. 删除9：<u>25</u>\n\n【53】In conclusion, the high susceptibility to antibiotics and good prognosis would suggest that identification of the pathogen is not obligatory for accurate and resistance-oriented treatment. However, to prevent recurrence of infection, the surgical removal of infection focus is critical, as delay in treatment is associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality.\n\n【54】### Learning points\n\n【55】*   _Parvimonas micra_ and _Campylobacter rectus_ are both members of the oral microbiotic flora. Systemic infection is rare, however possible.\n\n【56】*   Since both bacterial strains are associated with chronic periodontitis, a dental focus should be considered in case of identification in systemic infections.\n\n【57】*   _Parvimonas micra_ and _Campylobacter rectus_ are highly susceptible to antibiotic treatment. To prevent recurrence of infection, identification and surgical removal of the source of infection is however critical.\n\n【58】删除5：<u>Ethics statements\n-----------------\n\n【59】### Patient consent for publication\n\n【60】Consent obtained directly from patient(s).\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We are grateful to H Notter, MD, M Valletti, MD and F Porchet who took care of the patient in the regional hospital, prior to referral to the University Hospital Zurich.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "bmj_case", "batch_name": "20240416", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/23 11:31:13", "endTime": "2024/09/23 11:31:49", "cost": 36.551}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:22", "update_time": "2024-09-22 19:31:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-22 19:31:12"}
