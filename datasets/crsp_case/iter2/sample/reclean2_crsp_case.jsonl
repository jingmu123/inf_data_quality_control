Her history was notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and a transient ischemic attack 3 years previously. Her current (>12 months) medications included acetylsalicylic acid, candesartan, nifedipine, rosuvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. She did not mention any weight loss, symptoms of hyperthyroidism, Cushing syndrome, pheochromocytoma, or any previous history of paresis or fatigue. She did not have a personal or family history of renal disease, endocrine disorders, chewing tobacco, and prescribed/over the counter, natural, or herbal medications. She had no history of drug abuse, alcohol, or laxatives, and she had no risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus. Clinical examination revealed left superior arm paresis (M4 on all left superior arm mussels, including flexion and extension of the fingers), hypertension (160/70 mm Hg), and minimal lower limb non-pitting edema. ECG showed a bigeminal rhythm, right bundle branch block, U waves, inversion of T waves, and long QT (Bazett, 492 ms). Laboratory investigations showed hypokalemia (<1.5 mmol/L, normal: 3.6–4.6), hypernatremia (145 mmol/L, normal: 136–144), hypophosphatemia (0.42 mmol/L, normal: 0.8–1.5), and acute renal failure (creatinine 115 micromol/L, normal: creatinin (normal: 62–106 in men, 44–80 in women), glomerular filtration rate 38 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, normal: >60) with elevation of creatine kinase (2371 U/L, normal: 33–187). Arterial blood gas showed a metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.5, normal: 7.34–7.43, bicarbonates 41.5 mmol/L, normal: 21–28). Spot urine test showed renal loss of potassium (potassium 42.7 mmol/L, sodium 61 mmol/L, chloride 67 mmol/L). She was treated with intravenous potassium and magnesium and rapidly transferred to the intermediate care unit. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography showed no cerebral anomalies.\n\nBased on these findings, we suspected hyperaldosteronism. She had no symptoms of pheochromocytoma or Cushing syndrome. Serum cortisol and thyroid function test results were normal. Any renal stenosis was observed. Primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism were excluded on low plasmatic renin (supine position 0.1 ng/mL/h, normal: 0.2–2.8), and low aldosterone (supine position 18 pg/mL, normal: 42–202). Finally, she reported drinking 4 to 5 cups of licorice tea per day, constituting an intake of more than 400 mg (glycyrrhetinic acid) per day, for 1 month. She was the only member of the family to drink licorice infusion, and symptoms appeared only after licorice consumption. Fatigue and loss of appetite were progressive (1–2 weeks) in contrast to left hand paresis (only by 48 hours). The new licorice consumption in a patient already receiving thiazide treatment (>12 months), with low renin and aldosterone plasma levels, suggests a more important role of glycyrrhetinic acid than diuretics. Based on the hypothesis of pseudo-hyperaldosteronism secondary to licorice consumption, perhaps precipitated by concomitant thiazide diuretics, spironolactone was initiated. Potassium, sodium, and magnesium became normal after 3 days of treatment and left superior arm paresis disappeared on the same day. Her ECG returned to normal (sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block), with disappearance of initial abnormalities 通用删除1(英):<u>(bigeminal rhythm, U waves, inversion T waves, and normalization of QT interval)</u> on day 5. The patient was then discharged from the intermediate care unit and transferred to a rehabilitation center to prepare for a safe return home. Discharge medications were the usual patient treatment (acetylsalicylic acid, candesartan, nifedipine, and rosuvastatin) and spironolactone, without hydrochlorothiazide. No similar episodes were observed during the follow-up period (4 weeks).\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThis report presents an impressive case of pseudo-hyperaldosteronism secondary to licorice consumption, complicated by ECG abnormalities and paresis, correlated with hypokalemia and rhabdomyolysis. Licorice is widely used as a medicinal herb,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> without side effects.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> It is an old remedy used by Egyptians, and there are numerous licorice-containing products that are readily available in everyday use (snacks, toffee bars, blackcurrant, cakes, chewing gums, drinks, Belgian beers, pastis, and tobacco flavoring/sweetening agents).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Hypokalemia induced by licorice can present with many situations, such as hypertensive crisis,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> paralysis,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> and hypernatremia with increased fluid volume.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> The true incidence of relevant hypokalemia causing myopathy and arrhythmia in subjects with long-term intake is unknown. Glycyrrhizin toxicity can be observed even with small amounts ingested, and several factors (prolonged gastrointestinal transit time, old age, female sex) could contribute to increased sensitivity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Renal mineralocorticoid receptors bind aldosterone and cortisol, the latter of which is normally limited to hormonally inactive cortisone by the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11-beta-HSD2). Glycyrrhetinic acid, the main active component of licorice, is converted to 3-monoglucuronyl-18-glycyrrhetinic acid and 18-glycyrrhetinic acid,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> which inhibits 11-beta-HSD2. This increases cortisol levels, creating elevated activation of renal mineralocorticoid receptors, causing an excess of mineralocorticoid effect. Plasma renin and aldosterone levels are normally suppressed by negative feedback regulation. Some authors have also suggested inter-individual variability in 11-beta-HSD2 activity (genetic polymorphism). The European Scientific Committee on Food advises that a safe daily intake of glycyrrhizin should not be >10 mg daily, and that regular intake of 100 mg daily has potential health hazards.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Our patient consumed 4 to 5 cups of licorice tea per day, resulting in more than 400 mg (glycyrrhetinic acid) per day, for 1 month. Although products are required to carry a warning, the exact quantities may be difficult to estimate. Thiazide diuretics can precipitate hypokalemia via disruption of the natrium/chloride co-transporter in the distal tubule, leading to increased sodium infiltrate and sodium reabsorption distally via natrium-kalium/hydrogen transporters, resulting in urinary loss of kalium.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Treatment consists of avoiding licorice and correcting electrolyte disorders. Because of the physiological role of cortisol (activation of renal mineralocorticoid system results in potassium loss) and few data regarding the effect on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, which appears to be fully reversible (recovery time is highly variable from days to weeks<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u></a></sup>), potassium-sparing diuretics are frequently introduced for their mineralocorticoid antagonism, resulting in increasing and stabilization of the serum concentration of potassium. As shown by other authors,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> severe hypokalemia can cause paralysis. The absence of anomalies on cerebral imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography), the normalization of ECG abnormalities and clinical presentation after potassium correction, and the confirmation of pseudo-hyperaldosteronism by plasma renin and aldosterone levels confirmed the role of licorice in our patient. Pseudo-hyperaldosteronism secondary to licorice ingestion is well-known, but often under-diagnosed, causing possible fatal outcomes. Intoxication should be considered in any patient with unexplained hypokalemia.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nJS: critical revision of the article.\n\nLB: conception of the work, data collection, drafting of the article\n\nTP: data analysis and interpretation, critical revision of the article</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:21:40", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:22:40", "cost": 60.326}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:20", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:22:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:21:39"}

Anesthetic management in these patients present unique challenges such as recognizing and managing cardiovascular instability. The manifestations of cardiovascular instability in paraplegic patients may be classified into 3 categories:\n\n*   1\\. hypertension, associated with autonomic hyperreflexia\n*   2\\. arrhythmias, and\n*   3\\. hypotension.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup>\n\nAutonomic hyperreflexia is the most dangerous and life-threatening complication in patients with paraplegia, occurring in 83.87% of patients with myelopathy of T6 or higher.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Autonomic hyperreflexia is characterized by the presence of hypertension, severe headache, bradycardia, sweating, congestion of nasal mucosa, and flushing, with the most severe outcomes resulting in cerebral hemorrhage and even death.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Autonomic hyperreflexia should be recognized and managed successfully during the surgery.\n\nThe FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup> system is a pulse contour analysis device for continuous cardiac output (CO) monitoring. The FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup> system monitoring is used to maintain hemodynamics and cardiovascular stability. Here we report a case of a paraplegic woman who underwent general anesthesia for a cesarean section under FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup> system monitoring.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 33-year-old paraplegic woman (G1 P0) was scheduled for an elective cesarean section, in the 38th week of gestation. Previous history included a surgical treatment for spinal cord bulge at the neck-chest junction in 2009. More than a year after that surgery, she gradually developed numbness in both the lower extremities, resulting in dysfunction. In May 2011, the patient underwent syringomyelia-abdominal shunt placement. After the operation, the patient felt that the lower extremity activity was improved for a short period of time, but three months later, her lower limbs were paralyzed. In July 2019, the patient successfully became pregnant through in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer.\n\nDuring the preoperative evaluation, the patient was completely paralyzed below T4. Her blood pressure fluctuated during pregnancy, ranging between 83-110/37-59 mmHg without any discomfort. Auscultation of the heart and lungs was normal. Laboratory data and an electrocardiogram were within normal limits. After considering the safety and effectiveness, general anesthesia was considered for elective cesarean section.\n\nRoutine perioperative monitoring was performed in the operating room, including pulse oximetry, 5-lead electrocardiography, and non-invasive blood pressure. Initial vital signs in the operating room were as follows: sitting blood pressure, 95/50 mmHg; supine blood pressure, 120/71 mm Hg; heart rate, 74 beats/min; respiratory rate, 20/min; blood oxygen saturation, 97%. An 18-caliber intravenous injection was placed and flushed with Ringer's solution. A 16-G catheter was inserted into the right internal jugular vein. A conventional channel to the left radial artery was established and connected to a FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup> monitor (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, Software Version 4.00), which is an analysis device for continuous CO monitoring. The FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup> system presents a CO value every 20 seconds. No severe hemodynamic fluctuations were observed during the puncture of right internal jugular vein and left radial artery. When lowering the urinary catheter, the blood pressure was 234/110mmHg. The patient did not feel uncomfortable and the blood pressure returned to normal without any treatment. After the obstetrician was ready for the surgery, anesthesia was induced with 100 mg propofol, 60 μg remifentanil, and 40 mg rocuronium. After endotracheal intubation, propofol and remifentanil were continuously pumped in; inhalational sevoflurane was used to maintain anesthesia, and 20 μg sufentanil was added after the fetus was dissected. FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup> system was used to measure the patient's SV variability (SVV), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), and central venous pressure (CVP). The changes in patient's blood pressure, central venous pressure, SVV, SVRI and CI are shown in Table 1. In accordance with the patient's blood pressure, central venous pressure, and CO monitoring, norepinephrine, nitroglycerin, and liquid infusion were adjusted in real time. A baby girl was delivered 5 minutes after the onset of the operation. Apgar score was 10 points. Patient vital signs were stable throughout the operation and the endotracheal tube was removed without incident. She returned to the ward and was successfully discharged 7 days later.\n\nTable 1 - Changes in patient vital signs at different time points.\n\n| Time | Remarks | ABP (mm Hg) | CVP (cmH2O) | SVV (%) | CI (L/min/m2) | SVRI (dyne-s-m2/cm5) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 11:50 | Indwelling urinary catheter | 234/110 | 5 |  |  |  |\n| 12:20 | Surgery started | 161/72 | 7 | 5 | 8.3 | 844 |\n| 12:25 | Baby out | 179/81 | 6 | 4 | 9.8 | 883 |\n| 13:00 | In surgery | 125/51 | 6 | 8 | 7.2 | 674 |\n| 13:30 | End of surgery | 143/70 | 8 | 5 | 7.8 | 893 |\n\n(Note: FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup> cardiac output monitoring can only guarantee the accuracy of the values under the condition of mechanical ventilation of endotracheal intubation. ABP = arterial blood pressure, CI = cardiac index, CVP = central venous pressure, SVRI = systemic vascular resistance index, SVV = stroke volume variability).\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nFor paraplegic patients, it is important to take preventative measures for autonomic hyperreflexia. Autonomic hyperreflexia is a sudden rise in blood pressure caused by spinal cord injury in T6 or higher spinal segments, and is accompanied by bradycardia, severe headache, facial flushing, nasal mucosal congestion, sweating, vascular constriction below the injury level, and vasodilation above the injury level.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> In severe cases, cerebral hemorrhage, seizures, and even death may occur. Autonomic hyperreflexia is induced by harmful stimulation resulting in dilation below the level of spinal cord injury and is a result of reflex sympathetic discharge that is not altered or suppressed by the upper central spinal cord. Reflex movements from the lateral horn, causes pelvic visceral spasm, and arteriolar spasm, leading to high blood pressure, capillary spasms, and sweating. In patients without spinal cord injury, these reflexes are suppressed by the outflow from the higher center. The resulting hypertension, sensed by receptors in the aortic arch, carotid sinus, and cerebral vasculature, can cause reflex bradycardia through the intact vagus nerve.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> In addition, the afferent outflow from the cervical sinus and the aortic arch stimulates the vasomotor center, leading to vasodilation in the head and neck. These areas become sweaty, warm, and flushed, while the rest of the body remains cool and dry.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> In this case, the highest blood pressure (234/110 mmHg) appeared in the period of indwelling urinary catheter. Transient elevated blood pressure appeared in the patient at the beginning of the operation, when the baby was removed and at the end of the surgery. No other adverse events occurred during the entire perioperative period. Therefore, preventative measures against autonomic hyperreflexia should be taken during the perioperative period.\n\nThe choice of general anesthesia versus regional anesthesia is governed by maternal comorbidities, urgency, and available equipment and expertise.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> To prevent autonomic hyperreflexia, we chose general anesthesia for the patient. We did not use local anesthesia because it cannot control autonomic hyperreflexia; regional anesthesia prevents autonomic hyperreflexia when an appropriate sensory level is achieved.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> However, it may be difficult to determine the level of sensation in women with paraplegia. Within the epidural space, a local anesthetic injection may cause further compression of the spinal cord. In addition to further injury, autonomic hyperreflexia can occur during the procedure of regional anesthesia. In our opinion, general anesthesia was the most appropriate and safest choice in this patient.\n\nThe ideal anesthesia for cesarean section should provide adequate muscle relaxation, analgesia, and narcosis under optimal surgical conditions, be safe for the mother, and should not affect neonatal viability and survival. Additional recommendations include the use of drugs with short duration effects<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> and the use of reversible drugs.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> The novel appropriate anesthetics, such as propofol and remifentanil, have been used to induce and maintain general anesthesia. There is reasonable evidence to support the use of propofol as a standard induction agent for general anesthesia for cesarean section in healthy patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> A meta-analysis of side effects, both maternal and fetal, of remifentanil under general anesthesia for caesarean section found that remifentanil attenuated maternal circulatory responses to intubation and surgery.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Continuous infusions of a combination of propofol and remifentanil is relatively safe for inducing anesthesia during cesarean section.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> Muscle relaxants are used to facilitate endotracheal intubation and provide optimal surgical conditions, but awareness during general anesthesia has become increasingly recognized since the routine use of neuromuscular blockers.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u></a></sup> Succinylcholine can cause denervated muscles to release a large amount of potassium, which causes hyperkalemia. Rocuronium has no adverse effects on Apgar score, pH, duration of breathing, or neurobehavioral score in neonates,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> but despite limited evidence, sevoflurane has become the preferred maintenance agent for general anesthesia during cesarean section.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup>\n\nCardiovascular instability caused by autonomic hyperreflexia may cause serious consequences. We should try our best to avoid these consequences. Real-time and convenient monitoring is necessary for paraplegic patients. In this case, the FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup> system was used to continuously monitor CO, and this system can be used for patients on mechanical ventilation. This minimally invasive device can be considered for further improving hemodynamic control and patient outcomes in obstetric anesthesia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> Pulse wave analysis has been used in the careful study of cardiovascular responses during pregnancy. The first cardiovascular change during pregnancy is an increase in arterial compliance from the first trimester.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> In addition, from the second to the third trimester, peripheral vascular resistance decreases moderately throughout pregnancy. This is followed by increased CO, heart rate, SV, and aortic dilation, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, and increased left ventricular wall thickness.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> A better understanding of perioperative hemodynamic responses in obstetrics may contribute to a significant reduction in maternal and neonatal morbidity. The use of minimally invasive methods such as the FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup>system in pregnant women with serious complications should be considered.\n\nIntraoperatively, FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup> system was used to achieve our anesthetic management goals which were mainly hemodynamic and cardiovascular stability. Using the FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup> system, we could easily measure the patient's s SVV, CI, SVRI, and CVP. SVV can reflect the preload of the heart in mechanically ventilated patients and effectively evaluate the volume status with better sensitivity and specificity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> The FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup> device is easy to set up and use. The patient's CVP and SVV were in the normal range, which means that the amount of fluid in the patient's body was relatively sufficient. CI is the ratio of CO to body surface area, an effective indicator of cardiovascular function. Systemic tissue perfusion, increased blood volume, and increased CO during pregnancy can lead to a CI higher than normal. Low SVRI signals indicates the application of vasoconstricting drugs to increase circulatory resistance. The FloTrac/Vigileo<sup>TM</sup> system is rapid and real-time in evaluating these parameters, providing timely guidance on the use of vasoactive drugs and fluid infusion.\n\nIn conclusion, pregnant patients with paraplegia can be given general anesthesia, preferentially using drugs that have minimal impact on the fetus. In these patients, attention should be paid to the prevention of autonomic hyperreflexia.

It can guide additional diagnostic investigations, such as pleural biopsies, if fluid cytological testing is non-contributory.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> However CT is often unable to detect small pleural nodules that are visible on direct inspection, eg. during thoracoscopic surgery.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> As a consequence, many patients with pleural disease have to undergo surgery to obtain pleural tissue for histological examination but has recognized risks and complications. Many patients are unable to undergo surgical procedures, for example, due to underlying comorbidities, which can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe presence of a pneumothorax may enhance detection of pleural abnormalities not detected on conventional CT imaging. In a published series of six patients with known or suspected malignant pleural diseases, initial CTs failed to show pleural abnormalities which subsequently became detectable after they developed a pneumothorax (either because of air leak after fluid removal or a trapped lung).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> These detected pleural nodules were not seen on CTs without the air-pleura interface.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup>\n\nCreation of an air-pleura interface within the chest cavity has previously been used to assess for tumour invasion of the chest wall and mediastinum,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7–9]</u></a></sup> for treatment of tuberculosis<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> and pneumonia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> These studies found the technique to be safe, with minimal complications, in well-selected patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u></a></sup>\n\nWe hypothesize that the reason for the low sensitivity of a CT scan to detect pleural abnormalities is because the pleura and the adjacent lung tissue and/or pleural effusion share a relatively similar density. We further hypothesize that creating an artificial air-pleura interface will allow significantly better detection of pleural abnormalities during CT imaging, due to their disparate densities.\n\nThe AIR study is a prospective, multicenter, pilot, proof-of-concept study that aims to:\n\n*   a) confirm the safety of creating an artificial air-pleura interface by introducing air into the pleural space via a previously inserted chest drain; and\n*   b) compare the effectiveness of a CT scan with the presence of an air-pleura interface, to a standard CT scan in detecting pleural nodules and/or other pleural abnormalities.\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\n### 2.1 Study design and participants\n\nThe AIR study will recruit patients with suspected or proven MPE, requiring a standard CT chest scan as part of routine clinical management. Patients will be recruited from outpatient clinics or inpatients wards from three Australian public hospitals. Any patient that meets the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria will be approached by a member of the research team at participating centers to offer inclusion in this trial. Informed consent will be obtained prior to enrolment. Screening logs will be kept.\n\n#### 2.1.1 Inclusion criteria\n\n*   a) Patient with known or suspected malignant pleural effusions\n    *   i. Who as part of his/her standard clinical care has a chest drain in-situ and requires a CT chest scan; and\n    *   ii. Does not have evidence of advanced pleural disease or abnormalities on a previous CT chest scan\n*   b) Will technically be able to undergo a CT scan;\n*   c) Is able to comply with the protocol; and\n*   d) Is able to give written informed consent.\n\n#### 2.1.2 Exclusion criteria\n\n*   a) Age <18 years;\n*   b) Respiratory distress or oxygen saturation less than 92% on room air;\n*   c) Loculated effusion;\n*   d) FEV1 < 1L after drainage of pleural effusion;\n*   e) Unable to tolerate CT scanning (unable to lie supine or prone, renal impairment not on dialysis, claustrophobia, contrast allergy); and\n*   f) Pregnant or lactating.\n\nParticipants will remain in the study from the time of enrolment to 3 months after their study CT scan. Outpatient follow-up visits will occur at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 3 months post-procedure. If visits are not attended, a member of the research team will contact the participant to clarify the reason. Participants will be de-identified and allocated sequential study numbers at each study site. If a participant withdraws from the study, their previously collected data will still be included.\n\n### 2.2 Interventions\n\nThe control for this study will be the current best available ‘standard-of-care’ imaging - a contrast-enhanced (pleural phase) CT scan of the thorax in the supine position.\n\nPrior to intervention, the volume of the underlying pleural effusion will be assessed in all patients. If there is a significant residual effusion, it will be drained to the maximum extent. This will optimize both the respiratory function and conditions for an air-pleura interface to form.\n\nThis procedure will be performed by a senior pleural fellow, or respiratory consultant experienced in pleural drains and pneumothorax management, who can monitor participants for respiratory compromise 删除6：<u></u>.\n\nStudy participants will first undergo a standard contrast-enhanced CT scan in supine position 删除6：<u></u>. Immediately after the standard scan, the participant will be re-assessed by a member of the study team. In these 40 patients, if still considered safe and appropriate to proceed, they will then be repositioned prone. An artificial air-pleura interface will be created by slowly introducing 500 mL of air into the pleural space of the patient using a syringe connected to the in-situ chest drain over a period of 1–2 minutes 删除6：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(Appendix 3, https://links.lww.com/MD-CASES/A13)</u></u>. The study scan (non-contrast) will be performed in the prone position 删除6：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(Appendix 2, https://links.lww.com/MD-CASES/A12)</u></u>. After the study scan is completed, the artificially introduced air will be evacuated via manual aspiration with the syringe over a period of 1-2 minutes. The chest drain will then remain connected to an underwater seal bottle for removal of any residual air, and the patient will then be observed for up to 2 hours before being able to be discharged home or returned to their inpatient ward.\n\nParticipants will have their observations (oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood pressure and pulse rate) taken before, during and up to 30 minutes after. In the event of difficulty in breathing, chest discomfort or oxygen desaturation (saturation change to < 90% on 2L/minute supplementary oxygen will be considered significant), the study will be aborted and the introduced air will be promptly evacuated (by aspirating air using a syringe attached to the 3-way tap and then connecting the chest tube to an underwater seal bottle). A study physician will be present throughout during the period of introduction of air and CT scanning.\n\nA follow-up chest radiograph (erect, expiratory) will be performed 2 hours after the study CT scan, or sooner if the patient has shortness of breath or chest discomfort. Monitoring will cease after 2 hours and the patient will be discharged home (or returned to the care of their inpatient team) if the following conditions are met:\n\n*   a) the participant does not have new or worsening symptoms compared to baseline;\n*   b) observations have remained stable;\n*   c) there is no significant residual pneumothorax;\n*   d) there is no continuous bubbling of air through the chest drain; and\n*   e) there is no other concern from the medical/nursing staff.\n\nIf the participant is more symptomatic compared to baseline and/or has a large residual pneumothorax on chest radiograph, they will be observed for as long as clinically required. Participants who are discharged home will be provided with the investigating team's mobile phone number that is held by senior respiratory registrars, for any post-procedural problems or concerns following discharge from hospital.\n\n### 2.3 Blinding\n\nDue to the nature of the intervention, the reporting radiologists cannot be blinded to the type of CT. To reduce bias, they will report the CT scans with and without the air-pleura interface in a random order.\n\n### 2.4 Aims\n\nThe aims of this study are to confirm the feasibility and safety of the study technique for creating an air-pleura interface and to determine the effectiveness of a CT scan with the presence of this air-pleura interface to detect pleural nodules, pleural thickening or other pleural abnormalities.\n\n### 2.5 Data collection\n\nBaseline data will be collected once informed consent has been obtained. Data collected will include demographics, comorbidities (particularly cardio-respiratory disease), underlying cancer, spirometry and relevant clinical data. Pleural effusion characteristics will be also be collected, including effusion cause, color, viscosity and biochemistry.\n\nBreathlessness will be measured using a validated visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS score will be recorded before and after study CT scan, and at the subsequent follow-up visits. Follow-up visits will occur at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 3 months post-procedure.\n\nThe control for the study CT scan will be the first contrast-enhanced scan.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Each scan will be divided into two studies for reporting 1) supine pleural phase contrast CT with no air-pleura interface and 2) prone non-contrast CT with the air-pleura interface. Two chest radiologists will independently assess the CTs for pleural nodules, thickening or other abnormalities.\n\n### 2.6 Study size\n\nThis pilot proof-of-concept study is the first to evaluate usefulness of an air-pleura interface CT. No prior data exists to guide power calculations. The study will aim to recruit 40 participants to ensure representation of the common causes of malignant pleural effusions (including mesothelioma and metastatic pleural cancers).\n\n### 2.7 Data management\n\nData will be entered into a secure database and a system of data validation checks will be implemented and applied. Accuracy of the data will be verified through data monitoring and comparison to source documents. Data entered will be checked by a second study team member to ensure accuracy.\n\nAll physical documentation will be stored in a secure environment in line with the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research for clinical trials and local policy guidelines for research data archiving. All procedures for the handling and analysis of data will be conducted using ICH-GCP guidelines, the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research and local policies and procedures for the handling and analysis of data.\n\n### 2.8 Trial monitoring and oversight\n\nThe Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will be responsible for supervising all aspects of the trial, including ensuring its completion to clinical and ethical standards.\n\nThe Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will ensure the safety of study participants through study procedures, reviewing non serious and serious adverse events, and consider new data (recently published studies) that may determine validity of study continuation. All deaths, anticipated or unanticipated, will be discussed with the DSMB. The Board will determine whether significant benefits or risks have been uncovered that may impact the study feasibility and/or ethical conduct. The DSMB will also help to ensure scientific integrity of the study by reviewing quality of the data to make its decisions. The DSMB will include an independent chairperson and two independent members.\n\n### 2.9 Safety monitoring and reporting\n\nParticipants will be monitored for the development of adverse events, all of which will be collected and documented by the investigator according to standard National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines and international standards for adverse event reporting. Any serious adverse events, whether related to the intervention or not, will be reported, documented and relayed to the DSMB. Adverse events will be followed up until resolution, or documented as unresolved in the adverse event log upon study completion.\n\n### 2.10 Ethics and dissemination\n\nThe trial has been approved by the Sir Charles Gairdner and Osborne Park Health Care Group Human Research Ethics Committee (reference: RGS0000001105). Recruitment centers include Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and St John of God Hospital Midland in Western Australia, and Northern Hospital in Victoria, Australia. The investigators will receive approval from the ethics committee for any amendment to the protocol and all subsequent eligible patients and active participants will consent to the updated patient information and consent form. Results of the clinical trial will be presented at scientific meetings and published in medical journals when completed. Only the research team will have access to the data. No professional writers will be used.\n\nFunding for this study is being provided through grants from Dust Diseases Board. The sponsor has no direct role in study design, data collection and analysis or report writing and publication.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nPleural diseases are common and can arise from more than 60 causes, including malignant pleural diseases that affect over 1 million people a year worldwide.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> CT scans are a part of the standard algorithm of an undiagnosed pleural effusion and can guide further diagnostic testing. Although CT is useful in detecting small pulmonary nodules, it has low sensitivity in detecting similar pleural abnormalities<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> that could be a target for percutaneous biopsy. Instead, patients have to undergo thorascopic surgery to directly visualize the pleura and biopsy abnormal areas. This requires more resources and has known complications. Efforts to improve detection of pleural abnormalities are therefore important.\n\nOur published case series showed that an air-pleura interface significantly improved detection of parietal pleural nodules by CT.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Creation of an air-pleura interface has previously been used to help determine tumor invasion of the chest wall and mediastinum,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7–9]</u></a></sup> but has not specifically been studied for its role in enhancing CT detection of pleural abnormalities in patients with suspected pleural malignancies.\n\nThe AIR study is a proof-of-principle study to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of introducing an artificial air-pleura interface to detect pleural nodules and other pleural abnormalities on CT. Improving detection of pleural abnormalities by CT scans could provide the opportunity to perform targeted percutaneous imaging-guided biopsies in patients who would otherwise require thoracoscopic surgery. Conversely, lack of suspicious features on an air-contrast CT may help negate the need for additional invasive testing. The findings of this AIR study could also provide data to aid the design and power calculations for future validation studies.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization**: Y.

As of 19th Oct, 2020, there are also 212,890 confirmed cases and 2789 deaths have been reported daily over the world. Although different countries and several researchers are studying clinical trials and focusing on the development of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19, there are no approved vaccines and specific antiviral agents. COVID-19 is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality, and is associated with high medical expenditures. Therefore, it is important to get an effective way to treat COVID-19 in a short time. convalescent plasma (CP) is a passive therapy, which uses plasma collected from recovered patients and full with antibodies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Previous studies showed that CP (ie, passive antibody therapy) has been used to treat SARS, A H1N1, Ebola virus patients, and has shown some clinical benefits by it.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4–6]</u></a></sup> This therapy can be used in varying severity, particularly severe conditions. So, the great value may be hiding in using CP to treat the pandemic of COVID-19 currently. In addition, many organizations (such as WHO, FDA et al), health care workers and several researchers around the world were investigating the safety and efficacy of CP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> To that end, setting up protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis the evidence from clinical trials is really important. Therefore, this protocol will provide evidence about efficacy and safety for CP treating in COVID-19 patients.\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\n### 2.1 Study registration\n\nThis protocol has been registered in PROSPERO. Registration number: CRD42020215456. And this protocol report has been based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement guidelines.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 2.2 Inclusion criteria for study selection\n\n#### 2.2.1 Types of studies\n\nAll relevant randomized controlled trials will be included. And then, non-randomized single-arm intervention studies, cohort studies (including prospective and retrospective), case reports, animal studies, reviews, duplicate studies, and studies with incomplete data will be excluded.\n\n#### 2.2.2 Types of participants\n\nPatients with confirmed severe COVID-19, and who used convalescent plasma therapy to treat severe COVID-19.\n\n#### 2.2.3 Types of interventions\n\nThe intervention measure of this review is the convalescent plasma, namely the blood product containing anti-body from recovered COVID-19 patients.\n\n#### 2.2.4 Types of outcome measures\n\n##### 2.2.4.1 Primary outcomes\n\nSurvival, Mortality, Viral load, and antibody level will be used as the main outcome. routine laboratory criteria and pulmonary function\n\n##### 2.2.4.2 Secondary outcomes\n\nLength of hospital stay, and adverse events as the secondary outcome.\n\n### 2.3 Data sources\n\nNine databases: PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Wan-fang Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, as well as the other source databases will be searched from Dec, 2019.\n\n### 2.4 Searching strategy\n\nThe following keywords will be used to search: COVID-19, Convalescent plasma therapy, CRT, efficacy, and safety. We will build this search strategy based on the guidelines (Cochrane handbook). The specific search content (for PubMed) is shown in Table 1. And the same search content will be used in other databases (English and Chinese database).\n\nTable 1 - The search strategy for PubMed.\n\n| Number | Search terms |\n| --- | --- |\n| #1 | ((COVID-19 \\[Supplementary Concept\\]) OR (Corona Virus Disease 2019\\[Title/Abstract\\]) OR (Corona Virus\\[Title/Abstract\\])) |\n| #2 | ((COVID-19 serotherapy\\[Supplementary Concept\\]) OR (Convalescent plasma therapy\\[Title/Abstract\\])) |\n| #3 | ((RCT\\[Title/Abstract\\]) OR (randomized controlled trial \\[Title/Abstract\\]) OR (randomized\\[Title/Abstract\\]) OR (randomly \\[Title/Abstract\\])) |\n| #4 | ((Efficacy\\[Title/Abstract\\]) OR Safety\\[Title/Abstract\\])) |\n| #5 | #1and #2 and #3 and #4 |\n\nThis search strategy will be modified as required for other electronic databases. COVID-19 = coronvirus disease 2019, RCT = randomized controlled trials.\n\n### 2.5 Data collection and analysis\n\n#### 2.5.1 Selection of studies\n\nAll of us will determine the including criteria before searching for the article. Two of us (ZM and YD) will screen all the articles’ titles and abstracts independently, in order to exclude some studies (duplicate publication or with incomplete data). The third 1 of us (HXH) will resolve the disagreement among the ZM and YD in literatures. The studies we included will be published in Chinese and English involving participants with confirmed severe COVID-19 and reporting on the treatment of CP. The PRISMA diagram will be used to show the process of selecting studies .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nThe PRISMA flow chart of the selection process.</u>\n\n#### 2.5.2 Data extraction and management\n\nThe following items will be extracted by two independent investigators (WGY and HXH):\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Basic characteristics (author, year, nation, and design);\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> The characteristics of participants (gender, age, and sample size);\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Outcome (including primary and secondary outcomes). XGL (the third investigator) will make the final decision when WGY and HXH failed to get consensus on data extraction.\n\n#### 2.5.3 Assessment of risk of bias\n\nIn order to evaluate the risk of bias for all studies, we will use the Cochrane bias risk tool. And the reviewers will assess the risk of bias independently. There are 6 aspects we will evaluate:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> random sequence generation;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> assignment sequence hiding;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> blindness;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> incomplete outcome data;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> selective reporting;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> other bias.\n\nThree levels will be used to assess the risk of bias, namely, low, ambiguity, and high. To obtain the complete information, we will contact the first author of the article when the information is vague.\n\n#### 2.5.4 Measures of treatment effect\n\nThe risk ratio and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals will be used for dichotomous and continuous data, respectively.\n\n#### 2.5.5 Unit of analysis issues\n\nTo avoid analysis issues, data from parallel group design studies will be extracted in this meta-analysis. And to minimize the carryover effects, the first experimental period data will be collected in crossover trials.\n\n#### 2.5.6 Management of missing data\n\nWe will contact and communicate with the author when we find the data is incomplete. If the data could not be provided completely, it would be removed finally.\n\n#### 2.5.7 Assessment of heterogeneity\n\nThe test of heterogeneity will be performed among all included studies. Fixed effects model will be adopted if the results for no heterogeneity (_P_ > .1, _I_<sup>2</sup>≤50%). And results in significant heterogeneity (_P_ < .1, _I_<sup>2</sup> > 50%) using random effects model and sensitivity analysis.\n\n#### 2.5.8 Assessment of reporting biases\n\nIn this protocol, we will use funnel plots to assess the reporting bias when the study includes more than ten trials.\n\n#### 2.5.9 Data synthesis\n\nData synthesis will be done by Review Manager 5.3 software (RevMan 5.3). On 1 hand, if there is no heterogeneity among all included trials, models in fixed-effects will be used. On the other hand, models in random-effects will be used when there is significant heterogeneity. And then, sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis will be conducted.\n\n#### 2.5.10 Subgroup analysis\n\nThe subgroup analysis including these trials will be conducted to explain the source of heterogeneity. The factors of different interventions or outcomes will be considered.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nCOVID-19 is pneumonia with severe acute respiratory syndrome.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Nowadays, specific antiviral agents, which have been approved for COVID-19, are none. CP, as a classic form of passive immunization, has been used in pandemics (such as SARS, and H1N1) over the past 2 decades. It is here that some studies and different researchers converge: CP may be the potential treatment with safety for severe COVID-19 patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> However, the number of clinical trials is poor, there is no complete systematic analysis and sufficient evidence to prove that CP has a significant effect with efficacy and safety on COVID-19. So, setting a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis in the effect of CP for severe COVID-19 is of paramount importance. This protocol will evaluate the effect (efficacy and safety) of CP in treating severe COVID-19 patients. Sure, there are some limitations (eg, language bias), we only search for studies in Chinese and English. All in all, the conclusions from this study may provide clues for researchers whether to choose the CP for severe COVID-19 patients or not.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nGYW, HXH, JL, MZ, DY, and GLX conceived and designed the protocol, and GYW drafted the protocol manuscript.

His fellow friend who also consumed the pufferfish preparation did not exhibit any symptom. The patient had a habit of eating pufferfish for the past years without any discomfort. His past medical history included gout with unknown treatment. He denied the history of other diseases and allergies. Vital signs on presentation were as follows: blood pressure 148/78 mm Hg, pulse rate 128 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and temperature 36.3. He was alert and oriented with a pulse oxygen saturation of 99%. His GCS score was 15. He had fluent speech and his bilateral nasolabial sulci was symmetrical. Both the lungs were clear to auscultation. His heart rhythm was normal without murmurs. The abdomen was soft without tenderness or rebounding pain. No edema was found in both lower limbs. Muscle tone and reflexes were normal. A complete blood count revealed that white blood cell, red blood cell and platelet counts were in the normal range. Liver and kidney functions were normal. Both hypersensitive troponin T and troponin I were in the normal range.\n\nThe gastric lavage treatment was given immediately without activated charcoal and the process was closely monitored. The patient felt uncomfortable during gastric lavage. The gastric lavage tube was removed afterwards. Meanwhile, he complained of numbness of the tongue and was vague in his speech. The monitoring showed heart rate was between 118 and 130 beats/min, respiratory rate was between 20 and 30 beats/min, blood pressure was between 140/80 and 189/110mm Hg, and pulse oxygen saturation was between 98% and 99%. Blood gas analysis showed PH 6.999, pCO2 54.2mm Hg, pO2 405.9mm Hg, FiO2 100%. The patient became cyanotic with sudden loss of consciousness shortly after reinitiating the lavage treatment. He had cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started immediately. No vomit was found in the airway during advanced airway establishment.\n\nAfter restoration of spontaneous circulation, he was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) for further treatment. There were no significant abnormities in bedside echocardiography, chest radiographs and CT brain. ECG showed sinus tachycardia. His serum concentration of TTX reported back as 348ng/mL. Based on the symptoms and serum TTX level, his diagnosis of pufferfish poisoning was conclusive. During his stay in ICU, he continued to receive mechanical ventilation without muscle relaxant. The patient was given comprehensive treatment, including but not limited to blood perfusion, catharsis, neurotrophic therapy, brain cell protection therapy, anti-oxidation, correct acidosis, fluid replenishment, electrolyte correction and anti-infection. Spontaneous breathing was not restored during the ICU stay. He had no pupillary reflex and was in coma. He was transferred to another hospital for hyperbaric oxygen treatment and eventually died of respiratory failure.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nA poison isolated from the ovaries of pufferfish by Dr. Yoshizumi Tahara in 1894 was named TTX in 1909.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,6]</u></a></sup> Many types of pufferfish contain TTX, such as _Takifugu obscurus, Fugu poecilonotus, Takifugu niphobles, Fugu obscurus_ and _Fugu rubripes_.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> TTX is mainly found in the liver and ovaries of pufferfish. It binds to the sodium channels of human excitable tissues (muscles and nerves), inhibits the influx of sodium ions, affects the generation of action potentials and impulse conduction, and causes paralysis of nerves and muscles.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,5–8]</u></a></sup> The severity of symptoms caused by TTX is related to dose and has individual differences.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,8]</u></a></sup> Symptoms usually appear within 30 minutes to 6 hours after consuming TTX.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,5,7]</u></a></sup> TTX is excreted from urine within 8 hours,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,7]</u></a></sup> and symptoms relieve within 24 hours.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> However, people who take large amount of pufferfish can become ill within 30 minutes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,8]</u></a></sup> Fukuda ranks fugu poisoning at 4 grades based on symptoms:<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Grade 1 is neuromuscular symptoms (perioral paresthesia, headache, sweating, pupil constriction) and mild gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, excessive salivation, hematemesis, diarrhea, abdominal pain); Grade 2 is paresthesia extending to the trunk and limbs, early motor paralysis and lack of coordination; Grade 3 is worsening of neuromuscular symptoms, dysarthria, dysphagia, sleepiness, ataxia, floating feeling, cranial nerve palsy, muscle tremor, heart/lung symptoms (low blood pressure, or hypertension, vasomotor dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, cyanosis, pallor, difficulty breathing, etc), skin symptoms (bruises, exfoliative dermatitis, blisters), hypotension and aphasia; Grade 4 is delirium, respiratory paralysis, severe hypotension, and arrhythmia. Generally, grade 3 and grade 4 are considered as severe pufferfish poisoning.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,7]</u></a></sup>\n\nCurrently, there is no antitoxin for pufferfish poisoning. For patients with severe pufferfish poisoning, timely establishment of artificial airway and implementation of mechanical ventilation is the key treatment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,5,7,8]</u></a></sup> Notably, patients with severe pufferfish poisoning can be conscious and have spontaneous respiration. They may not manifest respiratory paralysis at first, but may have a decrease in the tidal volume and minute ventilation and insufficient ventilation because of the decline in strength.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> In light of this, taking protective endotracheal intubation, or establishing artificial airway combined with early mechanical ventilation is critical to ensure survival. In general, the indications for protective endotracheal intubation are as follows:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Coma patients, especially those at risk of inhalation;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Patients with obvious changes in autonomic respiratory rate and rhythm;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Patients with cerebral hernia at risk for respiratory and cardiac arrest;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Patients with serious condition who may deteriorate rapidly, leading to respiratory and cardiac arrest;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxemia or hypercapnia or other reasons;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> Patients with large-scale trauma of the whole body, especially those with severe brain injury.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u></a></sup>\n\nHowever, protective endotracheal intubation is associated with pneumonia, length of ICU stay, death, and cost.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Moreover, for patients with mild poisoning who still have spontaneous respiration, muscle relaxants are needed to establish artificial airway. The muscle relaxants may aggravate the risk of respiratory muscle paralysis and cause medical disputes. Therefore, it is extremely important to know the best time to establish an artificial airway.\n\nIn this case, the patient was diagnosed as grade 1 to 2 pufferfish poisoning at admission. After the patient arrived at the hospital, his symptoms worsened, from numbness around the mouth to the tongue and slurred words We performed gastric lavage in time but did not perform protective endotracheal intubation. The patient's condition progressed rapidly, and respiratory failure and cardiac arrest occurred. The patient had no underlying cerebrovascular diseases and cardiac diseases. Based on the above analysis, we believed that his cardiac and respiratory arrest was caused by acute pufferfish poisoning. Hence, timely establishment of artificial airway might be helpful for good prognosis. Furthermore, we believe that decision of artificial airway in pufferfish poisoning patients should not be made based on only the severity at presentation. We must also take into consideration, the speed of disease progression, the risk of deterioration, and the basic condition of the patient. Specific indications for immediate artificial ventilation support in pufferfish poisoning are as follows:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Patients with grade 3 or above of Futian poisoning<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,7]</u></a></sup>;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Patients in whom symptoms of poisoning occurs in a short period of time, especially in patients with symptoms within 30 minutes after eating pufferfish.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,7,8]</u></a></sup>\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Grade-1 patients who progress rapidly to grade-2 during treatment or still progress after active treatment for 6 to 8 hours<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,7]</u></a></sup>;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Patients who eat the liver or ovaries of pufferfish, eat large amount of pufferfish, or drink alcohol at the same time should have immediate artificial airway support, no matter what grade they present with.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,5,7]</u></a></sup>\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Artificial airway should be established before gastric lavage in patients with diseases such as cerebrovascular disease and risk of aspiration<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u></a></sup>;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> Elderly patients or patients with liver and kidney dysfunction, who are at a risk for toxin metabolism disorder or delayed excretion.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,5,9,10]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn addition to the above, it should be considered that all the patients who present with pufferfish poisoning will need an urgent artificial airway, and the personnel and materials for the establishment of the artificial airway should be prepared in advance.\n\nThe prognosis of severe pufferfish is poor, and the death rate is about 13.5% to 30%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,7,8]</u></a></sup> The best way to prevent pufferfish poisoning is to be aware of the toxicity of pufferfish and avoid eating it, especially eating the liver or ovaries. Soaking for a few hours and cooking at high temperatures for a long time may reduce the toxicity of pufferfish.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nThe establishment of artificial airway and early implementation of mechanical ventilation are crucial for the prognosis of patients. Early and appropriate endotracheal intubation should be considered in such patients.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgements\n----------------\n\nWe acknowledge the contribution of consultant experts and healthcare practitioners from Peking University Shenzhen Hospital for their participation.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nSQZ had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis; SQZ, YY participated in the treatment of this patient and were involved in the development of the conclusions.

Several reports suggest that systemic anticoagulant therapy, minor trauma, intraabdominal injections, or exertional abdominal wall straining are risk factors for SRSH, and the mortality rate is approximately 4% to 20%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1–3]</u></a></sup> Prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended to decrease the potential risks of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) due to hypercoagulability, for instance in membranous nephropathy (MN) patients particularly those with hypoalbuminemia (<28 g/L).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> Herein, we report one case of SRSH in a MN patient who was prescribed with prophylactic anticoagulant therapy for the persistent hypoalbuminemia.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 63-year-old man was admitted with complaints of persistent proteinuria and severe edema. He had been diagnosed with MN for 6 years and achieved remission with the treatment of prednisone combined with tacrolimus. Six months ago, he experienced a diarrhea which subsequently led to the relapse of proteinuria with renal dysfunction (the serum creatinine level was 200 μmol/L, the normal level is 58 to 110 μmol/L) and hypertension. He received the treatment of prednisone combined with cyclophosphamide, but proteinuria and edema did not resolve. Due to the persistent hypoalbuminemia (<28 g/L), prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), 4250 IU subcutaneously every day, had been administered. Three months ago, the dosage of LMWH was adjusted to 4250 IU subcutaneously every 12 hours due to severe hypoalbuminemia (<20 g/L) and elevation of D-dimer level (3130 ug/L, the normal level is <550 ug/l). Two weeks before admission, the patient presented with cough and purulent sputum. Pneumonia was diagnosed by X-ray examination and moxifloxacin was prescribed for 3 days.\n\nOn admission, the symptom of cough was moderately relieved, but proteinuria and edema were persistent, not accompanied by Carnett and Fothergill sign. Blood pressure was 150/90mm Hg. Laboratory analyses revealed that serum albumin was 16 g/L (the normal level 40 to 55 g/L), the hemoglobin was 92 g/L (the normal level 130 to 175 g/L), the platelet count was 270x10<sup>9</sup>/L (the normal level 100 to 300x10<sup>9</sup>/L), the serum creatinine level was elevated (240 μmol/L), eGFR was 23.8 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, the activated partial thromboplastin time was 44.5 seconds (the normal level 20 to 40 seconds), the thromboplastin time was 11.5 seconds (the normal level 9 to 13 seconds) with an international normalized ratio of 1.03 (the normal level 0.79 to 1.14), and the D-dimer level was 500 ug/L. Due to the persistent severe hypoalbuminemia, prophylactic anticoagulation with LMWH, 4250 IU subcutaneously every 12 hours, was prescribed without dose adjustment.\n\nThree days after admission, this patient developed a sudden onset of left abdominal pain, which progressively exacerbated. Physical examination demonstrated a tender mass in the left abdominal quadrant, the size of which was about 5 x 3 cm, and the Carnett and Fothergill sign became positive. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a hematoma formation in the left rectus sheath , confirming the diagnosis of SRSH. The LMWH therapy, as part of MN therapeutic scheme, was immediately discontinued and the patient received several conservative treatments, such as cough suppression, local compression bandage and intravenous vitamin K administration. However, he complained of a severe progressive abdominal pain and urinary bladder irritation twelve hours later. A repeat CT scan showed one giant hematoma expanding into the inferior of rectus abdominis and prevesical space . The blood pressure dropped to 110/80mm Hg with hemoglobin rapidly decreasing to 61 g/L and the platelet count dropped to 86x10<sup>9</sup>/L, despite intravenous vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate, cryoprecipitate and red blood cell administration.\n\n删除2：<u>FIGURE 1:\n\nComputed tomography scans for rectus sheath hematoma. (A) Arrow pointing a hematoma formation in the left rectus sheath. (B) Arrow pointing a giant hematoma expanding into the inferior of rectus abdominis and prevesical space.</u>\n\nAn emergency surgery was performed due to the ongoing bleeding. During the surgery, after suction of abdominal wall hydrops (from clear to hemic, about 1500 mL), we found a giant hematoma (about 10x10 cm) consisting of blood and blood clots with rupture of inferior epigastric artery and diffuse rectus abdominis hemorrhage. The rupture of inferior epigastric artery was ligated and the hematoma was evacuated. The residual cavity of hematoma was filled with gelfoam and hemostatic glue. Intraoperative blood's volume was 200 mL. Red blood cell suspension (2000 mL), fresh frozen plasma (1000 ml) and cryoprecipitate (8 units) were infused during the surgery. Then the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unity. Four hours after surgery, a repeat laboratory analyses revealed that the hemoglobin was 67 g/L, which didn’t decrease further. He made a clinical recovery with supportive treatment gradually and was discharged without anticoagulant prescribed. During the follow-up of this patient, there wasn’t any recurrence of SRSH found.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nSRSH is an uncommon and frequently misdiagnosed condition, which accounts for up to 1.8% of acute abdominal pain syndromes,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> and has a mortality rate of 4% to 20%. SRSH is mostly due to the abdominal trauma and/or the coagulation imbalance, which could result from some anticoagulant therapy. It has been confirmed that innocuous trauma, such as cough, is an important contributing factor in the development of SRSH.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,7]</u></a></sup> In our case, the patient experienced cough for 2 weeks and received the LMWH anticoagulant therapy for more than 3 months, all of these factors probably contributed to the development of SRSH. The clinical manifestations of SRSH are usually a sudden abdominal pain and local abdominal mass. In some cases, large hematomas can cause urinary tract obstruction and bladder irritation,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> which were also observed in our case.\n\nCT scanning is a useful approach to diagnosis SRSH. Not only does it demonstrate the location and extent of the hematoma, but it also rules out other abdominal pathologies, such as appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, urine retention, intestinal obstruction, ovarian cyst torsion, and so on. Moreover, it is also very useful to classify the type of SRSH, which helps in assessing the severity and provides guidance in the treatment of SRSH. Based on CT findings, SRSH can be classified into 3 types.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Type I SRSH is a small hematoma and the bleeding is confined within the rectus muscle. Type II SRSH is a medium sized hematoma and the bleeding is between the rectus muscle and the transversalis fascia. Type III SRSH is a large hematoma, which can extend to the prevesical space and sometimes intraperitoneally. In our case, type I SRSH was diagnosed in the first CT scan, and the patient received conservative treatment. However, type III SRSH was confirmed with the repeat CT scan 12 hours later, which demonstrated the failure of conservative treatment and surgical therapy was performed to remove the hematoma. In the management of SRSH, arteriography with selective embolization of the epigastric arteries is the first recommended therapeutic option.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> However, in our case, considering the patient's kidney function was already insufficient and the arteriography contrast agent might exacerbate the renal dysfunction, we chose the emergency surgical therapy to stop the bleeding.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that the risks of VTEs in MN patients is relatively high,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,10–12]</u></a></sup> but the pathogenesis of hypercoagulability in these patients has not been clarified. Up to now, several risk factors that may promote thrombosis in MN have been identified, including hypoalbuminemia, lower levels of proteins (such as antithrombin, protein C and protein S), proteinuria, hyperviscosity, hyperlipidemia, previous thromboembolic episodes, and steroid therapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Because of the high risk of VTEs, prophylactic anticoagulation is usually recommended for MN patients, particularly in patients with hypoalbuminemia (<28 g/L).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,11,14]</u></a></sup> However, the use of anticoagulants could cause coagulation imbalance, increasing the risks of hemorrhage, which sometimes could be life-threatening.\n\nThe best strategy for prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in MN patients is still controversial.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Previous study has reported a risk stratification score to predict risks of hemorrhage, which consists of several risk factors of hemorrhage, including anemia (hemoglobin < 130 g/L in men and < 120 g/L in women; 3 points), severe renal disease (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> or dialysis-dependent; 3 points), age ≥ 75 years (2 points), history of prior hemorrhage (1 points) and hypertension (1 points).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> For a patient prescribed with prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, the higher the risk stratification score, higher the risk of bleeding. In our case, the patient had anemia (92 g/L), renal dysfunction (eGFR was 23.8 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>), and a history of hypertension for 6 months on hospital admission, achieving a bleeding risk scores with 7 points, which fell into the high-risk group (5–10 points) and increased the risk of SRSH. Moreover, LMWH, 4250 IU subcutaneously every 12 hours, had been prescribed for 3 months to our patient before admission. On admission, we did not adjust the dosage of LMWH as the patient had a severe hypoalbuminemia (16 g/L) and a relatively normal coagulation function (international normalized ratio 1.03), which might mislead us to underestimate the risks of bleeding. In fact, in patients with renal dysfunction, the clearance of anticoagulants and the effect of uremic toxins on coagulation should be taken into consideration to appropriately adjust the dosage of anticoagulants. In addition, injection technique has been implicated in numerous cases of SRSH.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> In our case, the patient received the injections of LMWH in the skin of the abdomen. But we do not have clarity about whether injection technique had relationship with the rupture of inferior epigastric artery.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nIn summary, we report 1 case of SRSH in a MN patient prescribed with prophylactic anticoagulant therapy. SRSH is a rare but serious bleeding complication of anticoagulant therapy. For hypercoagulability patients, such as MN patients with hypoalbuminemia, prophylactic anticoagulant therapy is frequently recommended. Nonetheless, anticoagulant therapy could sometimes alter the coagulation balance excessively, resulting in bleeding complications in some high-risk patients. Therefore, weighing up the benefits and risks of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy should be carefully carried out to avoid serious bleeding events. It is equally important to consider SRSH in patients on anticoagulant therapy who present with acute abdomen. Early diagnosis and treatment can help avoid morbidity and mortality in these patients.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Dechao Xu, Xuezhen Li, Changlin Mei, Xiang Gao\n\n**Investigation:** Dechao Xu, Linlin Cui\n\n**Resources:** Liyu Huang\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Dechao Xu, Xuezhen Li, Linlin Cui\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Changlin Mei, Xiang Gao</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:03:03", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:05:05", "cost": 121.617}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:20", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:05:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:03:02"}

Here, we document a large intrathoracic SAA located in the origin of VA that induced SSS.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 65-year -old woman was hospitalized at the Department of Neurology for repeated vertigo over the past 6 months. Her past history was significant for coronary heart disease, hypertension and gastric ulcers while negative for trauma. Physical examination was normal except for a focal pulsatile mass in the right supraclavicular fossae. The admission blood pressure of the left arm was 176/100mm Hg, that of the right arm was 165/97mm Hg.\n\nThe blood routine and biochemical examination were normal. Color Doppler ultrasound examination of the digestive system and urinary system was normal. No abnormalities in the form, structure, valve activities, or functionality were found in cardiac Doppler ultrasound. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was also normal, and no aneurysms were observed.\n\nChest Computed Tomography (CT) showed a well-circumscribed soft tissue mass in the superior mediastinum and right paratracheal region. The computed tomography angiography showed a circumflex right proximal SA and an ovoid true SAA of size 4.2cmx3.8 cm. The right VA originated from this aneurysm . The anatomy of bilateral vertebral, cephalic and internal carotid artery was normal and no marginal calcified plaques, lumen stenosis or thickening were found. Ultrasonography (US) showed systolic notch in the right vertebral artery (VA) which was created by a transient sharp decline in velocity at mid systole, confirming the occurrence of SSS . Transcranial Doppler (TCD) showed that the nadir of mid systolic cleft fell well below baseline signifying greater reverse flow during systole and forward flow restored in diastole . The blood flow velocities in the left vertebral, basilar and bilateral carotid artery were normal. Combined with clinical manifestation, physical examination and auxiliary examination, we diagnosed the patient as SSS caused by SAA. The severity of the SSS was classified as stage two–alternating vertebral flow.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nCTA showed a true SAA of size 4.2 × 3.8 cm; the VA originated from the aneurysm.

TCD = transcranial Doppler, VA = vertebral artery.</u>\n\nThe patient was initially put on oral antihypertensives and the systolic pressure was controlled at 130 to 150 mm Hg. Under general anesthesia, she underwent aneurysmectomy and bypass surgery via right supraclavicular incision. She also underwent ligation of the ostium of right VA. Ten days after the surgical treatment, repeat TCD demonstrated retrograde flow through the right VA as a result of surgical ligation at its origin, virtually consistent with predictable postoperative transformation. The patient recovered successfully without any postoperative complications and symptoms of vertigo disappeared. Long term use of extended release nifedipine tablets and atorvastatin was recommended. During the 6-month follow-up period, her clinical condition and blood pressure remained stable.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThe patient showed clinical features of vertigo lasting over 6 months. The right blood pressure was decreased as compared to the left. Computed tomography angiography findings confirmed a special intrathoracic SAA which was located in the ostium of the right VA and had a considerable volume of 4.2cmx3.8 cm. US together with TCD showed transient sharp decline in flow velocity and reverse flow during systole, testifying the occurrence of SSS. This hemodynamic abnormality caused the symptoms of vertigo. Combined with clinical manifestation and imaging methods, we diagnosed the patient as SSS caused by SAA. Severity of SSS is classified as follows: stage one - reduced anterograde vertebral flow, stage two - alternating vertebral flow and stage three - permanent retrograde vertebral flow.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> The severity of our case was classified as stage two–alternating vertebral flow.\n\nSAA is rare and accounts for approximately 1% of all peripheral vascular aneurysms.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Hobson et al have reported that only 1% out of 195 cases of peripheral aneurysms originated from SA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> On the basis of anatomical location, they can be classified into extrathoracic and intrathoracic aneurysms, which usually rely on US and angiography.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> The aneurysm located in the first segment of SA is identified as intrathoracic SAA. The occurrence of intrathoracic SAA is very low, and involvement of the ostium of VA is extremely rare. In the literature review, we found only one case where the aneurysm was located in the opening of VA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Commonly, SSS is mainly consequent upon occlusion or stenosis of the innominate or proximal SA and is usually attributed to atherosclerosis. Thus, it is relatively rare when SSS is caused by SAA and only three case reports have been described in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, here, we report the first case of an intrathoracic SAA which was not only characteristic of its specific location and huge volume, but also induced SSS. The aneurysm originated 1.2 cm from the outlet of right SA, and the right VA originated from this aneurysm. It is distinctive because in the reported literature, SAA usually originated before this location.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Besides, the aneurysm had a large volume of approximately 4.2cm × 3.8 cm, being the largest SAA that induced SSS in the reported literature.\n\nAs SAAs are at risk of rupture, thrombosis and embolism, elective treatments are indispensable. Open surgery including median sternotomy, left thoracotomy and supraclavicular approach are the alternatives according to the location of the aneurysms.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> The main postoperative complications include massive intra-operative bleeding, graft infection, stroke and paresis of the recurrent nerve.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Endovascular treatment has been reported, but there may be difficulty in accessing the aneurysm base and the possibility of causing obstruction of important great vessels.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Individualized treatments should be considered as the anatomy and morphology of the aneurysm are unique for different patients and correct surgical approach is the key for surgical success. In our case, the patient underwent aneurysmectomy and bypass surgery by a right supraclavicular incision without any postoperative complications and the clinical condition remained stable at 6-month follow-up.\n\nThe mechanism of SSS induced by SA stenosis can be explained by Venturi tube. It describes a pressure decrease in the narrow SA because of high flow velocities and hemodynamic abnormality of retrograde blood flow in ipsilateral VA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> In SAA, the mechanism of SSS is analogous. The existence of the suction effect may be a possible explanation. According to the Bernoulli equation, potential energy is inversely related to kinetic energy in hemodynamic system.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Hence, when the blood flows through the SAA, the flow velocity will abruptly increase. As a result, the pressure inside the aneurysm and nearby area such as the ostium of VA will inevitably decrease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u></a></sup> During systole peak, the blood flow is fastest and the pressure drop is greatest, creating a pronounced suction effect that results in transient sharp decrease of blood flow velocity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,11]</u></a></sup> Further, when the aneurysm happens to be located in the origin of VA, as is exhibited in our case, the lower pressure inside the aneurysm may increase the suction effect that easily leads to SSS. As a result, the patient suffers from vertebrobasilar ischemia causing vertigo and walking instability. Therefore, when SAA is discovered intentionally or accidently, irrespective of the symptoms, further US and TCD examination is necessary for the recognition of SSS and further treatment.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Dingdan Zheng, Qiuli Li.\n\n**Data curation:** Jibao Wu.\n\n**Funding acquisition:** Jibao Wu, Haipeng Li.\n\n**Resources:** Xiaoxi Yao.\n\n**Supervision:** Huayang Zhou, Jing Chen, Shufang Liu.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Dingdan Zheng.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Qiuli Li, Haipeng Li.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:52:29", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:53:27", "cost": 57.657}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:20", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:53:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:52:28"}

The researchers used a random number generator to generate a random number sequence. According to the odd and even nature of the sequence, the patients were divided into groups according to the order of admission.\n\n### 2.3 Surgical procedure\n\n#### 2.3.1 Mini-incision technique\n\nThe tendons in the mini-incision repair group were repaired using the PARS system (Arthrex) on the proximal portion of the rupture and on the distal portion. The patient was placed prone with a thigh tourniquet, a 2 cm longitudinal skin incision was made at the level of the tendon rupture, and the paratenon was incised and preserved. The PARS was inserted and pushed proximally, with the two inner arms below the paratenon, surrounding the tendon sheath, and 3 #2 nonabsorbable sutures were inserted percutaneously using the holes of the device through the skin, paratenon, and tendon. Then, the device was extracted from the skin access, pulling the sutures into the tendon inside the paratenon, and then exiting from the skin access at the site of the injury. This procedure was repeated at the distal end. The tendon ends were gently pushed down into the central aspect of the device by hand during suture insertion. With the ankle in a plantarflexed position, the sutures at each end were tied under maximum tension from nearest to farthest from the rupture site to avoid tendon bunching in the center. The paratenon and subcutaneous tissues were closed with 4–0 absorbable sutures, and the skin was closed with 3–0 nylon sutures.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u></a></sup>\n\n#### 2.3.2 Open technique\n\nThe tendons in the open repair group were repaired using the Krackow (locking-loop) technique. The patient was placed prone with a thigh tourniquet, an approximately 10 cm long posteromedial incision was made approximately 1 cm medial to the tendon. The skin, subcutaneous tissues, and tendon sheath were sharply dissected, reflecting the tendon sheath with the subcutaneous tissue to minimize subcutaneous dissection. The ankle was then plantar flexed to expose and hold the tendon stumps. A #2 nonabsorbable suture was placed in a Krackow fashion at each end of the tendon. Tendon ends were approximated and secured using a 2-strand construct, and the repair for stability was checked. The paratenon and subcutaneous tissues were closed with 4–0 absorbable sutures, and the skin was closed with 3–0 nylon sutures.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,13]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 2.4 Outcome measures\n\nThe patients’ demographic data, operating time, hospitalization time, hospitalization expenses, and other related data were recorded. In our study, the outcomes of patients were determined and recorded at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The primary outcomes included in our study were Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score, ankle range of motion, dorsiflexion/plantarflexion), American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score points, and visual analog scale pain score. The secondary outcomes will be included in our study: Achilles Tendon Leppilahti score, the MOS item short from health survey (SF-36), time to return to sports, calf circumference difference, and percentage of recovery to pre-injury physical activity. Complications such as rerupture, sural nerve problems, superficial/deep infections, deep venous thromboembolism, and wound complications were recorded and analyzed.\n\n### 2.5 Sample size\n\nThe sample size was calculated on the basis of a clinically relevant difference of 10 points in Achilles tendon total rupture score, with a standard deviation (SD) of 16. With a one-sided α of 0.05, a statistical power of (1-β) of 0.80, one-sided type-I error rate = 5%, power = 80%), and a dropout rate of 10%, we need to randomize at least 50 patients in each group.\n\n### 2.6 Statistical analysis\n\nQuantitative data are expressed as the mean and standard deviation (SD). The independent-group _t_\\-test, Mann–Whitney _U_ test, Chi-squared test, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient were used for statistical analyses. The comparison of demographic characteristics between the 2 groups was carried out using the descriptive statistics method. All analyses were performed using SPSS software . The value of _P_ < .05 was considered significant.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThis is a study protocol for a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing clinical effects of mini-incision and open repair in treating acute Achilles tendon rupture.\n\nAt present, surgical treatment for the repair of acute Achilles tendon rupture can be divided into 3 categories: open operations, minimally invasive techniques, and percutaneous techniques. In this trial, we performed minimally invasive repair using a PARS device and open repair using the Krackow technique.\n\nThis randomized controlled trial has some limitations. First, the sample size was small, with only 100 patients. Second, only acute Achilles tendon ruptures with no Achilles tendinitis were included, preventing any conclusions about the treatment of chronic ruptures or other situations. A third limitation of this study was the follow-up period of only 12 months. Further follow-up is necessary and is underway. Finally, due to the strict inclusion criteria, the study was limited to healthy patients aged between 18 and 60 years. We could not determine whether mini-incision surgery can reduce complications in elderly patients with comorbidities, or conversely because the structure obtained by mini-incision surgery is not firm, it may increase the risk of rerupture in such patients.\n\nThe results of this study will provide comprehensive data and outcomes on mini-incision vs. open repair in treating acute Achilles tendon rupture to help surgeons and patients make better choices.\n\n_All relevant data are within the paper._\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization**: Le Cao\n\n**Data curation**: Le Cao, Ping Wang, Qiang Zhang\n\n**Formal analysis**: Le Cao, Ping Wang, Yongping Wu, Xudong Miao\n\n**Funding acquisition**: Le Cao\n\n**Investigation**: Ping Wang\n\n**Methodology**: Ping Wang\n\n**Project administration**: Le Cao\n\n**Resources**: Qiang Zhang\n\n**Software**: Le Cao\n\n**Supervision**: Xudong Miao\n\n**Validation**: Xudong Miao\n\n**Visualization**: Qiang Zhang\n\n**Writing – original draft**: Le Cao\n\n**Writing – review & editing**: Xudong Miao</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "通用删除2(英):The advantages of surgical repair include lower rerupture rates, superior functional results, and a shorter time to return to activity, whereas conservative treatment has no surgical complications such as postoperative infections.通用删除6(英):[6–8] The operative treatment approaches contain open, mini-incision, and percutaneous repair, they should be considered separately because of different complications such as wound complications, infections, sural nerve problem,", "content": "1 Introduction\n--------------\n\nThe Achilles tendon is the most commonly ruptured tendon in the body and usually occurs in middle-aged men who participate intermittently in high-demand sports, with an annual incidence as high as 21.5 24 100,000 persons.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u></a></sup> However, the treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures remains controversial,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u></a></sup> and treatment options for acute Achilles tendon rupture include nonoperative and operative management.

The ankle was then plantar flexed to expose and hold the tendon stumps. A #2 nonabsorbable suture was placed in a Krackow fashion at each end of the tendon. Tendon ends were approximated and secured using a 2-strand construct, and the repair for stability was checked. The paratenon and subcutaneous tissues were closed with 4–0 absorbable sutures, and the skin was closed with 3–0 nylon sutures.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,13]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 2.4 Outcome measures\n\nThe patients’ demographic data, operating time, hospitalization time, hospitalization expenses, and other related data were recorded. In our study, the outcomes of patients were determined and recorded at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The primary outcomes included in our study were Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score, ankle range of motion, dorsiflexion/plantarflexion), American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score points, and visual analog scale pain score. The secondary outcomes will be included in our study: Achilles Tendon Leppilahti score, the MOS item short from health survey (SF-36), time to return to sports, calf circumference difference, and percentage of recovery to pre-injury physical activity. Complications such as rerupture, sural nerve problems, superficial/deep infections, deep venous thromboembolism, and wound complications were recorded and analyzed.\n\n### 2.5 Sample size\n\nThe sample size was calculated on the basis of a clinically relevant difference of 10 points in Achilles tendon total rupture score, with a standard deviation (SD) of 16. With a one-sided α of 0.05, a statistical power of (1-β) of 0.80, one-sided type-I error rate = 5%, power = 80%), and a dropout rate of 10%, we need to randomize at least 50 patients in each group.\n\n### 2.6 Statistical analysis\n\nQuantitative data are expressed as the mean and standard deviation (SD). The independent-group _t_\\-test, Mann–Whitney _U_ test, Chi-squared test, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient were used for statistical analyses. The comparison of demographic characteristics between the 2 groups was carried out using the descriptive statistics method. All analyses were performed using SPSS software . The value of _P_ < .05 was considered significant.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThis is a study protocol for a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing clinical effects of mini-incision and open repair in treating acute Achilles tendon rupture.\n\nAt present, surgical treatment for the repair of acute Achilles tendon rupture can be divided into 3 categories: open operations, minimally invasive techniques, and percutaneous techniques. In this trial, we performed minimally invasive repair using a PARS device and open repair using the Krackow technique.\n\nThis randomized controlled trial has some limitations. First, the sample size was small, with only 100 patients. Second, only acute Achilles tendon ruptures with no Achilles tendinitis were included, preventing any conclusions about the treatment of chronic ruptures or other situations. A third limitation of this study was the follow-up period of only 12 months. Further follow-up is necessary and is underway. Finally, due to the strict inclusion criteria, the study was limited to healthy patients aged between 18 and 60 years. We could not determine whether mini-incision surgery can reduce complications in elderly patients with comorbidities, or conversely because the structure obtained by mini-incision surgery is not firm, it may increase the risk of rerupture in such patients.\n\nThe results of this study will provide comprehensive data and outcomes on mini-incision vs. open repair in treating acute Achilles tendon rupture to help surgeons and patients make better choices.\n\n_All relevant data are within the paper._\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization**: Le Cao\n\n**Data curation**: Le Cao, Ping Wang, Qiang Zhang\n\n**Formal analysis**: Le Cao, Ping Wang, Yongping Wu, Xudong Miao\n\n**Funding acquisition**: Le Cao\n\n**Investigation**: Ping Wang\n\n**Methodology**: Ping Wang\n\n**Project administration**: Le Cao\n\n**Resources**: Qiang Zhang\n\n**Software**: Le Cao\n\n**Supervision**: Xudong Miao\n\n**Validation**: Xudong Miao\n\n**Visualization**: Qiang Zhang\n\n**Writing – original draft**: Le Cao\n\n**Writing – review & editing**: Xudong Miao</u>", "index": 9900, "show": true, "start": 9887, "end": 9926, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:44:32", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:49:16", "cost": 284.47}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:20", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:49:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:44:31"}

We report a case of Kyrieleis plaques complicated with retinal detachment, who underwent pars plana vitrectomy surgery.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 39-year-old male patient developed lower extremity and neck herpes two months ago. A week later, he had blurred vision in his left eye. There was no significant improvement after receiving antibiotics for a week in a local hospital. No antiviral treatment was administered. A month later, when he visited our hospital, his left eye visual acuity was a finger count of 10 cm, and keratin precipitates were found on the cornea using a slit lamp. On dilated fundus examinations, vitreous opacity, retinal detachment, and periarterial whitish focal Kyrieleis plaques, specifically along with arterioles of the retina were observed. His right eye vision was 20/20(Snellen Chart), with no signs of inflammation, and no Kyrieleis plaques. Subsequently, pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade was performed on his left eye. After the operation, retinal detachment did not recover completely, but he felt he could see more clearly than before. Tobramycin and dexamethasone (four times a day for days), Oral prednisone 60 mg once a day and oral omeprazole 20 mg (twice a day) were administered to the left eye, but prednisone and omeprazole were discontinued after 1 week due to stomachache. The patient was discharged after improvement.\n\nOne week later the patient felt that his vision was better than that before surgery, and visual acuity of the left eye was 20/800(Snellen Chart). The Kyrieleis plaques could still be seen . Examinations revealed serum Herpes simplex virus type 2 IgG, rubella virus, and cytomegalovirus were positive. Epstein-Barr virus antigen IgG and Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen IgG were positive.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nOne week later after surgery, eye-ground photography shows there are numerous Kyrieleis plaques around the retinal artery.</u>\n\nOne year after surgery, his left eye vision was still 20/800 (Snellen Chart), right eye vision was 20/20 (Snellen Chart), dilated fundus examinations showed most Kyrieleis plaques along the arterioles of retina was absorbed , Partial retinal detachment did not recover. We speculate that the partial retinal detachment and Kyrieleis plaques are the cause of poor eyesight. In order to treat partial retinal detachment, we will consider administering prednisone again.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nOne year later eye-ground photography shows Kyrieleis plaques around the retinal artery less than before. Partial retinal detachment was not recovered.</u>\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nKyrieleis plaques, also referred to as segmental retinal periarteritis is generally present in retinochorioiditis, acute retinal necrosis, cytomegalovirus retinitis, etc.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,3,4]</u></a></sup> Periarterial whitish focal Kyrieleis plaques are specifically found along arterioles of the retina.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> To date, there has been no pathological diagnosis of Kyrieleis plaques. At present, the diagnosis of this disease mainly depends on clinical signs, especially the presentation of the eye fundus. Kyrieleis plaques complicated by retinal detachment are rare. When there is no retinal detachment, the effect of hormone therapy is satisfactory,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> but it is not suitable for patients with severe retinal detachment. Surgery should be considered for severe retinal detachment. To the best of our knowledge, Pars plana vitrectomy surgery for treatment of Kyrielies plaque with retinal detachment has not been reported before.\n\nA multimodal imaging study showed that Kyrieleis plaques were characterized by inflammation in the vascular endothelium,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> and Kyrieleis plaques were observed after intravitreal injection of brolucizumab (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Animal experiments have shown that herpes simplex virus type 1 can spread to the retina and develop retinitis after inoculating the anterior chamber of mice.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> There is evidence of herpes simplex type 2 infection in the human coronary arteries.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> In vitro experiments have shown that herpes virus infection of vascular endothelial cells can inhibit anticoagulant function and induce coagulation receptor expression of proteins, thereby changing the balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant activities. Viral infection can damage and activate the endothelium directly or indirectly through immune mechanisms. Endothelial cells express clotting receptor proteins and inflammatory cells.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> All these indicates a virus infection that damages vascular endothelial cells and leads to Kyrieleis plaques. Furthermore, the patient had a prior history of herpes virus infection and prednisone treatment was effective. We speculate that retinal detachment could be a secondary immune response to a viral infection, a small number of immune deposits attach to the arterial wall of the eye fundus and the exudation retinal detachment results from fluid leakage due to impaired endothelial function. Over time, severe exudation retinal detachment necessitates surgical treatment. Alternatively, Kyrieleis plaques are similar to immune deposits that block blood vessels and cause retinal necrosis. This case also suggests that Kyrieleis plaques are slowly absorbed. Poor vision can be caused by the detachment of the retina that has not completely recovered, or the Kyrieleis plaques may interfere with the blood supply to the retina causing damage to the retinal nerve fibers.\n\nTo conclude, viral infection is a possible cause of Kyrieleis plaques. Endothelial cells of retinal arteries may be involved in this process. Pars Plana Vitrectomy can be a good method to treat Kyrieleis plaques complicated by retinal detachment\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nH P - Diagnosis and Surgery, Writing.

This patient had inadequate pain relief following conservative medical management, para-sagittal epidural steroid injections, sympathetic blocks, and failed to improve with traditional SCS. The patient then experienced 100% relief of his CRPS pain along with his associated symptoms with improved functionality in his right lower limb after using HF10-SCS. He also reported 40% improvement in his chronic back pain. The SENZA-RCT showed increased and prolonged efficacy of the HF10 system when compared to traditional methods when treating typical leg and back pain and potentially regarding management of CRPS.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> This case report is an example of the HF10 system being superior in the management of CRPS-related pain and chronic low back pain when compared to the traditional low frequency SCS.\n\nTraditional SCS uses a frequency up to 1200 Hz with most programmed at 40–80 Hz and the electrodes placed topographically based on paresthesia creation over the area of pain. This type of stimulation activates the dorsal column which then interferes with the hyperexcitable afferent signals originating from the periphery. The HF-SCS uses a frequency of 10,000 Hz and is placed anatomically without paresthesia mapping. The leads are placed to overlap the T9-T10 disc where the neurons responsible for back and leg pain are most heavily concentrated. HF-SCS delivers more stimulation to the dorsal horn instead of the dorsal columns which eliminates giving the patient unpleasant paresthesia which may also increase patient compliance.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> This direct stimulation on the dorsal horn creates increased inhibition- activation ratio on wide dynamic range neurons (pain projecting neurons) which studies have shown only occurs at frequencies > 5khz.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Additionally, another study showed these neurons responsible for relaying pain were found to be optimally inhibited at 10khz.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> This results in a decrease in the hyperexcitability of these neurons and the perceived pain. This in theory would block the amplified sympathetic response seen in CRPS and decreasing the perceived pain (allodynia, hyperesthesia) and improvement in vasomotor/skin changes.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 59-year-old Caucasian man presented for evaluation of his right lower limb pain that had been present since April 2018. During this time, he was hospitalized for pneumonia that was complicated by right lower limb arterial blood clots which required intervention via open thrombectomy. The intervention was successful but 2-3 weeks post procedure he began experiencing constant severe right lower limb pain.\n\nThe pain progressively increased and was rated using a Visual analog scale (VAS scale to be a 10/10 at its worst and a 4-5/10 at its best but typically > 5. The pain was located on his buttocks, lateral thigh, and all the way down his leg to the toes. He described it as a sharp, shooting, throbbing ache. The pain was associated with weakness, numbness, tingling, swelling, muscle spasms, sheet and clothing intolerance, and decreased temperature in the foot. Prior to the onset of this pain he described himself as active and energetic but since had been unable to continue this level of activity due to the pain. The pain was at its worst at night and woke him up around 3 times nightly. It was exacerbated by prolonged standing, sitting, walking, and physical activity. Lying down and pain medications (gabapentin 300 mg TID and oxycodone 7.5/325 mg QID) previously provided some relief but were no longer helping. He denied any skin discoloration, saddle anesthesia, or bowel incontinence but had occasional trouble with urination. Patient stated that he had a history of lumbar back pain with right leg radiculopathy since 2002 but the pain after the thrombectomy was worse and different in character. After thorough evaluation he was given a diagnosis of CRPS type 1 (CRPS) using the Budapest criteria.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine was done on January 2, 2020 which showed L4/L5 facet arthrosis with bilateral effusions, spondylosis, L5/S1 spondylolysis, anterolisthesis, disc degeneration with posterior protrusion into the neural foramen with severe right foraminal stenosis with impingement on the right L5 nerve root. Due to the complicated nature of his diagnosis of CRPS in addition to his MRI findings, he was deemed to be a poor candidate for L5-S1 transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. He was then referred for evaluation using the HF10-SCS system since his prior use of traditional SCS provided no improvement and prior studies such as the SENZA RCT showed sustained pain relief at 24 month follow up.\n\nThe patient had a past medical history significant for arthritis, leukemia (in remission since 2010 post stem cell transplant), and depression. He was on disability and was previously a truck driver. Physical exam showed the spine was midline without kyphosis, scoliosis, or excessive lordosis. The mid-lower lumbar spine was tender to palpation, worse on the right side. No paraspinous muscle spasms noted. Motor exam of the flexors and extensors were symmetric and rated 4+ to 5/5 of the bilateral lower limbs. Sensory exam was significant for dysesthetic sensations along the right thigh, calf, foot, and toes. Patellar reflexes were 2+ bilaterally and Achilles reflexes were equivocal bilaterally.\n\nHe had not done any therapeutic exercise or any modalities due to pain. Since the pain began in 2018, he had several epidural steroid injections and sympathetic blocks that provided relief for approximately 6 days. In April 2019 he failed to improve using traditional SCS. He was evaluated by a neurosurgeon who deemed him a poor surgical candidate and referred him for use of the HF10 system. A P3 psychological profile was done showing depression, anxiety, and somatization scores all well below the mean values for pain patients, indicating that from a psychological viewpoint, he was an excellent candidate for a SCS trial.\n\nOn February 21, 2020, the HF10 SCS was placed anatomically along the posterior epidural space with 2 leads, with 1 on the top of T8 and the second along the upper third of T9. The positions were confirmed using biplane fluoroscopy. Due to the dosage and frequency of his gabapentin and oxycodone, he was advised not to wean during the trial in order to keep all variables consistent so that results would not be confounded. The patient tolerated the procedure well with only minor temporary discomfort during administration of local anesthetic. Two days after the procedure the patient noted that he was “essentially pain free in the right lower extremity.” The patient was then seen on February 25, 2020 with concern that he was not having as good of results after he moved to program 2. Fluoroscopic imaging showed that the lead over the top of T8 was still in position but that the 1 over T9 was still midline but had shifted down to the top of T11. Even with this deviation the patient reported a dramatic improvement in his back pain and his right lower extremity pain and that at times he was even completely pain free. The trial was then extended 3 more days and the stimulator reprogrammed back to program 1 since the leads still covered the T9-T10 disk. The HF10 trial stimulator was removed on February 28th, 2020 and at this time he stated that his sympathetic pain in the right lower limb was 100% better with resolution of his other CRPS symptoms and had significant improved function with activities of daily living. He enthusiastically stated that he no longer limped and that his physical activity increased and was sleeping better. Additionally, he noted that his back pain had improved 40% compared to baseline. Due to the successful SCS trial, he is scheduled for permanent implantation with the HF10 system. The parameters assessed and the comparative outcome on the patient's response to treatment after trying traditional SCS versus after trying HF10 SCS is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 - Treatment outcomes.\n\n| Treatment Outcomes |\n| --- |\n| \n* * *\n\n |\n| --- |\n| Parameter Assessed | Before HF SCS | After HF SCS |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CRPS pain VAS | 10 | 0 |\n| Back pain VAS | 10 | 6 |\n| Mental affect | Restricted | Appropriate to context |\n| ADLs | Poor | Significantly improved |\n| Sleep | Poor | Excellent |\n\nADLs = activities of daily living, CRPS = complex regional pain syndrome, HF SCS = high frequency spinal cord stimulation, VAS = visual analog scale. The column denoting “before HF SCS is in relation to after the patient had failed to improve after traditional spinal cord stimulation 10 months prior to implementation of the high frequency spinal cord stimulator. The patient's mental affect refers to the patient's mental status.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nComplex regional pain syndrome is a disabling condition that can involve regional pain, sensory changes associated with autonomic dysregulation, and trophic changes. The location of the pain is not consistent with any dermatomal distribution and typically begins distally (hands or feet) unilaterally and spreads proximally over time and may then spread to other limbs. The inciting event is typically minor trauma or post-surgery and exacerbated by additional surgery, splint/cast placement, and/or immobilization. The development of CRPS is believed to be due to abnormal processing of sensory information resulting in amplification of the sympathetic nervous system's response to injury. This causes the associated vasomotor and skin changes seen in CRPS and plays a pivotal role in the sensitization of peripheral nerves resulting in disabling pain, hyperesthesia/allodynia, and decreased functionality in the area involved.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup>\n\nManagement of CRPS can be difficult since it is often refractory to conventional treatments such as medications, therapeutic exercise, and transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Since there is no proven treatment, management is focused primarily on reducing pain, improving/preventing skin changes, and increase functional status. Although data shows only 1 in 5 CRPS patients return to full functional status.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup>\n\nSympathetic blocks can be used both diagnostically and therapeutically but are not always successful as seen in the discussed patient. After extensive literature review and to the best of our knowledge, the only RCT done analyzing the use of SCS in the management of CRPS showed SCS in addition to physical therapy to be an effective means in reducing pain in CRPS.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Unfortunately, as with other treatments, its therapeutic effect diminished over time and only provided significant pain relief for 2 to 3 years and had no effect on functionality. Despite this diminished effect, the study showed reduced health care costs in the long term, improved health related quality of life, and patient satisfaction. This study also showed that for those who started to lose pain control and were able to increase their stimulators > 250 Hz had a return of pain reduction indicating that a higher frequency may be more beneficial in those with CRPS.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> This finding and the case discussed above; shows promising evidence of the effectiveness of HF10 SCS in CRPS.\n\nResults of the SENZA-RCT showed that the HF10-SCS was more efficacious in providing pain relief at 24 months and was superior in treating leg and back pain when compared to the traditional low frequency SCS. Responder rate when comparing HF10 vs traditional SCS at 24 month was 76.5% versus 49.3% for back pain and 76.5% versus 49.3% for leg pain respectively. Those that used the HF10 SCS had up to 50% greater reduction in their visual analog scale (pain scale) and no difference in safety/complications. Additionally, some patients find the paresthesia produced when using traditional SCS to be unpleasant and can negatively influence compliance.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> This does not occur with HF10 SCS and patients report no unpleasant sensations.\n\nStudies comparing traditional SCS vs HF10-SCS in the treatment of CRPS are limited. One case report of another CRPS patient who used a HF-SCS had 75% pain reduction and resolution of her vasomotor and skin changes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Though this supports consideration for the use of the HF-SCS in the treatment of CRPS, it fails to compare which system type is more efficacious regarding CRPS treatment. The patient discussed here is of importance in that he had tried both traditional and the HF10-SCS. With traditional SCS, he failed to experience any benefit. When switched to the HF10-SCS, he reported 100% resolution of his CRPS pain, associated symptoms, and experienced improved functionality in his right lower limb with the added benefit of 40% improvement in his chronic low back pain (which traditional SCS often inadequately reduces).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,9]</u></a></sup>\n\nThis case report demonstrates that HF10 SCS might be an effective means of managing the symptoms of CRPS and reducing axial back pain.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Collected data:** Harrison R.

Introduction\n----------------\n\nAn accessory spleen (AS), commonly referred to as a splenule, is ectopic splenic tissue that arises from developmental anomalies. In contrast, splenosis refers to acquired ectopic splenic tissue in the setting of trauma or a splenectomy and does not have an arterial supply. AS is benign, asymptomatic, and typically an incidental finding. In a meta-analysis of over 22,000 subjects, the pooled prevalence of AS was 14.5%.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Among patients undergoing abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans, the prevalence of AS was noted to be around 16% in comparison to around 0.5% to 2% for adrenal incidentalomas.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The most common locations for AS are the splenic hilum (62%) followed by the pancreatic tail (5.5%), the latter labeled intrapancreatic accessory spleen (IPAS).删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nWhen these lesions are found in the pancreas, it is important to differentiate between IPAS and pancreatic neoplasms such as a neuroendocrine tumor to avoid patients undergoing unnecessary invasive surgeries.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>4–6</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Management for IPAS is typically observation unless it is obstructing vasculature or the pancreatic duct and/or symptomatic in the case of torsion, rupture, or hemorrhage. However, the dilemma arises as CT imaging is limited in its ability to definitively confirm a diagnosis of IPAS and can often mimic a neuroendocrine tumor or adenopathy. They appear as well-defined, round lesions that are homogenously enhancing with contrast.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Often, these patients must undergo nuclear medicine scans or more definitively have an endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA).\n\nHere, we report on a case of a patient who underwent EUS-FNA of a pancreatic lesion to confirm a diagnosis of IPAS.\n\n2\\. Case report\n---------------\n\nA 66-year-old male with past medical history of stage 1 prostate cancer status post brachytherapy presented to his urologist for surveillance of an elevated prostate specific antigen. He underwent nuclear bone scan for evaluation of metastatic disease which incidentally found a bulbous morphology of the pancreatic tail. A CT scan of the abdomen was obtained for further evaluation which revealed a 4 cm × 3 cm isoenhancing mass in the tail of the pancreas . There was no evidence of local invasion, lymphadenopathy, nor pancreatic ductal dilation.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nCT abdomen of the pancreatic mass.

EUS revealed an approximately 20 mm × 20 mm hypoechoic, oval mass with well-defined borders . FNA was performed. Cytology was significant for small mature lymphocytes and blood vessels suggestive of IPAS . A previously scheduled MRI with pancreas protocol was also completed which revealed a round 2 cm T1 isointense/T2 slightly hyperintense lesion with mild post-contrast enhancement. This was similar signal intensity to the spleen on all sequences which is consistent with the pathology-proven diagnosis of IPAS.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2.:\n\nEUS revealing hypoechoic mass.

Discussion\n--------------\n\nIPAS are benign and typically asymptomatic lesions that are not uncommon incidental findings. Given their similar imaging signature, malignancies must be ruled out. This was particularly important in our case presentation given the patient’s history of prostate cancer with an elevated PSA.\n\nNew imaging modalities have been investigated including contrast enhanced EUS and scintigraphy to help rule out malignancy.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In particular, Technetium 99m (Tc-99m) sulfur colloid scan or Technetium 99m (Tc-99m) heat-damaged red-blood-cell (HDRBC) will both show increased uptake which is characteristic for IPAS.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>8–10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However, these resources are limited and can be expensive. In contrast, EUS is quite reliable in further evaluating pancreatic masses.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> One study demonstrated good interobserver agreement between providers characterizing pancreatic lesions however limited in their ability to diagnose IPAS with imaging alone.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Ultimately patients typically need FNA for confirmation.\n\nOn cytologic evaluation, common features of IPAS include small blood vessels among a mixed population of inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, plasma cells, and histiocytes.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Diagnostic accuracy of these masses can be improved with immunohistochemical (IHC) staining especially in patients with splenosis where cytology may appear different. In particular, CD8 staining can highlight splenic sinusoidal endothelial cells, differentiating them from malignancies.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13–15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Given the characteristic findings on cytology, IHC was not performed on our patient. However, it is important to note limitations of IHC. There have been several case reports of false negative CD8 staining among IPAS which can potentially lead providers to pursue either more diagnostic intervention or surgical excision.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>17</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nIn conclusion, there are numerous diagnostic modalities to investigate pancreatic masses including CT scans, nuclear scans, ultrasound, cytology, and immunohistochemistry. Each diagnostic intervention comes with its own limitations and risks for misdiagnosis which can ultimately lead to unwarranted surgical intervention. There is no gold standard guideline for definitive management however EUS-FNA is the most common intervention used for diagnosis. If cytology is equivocal, IHC and other imaging modalities such as nuclear scans can be considered to diagnose IPAS. Patient history such as prior or current malignancies, age, and history of splenectomy can help guide diagnostic management.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nJP reviewed the patient’s hospital course, wrote, and revised the manuscript.

Introduction\n----------------\n\nChronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) comprises up to 20 percent of adult leukemias, with most patients presenting at or after 50 years of age.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> As it is one of the most commonly encountered hematological malignancies in this age group, extensive literature with a well-established knowledge of molecular genetics, presentations, response to therapies, and CML progression in adults is available.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> However, the prevalence of CML in the pediatric population is less than 2 percent among leukemia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> This is 1 reason many pediatric CML aspects are relatively less studied, especially in response to treatment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> The management of CML has evolved immensely since the introduction of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI), followed by multiple trials refining its use in adult CML.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> The role of TKI in pediatric CML has recently gained interest.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Newer Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) such as dasatinib and nilotinib are now used as first-line chemotherapy agents in pediatric CML.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> One of the key differences in the use of TKI in the pediatric population versus the adult age group is the relatively long treatment and higher incidence of adverse effects due to the rapid growth phase in the former population.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Because of the rare occurrence of CML in the pediatric population and limited trials investigating the role of new treatment modalities, therefore, the research team is intended to (a) to combine the existing knowledge of efficacy and safety profile of TKI in pediatric CML and (b) to compare the side effects of long-term TKI therapy in the pediatric population versus stem cell transplantation.\n\nBecause of the rare occurrence of CML in the pediatric population and limited trials investigating the role of new treatment modalities, there is a need of an enhanced review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety profile of different generations of TKIs as well as the risks and benefits of TKI over stem cell transplant specifically in the pediatric age group.\n\n### 1.1. _PICO_\n\nP: Pediatrics with chronic myeloid leukemia\n\nI: none\n\nC: new versus old treatment modalities\n\nO: efficacy and safety profile of different generations of TKIs\n\n2\\. Methods\n-----------\n\nThis study protocol has been formulated following Reporting Guidelines for Meta-analyses of Observational Studies and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P) reporting guidelines 通用删除7(英):<u>(17, 18)</u>. The protocol is registered at PROSPERO and can be found with the identification number: CRD42020154435.\n\n### 2.1. _Systematic search strategy_\n\nThe following electronic records would be searched to meet the study’s objectives: Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Web of Conferences, and Open Grey. The following keywords will be searched: (“pediatric chronic myeloid leukemia” OR “pediatric CML” OR “chronic myeloid leukemia in children” AND “adolescent chronic myeloid leukemia” OR “adolescent CML” OR “chronic myeloid leukemia in adolescents” AND “tyrosine kinase inhibitors” OR “TKI” OR “imatinib” OR “dasatinib” OR “nilotinib” OR “ponatinib” OR “bosutinib”.\n\nEndnote will be used to eliminate duplicates. Initially, titles, abstracts, and keywords will be screened for eligibility. Included studies will be further screened in detail by reviewing the full text for inclusion into the review. Added studies will also be hand screened to identify other eligible articles from the references. PRISMA-P checklist will be followed to help reviewers under-stand the process of study selection.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 2.2. _Eligibility criteria_\n\nAll studies reporting the efficacy and safety of TKI in pediatric patients with CML will be included. All literature, including randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case reports/series, and abstracts reported in the English language and published between 2000 and 2020, will be included.\n\nInclusion criteria: Pediatric (≤18years) patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CML and were treated with TKIs. Exclusion criteria: Patients aged >18 years, those with contraindications to the use of TKI, other active cancer or using systemic medication for another malignancy in the past years (with the exception of regional therapy for curative purposes).\n\n### 2.3. _Data extraction (selection and coding)_\n\nFour reviewers (FA and RG, and AN and KM in 2 groups) will extract the data from the finalized studies into the data collection sheet. A third reviewer (MY) will resolve any conflicts in the data collection by independently reviewing the conflicted articles. Data will include patient demographics, details of the CML with age at diagnosis, CML phase, peripheral smear and Bone marrow biopsy findings, treatments given (including TKI) with their type and doses, side effects and toxicities of the treatments and the outcomes. Both groups will double check the data entered for the other group to maintain accuracy in data collection process.\n\nThe overall survival, progression-free survival, and hazard ratios will be used to report statistical measures among the different treatment modalities.\n\n### 2.4. _Methodological quality assessment (risk of bias)_\n\nTwo reviewers (FA and RG) will assess the study quality independently, following Reporting Guidelines for Meta-analyses of Observational Studies and PRISMA guidelines. A group meeting will be arranged to arrive at an agreement in case of disagreement. Selection and publication biases among the studies will be evaluated via plotting the effect by the inverse of its standard error. The symmetry of these’ funnel plots’ will be evaluated manually and with Egger test to check for a need for a larger sample size.\n\n### 2.5. _Meta-analysis_\n\nCMA and STATA will be used to perform the meta-analysis. Confidence intervals will be put at 95%. Inconsistency index (_I_<sup>2</sup>) will be used to evaluate the inter-study heterogeneity. If notable heterogeneity will be found (_I_<sup>2</sup> > 50%), pooled estimates of specific effect size measures and confidence intervals (95% CI) will be calculated via a random-effects model.\n\nA subgroup analysis will be performed based on potential covariates which may affect primary outcomes. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted to evaluate the primary outcome measures of the meta-analysis if influenced by individual studies.\n\nTo compare the adverse events of long-term TKI treatment in the pediatric population versus stem cell transplantation, a network meta-analysis will be performed. We will report all results following the PRISMA-NMA.\n\nAdditionally, we will generate a network plot representing data from all the included trials. Direct treatment effect variance will be used to assess the basic comparison’s contribution to the network estimation. To summarize the findings, a contribution plot will be developed. A forest plot will be created for all the comparisons done in our meta-analysis.\n\nThe statistical analysis will be performed based on potential stratifications and subgroups (like CML phase and severity, age group, sex, co-morbidities, clinical features, etc.) which may influence the outcome measures.\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nCML is a commonly occurring hematological neoplasm caused by BCR ABL1 gene mutation in the myeloid cells.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Chromosome 22 (Philadelphia chromosome or Ph<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup>) abnormality is seen in almost all patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> The median age of presentation in the literature varies from 50 to 60 years.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Three distinct clinical phases can be seen in CML; Chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase, and blast phase.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe treatment of CML has undergone a significant transformation over the past decade. Allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT) had remained a standard of treatment for many years for any phase of CML.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> Stem cell transplant, being an interventional treatment, especially that of the bone marrow, can have many potential short and long term complications, ranging from graft versus host disease, symptomatic cytopenias, mucositis, and diarrhea to secondary malignancies and chronic infections.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> The in-depth understanding of CML genetics led to the development of drugs such as imatinib, the first TKI, which inhibits the tyrosine kinase encoded by the ABL gene.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> The introduction of further first and second-line TKIs such as nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib have potentially made SCT one of the last resorts in managing CML.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Currently, SCT is mainly reserved for CML - CP patients resistant to 2 TKIs and those with new mutations like T315I mutation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe primary mechanism of action of TKIs is the blockage of the BCR-ABL pathway, although other mechanisms have been studied.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> The first TKI Imatinib solely acts on the BCR-ABL pathway and halts cell proliferation without causing cell breakdown, and results in up to 98 percent reduction in the abnormal myeloid cells, leaving the healthy cells unaffected.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Currently, imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, ponatinib, and bosutinib are being used for CML in adults.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Primary (failure to achieve optimum response) and secondary resistance (relapse after optimum response) with TKIs in CML-CP is not uncommon, being 25 and 15 percent, respectively.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup>\n\nAlthough pediatric and adult CML involves the proliferation of the same cell lineage, that is, mature granulocytes in a similar way, there are unignorable differences between them. These differences range from the micro-level such as different break-points distribution of mutations in the BCR-ABL1 gene to the macro-level such as disease progression and severity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup>\n\nThere is recent progress in understanding the role of TKIs in pediatric CML, but still, many aspects are unanswered. Efficacy of TKIs is proportional to the plasma concentration, and better outcomes have been demonstrated with a plasma concentration of 1000 ng/mL; however, this has not been studied in the pediatric population.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Also, there are no criteria explicitly validated for this population for prognostication. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines or European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria are used based on their validation for the adult CML population.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> As children have an immature skeleton and rapid growth phases, indefinite TKI therapy in them is associated with growth impairment. The side effects of TKI are not well-studied beyond 15 years of use, and as the pediatric population is expected to get it for more extended periods, the long-term side effect profile may be different from those of adults.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Discontinuation of TKI therapy in adults has been studied, and results are good, but it has not been studied yet in a prospective trial in children, hence leaving this aspect unanswered too.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> It is essential to understand the mechanism, efficacy rates, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, short-term and long-term complications, treatment-free remissions with TKI therapy in the pediatric CML population. Therefore, it will be prudent to combine whatever has been studied about TKIs in this population and provide a broader knowledge base for a better clinical practice as well as a guide for future prospective studies.\n\n4\\. Limitations\n---------------\n\nMethodological biases in the added articles may lead to uncertainties in the results of our meta-analysis. Due to limited number of available data, we will include studies with weaker evidence such as case reports, case series, and gray literature.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Mohamed A.

Introduction\n----------------\n\nLeft ventricular thrombus (LVT) is a severe and potentially fatal complication of cardiomyopathies with a reduced ejection fraction (EF). Although most frequently seen in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction or LV aneurysm, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) represents the second leading cause, with an incidence between 2% and 36%.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In addition to optimal heart failure medication, if the reduction of EF is accompanied by left bundle branch block (LBBB), cardiac electrical resynchronization is established as a very effective therapy, leading to improvement in left ventricular function.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\n2\\. Case report\n---------------\n\nWe describe the case of a 64-year-old male patient who was first referred to our institution in June 2020 for progressive shortness of breath. His medical history included a diagnosis of NICM with moderately reduced EF, LBBB, and a dual-chamber pacemaker implanted for symptomatic sick sinus node disease in 2018. The presenting electrocardiogram showed atrial synchronized paced QRS complexes with LBBB morphology .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nECG before (A) and after (B) upgrade to biventricular pacing. ECG = electrocardiogram.</u>\n\nInterrogation of the pacemaker revealed a ventricular pacing burden of 31%. Echocardiography showed a dilated left ventricle (LV; end-diastolic diameter, 71 mm; end-systolic diameter, 63 mm; end-diastolic volume, 247 mL; end-systolic volume, 210 mL), with diffuse hypokinesis and an EF of 20% with a large thrombus attached to the anteroseptal wall. We interpreted the case as LBBB/pacing-induced cardiomyopathy. The patient’s heart failure medication was optimized to the maximum tolerated doses (bisoprolol 5 mg once a day, candesartan 8 mg once a day, spironolactone 25 mg once a day), and antithrombotic treatment with apixaban 5 mg twice daily was started. One month later, echocardiography showed no reduction in thrombus size, so the patient was switched to an antivitamin K (AVK) anticoagulant with an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 3.5. Two months later, although the weekly INRs were between 3 and 6, the patient suffered significant deterioration in his clinical status, with cardiac cachexia and New York Heart Association functional class IV. Echocardiography showed an increase in left intraventricular thrombus size (73 × 26 mm, almost half of the ventricular cavity), and an EF of 15 % .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2.:\n\nEchocardiography images (apical 4 chambers and parasternal short axis) showing a massive left ventricular thrombus (A, B) and complete resolution after CRT (C, D). CRT = cardiac resynchronization therapy.</u>\n\nBecause there was a failure of the antithrombotic treatment and surgical removal of the thrombus was not an option due to the severely depressed LV function, we decided, after discussing with the patient and the family, to deliver cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) as a last resort measure.\n\nTherefore, an additional left ventricular pacing lead was placed in the midportion of the lateral branch of the coronary sinus, and the 3 leads were connected to a biventricular pacemaker without any procedural complications .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3.:\n\nFluoroscopic images in postero-anterior (A) and latero-lateral (B) incidences showing final position of the additional lead in a lateral branch of the coronary sinus.</u>\n\nThe pacemaker was set in dual-chamber pacing mode with simultaneous activation of both ventricles, with a significant narrowing of the QRS complex on the postprocedural electrocardiogram . The patient was maintained on AVK treatment with a target INR of 3.5. In addition, the heart failure medications (isoprolol, candesartan, and spironolactone) were continued at the same doses due to blood pressure limitations.\n\nThe clinical course after the procedure was favorable, with rapid improvement in heart failure symptoms, an increase in exercise tolerance, and weight gain. After 6 months, the patient had New York Heart Association functional class I and reported an excellent quality of life; echocardiography showed complete resolution of the LVT, a significant increase in LV contractility and EF (37%), and a significant decrease in LV parameters (end-diastolic diameter, 67 mm; end-systolic diameter, 58 mm; end-diastolic volume, 222 mL; end-systolic volume, 140 mL).\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nA combination of hypercoagulable status, endothelial dysfunction, and flow stasis, known as Virchow triad, represents the mainstay of thrombus formation.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> These mechanisms better describe LV thrombogenesis in ischemic cardiomyopathies, where necrotic areas due to an occluded artery can lead to aneurysm formation, a condition in which all of the above-mentioned factors are met. Less evidence is available for NICM. LBBB (either native or pacing-induced) leads to an important alteration in LV depolarization with a contraction delay between the septal and lateral walls. This affects the myocardial mechanics and workload, leading to alterations in the myocardial histological structure, enlargement of the LV, and decrease in EF.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In our patient, severe hypokinesia of the septum, apex, and anterior wall along with an overall altered geometry of the LV led to an important reduction in blood velocity, acting as a trigger and a maintenance factor for thrombosis.\n\nThe diagnosis of LVT is solely imagistic, as an incidental finding or in the event of an embolic complication. Sensitivity and specificity vary between different imaging modalities, with echocardiography being the easiest to use and readily available in clinical practice.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nWith the exception of rare cases when thrombectomy or systemic thrombolysis is indicated, the treatment of LVT relies on anticoagulation therapy. Guidelines recommend the use of AVK anticoagulants,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> with a growing body of evidence on non-antivitamin K anticoagulants (NOACs), suggesting their effectiveness and safety in cases of AVK failure/infeasibility.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe response to treatment was inconsistent, with rates of thrombus resolution at follow-up visits between 54% and 81%.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In our case, despite correct treatment with both AVKs and NOACs, thrombogenic factors overcame the effects of anticoagulant therapy, preventing thrombus resolution.\n\nThe impact on mortality and morbidity of LVT resides from embolization into systemic circulation, with a comparable 12-month incidence between ICM and NICM.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Little evidence is available on massive LVT, and the majority of cases are described in the context of ICM and large aneurysms.\n\nCRT has been extensively evaluated in several randomized trials and has shown significant benefits in terms of morbidity and mortality. It restores the altered LV activation, leading to positive remodeling删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> and is now recommended with a class I indication in the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines for patients with reduced EF and LBBB.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Our patient was no exception, showing significant improvement in myocardial contraction and a reduction in both diastolic and systolic volumes. We believe that the increase in contractility, especially at the septal and anterior wall, together with the normalization of the geometry of the LV, led to an increase in blood velocity, thereby eliminating the trigger for further blood coagulation. In turn, anticoagulant treatment and the endogenous fibrinolytic system slowly and completely resolved the existing thrombus.\n\nThe distinctive features of the case were the important size of the LVT without embolic complications, unresponsiveness to anticoagulant therapy, and prompt and complete resolution after CRT.\n\nThis case showed once more the importance and effectiveness of CRT on positive LV remodeling, especially in NICM patients,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> a therapy that should be implemented as soon as the current recommended guideline indications are met, in order to prevent severe complications.\n\nThe major limitation of the data presented resides in the sample size (a single case report) and the relatively short follow-up period (only 6 months). Considering the existing data on different mechanisms of thrombus resolution of rivaroxaban, another limitation of our case report was the use of apixaban only from the NOACs available.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Further studies are required to accurately correlate CRT with thrombus resolution.\n\n4\\. Conclusions\n---------------\n\nAlthough LVT is less frequent in NICM than in ICM, it is associated with a similar complication rate. Anticoagulant treatment has variable effects on thrombus regression. In patients with LBBB, CRT leads to positive remodeling of the LV, improving LV function, and eliminating the triggers for thrombosis. The presence of LVT should not delay resynchronization therapy, as this could be the only effective therapy for thrombus resolution.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nConceptualization: Catalin Pestrea, Ecaterina Cicala, Geanina Catanescu, Alexandra Gherghina, Irina Pintilie, Diana Gurzau, Dana Pop.\n\nIdeas: Catalin Pestrea, Ecaterina Cicala, Alexandra Gherghina, Irina Pintilie, Dana Pop.\n\nData curation: Catalin Pestrea, Ecaterina Cicala, Alexandra Gherghina, Irina Pintilie.\n\nFormal analysis: Catalin Pestrea, Ecaterina Cicala.\n\nMethodology: Catalin Pestrea, Ecaterina Cicala, Alexandra Gherghina, Irina Pintilie, Dana Pop.\n\nProject administration: Catalin Pestrea, Dana Pop.\n\nSupervision: Catalin Pestrea, Dana Pop.\n\nValidation: Catalin Pestrea, Dana Pop.\n\nWriting–original draft: Catalin Pestrea, Ecaterina Cicala, Alexandra Gherghina, Irina Pintilie, Dana Pop.\n\nWriting–review & editing: Catalin Pestrea, Ecaterina Cicala, Geanina Catanescu, Alexandra Gherghina, Irina Pintilie, Diana Gurzau, Dana Pop.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:30:22", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:33:30", "cost": 188.288}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:20", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:33:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:30:21"}

Introduction\n----------------\n\nLung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with a 5-year survival rate of 18 to 27%.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the major pathological lung cancer subtype, accounts for approximately 85% of all cases. Most patients with NSCLC are frequently diagnosed with advanced or metastatic disease.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Recently, immunotherapy emerged as a major form of cancer treatment, among which, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) showed favorable results against various tumors, including NSCLC. Unlike conventional anticancer treatments that exert considerable cytotoxicity against tumors and healthy tissue, or targeted therapy approaches, ICI therapy reinvigorates the host’s immune surveillance capacity by blocking immune evasion driven by malignant tumors.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> ICI monotherapy has low objective response rate (ORR); yet, the survival benefit due to its low side effects and long-lasting effect is considered advantageous. The treatment outcomes of ICI therapy are also influenced by PD-L1 expression rate, a representative predictive biomarker.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Previous studies reported positive association between treatment response rates and the expression of the standard biomarker, PD-L1; however, other studies presented conflicting results that underscored the predictive value.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In a trial of 272 NSCLC patients, PD-L1 expression had no beneficial association with prediction of prognosis.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nEvidence for the efficacy of biomarkers, such as tumor mutational burden, DNA mismatch repair deficiency, and CD8 T-cell density, as predictive biomarkers for ICI treatment response are increasing.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>9–11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However, since the immune response is a complex system with a stochastic nature, it must be approached from the systemic level with a broad repertoire.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Therefore, new approaches, such as pattern identification diagnosis system, are warranted.\n\nPattern identification is a systemic and holistic diagnostic system that plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment process, including herbal medicine, which stems from traditional oriental medicine. This diagnostic process is carried out by collecting and analyzing clinical data of the patient’s symptoms and signs including tongue and pulse measurements.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Pattern identification is broadly classified into cold, heat, Yin, Yang, excessiveness, and deficiency states, each of which describes a specific state of imbalance in the theory of whole-body system.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Many clinical experts in oriental medicine believe that the preferential Yin-cold (YC) or Yang-heat (YH) diagnostic process can guide an approximate pattern identification diagnosis later.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> A previous study investigated the association between Yin-cold or Yang-heat pattern identification and EGFR mutations in NSCLC patients and found that EGFR mutations (45.24% vs 25.95%; YC vs YH) were more frequent in the Yin-cold pattern identification.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nIn the pattern identification system, when the human body loses its balance and tilts to the Yang-heat pattern identification, enhanced autoimmune activation occurs, while immune suppression occurs when inclined to the Yin-cold pattern identification.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>17</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In this regard, it is similar to the theory of critical transition, a pattern seen in complex systems including the immune system.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The clinically common pattern identification types related to NSCLC or lung cancer are Qi deficiency (or Fei-Pi-Qi deficiency), Yin deficiency (or Yin deficiency with internal heat), and combined Qi and Yin deficiency. Indeed, co-administration of different herbal medicines with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors according to the type of pattern identification diagnosis has contributed to an improved progression-free survival (PFS) in clinical trials with NSCLC patients.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nIn an observational study of lung cancer patients, Yin deficiency was associated with dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1α, IFN, and IL-2 compared to those without Yin deficiency.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However, the molecular basis for different pattern identifications in cancer remains to be fully characterized. Furthermore, it is more complex to predict the immune profile for different pattern identification in ICI-treated patients due to the different mechanisms between ICI therapy and conventional chemotherapy.\n\nTherefore, an observational study of pattern identification in patients receiving ICI therapy is warranted to observe differences in survival, treatment response, and immune profile according to pattern identification during ICI therapy and how pattern identification changes during the course of NSCLC treated with ICIs. In this study, we attempt to observe and analyze the association between survival, treatment response, and immune profiles in association with pattern identification evaluated on every visit. A common goal of studies attempting to identify predictive biomarkers is to identify individuals who are likely to return to healthy state with appropriate ICI therapy. Indeed, the identification of such susceptible individuals for therapy is also characteristic of the pattern identification system, and we aim to explore the possibility of predicting treatment response of ICI therapy using pattern identification, which is to be comprehensively diagnosed with pattern identification differentiation questionnaires as well as pulse and tongue diagnosis of NSCLC patients.\n\n2\\. Previous work\n-----------------\n\nWe previously identified the degree of agreement between the results of non-face-to-face pattern identification diagnosis obtained via pattern identification questionnaires, pulse and tongue diagnostic data, and face-to-face pattern identification diagnosis. Patients had various cancer types and were not limited to lung cancer. The comparison of face-to-face with non-face-to-face pattern identification diagnosis for the cold and noncold type revealed moderate agreement (sensitivity: 0.85, specificity: 0.67, accuracy: 0.92, Kappa: 0.455 (–0.063, 0.972)). Agreement with Qi deficiency and nonQi deficiency, as well as Yin deficiency and nonYin deficiency types, was also moderate. This previous study suggested that the non-face-to-face pattern identification diagnosis system could be applied in further research in place of face-to-face diagnosis for cold/noncold and Qi/Yin deficiency pattern identification diagnosis.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>21</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nWe also conducted a pilot study comparing cytokine levels and immune profiles between cold and noncold types. The comparison was performed using blood samples from 10 NSCLC patients who underwent ICI therapy. In patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, the cold type exhibited shorter PFS than the noncold type (_P_ = .036). The cold type also correlated with a lower terminal effector CD8 T-cell proportion (_P_ = .005), a higher effector memory CD8 T-cell proportion (_P_ = .015), and lower expression of PD-L1 ligand, suggestive of the prognostic potential of pattern identification diagnosis.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>22</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\n3\\. Methods and Design\n----------------------\n\n### 3\\. 1. Study design\n\nThis is a multicenter prospective observational study protocol. Patient clinical information (survival, treatment response, quality of life, and adverse events), pattern identification (2 questionnaires, pulse, and tongue examination), and safety assessment (AEs/serious AEs (SAEs)) will be collected from patients with advanced NSCLC who will undergo either pembrolizumab or atezolizumab therapy. A flow diagram is shown in Figure 1.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nFlowchart of the multicenter, prospective, single group, observational study design.</u>\n\n### 3\\. 2. Setting\n\nThis study will be conducted in 10 academic hospitals across South Korea, namely, Korea University Guro Hospital, Asan Medical Center, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, Konyang University Hospital, Kyung Hee University Hospital, Kosin University Gospel Hospital, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Inha University Hospital, Hallym University Medical Center, as well as Chonnam National and University Hospital Hwasun Hospital. Recruitment began in August 2020 and is estimated to be completed in December 2021. All blood samples will be delivered to the central laboratory (U2Bio Co. Ltd. Seoul, Korea), where peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma will be isolated. PBMC samples are to be kept frozen in liquid nitrogen containers at the KAIST laboratory below –130 °C until all samples are collected for final batch analysis, while frozen plasma samples will be stored in the deep freezer at the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM) laboratory below –80 °C. This study, including the final analyses, is estimated to be completed before December 2022.\n\n### 3\\. 3. Study population\n\nThe full inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in Table 1. If all inclusion criteria are satisfied and none of the exclusion criteria are met, the patient will be enrolled.\n\nTable 1 - Patient eligibility criteria.\n\n| Inclusion criteria |\n| --- |\n| ►Adult patients over 19 years of age |\n| ►Patients diagnosed with stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV (TNM 8th edition) NSCLC |\n| ►Patients scheduled for immune checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab or atezolizumab) monotherapy as second- or higher-line treatment following platinum-based first-line treatment for NSCLC |\n| ►Patients with a life expectancy >6 mo |\n| ►Patients with an ECOG performance status of 0–2 |\n| ►Patients willing to voluntarily participate in this clinical study who provided written informed consent including consent to obtain biological specimen for genetic or molecular analysis by practitioners at each academic hospital |\n| Exclusion criteria |\n| ►Patients with active brain metastases with clinically significant neurological symptoms or signs |\n| ►Patients diagnosed with other new primary cancers within the last 5 years that may affect NSCLC |\n| ►Patients with autoimmune diseases that require systemic treatment |\n| ►Pregnant or lactating women |\n| ►Patients considered unsuitable for this study by investigators |\n\n_Abbreviation_: ECOG = European Cooperative Oncology Group.\n\n### 3\\. 4. Sample size calculation\n\nAs this is an observational study, it is difficult to provide a statistical basis for calculating the number of participants. Furthermore, due to the nature of the study, to the best of our knowledge, there are no relevant available data. Since this is not an efficacy evaluation study, the statistical hypothesis and effective size cannot be established via power calculation. However, considering pattern identification and demographic characteristics to be corrected by covariates, the sample size was calculated as 200 patients, with 100 patients for each ICI therapy to be administered.\n\n### 3\\. 5. Study procedures\n\nAs this is an observational study, the participants’ appointment schedule will not be affected by the time of follow-up, and the participant does not need to visit solely for data collection. Data for assessing ICI therapy efficacy, including laboratory results, are collected only if available within the research period. An overview of the study procedures is described in Table 2. Eligible outpatient participants based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be screened. Each hospital is to recruit 20 participants receiving pembrolizumab or atezolizumab monotherapy. However, when needed, we are also considering a change to a competitive recruitment strategy for achieving adequate and rapid participant enrollment. The assessment at baseline (visit 1, 0 days) must precede initiation of ICI administration. The standard visit interval is 9 weeks, but may differ at the discretion of the researcher, and the second visit is scheduled only for patient data collection 3 weeks after the first schedule of ICI administration. The second visit aims to explore the correlation between changes in immune profiles and the incidence of irAEs at the beginning of ICI therapy. Follow-up phone visit will begin after 45 weeks, and, at that point, patients who do not continue ICI therapy will be followed up via phone call to check for survival, whereas patients who continue ICI therapy will be checked for progressive disease (PD) by tumor evaluation at time of the visit after 45 weeks. In cases of ICI therapy interruption or completion for any cause, data are to collected every 9 weeks from that point until the end of the study. When PD or initiation of other cancer therapies including ICI other than pembrolizumab or atezolizumab monotherapy is confirmed, only verification of survival via phone calls will be performed. We will collect demographic information and medical history including lung cancer-related clinical information, such as date of diagnosis and TNM (AJCC 8<sup>th</sup>) staging. For imaging, CT scans will be collectively performed, and PET-CT, MRI, as well as chest and bone X-ray scans will be acquired, if necessary. Tumor assessment will be performed using RECIST version 1.1. If available, general clinical laboratory examination results, EGFR/ALK mutation test results, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data will be collected. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Lung cancer 13 (EORTC QLQ-LC13) questionnaire will be completed during visit 1 before administration, as well as on visit 7, upon PD confirmation, and early discontinuation.\n\nTable 2 - Schedule for enrollment, treatment, and assessment.\n\n| Period | Treatment & F/U | ON or OFFTx & F/U |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Visit | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Week | 0D(Baseline) | Week 3±7D | Week 9±7D | Week 18±7D | Week 27±7D | Week 36±7D | Week 45±7D | After week 45 |\n| Provided informed consent | O |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Assessment of eligibility | O |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Demographic characteristics | O |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Medical and disease history including lung cancer (TNM stages) | O |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Prior medication and treatment | O |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Physical examination(including vital signs) | O |  | O | O | O | O | O |  |\n| ECOG PS | O |  | O | O | O | O | O |  |\n| Radiological imaging | O |  | O | O | O | O | O | △ |\n| Tumor evaluation(RECIST) | O |  | O | O | O | O | O | △ |\n| Clinical laboratoryexamination includingNGS test | △ |  | △ | △ | △ | △ | △ |  |\n| Blood sample collection for immune profile | O | O | O | O | O | O | O |  |\n| EORTC QLQC30, LC13 | O |  |  |  |  |  | O |  |\n| Pattern identification | O |  | O | O | O | O | O |  |\n| ICI therapy | O | O | O | O | O | O | O |  |\n| Concomitant drug and treatment |  | O | O | O | O | O | O |  |\n| AE/SAE |  | O | O | O | O | O | O |  |\n| Survival information |  | O | O | O | O | O | O | O |\n\n_Abbreviation_: AE = adverse event, ECOG PS = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, EORTC QLQ = European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, ICI = immune checkpoint inhibitor, NGS = next generation sequencing, RECIST = response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, SAE = serious adverse event, Tx. = treatment.\n\n△ = items to be collected if data exist.\n\nWhen PD or early interruption is confirmed, data scheduled to be collected at visit 7 will be collected immediately at that point, and survival will be checked every 9 weeks.\n\n### 3\\. 6. Pattern identification diagnosis\n\nTo evaluate changes in the participants’ pattern identification, 2 different questionnaire surveys will be conducted, and the statuses of the pulse and tongue are to be diagnosed using the respective diagnostic devices. In this study, the cold-heat pattern identification questionnaire will be used to differentiate cold, noncold, heat, and nonheat type classifications. The Qi-blood-Yin-Yang deficiency pattern identification questionnaire will be used along with the measurement of tongue and pulse statuses to differentiate Qi- or Yin-deficiency. Based on the questionnaire score and the results obtained from the pulse and tongue measurement, 2 or more oriental medicine doctors will comprehensively evaluate the cases and make a definitive pattern identification diagnosis.\n\n### 3\\. 7. Questionnaires and measurements for pattern identification diagnosis\n\nCold-heat pattern identification questionnaire comprises a 5-point scale and 15 questions, with 8 questions regarding cold type and 7 questions about heat type, all of which have been sufficiently verified through item reliability evaluation, correlation coefficient analysis, and factor analysis in healthy participants in South Korea.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>23</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Furthermore, the questionnaire was reevaluated for reliability and validity in healthy participants.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Notably, the agreement between diagnosis via non-face-to-face questionnaire and face-to-face diagnosis was 82.8% in the cold type and 72.9% in the heat type.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nQi-blood-Yin-Yang deficiency pattern identification questionnaire initially included 36 questions删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>26</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>; however, it was revised following a validity and reliability pilot study with 100 participants complaining of fatigue syndrome, which ultimately resulted in a total of 15 questions.

In addition, when data from the follow-up study and previous pilot study were merged, the internal consistency of qi-deficiency, blood-deficiency, Yin-deficiency, and Yang-deficiency was found to be relatively high in 252 cases. The convergent validity evaluated by linking this questionnaire with other questionnaires showed significant correlation.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>28</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nPulse measurement: Pulse location (floating or sunken), pulse rate (slow or rapid), pulse force (strong or weak), and pulse shape (fine, slippery, rough, or surging) are to be collected using pulse diagnostic equipment (Pulse analyzer, DMP-Life, Daeyomedi Co. Gyeonggi-do, Korea) to determine the patient’s pulse status, which is crucial for the comprehensive pattern identification diagnosis process.\n\nTongue measurements: tongue color (pale, pale-red, red, or bluish purple), coated fur color (white fur or yellow fur), coated fur characteristic (thick or dry coating), and diagnostic tongue appearance (teeth-marked, enlarged, mirror, or spotted) are to be collected using tongue diagnostic equipment (Computerized tongue image analysis system, TAS-4000, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea) to examine the patient’s tongue status, which is also crucial for the comprehensive pattern identification diagnosis process.\n\n### 3\\. 8. Immune profiles and cfDNA analyses\n\nBlood samples (approximately 10 mL) will be collected intravenously in 2 EDTA tubes prior to ICI administration at every visit. Blood samples will be separately collected at visit 2, 3 weeks after the first ICI administration to evaluate the association between early phase irAE and hyper-progression. The timing of sample collection might vary depending on the clinician’s discretion. However, data will not be collected if they do not meet the data collection criteria, defining the window period as 7 days before and after each visit. PBMCs and plasma will be isolated from peripheral blood samples obtained at each time point via centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. Following nitrogen freezing, the PBMCs samples will be carried to KAIST once per year. Using dry ice, the plasma samples will be transported to KIOM once per year over 3 years.\n\nThrough multicolor FACS analysis of PBMCs samples, basic immune cell subtypes, fractions of Th1/Th2/Th17, Treg subtypes, naïve/memory/senescence markers, and the expression of immune checkpoint receptors will be measured.\n\nCytokine levels will be measured using a multiplex assay, and the Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell fractions, as well as NK activity will be measured. Tumor tissue samples will not be obtained. Frozen PBMC samples will be stored in the nitrogen tanks at the KAIST laboratory below –130 <sup>○</sup>C and analyzed after the total samples are collected. Batch analysis is expected to begin as early as August 2022. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing analysis will be performed using selected plasma samples, to confirm differences in mutation status and copy number alterations of major cancer-related genes via whole exome sequencing. We will also compare the amount of cfDNA before and after ICI therapy. Next, based on the pattern identification diagnosis data, we will analyze the correlation between survival, treatment response, immune profile, and cfDNA. Finally, we aim to identify candidate predictive markers based on pattern identification data-related analysis results.\n\n### 3\\. 9. Outcome measures\n\nPrimary endpoint: PFS. Secondary endpoints: ORR; time to response (TTR); time to tumor progression (TTP); overall survival (OS); NGS test: ROS1, BRAF, K-Ras, LKB1 (STK11), TP53, CDKN2A/B, EGFR, ALK gene mutations; PD-L1 expression rate; blood sample immune index measurements: Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine assay (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-γ), chemokine assay (CXCL10, CCL2, CXCL9, CCL5, CXCL8), granzyme B, basic immune cell subtypes, Th1, Th2, and Th17 fractions, Treg subtypes, naïve/memory/senescence markers; cfDNA; laboratory tests: WBC with differential count, RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet, ESR, glucose, BUN, Cr, calcium, LDH, AST, ALT, ALP, albumin, total bilirubin, Na, K, Cl, urine total protein; EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-LC13; pattern identification; safety assessment: irAEs, early interruption rate and reasons, as well as incidence rate of SAE/AE.\n\nEarly interruption rates are to be classified as early discontinuation rates according to abnormal cases described in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or higher, and the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic adverse drug reactions of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher. Early discontinuation is defined as failure to complete planned administration regardless of the cause or dosing regimen, except when discontinuation is due to PD. Furthermore, even if the entire schedule has been completed, cases in which the actual number of ICI doses during the treatment period is <60% of the total planned number due to toxicity will be included in the early discontinuation category.\n\n### 3\\. 10. Withdrawal criteria\n\nIf the participants agree to withdrawal, lose contact, or die, they will be excluded from this study.\n\n### 3\\. 11. Data collection, management, and monitoring\n\nWe will use iMedidata, a web-based software for data collection and management . Data collection will include demographic characteristics, vital signs and body measurements, patient history, baseline symptoms, NSCLC history, NGS test results, PD-L1 expression rate, line of therapy, past treatment history for NSCLC, laboratory test results, EORTC QLQ (-C30, -LC13), cold-heat pattern identification questionnaire, Qi-blood-Yin-Yang deficiency pattern identification questionnaire, pulse and tongue diagnosis results, tumor evaluation, overall disease status, ICI administration information, concomitant medication, AEs, and study conclusion status. Based on the paper questionnaire that the patients will respond to, the investigator will directly fill out electronic subject case report forms (e-CRF). Sufficient time will be provided to the participants to complete the questionnaires with the investigator’s assistance. All documents will be preserved in the confidential archives at the conducting center for 3 years from the completion of the study. An independent monitoring committee, made up of members of the contract research organization (CRO), will monitor the research to ensure that it is performed in accordance with the research protocol and regulations.\n\n### 3\\. 12. Quality control\n\nTo ensure smooth progression of the research, on-site training on how to use pulse and tongue equipment, as well as how to fill in the eCRF, was carried out for practitioners at each site. In addition, a brief guidebook file was produced and distributed to investigators at each site, and health guidelines were attached to the pulse and tongue diagnosis result sheets for subjects. On-site and online researcher meetings were held several times during the process of devising and revising the study protocol, and initiation meetings with the CRO were held before recruitment. The investigators were trained in standard study procedures prior to patient recruitment.\n\n### 3\\. 13. Data analysis plan\n\nA 2-sided test will be used for all statistical analyses in this study. The significance level will be set to 5%, and SASⓇ Version 9.4 (SAS institute. Inc, A, Cary, NC) statistical software will be used for analysis. The collected raw data will be used without replacing missing values. However, missing values for participants who failed the follow-up investigation during the survival analysis will be treated as censored observations. To assess differences between each pattern identification, continuous data will be analyzed using the Student independent _t_\\-test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test, while categorical data will be analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test. For PFS, the primary endpoint, the survival function for each pattern identification, and ICI therapy will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the survival function for each pattern identification will be compared and analyzed using a log-rank test. For analysis of secondary endpoints, the covariate-adjusted proportional Cox hazard model will be used to estimate variables that affect survival function for each pattern identification, ICI therapy, and treatment response.\n\n### 3\\. 14. Patient and public involvement\n\nPatients and the public will not be involved in designing, patient recruitment, or conducting the study. The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals to be made available to patients and the public.\n\n### 3\\. 15.

In this study, prior to identifying the means for predicting the treatment response of ICI therapy with pattern identification, we aimed to explore the association between treatment response and immune profiles according to pattern identification in NSCLC patients receiving ICI therapy through a broad range of immune profiles. Further we observed changes in pattern identification during the course of NSCLC treated with ICI therapy.\n\nPeripheral blood-based dynamic biomarkers have been reported to predict the response and prognosis of antiPD-1 therapy in solid tumors.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>32</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In addition, dynamic biomarkers from serially obtained samples were considered to have superior predictive power than pretreatment biomarkers that can determine susceptible individuals before therapy.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Although samples are obtained serially for dynamic biomarkers, peripheral blood samples are easier to obtain than tumor tissues.\n\nThis study acts as a preparatory study that will enable further analysis of the association between survival, response rates, and immune profile in association with pattern identification in combination therapy of ICI therapy and herbal medicine. In the next step, we will explore the common areas between ICI therapy-induced and herbal medicine-induced immune enhancement in the study of combination therapy, which are considered different concepts.

Through the results of this study and subsequent further clinical trials using herbal medicines, the possibility of identifying potential predictive system marker will become more robust.\n\n5\\. Conclusions\n---------------\n\nThis study has significance in analyzing the difference of survival, treatment response, and immune profile in association with pattern identification in NSCLC patients during ICI therapy, and will provide comprehensive data to identify pattern identification-based immune biomarkers for predicting the survival and treatment response of ICI therapy in NSCLC patients.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nJH Jang and HJ Jeon reviewed and revised the protocol and contributed equally to this manuscript as first authors.

Introduction\n----------------\n\nMechanical thrombectomy (MT) for large vessel occlusion has proved to be the new standard of therapy in acute ischemic stroke.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> A good surgical approach is closely related to the success of MT and the transfemoral approach is usually used. However, with the increasing number of elderly patients, it is often difficult and time-consuming to guide the catheter via the transfemoral approach due to severe tortuosity of the vessels and elongation of the aortic arch.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Moreover, prolonged puncture to reperfusion time is associated with poor functional outcome.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe transbrachial approach is an alternative approach when standard transfemoral access is technically difficult or impossible. Successful MT via the transbrachial approach have been described in previous case studies.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However, there are few cases study focused on the use of the transbrachial approach for MT in acute stroke with tandem occlusions. We present a case of successful recanalization via a transbrachial approach in the context of both occlusion of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) and cerebral middle artery (MCA).\n\n2\\. Case report\n---------------\n\nA 78-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled hypertension was transferred to our hospital presented with onset of the right limbs weakness for 50 minutes prior to admission at 7 am on December 30, 2016. Blood pressure at admission was 129/65 mm Hg. Neurological examination revealed severe aphasia, right-sided facial palsy, left gaze deviation and right-sided weakness. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission was 18.\n\n3\\. Preprocedural evaluation\n----------------------------\n\nThe patients underwent multimodal computed tomography (CT), comprising noncontrast CT, CT perfusion, and CT angiography before reperfusion therapy. Baseline noncontrast CT revealed no evidence of a low-density or bleeding lesions . CT perfusion were reconstructed by using MIStar software (Apollo Medical Imaging Technology, Melbourne, Australia) and revealed a large penumbra (15.8 mL) and small core (4.8 mL) with mismatch ratio (Total/Core) greater than 4 . CT angiography confirmed occlusion of the M1 segment of the left MCA and the C1 segment of the left ICA. The C7 segment of left ICA and the proximal M1 segment of the left MCA were developed which were supposed to be the first collateral flows from the anterior communicating artery. The distal portion of the left MCA was noted possibly to be the secondary collateral flows from the pial arteriole from the left anterior cerebral artery which were all actually from the right ICA .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\n(A) CT scan of the head demonstrating obvious no low-density lesion and bleeding lesion.

Technical aspects\n---------------------\n\nThe patient was then taken for emergent MT. Bilateral femoral and radial arteries were evaluated before the procedure. There were weak bilateral femoral arteries; bilateral radial artery Allen tests were positive. After induction of general anesthesia, an 8-F sheath was placed with the modified Seldinger technique in the right common femoral artery. However, the right common iliac artery was found to be occluded by angiography. We then punctured the left femoral artery with the same Seldinger technique and placed an 8-F arterial sheath. The left common iliac artery was also found to be occluded . Since no appropriate access in the traditional femoral artery locations, we selected the right brachial artery as a puncture access site via the Seldinger technique . We placed a 6-F arterial sheath. Angiography of the abdominal aorta with a 5-F pigtail angiographic catheter showed that the inferior segment was occluded . The angiography of the aortic arch by the 5F pigtail catheter demonstrated type II and the occlusion of the left ICA . Arterial angiography was performed by a 5-F Simmons 2 catheter over a 0.035 angle guidewire, clearly demonstrating left ICA occlusion  and the opened anterior communicating artery . Bilateral anterior cerebral artery angiography showed that the left M1 segment was occluded. The Simmons 2 catheter was exchanged for a 90-cm 6-F guiding sheath (Cook Flexor Raabe, Product Code G12266, Bloomington, IN) into the left carotid artery and a SL-10 microcatheter (SL-10, 6–150 cm, Boston Scientific, Cork, Ireland) combination over a 0.014-inch exchange guidewire (Synchro-14, 300 mm length, Stryker, West Valley City, UT) to pass through the occluded C1 segment of the left ICA. Angiography revealed that the C2 segment of the left ICA to the initial segment of MCA was visible . Based on angiography, Figure 4A illustrated the possible location of the thrombus. We removed the microcatheter and inflated the C1 segment slightly by a dilatation balloon (NC SPRINTER, 3.0–15 mm, Medtronic, New Delhi, India). Another angiography showed a stenosis of 70% in the left C1 segment with visible flow to the M1 segment . The guiding sheath was advanced over the left C1 segment and Rebar18 microcatheter (2.4-F, 153-cm, ev3, Medtronic, Irvine, CA) with the 0.014-inch guidewire to the M2 segment of left MCA. Angiography showed that the distal upper trunk of the left M2 segment was visible. We achieved successful retrieval with a 4 × 20 mm Solitaire FR Revascularization Device (Covidien/ev3 Endovascular, Inc, Plymouth, MN). Angiography showed antegrade flow in the left MCA with a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 3 . A SpiderFX (5.0-mm, embolic protection system, ev3, Temecula, CA) was positioned at the distal portion of the left ICA C2 segment. The 6-F guiding sheath was withdrawn to the left common carotid artery, and a pre-dilated RX balloon (Viatrac 14 Plus, 5-30 mm, Abbott, Santa Clara, CA) was inflated, improving the residual stenosis of 30% of left ICA with a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 3 . The Spider FX was removed with observation of unobstructed blood flow over 20 minutes. Re-angiography demonstrated complete recanalization of the left ICA and left MCA. The right brachial guiding sheath was then removed and hemostasis was achieved with manual compression for 15 minutes. There were no complications.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2.:\n\n(A) Angiography for the right femoral artery showing the right common iliac artery occlusion; (B) angiography for the left femoral artery showing the left common iliac artery occlusion; (C) the right brachial artery as puncture access-site by the Seldinger technique; and (D) angiography of the abdominal aorta showing the occlusion of its inferior segment.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3.:\n\n(A) The angiography of the aortic arch by the 5F pigtail catheter; (B) the angiography of left common carotid artery by a 5-F Simmons 2 catheter demonstrating left ICA occlusion; (C) right common carotid artery angiography showing the opened anterior communicating artery and a short slightly visible left MCA M1 segment; and (D) angiography passing through the C1 occluded segment of the left ICA.

A follow-up T2 weighted image examination showed a small infarction in the left internal capsule . Magnetic resonance angiography revealed moderate stenosis of the left MCA .

Discussion\n--------------\n\nEndovascular treatment via the transfemoral approach is the most commonly used approach for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with large vessel occlusion. Faster time from onset to reperfusion was associated with better 3-month functional outcomes.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Difficult catheter access to the occluded vessel during endovascular treatment of AIS leads to unacceptable delays in reperfusion and worse outcomes.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In our case, the bilateral iliac arteries were occluded, which is rare in most cases. According to the experience from carotid artery stenting, there remain some cases with difficult access to the carotid artery from the femoral artery because of the slender aortic arch or brachial trunk, type III aortic arch, extremely tortuous artery, aortic aneurysm, abdominal aortic lesions, obesity, severe peripheral vascular disease, previous iliac femoral bypass grafting and iliac artery occlusions.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> If catheter access through the femoral artery appears difficult, alternative access, including direct carotid puncture, the transradial approach or the transbrachial approach could be considered.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe transradial approach is widely used in cardiology interventional treatment with fewer complications and more comfort for patients.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However, the diameter of the radial artery is small with the maximum inserted sheath size of 6-F that cannot pass most carotid artery stent systems unless the stents are less than 8 mm in diameter. The brachial artery is larger than the radial artery in diameter and there is shorter distance to the target artery (especially for tall patients). In our case, due to the tandem occlusions, some carotid stents are not compatible with the 6-F guiding catheter system, therefore, the transbrachial approach maybe a better option. Previous study demonstreated that transbrachial approach is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for carotid artery stenting.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However, it cannot be used in the context of subclavian artery stenosis or a non-bovine left ICA take-off (due to its sharp angle) that may not solve the problem of ostial stenosis.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Common carotid artery puncture is also attempted and is acceptable in some cases when a transfemoral, brachial, or transradial approach is technically difficult. We should pay much attention when establishing direct carotid artery access to avoid potential complications due to its specific position, including arterial dissection, hematoma formation and sheath kinking, making this approach not as safe as the transbrachial approach. Lagrer studies on the transbrachial approach for endovascular treatment of AIS patients are warranted to verify its safety and efficacy.\n\nOur study has the following limitations. Firstly, the presented case study is based on a single patient, which limits the generalizability of the findings. The results may not be applicable to a broader population, and individual variations in patient characteristics and responses to treatment may not be fully represented. Secondly, the follow-up period in this case study appears to be relatively short, with outcomes assessed at discharge and a 90-day follow-up. Longer-term follow-up data are necessary to evaluate the durability and sustainability of the treatment outcomes, including functional recovery and recurrence rates. Thirdly, the case study acknowledges the need for further research to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the transbrachial approach. Larger studies involving a greater number of patients are necessary to validate the findings, assess the reproducibility of the technique, and gather more comprehensive evidence on its safety and efficacy.\n\n7\\. Conclusion\n--------------\n\nIn our case, a successful recanalization of the left ICA and left MCA via the transbrachial approach was achieved in a patient with bilateral iliac artery occlusion. The transbrachial approach is a safe and feasible alternative access for endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgements\n----------------\n\nWe thank the patient and his son for his cooperation in writing this case report.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Funding acquisition:** Peng Wang.\n\n**Methodology:** Danyu Chen.\n\n**Software:** Tianyu Jin.\n\n**Supervision:** Peng Wang.\n\n**Validation:** Jiangxian Ying, Peng Wang.\n\n**Visualization:** Jiangxian Ying, Peng Wang.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Chao Xu, Tianyu Jin, Qinpu Wang.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:44:20", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:45:11", "cost": 51.761}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:20", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:45:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:44:19"}

Introduction\n----------------\n\nMorbilliform or exanthem are eruptive skin rashes characterized by generalized erythematous papules and macules and may be accompanied by constitutional symptoms. The most common causes of morbilliform are the six classical exanthems, other viral and bacterial infections, drugs, and connective tissue diseases.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction of the skin and is usually induced by a non-viral elicitor or xenobiotic chemicals (hapten) that is absorbed into the skin and reacts with self-proteins, leading to an immune response.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2-3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Viral exanthem (VEs) have never been reported to occur following influenza vaccines. Combined post-vaccination VE and ACD pose a diagnostic challenge requiring a comprehensive anamnesis and management approach to correctly identify the offender. We report a case of exanthem triggered nine days after the administration of the flu vaccine, complicated by the development of lime-soap-induced ACD.\n\n2\\. Case presentation\n---------------------\n\nA 33-year-old Asian nurse woman with a past medical history of glioblastoma multiforme grade IV treated by surgery and chemotherapy in 2018 presented to the dermatology clinic complaining of nonpainful lesions on the chest , right and left axilla, both palms, volar side of both wrists, and both flanks. These lesions erupted in the vesicular rash and appeared over the chest, neck, axilla, and ventral side of the wrists, palms, and flanks nine days after receiving the seasonal flu vaccine (influvac tetra \\[Abbott Biologicals BV\\]; a vaccine with purified, inactivated fragments from four types of influenza virus). The patient had previously received influenza vaccines with no complications. The patient reported no respiratory symptoms or signs of systemic involvement. She was not on any new medications and did not use any new cosmetics on her skin. In addition, she had no medical history of herpes or measles. Key clinical features, as described above, favored VE删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>; however, a skin biopsy from the trunk lesion was performed and confirmed nonspecific perivascular dermatitis consistent with the clinical impression of the VE . The fungal staining results were negative. No other symptoms were described; clinical examination, apart from skin lesions, was unremarkable, and general blood tests were normal. Blood tests for herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster antibodies were ordered, but the patient did not undergo the tests. The patient was started empirically with valacyclovir 500mg twice daily for VE. Four days later, the patient reported worsening and increasing the size of skin lesions with an extensive eruption of bullae on the neck and chest . Reevaluation with a further intake of detailed history revealed the use of lemon soap over the lesions. She had never previously used lemon soap. ACD was diagnosed and the lesion regressed with dexamethasone (8mg intramuscular) for three days. At that time, she was off valacyclovir. Complete resolution was achieved 18 days after the initial presentation. The patient was reluctant to undergo further work-up.\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nExanthematous drug reactions account for up to 95% of all druginduced cutaneous manifestations, and lesions symmetrically spread to the body parts and are characterized by subtle vacuolar interface dermatitis and a superficial perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils. VE is similar and can be a pruritic vesicular eruption occurring on the trunk, limbs, and face or maculopapular删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>; however, it lacks tissue eosinophilia.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Therefore, the diagnosis is mainly clinical and requires the exclusion of other diagnoses. The only triggering factor found in our patient was the flu vaccine, and a lack of tissue eosinophilia supported VE diagnosis.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nEruption skin lesions following influenza vaccination. 1A. Initial lesions of viral exanthem on the neck and chest nine days following flu vaccine. 1B. Extensive vesicular eruptions on the neck and chest following use of Lime soap 13days after flu vaccination.</u>\n\nIn this case, allergic contact dermatitis was clinically suggested and was treated with a good response. No common components were found between the influenza vaccine and lime soap. The underlying mechanism may be infectious or parainfectious for the first time, and immunological in the subsequent presentation. Post-influenza vaccination VE and ACD are rarely described in the literature.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Patients can safely receive subsequent vaccinations, especially if a vaccine does not contain the culprit component.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2.:\n\nHistopathologic features of viral exanthem reaction following influenza vaccine administration. 2A High-power view of the perivascular inflammation with predominant lymphocytic.

H&Ex200.</u>\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, influenza vaccination is associated with musculoskeletal and neurological complications.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Skin rashes such as bullous eruptions and vasculitis have been reported,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>5,7</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> but VE has seldom been reported following influenza vaccination. Only one case of herpes simplex virus -2 reactivation and myelitis following influenza vaccination has been reported. The patient had blisters on the back associated with severe herpes simplex virus type 2 infection.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However, data on the rate of such complications are scarce in the literature. Apart from the skin lesions, the timeline from vaccination to skin lesions is important for determining the causative relationship. In cutaneous vasculitis following the flu vaccine, seven days were reported from vaccination to skin lesions.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> As there are no previous reports of VE in association with the flu vaccine, we suggest that lesions may be expected to occur within 10 days of vaccination. However, the possibility of unrelated VEs to flu shots cannot be completely excluded. However, the patient described feeling unwell since vaccination, which may suggest a relationship to vaccination. Additionally, she had no evidence of low immunity during this period in her life, and she experienced no contact with sick people with similar illnesses to suggest transmission.\n\nHere, we present an unusual case of viral exanthem following influenza vaccination complicated by allergic contact dermatitis to lemon soap applied to the lesions. The treating physician needs to be alert to recent vaccinations (like the flu vaccine in our case) and new consumer products (such as using lemon soap in our case). It is imperative to obtain a detailed anamnesis and revisit the patient’s medical history every time new symptoms are noted or clinical signs worsen or remain unresolved. The information provided by this will allow one to identify the possible triggering factors and understand the mechanism of how a newly onset skin lesion arises. Consequently, a diagnosis and management plan can be established accurately.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nAll authors listed have made a substantial, direct, and intellectual contribution to the work and approved it for publication.\n\n**Conceptualization:** AFMA, SAA, MAA.\n\n**Data curation:** AFMA, AMA, SAA, TSI, MAA.\n\n**De**fi**nition of intellectual content:** AFMA, AMA, SAA, MAA.\n\n**Design:** AFMA, SAA, MAA.\n\n**Investigation &Methodology:** AFMA, AMA, SAA, MAA.\n\n**Literature search:** AFMA, AMA, SAA, TSI, MAA.\n\n**Manuscript preparation:** AFMA, SAA, MAA.\n\n**Manuscript review and approval:** AFMA, AMA, TSI, MAA.\n\n**Project administration:** AMA, MAA.\n\n**Resources, Supervision, Validation:** AMA, MAA.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:47:54", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:48:04", "cost": 9.993}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:20", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:48:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:47:53"}

Introduction\n----------------\n\nStereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is hypofractionated, high dose, high precision irradiation for trunk lesion(s). SBRT for early-stage lung cancer, especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is characterized by a high local control rate and low severe toxicity incidence.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In addition, SBRT as the first-line therapy is now rapidly increasing in both the number and rate.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nEarly and/or late adverse events often occur after SBRT radiation although severe toxicity is relatively few.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Adverse events after SBRT for NSCLC can involve organs such as the lung parenchyma, bronchi, central airway, esophagus, large vessels, and chest wall.\n\nMuscular cells are known to be relatively resistant to radiation stress. Hence, only few reports of adverse events of muscles have been presented in the past compared to other tissues.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Here, we report a case in which we experienced chest wall myositis and necrosis as a late adverse event of SBRT for NSCLC.\n\n2\\. Case\n--------\n\nA 90-year-old male patient, who had been diagnosed with colon cancer, was referred to the respiratory department for evaluation of left upper lung consolidation found during metastasis screening computed tomography (CT). The consolidation was becoming enlarged through 3 years of follow-up, and he underwent a bronchoscopic biopsy and was diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma (stage 1A3). SBRT was chosen as a definitive therapy because of his high age for surgery but good performance status (PS = 0). Informed consent was obtained from the patient and his family. A total dose of 48 Gy at 12 Gy per fraction was delivered using a stereotactic body irradiation technique with a 6 MV photon beam . No severe acute complications occurred during the treatment, and the radiotherapy was well tolerated. The patient developed a maximum of Grade I dermatitis as an acute adverse event, which was successfully managed palliatively. Six months after radiation, his left anterior thorax became swollen and became hot and painful without obvious cutaneous injury . CT and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed under suspicion of intramuscular hemorrhage because he was taking an anticoagulant. Additionally, the acquired images suggested inflammation and necrosis of pectoral muscles and subcutaneous fat tissue . The pain and heat sensation spontaneously remitted within 6 weeks. However, the affected area became hardened, and the swollen, which remained for 18 months after radiation . The tumor had not recurred and no serious late adverse events other than soft tissue swelling were observed 3 years after the treatment.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\n(A) GTV (red line) and PTV (blue line) and (B) isodose lines in treatment planning CT.

CT and contrast-enhanced MRI finding after 3 months of SBRT in our case suggested not only inflammation, intramuscular and subcutaneous fat T2 hyperintensity, but also necrosis, non-enhanced area with peripheral enhancement. Our case seems to be different from soft tissue fibrosis after SBRT, both in terms of onset time and MRI findings.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The affected area almost coincided with the isodose line of 28.8 Gy. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of the image-proven inflammation and necrosis that occurred at chest wall muscles as an adverse event of SBRT, see删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> for paraspinal muscles.\n\nRadiation myositis after SBRT occurs in low frequency at 1.9%.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Furthermore, only 1 case was reported of chest wall muscle myositis after SBRT, which was suspected in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography CT.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Very little research is available because muscles are resistant to radiation.\n\nLockney et al reported a case of radiation myositis on paraspinal muscles with biologically effective dose and equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions of 82.7 Gy and 55.2 Gy, respectively<sup>.[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup> In our case, the irradiation dose (biologically effective dose = 80.6 Gy, equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions = 53.8, if 28.8 Gy irradiated and α/β = 4) was very close to that of the previous study. Hence, presuming the presence of radiation myositis could be reasonable.\n\nEstimating the presence of radiation myositis and necrosis is difficult in our patient’s case. Several studies have reported that radiation myositis occurred with the recall phenomenon,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> although the patient in our case had not received any chemotherapy.\n\nHis advanced age might have some role. However, Mancini et al compared SBRT complications in elderly (≥75 years) and younger patients with NSCLC and revealed no significant difference between the overall incidence of Grade ≥ 3 acute and late adverse events and age cohorts.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Furthermore, severe chest wall pain occurred only in the younger cohort (2/125). This seems to contradict with our hypothesis, but the number of chest wall pain incidences was too small to come to a clear conclusion.\n\nThe patient in our case developed radiation myositis and necrosis, contrary to the previous report.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Once these complications occur, it is not difficult to imagine that the patient’s quality of life will be greatly reduced. Hence, we should be aware of the fact that the elderly may be at increased risk of developing radiation myositis even if they do not receive any chemotherapy after SBRT.\n\n4\\. Conclusion\n--------------\n\nWe experienced radiation myositis and necrosis of the chest wall muscles accompanied by SBRT for NSCLC. We should be aware that these adverse events could occur on the patient without special background.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Project administration:** Gen Suzuki.\n\n**Resources:** Daisuke Shimizu.\n\n**Supervision:** Daisuke Shimizu, Sho Seri, Gen Suzuki, Hideya Yamazaki, Kei Yamada.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Shoko Hirano.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Daisuke Shimizu, Gen Suzuki, Hideya Yamazaki, Kei Yamada.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:22:25", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:23:10", "cost": 44.991}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:20", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:23:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:22:24"}

Introduction\n----------------\n\nThe frequency of synchronous malignant tumors in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral tongue is relatively low (2%), with the oral cavity being the most frequent secondary site, followed by the pharynx.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nIn patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Negative Neck (N0) is usually managed by Lateral Node Dissection. Systemic histopathologic examination of all excised lymph nodes (LNs) guides the detection of occult metastatic deposits. The incidence of asymptomatic well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas with metastatic potential to cervical LNs represents an unexpected finding in these patients.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe detection of a synchronous malignant tumor is critical because it is associated with decreased overall survival and may lead to treatment failure or mortality of patients with SCC of the oral tongue.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nProper treatment of the thyroid gland is debatable when metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC is incidentally encountered during neck dissection for the index treatment of primary SCC of the oral tongue, considering the good prognosis for thyroid cancer and the difficulty to find the primary tumor. The thyroid primary is often extremely small and not evident with gross examination, which needs greater attention and therapeutic supervision.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nOccult or sub-clinical thyroid carcinomas are not uncommon. Metastasis from thyroid carcinoma may be found incidentally during neck dissection for head and neck SCC (HNSCC). The prevalence of thyroid metastasis was estimated at 0.3% to 1.6%.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nCollision tumors are defined as 2 histologically distinct neoplasms that originate from topographically separate primaries, and abut and intermix with 1 another. The main site for intermixing of 2 tumors is the LN. Clinical manifestation of collision tumors may be 2 separate carcinomas that metastasize to the same LN or a carcinoma metastasis to a LN that already contains a malignant lymphoma. There are no areas of transition between the 2 tumors. However, collision tumors can be summarized as tumor-to-tumor metastasis with exceedingly rare incidence.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThere is no consensus regarding therapeutic decisions motivated by incidental discovery of thyroid metastases. Total thyroidectomy should be systematic according to León et al; while Fliegelman et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> and Périé et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> considered no aggressive therapy on the thyroid gland is necessary in most cases.\n\nComplete surgical treatment of the thyroid cancer (total thyroidectomy with level VI dissection) is appropriate for a selected population, especially in prognostically good HNSCC with a synchronous thyroid carcinoma.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\n2\\. Case report\n---------------\n\nA 28-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of tongue lesion. Oral examination revealed an ulcero-infiltrative mass located at the right side of the oral tongue, not reaching tongue midline, encroaching upon floor of the mouth, the tonsil and base of the tongue without infiltration or extension. Neck examination revealed a clinically suspicious palpable LN at ipsilateral neck level II. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast showed a well-defined soft tissue mass affect right postero-lateral aspect of tongue, minimally displacing the midline to contralateral side with no extension to median raphe or tongue base. It measures 2 × 1.4 × 1.8 cm. Few bilateral submental, submandibular, upper, and lower deep cervical LN. The largest was the right submandibular, about 10 mm. Neck us revealed multiple enlarged suspicious LNs are seen in right upper and lower deep cervical region, some of them show oval shape with lobulated border and distorted hilum and other show rounded shape with eccentric distorted hilum measuring (1 × 0.7 cm). A suspicious 1-cm right sided thyroid nodule of TIRADS-4c criteria was noted. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology for the thyroid nodule was not conclusive. Metastatic workup was done in the form of chest computed tomography without contrast, showing no metastatic nodules. Wedge biopsy showed a picture of squamous cell carcinoma (acantholytic type). The patient was diagnosed with SCC grade III of the oral tongue at clinical stage T2N1M0.\n\nAfter a thorough multidisciplinary team discussion and patient counseling, compartmental resection and right-sided modified radical block neck dissection (type III) in addition to diagnostic right hemithyroidectomy were done; the defect was reconstructed by posteriorly based buccinator myo-mucosal flap, which was followed by a completion thyroidectomy in a next session. The postoperative pathology was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with free all surgical margins. No perineural invasion. Pathologic tumor-node-metastasis stage: pT2 N1, STAGE III at least. The right thyroid lobe showed papillary thyroid carcinoma with microscopic extra-thyroid extension and lympho-vascular emboli, and free subsequently resected left lobe. Pathologic tumor-node-metastasis stage: pT1 N1 stage 1. Five out of 11 dissected LNs were infiltrated by papillary thyroid carcinoma with one of them is positive for both papillary thyroid carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nHistopathologic examination revealed nests and sheets of squamous epithelial cells infiltrating the tongue (A, H&E; 4×). In addition, the right lobe of the thyroid showed evident papillary thyroid carcinoma (B, H&E; 4×). Both papillary thyroid carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma metastasis to the same lymph node as neighbors “ arrows point to squamous carcinoma” (C, H&E; 4× and D, H&E; 10×). H&E = hematoxylin and eosin.</u>\n\nThe patient was referred for radiotherapy and clinical oncology department. She was scheduled to receive external beam radiotherapy and radioactive iodine. She received external beam radiotherapy for 35 sessions in 50 Grays. After that she received 150 mL radioactive iodine.\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nThe detection of a synchronous malignant tumor is critical, because it is associated with decreased overall survival and may lead to treatment-failure or the death of patients with SCC of the oral tongue.\n\nThe incidence of collision tumors is exceedingly rare. To date, there are only 4 published case reports. Three of them showed collision phenomenon in a pelvic LN and originated primarily from prostate and bladder cancers.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>6–8</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The other report documented 2 perithyroidal nodes and a delphian node that contained both metastatic thyroid medullary and papillary carcinoma.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe first reported case of collision metastasis of SCC of the oral tongue and incidental TPC in a single cervical LN was published by Lim et al.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nIn case of association of PTC and HNSCC, the survival rate depends on the stage of SCC.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nTill the date of this work, the reported cases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma coexistent with tongue SCC are only 13.\n\nSince level I to V cervical LNs are resected during surgical treatment of oral SCC and the most common site of drainage in the PTC is level VI cervical LNs, the actual incidence is expected to be higher in laryngeal or pharyngeal more than oral cancer.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe more frequent incidental discovery of thyroid carcinoma metastasis in neck dissection specimens may suggest different histopathological detection methods. The very meticulous HPE in every cervical LN at every level (sectioned every 3 mm, and stained by HES, then analyzed by light microscopy) differs from the analysis of the only first section involved by HNSCC LN metastasis.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nIn earlier study by Clark and colleagues, thyroid cancer was incidentally discovered during management of 16 out of 1516 patients for head and neck cancer. Only 1 had tongue carcinoma. No evidence of thyroid carcinoma was found in thyroid tissue in 2 patients with metastatic LNs.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Another study of Butler shows among 4 documented cases of dual head and neck SCC and thyroid carcinoma, a single case was diagnosed as a synchronous tongue and thyroid cancer.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nPérié et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> found higher incidence of coinciding head and neck SCC and thyroid carcinoma, about 7.9% patients (21 case of thyroid cancer including 13 PTC and 8 follicular thyroid carcinomas among 266 HNSCC including 7 cases of oral SCC, with 1 patient of tongue cancer).\n\nIn a large sample study of Vassilopulou-Sellin et al,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> 8 cases of synchronous thyroid (4 PTC and 4 follicular thyroid carcinomas) were reported among 2855 cases of tongue cancer. The incidence of thyroid metastasis was 0.3% in specimen of block neck dissection but only for tongue cancer. In a follow-up interval of 5 years, the cause of mortality in 50% of patients was the primary SCC of tongue not thyroid carcinoma. They concluded that in the absence of any clinical and radiological thyroid abnormality, no invasive thyroid treatment is required.\n\nAshraf et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> studied 250 laryngeal SCC patients whom managed by laryngectomy and block neck dissection. He found synchronous occurrence of SCC and PTC in 3 patients after resected thyroid lobes and in only 1 patient in cervical LNs. He recommended a preoperative ultrasonography and image-guided fine needle aspiration of any uncertain thyroid lesion in cases prepared for laryngectomy.\n\nLeón et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> investigated the PTC coexistent with HNSCC in 5 men and reported an incidence of 1.5%. Unsuspected thyroid tissue was found in cervical LNs in 11 out of the 752 patients (incidence of 1.5%) with HNSCC whom underwent block neck dissection. Five of them were occult PTC, while the other 6 cases showed benign thyroid follicles collection which were considered benign thyroid inclusions. Among 5 PTC patients, thyroidectomy was performed in 3. Occult PTC was found in 1 case. No patient had any kind of relapse of thyroid disease during follow-up.\n\nMoreover, Resta et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> examined a series of 66 HNSCC patients with pathologic cervical LN, and revealed incidental occult PTC in 8 patients, 1 with tongue carcinoma while the remaining were laryngeal cancer. Out of the 8, 4 patients underwent thyroidectomy during laryngectomy (for surgical exposure) or after histopathologic LN analysis; a focus of PTC was detected in 1 patient. Three of the 8 patients died from SCC recurrence; no patient presented any clinical evidence of thyroid malignancy. The more aggressive cancer (HNSCC) determined the prognosis of nearly all patients, with only one of the referred cases died of cerebellar metastases from the thyroid cancer. They highlighted the importance of an accurate reassessment and follow-up of patients with incidental occult metastases for detection of a primary thyroid carcinoma. It was concluded that the choice of treatment of patients with coexisting cancers determined by poor prognosis is difficult, and contradicting opinions exist regarding the use of thyroidectomy and the subsequent management.\n\nAnsari-Lari et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> studied 1337 patients who underwent cervical lymph node dissection. They found that 27 patients (2.0%) had at least 1 LN hiding an unexpected outcome. Sixteen (1.2%) had conclusive histologic evidence of an unexpected neoplasm, including 6 patients (0.4%) with lymphomas and 10 patients (0.7%) with PTC (6 HNSCC, 1 basal cell carcinoma, 1 melanoma, 1 medullary thyroid carcinoma, and the last case was parathyroid carcinoma). The remaining 11 patients (0.8%) had LN harboring “benign” thyroid inclusions (7 patients) or psammoma bodies (4 patients) in whom thyroidectomy was done. However, no occult PTC was detected in the ipsilateral thyroid. They reported a single case among the 27 died of the incidentally discovered neoplasm.\n\n4\\. Conclusion\n--------------\n\nAlthough the extreme rarity of this synchronous tumor may make it impossible to draw a significant conclusion regarding proper treatment of thyroid disease, it is important to be aware that even when primary head and neck SCC is at an advanced stage, a cure is possible. Active management of the thyroid carcinoma should be considered because it may affect prognosis, as in the present case.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Investigation:** Khadiga M.

Part of this complex perioperative management is goal-directed hemodynamic therapy (GDHT), which can be guided by invasive or non-invasive measurement of hemodynamic parameters. GDHT reduced the incidence of postoperative complications in major abdominal surgery and some orthopaedic procedures<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1–3]</u></a></sup> and improved outcomes of major surgery.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4–6]</u></a></sup> Optimal preload is mandatory for achieving adequate cardiac output and oxygen supply to organs and tissues. Patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures are at risk of inadequate intravascular volume for several reasons. Diuretics are often administered to reduce cerebral oedema. Fluid intake may be reduced, and these patients are at risk of blood loss. Hypovolemia decreases blood flow and oxygen delivery and results in organ dysfunction.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Fluid overload may also facilitate cerebral oedema. For these and other reasons, appropriate fluid management is a challenge. Static or dynamic measurements can guide fluid therapy. However, static parameters such as central venous pressure or mean arterial pressure (MAP), although commonly used, are poor predictors of fluid responsiveness.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u></a></sup> Dynamic parameters such as stroke volume variation (SVV) have been shown to predict fluid responsiveness sensitively.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u></a></sup> Current knowledge regarding the effect of fluid management on patient-orientated outcomes in neurosurgery is limited.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 1.2 Objectives\n\nThis study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of GDHT guided by non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring in patients undergoing elective neurosurgical procedures.\n\n### 1.3 Trial design\n\nThis is a two-arm prospective pilot randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio comparing the safety and feasibility of perioperative fluid management guided by non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring with standard fluid management in neurosurgery.\n\n2 Methods: Participants, interventions, and outcomes\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2.1 Study setting\n\nThe study will take place in operating rooms and intensive care units of University Hospital Brno, an academic hospital in the Czech Republic.\n\n### 2.2 Eligibility criteria\n\nAll patients admitted to the hospital who are scheduled for elective neurosurgery will be screened for inclusion criteria. After informed consent is obtained, each patient will be randomised to one of the trial arms. Randomisation will occur before surgery.\n\nThe inclusion criteria are as follows:\n\n*   1\\. Age ≥ 18 years\n*   2\\. Expected duration of surgery ≥ 2 hours\n*   3\\. Written informed consent\n*   4\\. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) category I–III\n\nExclusion criteria are as follows:\n\n*   1\\. ASA category IV\n*   2\\. Surgery for traumatic brain injury or acute haemorrhagic stroke\n*   3\\. Osmotherapy used prior surgery\n*   4\\. Operation position other than lateral or supine\n*   5\\. Awake neurosurgery\n*   6\\. Unavailability of hemodynamic monitoring\n\n### 2.3 Who will take informed consent\n\nA trained study investigator will describe the study to patients or authorised surrogates when necessary. Patients (or authorised surrogates) will also receive information sheets. The study investigator will discuss the study with patients (or authorised surrogates) and will cover all items on the information sheet. The study investigator will obtain written consent from patients (or authorised surrogates) willing to participate in the trial. In the case of patients’ inability to consent because of a medical condition, the ability to participate in the trial will be assessed by a medical council consisting of one independent physician informed of the study details and one study investigator.\n\n### 2.4 Additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data and biological specimens\n\nNot applicable.\n\nAncillary studies using participant data and biological specimens are not planned.\n\n### 2.5 Interventions\n\n#### 2.5.1 Explanation for the choice of comparators\n\nPerioperative fluid administration is based on an assessment of the patient's current hemodynamic status. The hemodynamic status is assessed by interpretation of standard measurement of vital signs, especially blood pressure and heart rate. This approach will serve as the comparator for intervention, which will consist of protocol-driven fluid administration based on non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring.\n\n#### 2.5.2 Intervention description\n\nDuring the operation, standard monitoring of vital functions will be introduced in one arm (STANDARD). Standard monitoring consists of continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, pulse oximetry, invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure, and monitoring of end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> level. Perioperative fluid therapy and administration of vasoactive agents will be conducted entirely according to decisions by the attending anaesthetist. Postoperative therapy will be fully controlled and will depend on the decisions of the attending physician. In the second arm (GDHT), in addition to standard vital signs monitoring (ECG, pulse oximeter, invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring), non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring using the STARLINKSV device (Cheetah Medical Inc. 600SE Maritime Ave Suite 220, Vancouver, WA, USA) will be introduced. Comprehensive hemodynamic monitoring will begin after the induction of general anaesthesia. The basal infusion will be initiated with a crystalloid balanced solution at 3 ml/kg/h using an infusion pump in this arm. First, the optimal cardiac index (CI) will be estimated. Optimal CI will be achieved when the SVV will be below 15%. If the SVV value is above 15%, boluses of 250 ml of fluid will be given until the SVV value falls below 15% and optimal CI is estimated. Additional fluids will be administered during surgery in the form of 250 ml boluses if SVV rises above 15%. If the SVV is above 15% and the CI decreases with fluid boluses, inotropic therapy will be initiated. In case of hypotension with MAP below 65 mmHg and SVV above 15%, a bolus of fluids will be given. In case of hypotension with MAP below 65 torr and SVV below 15%, vasopressors will be initiated. Postoperative therapy will depend entirely on the decision of the attending physician. In the postoperative period, members of the study team will assess the incidence of postoperative complications regularly. Patient participation will end on the day of hospital discharge.\n\n#### 2.5.3 Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions\n\nThe study participant should be withdrawn from the study if any of the following criteria are met:\n\n*   1\\. The study participant withdraws consent for ongoing study participation\n*   2\\. There are adverse events (AE) related to the study intervention (at the discretion of the investigator)\n*   3\\. Study interventions are stopped because pulmonary oedema or cardiac decompensation is suspected\n\n#### 2.5.4 Strategies to improve adherence to interventions\n\nWe will strive to improve adherence to interventions. Training of physicians involved in the study will be performed before the start of the study. The training will consist of a detailed discussion of the protocol with anaesthesiologists and neurosurgeons. The GDHT algorithm will be made available in the operating theatre in the form of a laminated card. Adherence to interventions the protocol will be monitored daily by designated trial staff.\n\n### 2.6 Relevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited during the trial\n\nStudy participants will receive standard of care according to local standards and guidelines regarding administering anaesthesia, pressure ulcer prophylaxis, and artificial ventilation management during anaesthesia.\n\n### 2.7 Provisions for post-trial care\n\nNot applicable. Post-trial care is not planned. This is a feasibility study, and the results may serve to plan future studies.\n\n### 2.8 Outcomes\n\n#### 2.8.1 Primary outcome measures:\n\nThe primary outcome is the number of patients with AE. AE is defined as:\n\n*   1\\. unsatisfactory brain tissue relaxation at the end of surgery assessed by neurosurgeon\n*   2\\. brain oedema requiring therapy\n\nIncidence of AE will be compared between control and intervention groups. Brain tissue relaxation will be assessed by neurosurgeon after durotomy and at the end of the surgery just before suture of dura. The brain tissue relaxation will be categorised in four categories: 1 - fully relaxed, 2 - sufficiently relaxed, 3 - stiff, 4 - bulging. Categories 3 and 4 will be considered as unsatisfactory.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup>\n\nBrain oedema requiring therapy is defined as any change of patient's status which will be considered as related to development or worsening of brain oedema and which will require any pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention.\n\n#### 2.8.2 Secondary outcome measures:\n\n##### 2.8.2.1 Feasibility\n\nFeasibility criteria are summarised in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 - Feasibility criteria.\n\n| Trial process | Outcome measure | Feasibility criteria |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Screening | Percentage of potentially eligible patients missed | < 55% of potentially eligible patients missed |\n| Consent | Percentage of personal consultee/participants agreeing to enrolment | \\>75% of personal consultees/participants agreeing to enrolment |\n| Recruitment rate | Number of patients recruited | Recruit 34 patients within 5 months |\n| Randomisation | Demographic characteristics in the intervention and control arms | Balanced demographic characteristics in intervention and control arm participants |\n| Electronic case report form data collection | Percentage of missing outcome and clinical data | < 10% missing outcome data including ICU and hospital length of stay and survival< 10% missing clinical data obtained from clinical medical notes and electronic patient records |\n\nICU = intensive care unit.\n\n##### 2.8.2.2 Perioperative fluids, fluid balance and transfusions\n\nAmounts and types of perioperative infused fluids, blood loss, and need for transfusions will be compared between study groups: the amount of infused crystalloids and colloids during surgery and in the 24-h postoperative period, urinary output during surgery and in the 24-h postoperative period, the number of patients transfused in the 24-h postoperative period, and the number of transfusion units administered in the 24-h postoperative period.\n\n##### 2.8.2.3 Laboratory testing\n\nHaemoglobin and lactate serum levels will be measured 24 h after surgery and compared between study groups.\n\n##### 2.8.2.4 Postoperative complications\n\nIncidence of postoperative complications during the hospital stay will be compared between study groups.

A sample size of 30 participants was calculated according to standard guidelines for pilot studies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> With a 10% dropout rate, a total of 34 participants will be recruited.\n\n### 2.11 Recruitment\n\nTo reach the target sample size as fast as possible, all patients scheduled for neurosurgery will be screened for eligibility criteria after admission to the study hospital. Study team members will perform the screening, and the principal investigator will regularly audit the accuracy of screening.\n\n### 2.12 Assignment of interventions: Allocation\n\n#### 2.12.1 Sequence generation\n\nParticipants will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio using a computer sequence generator with permutated blocks . Using the list generated by this software, 34 opaque envelopes containing a note indicating either ‘GDHT’ or ‘Standard Care’ will be prepared and sequentially numbered. Envelopes will be sealed by an independent person on the study team.\n\n#### 2.12.2 Concealment mechanism\n\nTo maximise concealment, randomisation will only be performed after patient recruitment. The study team member will randomise patients, and allocation concealment will be maintained using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.\n\n#### 2.12.3 Implementation\n\nThe allocation sequence will be generated by an independent person on the study team. Upon obtaining informed consent, the study team member will open the envelope that corresponds to the patient's study ID to determine allocation.\n\n### 2.13 Assignment of interventions: Blinding\n\n#### 2.13.1 Who will be blinded\n\nThe neurosurgeon will be blinded. The hemodynamic monitor will be placed in the operating room so that the neurosurgeon cannot see whether it is being used or not. The other study staff members and treating physicians, and other staff will not be blinded because of the impossibility of blinding while performing the study intervention. The data management group and statisticians will work with a pseudo-anonymised data set.\n\n#### 2.13.2 Procedure for unblinding if needed\n\nNot applicable. This trial is not blinded.\n\n### 2.14 Data collection and management\n\n#### 2.14.1 Plans for assessment and collection of outcomes\n\n##### 2.14.1.1 Demographic and baseline data\n\nThe study will collect demographic and baseline characteristics from medical records and electronic medical records, including age, sex, weight, and ASA classification.\n\n##### 2.14.1.2 Primary outcome\n\nThe number of AEs; perioperative brain relaxation, brain oedema requiring theapy perioperatively and 24 h postoperatively) will be compared between the control and intervention groups.\n\n##### 2.14.1.3 Secondary outcomes\n\nThe criteria assessing feasibility are outlined in Table 1.

The protocol of the study and its amendments will be available at each study unit.\n\n### 2.25 Dissemination plans\n\nWe intend to submit the results of the study to be published in a peer-reviewed international medical journal.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nAppropriate fluid management is essential during surgery. Administration of insufficient or excessive amounts of fluid during surgery may contribute to increased rates of postoperative complications.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Perioperative fluid management is challenging, and administration of fluids and inotropes based on hemodynamic monitoring can decrease the rate of postoperative complications and improve outcomes in several procedures.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> There is only limited evidence regarding the effect of GDHT in neurosurgery.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u></a></sup> Hemodynamic status, particularly preload, of neurosurgical patients may be altered for several reasons. Osmotic therapy is often used to reduce brain oedema in the preoperative period, and patients are at risk of hypovolemia during surgery due to excessive blood loss. An effort to keep neurosurgical patients as ‘dry’ as possible is made to prevent cerebral oedema. This strategy can put patients at risk of hypovolemia-related complications.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Protocol-driven administration fluid based on measurement of hemodynamic parameters may lead to positive fluid balance and increased risk of cerebral oedema. Assessment of brain tissue relaxation is important part of perioperative management. It can be assessed according to subjective scale.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> To assess the safety and feasibility of GDHT in neurosurgery, we recognised the need to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial to determine the feasibility of a fully-powered trial, including whether it is possible to recruit and retain participants in their allocated groups.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThe author would like to thank all clinical staff at the study site.

Natural orifice specimen extraction surgery (NOSES) is natural orifice specimen extraction surgery where the resected specimen is removed through the body's natural cavity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Laparoscopic combined with NOSES surgery has the characteristics of low trauma, fast postoperative recovery, low psychological stress, and aesthetics for colorectal cancer patients. As the traditional laparoscopic surgery, laparoscopic combined with NOSES surgery also has postoperative complications such as anastomotic leakage and infection. Anastomotic fistula is one of the most serious complications of colorectal cancer surgery, which seriously threatens the survival rate of patients after surgery. Studies have reported that the incidence of anastomotic leakage is 1% to 19%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Anastomotic leakage usually occurs about 1 week after surgery. Studies have shown that the incidence of anastomotic leakage in transverse colectomy is higher, and the incidence of anastomotic leakage after right colectomy is lower than that of left colectomy. In rectal cancer, the closer the anastomotic site is to the anus, the higher the risk of leakage.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Rectovaginal fistulas are psychologically devastating for female patients, increasing the length of hospital stay, decreasing patient prognosis, and making treatment less effective than expected. Here, we present a case of a patient with rectal cancer who underwent trans-vaginal NOSES laparoscopic rectal cancer resection combined with hysterectomy and developed a recto-vaginal fistula after surgery\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nThe patient was a 56-year-old female with blood in the stool 7 months ago without obvious cause. The situation worsened one month ago. The patient's past medical history included diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Colonoscopy showed a tumor located 6 cm from the anal margin, and the lumen was narrow. The biopsy pathology suggested differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen suggested malignant occupancy of the rectum, narrowing of the intestinal lumen, with peripheral infiltration, liver lesions, considered as metastatic tumor . Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the abdomen suggested rectal cancer with peripheral infiltration, enlarged rectal mesenteric and extra mesenteric lymph nodes . The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. Karnofsky Performance Scale rating was 90, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group level was 1, ERS 2002 rating was 1, Body mass index was 29.0Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The diagnosis was rectal cancer (T<sub>4</sub>N<sub>x</sub>M<sub>1</sub>). Considering the patient's condition, we recommended surgical resection of the tumor. The procedure was as follows: After general anesthesia, the surgical operating platform was established using the 4-hole method, and the abdominal cavity was explored. No ascites was observed in the abdominopelvic cavity. There were no obvious abnormalities on the surface of the liver, and no metastatic nodes in the peritoneum or omentum. The tumor was found to be located in the upper and middle rectum, about 7 × 8 cm in size, invading the cervix and the posterior wall of the vagina. We decided to perform trans-vaginal NOSES laparoscopic rectal cancer resection combined with hysterectomy. Adopting the principle of total mesorectal resection, the left colonic artery was preserved. Hemostatic clips were used to close the superior rectal artery. Further steps included: freeing the surrounding lymphatic and fatty tissue, freeing the sigmoid colon and rectal mesentery, extending Toldt's gap to the lateral extension, freeing the colonic mesentery, incising the bilateral lateral rectal ligaments, extending Denonvilliers fascia to free the anterior rectal wall, freeing the uterine broad ligament and round ligament, using hemostatic clips to close the upper rectal artery. The uterine artery was ligated through the cervix, the vaginal wall was incised through the posterior vaginal fornix in a circular fashion, and the uterus was incised down up to 3 cm below the rectal tumor. At 15 cm from the upper edge of the rectal tumor, the bowel wall was exposed and incised, and the head of the anastomosis was inserted and sutured. The intestinal tube was incised 2 cm from the lower edge of the tumor, and the proximal sigmoid colon intestine was incised along the predetermined tangent line. The uterus, upper rectum, middle and lower sigmoid colon and their corresponding mesangium were removed together. The protective sleeve was inserted into the vagina, and the specimen was put into the sleeve and pulled out from the vagina. The vaginal stump was sutured after disinfection. The body of the anastomosis was inserted from the anus, sigmoid colorectal anastomosis was performed, and two pelvic drainage tubes were placed. The surgery was completed. The surgical time was 180 minutes, and the intraoperative blood loss was 50 mL. On the second postoperative day, the pelvic drainage decreased gradually 删除6：<u></u>, and there was no fever. The patient defecated on the 3rd postoperative day and started to drink through the gastric tube. Diet was gradually resumed. On the 11th day after the operation, the patient developed gas expelled from the vagina and vaginal pus discharge. There was no abdominal pain. She was given a digital rectal examination, which confirmed an anastomotic fistula. An enterostomy was performed urgently. On the first day after the enterostomy, the patient passed gas smoothly and defecated. The vagina was flushed with normal saline daily. The patient gradually resumed her diet, and was discharged from the hospital. Postoperative pathological results  showed rectal ulcer-type moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The cancer tissue penetrated the intestinal muscular layer and involved subserosal fat, and tumor thrombi were seen in the vessels. Necrotic tissue was seen in the uterus, with atypical cells in it, which was considered cancerous. The fistula healed on the 7th day after surgery. The patient was in stable condition at 1 month follow-up. The follow-up CT examination showed no abnormalities.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nCT examination of the patient before the operation.

The recto-vaginal fistula is most commonly seen as a postoperative complication of pelvic surgery, especially in low anterior resection of the rectum, which has been reported to have a 1.6% incidence of postoperative recto-vaginal fistula.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> The clinical symptoms of recto-vaginal fistula are mainly vaginal discharge or paroxysmal discharge, while other symptoms include purulent, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, perianal pain, vaginal irritation, and recurrent urogenital tract infections. Postoperative anastomotic leakage often occurs around 7 days after surgery, and is often accompanied by symptoms of abdominal infection. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness, rebound pain, and muscle tension. It may be accompanied by increased body temperature, increased heart rate, and even shock and other symptoms. Further clinical symptoms include visible purulent material or fecal fluid flowing out of the drainage tube. The peculiarity of this case was that the recto-vaginal fistula was secondary to a postoperative anastomotic fistula and the patient showed no obvious symptoms of abdominal infection; no purulent or fecal watery material was found in the drainage canal, and the patient's temperature was normal 删除6：<u>(Graph 2)</u>, which misled the physician's judgment and led to a delay in diagnosis until the recto-vaginal fistula developed when vaginal discharge and abscesses were found on digital rectal examination. Hence for patients with low -level rectal cancer, routine digital rectal examination after surgery can help in early detection of the fistula.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 5:\n\nPostoperative body temperature.</u>\n\nThe patient's underlying disease is also a non-negligible factor in the occurrence of anastomotic leakage. The patient has a long history of diabetes mellitus and poor preoperative blood glucose control 删除6：<u>(Graph 3 and 4)</u>. Diabetes mellitus causes metabolic disorders in the body, decrease the body repair ability and anti-infection ability. It significantly increases the risk of complications post-surgery and hinders the recovery of the incision. Studies have shown<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> that the incidence of intestinal fistula in diabetic patients under the same surgical conditions is 9.7%, which is significantly higher than the 3.0% in non-diabetic patients. The patient in this case had an advanced stage of cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. It has been reported<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> that 3 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, there is a high correlation between endoscopic radical surgery for rectal cancer and the occurrence of anastomotic leakage.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 6:\n\nRegular blood glucose testing on days one through seven of hospitalization.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 7:\n\nRandom blood glucose testing on days eight through twenty of hospitalization.</u>\n\nThis is the first time that our hospital has tried NOSES combined with organ resection and the specimens were taken out through the vagina. Studies have shown the short-term and long-term effects of trans-vaginal NOSES.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14,15]</u></a></sup> In our patient, the specimen was extracted vaginally because the vagina was incised for hysterectomy and the vaginal opening was larger. Because the position of the vagina is fixed, the flexibility is better than that of the rectum, making it easier to take out the specimen and decrease the chances of specimen rupture. Being a combined organ resection, the specimen is large, and trans-vaginal extraction can avoid damage to the rectum and anal canal. In our experience, performing NOSES was a bold attempt and there are many advantages like minimum trauma, faster postoperative recovery, and esthetic outcomes. However, serious complications can occur after NOSES, and hence we must strictly screen patients that meet the indications of NOSES surgery to avoid secondary operations that increases the patient's burden. According to our experience, trans-vaginal NOSES can be attempted if the approximate circumference of the specimen is 3 to 5 cm. Relative contraindications include late local tumor stage, larger focus, and obesity (Body mass index ≥30Kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The innate nature of the vagina to expand in width is significant as it can provide a way to obtain specimens through the vaginal orifice. Psychologically, whether female patients can accept this is a question worth exploring.\n\nIn conclusion, routine digital rectal examination after ultra-low rectal anastomosis can discover anastomotic leakage early in patients with obscure clinical features. NOSES has the advantages of reduced trauma, quick recovery time, less stress on the patient and aesthetics. However, for patients with advanced tumors, especially cancers that invade adjacent organs, expanded resection will increase the risk of postoperative complications. In addition, patients with severe underlying diseases and those who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, have increased risk of complications. As a result, NOSES surgery can increase the economic burden of patients and impact the prognosis. Hence the surgical indication for NOSES surgery must be rigorously evaluated, and the risks must be taken into account<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1–3]</u></a></sup>.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe would like to thank all the staff in Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical University for their contribution on our research.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Zimin Zhao, Enhong Zhao.\n\n**Data curation:** Zimin Zhao, Qingkuang Chen.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Zimin Zhao, Honghong Zheng, Jianjun Li.\n\n**Methodology:** Zimin Zhao, Shuai Zheng.\n\n**Supervision:** Enhong Zhao.\n\n**Writing – original draft**: Zimin Zhao.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Zimin Zhao, Enhong Zhao.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:34:03", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:36:02", "cost": 119.229}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:20", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:36:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:34:02"}

Okuda et al. reported the clinical utility of tocilizumab (TCZ), a humanized anti-human interleukin-6 receptor antibody that suppresses the SAA levels, which improves the clinical symptoms of patients with AA amyloidosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> The development of AA amyloidosis is related to the presence of SAA gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the Japanese population.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u></a></sup>\n\nWe report a case of a patient with BD complicated by amyloidosis in the intestinal tract. The patient had alleles in the SAA1 gene, which was a risk factor for the development of AA amyloidosis. After TCZ was administered, the patient clinical symptoms, namely, high-grade fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, were immediately resolved. Hence, TCZ is useful for treating BD complicated by gastrointestinal AA amyloidosis.\n\n### Consent statement\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 44-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain and diarrhea lasting for a month. She experienced periodic remittent fever lasting for 5 days at the age of 14 as well as headache and arthritis. She was diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and was treated with aspirin. She was diagnosed with uveitis and iritis at the age of 21 and used eye drops as treatment. At the age of 31, the patient developed erythema nodosum on her legs and received intermittent steroid treatment. On this admission, the patient exhibited a normal level of consciousness, an axillary temperature of 36.2°C, a blood pressure of 108/58 mmHg, and a heart rate of 77 beats per minute. Abdominal general tenderness was observed, but muscular defense and rebound tenderness were not noted. Aphthous stomatitis was not observed during this period, but it was reported before the admission. Skin rashes, arthritis, and joint deformity were not observed. The patient's laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count, 7,600/μL (neutrophils, 71%; eosinophils, 0.8%; monocytes, 7%; and lymphocytes, 21%); hemoglobin, 12.4 g/dL; platelet count, 22.2 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL; total protein, 7.6 g/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 14 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 10 U/L; lactic dehydrogenase, 78 U/L; blood urea nitrogen, 9.2 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.65 mg/dL; C-reactive protein (CRP), 2.5 mg/dL; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 65 mm/h. The patient tested negative for antinuclear antibodies and disease-specific autoantibodies. The serum SAA level was high (352.8 μg/mL). The patient tested positive for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B51 typing. Direct sequencing showed the absence of mutations in the Mediterranean fever gene (exons 1–10). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed several edematous lesions in the small and large intestines , and there was absence of lymph node enlargement. On colonoscopy, edematous and reddish mucosa was observed in the terminal ileum  and ascending colon , and bleeding and erosive lesions were observed in the small intestine on capsule endoscopy . Histological examination of the edematous and reddish mucosae showed the presence of eosinophilic and amorphous masses around the muscularis mucosae and small vessels in the submucosal layer of the small and large intestines on hematoxylin and eosin staining . Those masses were detected on Congo red staining  and immunostaining  and suggested AA amyloidosis. Hence, the patient was diagnosed with BD based on the criteria for diagnosing BD 通用删除7(英):<u>(1990)</u>, and the presence of oral aphtha, skin lesion (erythema nodosum), eye lesion (uveitis),<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> and HLA B51 supported this diagnosis. Gastrointestinal involvement was also noted because of the presence of bleeding and erosive lesions in the small intestine, but no ulcers were observed in the ileocecum. Later on, a diagnosis of AA amyloidosis was established based on the findings of the histopathological examination of the patient's samples obtained from the small and large intestines. The patient was initially treated with mesalazine and received total parenteral nutrition, but she experienced persistent abdominal pain. Hence, infliximab was administered at a dose of 330 mg (5 mg/kg/body). High-grade fever was observed the day after receiving infliximab treatment, and CRP levels were elevated. Therefore, she was given prednisolone at a dose of 20 mg daily. After taking prednisolone, the patient's body temperature eventually improved, and the levels of CRP returned normal. However, diarrhea and abdominal pain re-occurred when the patient resumed oral diet. TCZ was administered at a dose of 520 mg (8 mg/kg/body), and the abdominal symptoms eventually disappeared. The patient was able to eat well and was discharged from our hospital on the 67th hospital day . She was administered with the same dose of TCZ every 4 weeks. She was advised to discontinue prednisolone treatment after her visit to the outpatient clinic. CT images showed an improvement in the intestinal tract inflammation on the 61th hospital day . As the patient refused to undergo colonoscopy, the status of the mucosal lesions after TCZ treatment cannot be assessed. Since then, she has been administered TCZ continuously for 39 months. Her condition has been good without diarrhea, abdominal pain, or fever for 38 months, and there have been no recurrences after receiving TCZ. The laboratory data 39 months after the first administration of TCZ were as follows: serum SAA, 2.7 μg/mL; CRP, < 0.05 mg/dL; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 2 mm/h.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nComputed tomography of the abdomen on admission showed that the wall in the small intestine appeared edematous, especially in the lower right portion.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nColonoscopy showed redness and edematous mucosa at the distal end of the ileum (A) and the ascending colon (B).

Lachmann et al summarized the underlying disorders of 374 patients with AA amyloidosis, and the major causative diseases of AA amyloidosis were chronic inflammatory arthritis (60%), chronic sepsis (15%), and periodic fever syndrome (9%).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> The proportions of BD patients with renal amyloidosis were 3.6% in the study by Kosemehmetoglu et al.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> and 2% in the study by Dilsen et al.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> On the basis of the literature review of BD complicated with renal AA amyloidosis, several patients were reported to have gastrointestinal symptoms, and a diagnosis of AA amyloidosis was made based on the biopsy results of specimens obtained from the gastrointestinal tract such as the duodenum and rectal mucosa.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u></a></sup> AA amyloid fibrils are derived from the acute-phase reactant SAA protein through a process of cleavage, misfolding, and aggregation into highly ordered abnormal β-sheet conformation. Sustained overproduction of SAA is a prerequisite for the development of AA amyloidosis, although the reason remains unknown. Amyloidosis occurs only in a small proportion of patients with chronic inflammatory disorders.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Genetic background is among the causative factors of developing amyloidosis. SAA protein gene polymorphism is 1 of the factors implicated in the pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Among the human SAA family, SAA1 and SAA2 are well known as acute phase proteins, which are synthesized by the hepatocytes in response to the production of inflammatory cytokines.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> The SAA1 genotype is a factor probably affecting amyloidogenesis. In Caucasians, the SAA1.1 allele and Japanese homozygosity for the SAA1.3 allele were associated with the development of AA amyloidosis in this patient group.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Another single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the SAA1 gene, SAA-13T, which is located at position −13 in the 5′ regulatory region of this gene, is also a risk factor for the development of AA amyloidosis in the Japanese and Caucasian populations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> Both SAA1.3 and SAA-13T were risk factors of amyloidosis in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> adult-onset Still disease,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> and familial Mediterranean fever.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> On the contrary, Utku et al. reported that a homozygous SAA1.1 genotype was significantly more common among patients with BD and amyloidosis, although the patients’ race was not described.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> In this patient, as various symptoms of BD appeared at different time points, it was difficult to diagnose her with BD at initial assessment. She was misdiagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis as the patient had a history of arthritis. Familial Mediterranean fever was listed as a differential diagnosis as the patient had a history of persistent periodic fever. However, the patient was not diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever as she continued to experience abdominal symptoms and low-grade fever even during admission, and Mediterranean fever gene mutation was not detected. Castleman disease was not also considered as there was absence of lymphadenopathy and hypergammaglobulinemia. Finally, she was diagnosed with BD after reviewing her past medical records, and HLA B51 positivity supported this diagnosis. As the patient was unable to receive sufficient treatments, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines remained elevated for a long period of time. This was thought to be 1 of the reasons why the patient developed amyloidosis. Moreover, the patient had SAA1.3 and SAA-13T alleles that were considered to be risk factors for developing amyloidosis in the Japanese population. This genetic background possibly promoted the development of amyloidosis. On the basis of the case of this patient, it was suggested that Japanese BD patients with SAA1.3 and SAA-13T alleles were at higher risk of developing AA amyloidosis, as well as other individuals with inflammatory diseases who acquired these types of alleles. In this case, abdominal pain and diarrhea persisted, colonoscopy revealed reddish and crude mucosa in the ascending colon and terminal ileum, and a diagnosis of intestinal amyloidosis was established based on these histopathological findings. Although histopathological examination was not performed, renal amyloidosis was also noted in this patient as serum creatinine was slightly elevated. Histopathological studies of aphtha-like lesions in the small intestine could not be performed because endoscopy of the small intestine was not carried out. Although simple ulcers were not observed in the ileocecum, which commonly occur in those with gastrointestinal BD, the presence of aphtha-like lesions possibly indicated gastrointestinal BD because the lesions appeared as simple ulcers.\n\nThe etiology and pathogenesis of BD have not been fully clarified. The production of a variety of cytokines by T cells activated with multiple antigens played a pivotal role in the activation of neutrophils.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> Colchicine has been widely used as a first-line drug for the treatment of BD based on the claim that colchicine exerts beneficial effects through the inhibition of the neutrophil function.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> It has been demonstrated that γδ T cells in patients with BD are activated in vivo and produce large amounts of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> Vallet et al reported the efficacy of anti-TNF-α in severe and/or refractory BD, including ocular, mucocutaneous, joint, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, and cardiovascular manifestations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> On the contrary, the primary focus of the management of secondary AA amyloidosis is the treatment of the underlying disease. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulates serum AA synthesis in the liver and plays a crucial role in amyloidosis development.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> TCZ suppresses the SAA levels and improves the clinical symptoms of AA amyloidosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> Okuda et al reported that the inhibition IL-6 is superior to the TNF inhibition in the treatment of AA amyloidosis complicated with rheumatic disease because the SAA values were more suppressed in patients who received TCZ treatment than those who received TNF treatment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> In this patient, anti-TNF-α antibody, infliximab, was initially administered to ameliorate the activity of BD. However, after the administration of infliximab, high-grade fever was observed. This phenomenon was considered to be caused by the imbalances due to the suppression of TNF-α. Therefore, corticosteroid was administered in order to ameliorate the inflammation. Although high-grade fever eventually improved, abdominal pain and diarrhea recurred. In order to improve the abdominal symptoms, TCZ was administered. After the administration of this drug, the patient abdominal pain and diarrhea were immediately resolved, the SAA value returned to normal, and intestinal inflammation was improved as seen on enhanced CT. The condition of patients with intestinal amyloidosis was improved after administering anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u></a></sup> Anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies were also used for the treatment of severe and refractory BD and neuro-BD.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27–29]</u></a></sup> The exact pathogenic roles of IL-6 in BD remain unclear. However, the cerebrospinal fluid levels of IL-6 in patients with neuro-BD were elevated.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u></a></sup> Moreover, the ocular fluid levels of IL-6 in BD patients with uveitis were also elevated.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u></a></sup> Recently, Akiyama et al. reported a systematic literature review of 47 BD patients treated with TCZ. Although all patients had refractory disease in response to previous treatment with conventional and biologic agents, TCZ somehow improved the condition of patients with ocular, neurological, and vascular involvement, as well as secondary amyloidosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u></a></sup> Therefore, the administration of anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody might be useful for BD in some cases, especially in those with secondary amyloidosis. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of this treatment, further study on the administration of TCZ for BD using a large sample size is warranted.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nWe reported a patient with BD accompanied by intestinal AA amyloidosis, who was complicated with periodic fever since childhood. Although BD accompanied with AA amyloidosis rarely occurs, in this patient, not only continuous inflammation but also the presence of alleles (which are risk factors for amyloidosis in Japanese individuals) possibly induced the development of AA amyloidosis. Furthermore, TCZ was effective in the treatment of BD and intestinal AA amyloidosis. Although BD is often accompanied by gastrointestinal lesions caused by the disease itself, intestinal AA amyloidosis lesions were occasionally observed. Therefore, in BD patients accompanied with abdominal symptoms, the gastrointestinal tract must be evaluated using an endoscope, and biopsy must be performed. Moreover, it is thought that an anti-human IL-6 receptor antibody is useful for BD with secondary AA amyloidosis.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe would like to thank Dr Masataka Umeda and Dr Atsushi Kawakami (Department of Rheumatology, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University) for examining the direct sequencing of the Mediterranean fever gene.

As the facial nerve innervates the movement of facial expression muscles, once it is damaged, it may cause functional defects of varying degrees and have a significant impact on the physiology and psychology of patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Symptoms of the disease appear on the face and affect the patient's facial appearance. It is found in clinical practice that some patients may have a sense of inferiority, anxiety and depression, which not only affects the health of Chinese residents, but also brings a certain economic burden to the patients, and affects the patients’ life, work and social interaction, and may even cause aesthetic and physical and mental effects. Therefore, it is of great significance to find an effective, safe, and fast treatment program for Bell's facial paralysis.\n\nModern medicine believes that facial paralysis is mainly caused by peripheral facial neuritis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> After facial nerve of mastoid hole is infected by acute virus and cold stimulation, can cause local oedema, facial nerve is pressed, local occurrence blood circulates obstacle. In clinical practice, Western medicine routinely uses hormones, antivirus and nutritive nerve for treatment, and it is considered that acupuncture therapy is not suitable for acute period. However, related studies have shown that early intervention of acupuncture in the treatment of Bell's facial paralysis can promote the recovery of facial nerve and reduce the occurrence of sequelae.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5–7]</u></a></sup> However, when to start acupuncture treatment for patients with Bell's facial paralysis is one of the heated discussions in the industry. Studies have shown that many patients with Bell's facial paralysis only receive conventional Western medicine treatment in the acute stage,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> and acupuncture treatment is intervened 7 days later. Compared with most patients who received early conventional western medicine treatment combined with acupuncture intervention in the acute stage, the course of facial nerve recovery treated by western medicine alone in the early stage was significantly prolonged, and there were relatively more sequelae, while early acupuncture intervention shortened the course of facial nerve recovery and reduced the occurrence of sequelae.\n\nAccording to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> facial paralysis is caused by insuficiency of Qi and blood, emptiness of veins and six exogenous pathogenic factors invasion. Its treatment principle is eliminating pathogenic-factor, tonifying deficiency, relaxing tendons and dredging collaterals. This disease is often treated with acupuncture, acupuncture and electroacupuncture, moxibustion, acupoint injection, cupping, plum needle percussion, massage, Chinese medicine, other therapies such as fumigation, external application. It is included in the 43 diseases recommended by the World Health Organization for the use of acupuncture therapy globally, and Bell's facial paralysis is also one of the I level disease spectrum diseases suitable for acupuncture.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> In view of this disease, acupuncture and moxibustion therapy is widely used in clinical practice, has been recognized by the academic circle, has been recognized and accepted by patients, and has achieved satisfactory efficacy. Compared with oral hormone, neurotrophic agent and other western medicine, the total effective rate of acupuncture treatment is higher, reaching 80% to 90%. Acupuncture therapy is safe, effective, cheap and has no side effects. Electroacupuncture therapy has the most prominent curative effect in acupuncture therapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10–12]</u></a></sup> Because electrical pulse can accurately adjust the amount of stimulation, adapt to the needs of different patients’ diseases, and operate objectively, it can often replace manual needle transport and save manpower, it is widely used in clinical practice. However, it is still controversial whether to use electroacupuncture in patients with Bell's facial paralysis in the acute stage,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> and it has become a research hotspot.\n\nHow to further reflect the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) acupuncture in the treatment of this disease and form a research program of electroacupuncture in the treatment of acute Bell's facial paralysis is of great significance. At present, there are few clinical studies on different electroacupuncture parameters (such as waveform and frequency) in the treatment of Bell's facial paralysis in the acute stage, and there is a lack of unified norms. There is still a lack of strong clinical evidence on the effect of stimulation of different electroacupuncture parameters. In addition, most of the existing clinical studies on electroacupuncture in the treatment of acute Bell's facial paralysis have only observed and evaluated the short-term clinical effects of patients, while there is still a lack of studies on the incidence of sequelae and the observation of long-term efficacy.\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\n### 2.1 Objectives\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to provide reasonable stimulation parameters for electroacupuncture in the treatment of patients with acute Bell's palsy. The secondary objectives are to provide strong evidence for the safety and effectiveness of electroacupuncture in the acute phase of interventional therapy.\n\n### 2.2 Study design\n\nThis is a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 330 patients with acute Bell's palsy aged 18 to 70 years were randomly divided into experimental group and control group. The experimental group was divided into 4 groups (A, B, C, D) according to different electroacupuncture parameters, with 66 participants in each group. The control group received ordinary acupuncture. This trial recruited participants from 6 sub centers: the First Affiliated Hospital of Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yuxi City Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xuanwei City Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yanshan County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jianshui County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Tengchong City Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, recruitment advertisements will be placed on the network and bulletin boards. Eligible participants will have an equal chance of being allocated randomly to experimental group or control group.\n\nThe entire study period was 60 days, including 30 days of treatment observation and 1 month follow-up. Facial nerve electrophysiological examination was used to detect the recovery of subjects’ facial nerve before and after treatment, and scales was used to evaluate the clinical efficacy during treatment and follow-up. Figure 1 shows a flow chart of the study.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nStudy design and participant flow chart.</u>\n\n### 2.3 Study registration\n\nThis study protocol was registered on Chinese Clinical Trial Register, the register number is ChiCTR1800015882.\n\n### 2.4 Ethics\n\nThis study has been approved by the ethics committee of all sub centers. All the subjects involved will understand and sign the informed consent.\n\n### 2.5 Paricipants\n\nThe main entry criteria were patients with Bell's facial paralysis who met the diagnostic criteria of the Chinese Journal of Neurology Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Idiopathic Facial Palsy 通用删除7(英):<u>(2016)</u>. The main feature is a crooked mouth and eye. Suddenly one side of the face muscle stiffness, numbness, paralysis, the disappearance of forehead lines, eye fission, eyedew tears, the nasolabial groove becomes shallow, the corner of the mouth drooping to the healthy side, the sick side can not frown, eyes closed, teeth exposed, bulging cheeks; Some patients initially have pain behind the ear, but also the affected side of the tongue anterior 2/3 of hypoguia or disappearance, hypersensitivity to hearing and other symptoms.\n\n### 2.6 Inclusion critera\n\n*   Subjects diagnosed Bell's facial\n*   paralysis for the first time, and theonset time is not more than 7 days without any treatment\n*   Subjects aged between18 and 70 years old, male or female\n*   Unilateral facial paralysis\n*   Signed Informed Consent\n\n### 2.7 Exclusion critera\n\n*   Again facial paralysis or onset time more than 7days\n*   Age < 18 years old, or age >70 years old\n*   Complicated with malignant tumors, infectious diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, liver, kidney, lung and hematopoietic system and other serious primary diseases and mental patients\n*   Hunter's syndrome\n*   Patients with artificial pacemakers and those who are not suitable for electrical stimulation, as well as pregnant women and lactating women\n*   Is participating in other clinical trials\n*   Facial paralysis caused by other causes\n*   There are infected persons on the skin near acupuncture points or acupoints\n*   Fail to complete the basic course of treatment, and may be poor compliance\n\n### 2.8 Interventions\n\nIntervention measures are selected according to the theory and experience of traditional Chinese medicine. The experimental group and the control group were treated with acupuncture, but the experimental group was combined with electroacupuncture on the basis of acupuncture treatment, and divided into 4 groups according to different parameters. In addition, the use of conventional drugs in neurology department is allowed, such as mecobalamin, vitamin B12, and drugs used will be documented in detail. This study used the same acupuncture instruments of disposable sterile needles (0.25 × 25mm, 0.25 × 40mm, 0.25 × 50 mm), acupoints location, and operation were carried out according to the National Standard of the People's Republic of China in 2006, Nomenclature and Location of Acupuncture Points (GB/T12346–2006).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup>\n\nExperimental group. According to TCM theory and clinical experience, acupuncture combined with electroacupuncture was used. Acupoints are including GB14 (Yangbai), ST2 (Sibai), SI18 (Quanliao), ST6 (Jiache), ST4 (Dicang), SJ17 (Yifeng), EX-HN5 (Taiyang), LI4 (Hegu). After acupuncture to obtain qi, connect the electrode to the selected acupoint (Dicang is connected to Jiache, Quanliao is connected to Taiyang). The experimental group was divided into 4 groups according to different electroacupuncture parameters (A, B, C, D), namely group A (2 Hz < density wave ≤5 Hz); Group B (1 Hz < density wave ≤2 Hz); Group C (2 Hz < continuous wave ≤5 Hz); Group D (1 Hz < continuous wave ≤2 Hz). The treatment time was 30 minutes each time. The participants were treated for 60 days, including a 30-day observation period (There were 4 courses of treatment once a day, each course was 6 days, with 1 day rest between each course) and a one-month follow-up.\n\nControl group. The control group was the ordinary acupuncture group, and the acupoints were the same as the experimental group. The operation method was to leave the needle for 30 minutes after getting qi by acupuncture. The participants were treated for 60 days, including a 30-day observation period (There were 4 courses of treatment once a day, each course was 6 days, with 1 day rest between each course) and a one-month follow-up.\n\n### 2.9 Outcome measures\n\nPrimary outcomes One of the main efficacy indicators was House-Brackmann scale. Overall efficacy = (pre-treatment score - post-treatment score)/ pre-treatment score × 100%. The H-B scale will be measured at the beginning of the trial and at the end of the four sessions. Electrophysiological examination of facial nerve is another main therapeutic index. Before and after treatment, all patients underwent electromyography (EMG) to detect facial nerve injury and recovery. During the whole examination, the patient was in supine position, and the muscle abdomen of frontris muscle, orbicularis oculi muscle and orbicularis oris muscle were inserted with a cored round needle, respectively. The waveform, time limit and amplitude of the inserted potential, spontaneous potential during muscle relaxation and motor unit potential during light force contraction, as well as the recruited potential during maximum force contraction were observed. The healthy side was measured first, then the affected side was measured, and the two sides were compared.\n\nSecondary outcomes. The TCM symptom scale was used to evaluate the efficacy of Bell's facial paralysis, and the sequelae scale of Bell's palsy was used to measure the safety of electroacupuncture. These scales were used to evaluate the efficacy before treatment, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, 28 days of treatment and 1 month of follow-up. Participants’ diary for their temperature, breathe, heart rate, blood pressure, drugs, adverse events (AE), and others during the research was recorded. All the dropouts and causes will be documented in case report form. The study schedule is shown in Figure 2.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nSPIRIT figure. SPIRIT = Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials.</u>\n\nSafety observation. Blood routine examination at 0 days and after the end of treatment. Acupuncture caused bleeding, needle sickness, hematoma, acupuncture site pain and other adverse events were recorded at any time.\n\n### 2.10 Adverse events\n\nAny possible AE associated with acupuncture or electroacupuncture intervention, including acupuncture sickness, broken needles, pain at the acupuncture site, bleeding, hematoma, infection, or scalds, will be examined and treated. The details of the AE will be recorded in the case report form by the acupuncturist and the safety administrator. Severe AE will be reported to the Ethics Committee. Participants who were unwilling to adhere to the treatment were removed from the trial.\n\n### 2.11 Statistical analysis\n\nSPSS21.0 software was used for analysis. The measurement data of normal distribution were represented by (X¯ ± S), the median (M) and the interquinterle interval (Q) were represented by skewness distribution data, the comparison of multiple local means was performed by one-way ANOVA, and the measurement data of multiple measurements was performed by repeated ANOVA. Counting data were expressed as frequency and percentage. The disordered classification data were tested by _x_<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact probability method. The data of ordered classification were tested by rank sum test. The clinical data were tested respectively and _P_ < .05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n### 2.12 Quality control\n\nBefore the subject research, the research group has been demonstrated for many times and finally established the research plan. After the research program is established, a multicenter research training meeting will be held. Only after the researchers have passed the training can they carry out clinical research. At the same time, the research group set up a multicenter quality management team, with the project leader as the team leader, and set up special quality inspectors and inspectors to be responsible for the management and research quality control of each sub-center. Through supervision, the sponsor can keep abreast of the process of trial execution, find and correct the existing problems in time, so as to control the quality of clinical trial to the greatest extent.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nElectroacupuncture therapy is a kind of therapy to prevent and cure diseases by connecting the appropriate current on the acupoints through the filliform needles after acupuncture to get qi. A lot of clinical studies suggest that moderate acupoint stimulation, stimulate facial expression muscle to produce rhythmic contraction, which repair of nerve defects, to accelerate the process of facial nerve inflammation, edema absorption, promote neural function rehabilitation, so as to promote the damaged nerve recovery, electricity for early around sexual facial paralysis treatment curative effect is better than that of treatment after stability.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15–19]</u></a></sup> In addition, the research results of literature showed that the application of electroacupuncture or electroacupuncture combined with other comprehensive treatments in the acute stage of Bell's facial paralysis had significant curative effect, improved the patient's blood circulation, shortened the course of treatment, and had good safety.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10–12,20]</u></a></sup> From the perspective of long-term curative effect, it could prevent the adverse sequelae such as hemifacial spasm and inversion. Basic studies have also confirmed that acupoint electrical stimulation can promote the repair of injured facial nerve,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> improve the expression of nerve growth factor and neurotrophic factor in facial muscle tissue during the process of facial nerve regeneration,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> reduce facial nerve fiber congestion and edema and damage to cell structure, and slow down the degree of facial nerve fiber demyelinating disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> It has a positive effect on the anatomical morphology and functional recovery of the involved facial nerve.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25]</u></a></sup> In addition, in terms of the application of electroacupuncture in the acute phase of Bell's palsy, it has been reported that acupuncture can improve the conduction velocity of facial nerve in rats with peripheral facial paralysis,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> stimulate the compressed facial nerve, enhance muscle fiber contraction, improve the local metabolic function of the lesion, and then reduce the inflammatory response of facial nerve and promote edema absorption.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u></a></sup> The intervention of acupuncture and electroacupuncture has been debated all the time. Some only speculate theoretically that acupuncture and electroacupuncture should not be used in the early stage, and there is a lack of large sample and multi-center control studies in clinical practice. So this study will focus on the problems existing in the use of electric acupuncture treatment of facial paralysis that bell's palsy in acute period should intervene cupping therapy and the electrical stimulation of different parameters on bell's palsy, forward curative effect of early in the acute phase of design, the influence of the incidence of sequelae, to observe the curative the curative effect of interventional treatment for bell's palsy and concrete suitable stimulation parameters, so as to guide the clinical, To improve the clinical effect.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Xuelian Zhang, Jing Shi.\n\n**Data curation:** Sifeng Feng.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Xiahui Zhang.\n\n**Investigation:** Sifeng Feng, Xiahui Zhang.\n\n**Methodology:** Youlong Xiong, Xingyou Deng.\n\n**Resources:** Yihao Zhou.\n\n**Software:** Anhong Dai.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Xuelian Zhang.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:48:44", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:49:42", "cost": 57.225}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:49:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:48:44"}

It results from the occlusion of the anterior spinal artery or vertebral artery or its branches. Medial medullary infarction (MMI) syndrome was first described by Spiller in the 19th century.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Dejerine then proposed a clinical triad of ipsilateral hypoglossal paralysis, contralateral hemiparesis sparing the face, and contralateral loss of deep sensation which are the key features currently used to diagnose unilateral medial medullary infarction.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Variable manifestations may occur in bilateral medial medullary syndrome which includes isolated hemiparesis, tetraparesis, ipsilateral hemiparesis, facial nerve palsy, ataxia, vertigo, nystagmus, or dysphagia.\n\n2 Case description\n------------------\n\nA 62-year-old gentleman presented to our center with sudden onset of left sided body weakness, slurring of speech, and headache for 3 days. He had no dizziness, vertigo, vomiting, swallowing difficulty or neck pain. Past medical history includes smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus with poor glycemic control. Vital signs were charted and blood pressure on admission was 230/94 mm Hg with a pulse rate of 71 beats per minute.\n\nNeurological examination revealed a left hemiplegia with dysarthria. His Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15/15 with pupils 3 mm bilaterally equal and reactive. Cranial nerves examination was normal. The left upper and lower limbs were hypertonic, hyporreflexic with muscle power 0/5 based on Medical Research Council (MRC) grading and positive Babinski sign was present on the left lower limb. Otherwise, the right upper and lower limbs had normal tone, reflexes, muscle power of 5/5 on MRC grading, and negative Babinski sign. Gag reflex was intact, and he passed the swallowing test. Pinprick sensation and proprioception of all limbs were normal. Within 30 minutes of the neurological examination of the patient, an urgent non-contrasted computed tomography (CT) brain was performed.\n\nThe urgent non-contrasted CT brain showed chronic infarcts at the right lentiform nucleus and right thalamus with no evidence of intracranial bleed. His full blood count revealed hemoglobin of 13.2 g/L, increased total white cell count of 13.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelet of 259 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. His renal function test, liver function test, and coagulation profiles were within normal limits. His random serum glucose on admission was 9.0 mmol/L with increased LDL level of 110 mg/dL.\n\nOur working clinical diagnosis at this point in time was a right lacunar infarct. He was then commenced on oral Aspirin 100 mg once daily and Labetalol intravenous infusion of 2 mg/min to lower down his blood pressure within 15 minutes after review of the CT brain report. His blood pressure was soon under control and the medication was switched to oral antihypertensive, Amlodipine 10 mg once daily. Appropriate limb and chest physiotherapy were started as well.\n\nOn day 3 of stroke, he developed right sided limb weakness and numbness. Muscle power of right upper and lower limb was 0/5 on MRC grading and he had right hemisensory loss. Urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain Axial T2 weighted image, diffusion-weighted imaging, Coronal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and magnetic resonance angiography of Circle of Willis and common carotid artery revealed an acute infarct at the bilateral medial medullary region, showing a typical heart-shaped sign  with beaded appearance of V4 segment of right vertebral artery  and M1 segment of left middle cerebral artery. Additional investigations performed include an electrocardiogram which showed ST depression in inferior leads and an echocardiogram which revealed left ventricular ejection fraction of 67%, left ventricular hypertrophy, grade II diastolic dysfunction with normal valves. There was no thrombus and size of left atrium size was normal.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nMRI brain showed hyperintensity on T2W/FLAIR (upper row) with restricted diffusion (lower row) at bilateral medial medulla, giving an appearance of “heart sign” (arrow).

Four days’ post-stroke, he had respiratory failure, requiring intubation and admission to intensive care unit. Tracheostomy tube was inserted, and he was then weaned off the ventilator. He was discharged home after 5 weeks of hospital stay. Follow up for physiotherapy and neurorehabilitation were given weekly then monthly with total duration of follow up of 12 months, however, he was still tetraplegic with minimum improvement in bilateral limb muscle power. Repeated imaging at the time of follow-up was not performed as no new neurological symptoms arose in the patient.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nPatients with bilateral MMI usually presented with acute onset of quadriparesis or quadriplegia, bulbar palsy, lingual palsy and bilateral sensory loss with or without respiratory failure. The initial diagnosis may be challenging due to diversity of clinical presentation. Interestingly, only 10% of patients with bilateral MMI presented with hemiparesis and 20% progressed from hemiparesis to tetraparesis within 72 hours.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> In our case, patient presented with initial unilateral hemiplegia followed by tetraplegia three days later. Subsequently, he developed respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation.\n\nWith advancements in MRI brain, bilateral MMI can be diagnosed earlier and easier. The commonest MRI finding of a bilateral MMI is hyperintensity of rostral medulla, known as the “heart sign.” Our patient's MRI brain showed the typical feature of bilateral MMI. A systematic review of bilateral medial medullary infarction by Pongmoragot et al in 2013 showed that the most common pathology detected via MRI was rostral medullary infarction (V-shaped), consistent with another study by Maeda et al and a case report by Krishnan P.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4–6]</u></a></sup> Another study by Kim JS et al in 2009 which analyzed MRI (T2/DWI) findings in 86 patients who had acute medial medullary infarction showed that 76% of patients had lesions in the rostral medulla.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe rapid deterioration of this patient shortly after the diagnosis of bilateral medial medullary infarct including the need for intubation was similar to a case report by Torabi in 2013 in which the patient who presented with generalized weakness, slurring of speech and dysphagia developed respiratory failure after performing the physical examination and was intubated. The patient was also treated with oral Aspirin 325 mg per day but the prognosis was very poor in which the patient remained ventilator dependent for five days and died.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> In addition, another case report of bilateral medial medullary infarction by Thijs, R. D et al in 2001 showed that a patient with history of hypertension presented initially with tingling sensation of both hands and feet, awoke the next day with unilateral weakness of left limbs and within hours developed weakness of the right limbs. He developed respiratory failure on day 2 post-stroke and was subsequently intubated, however the prognosis was relatively poor in which the patient was still quadriplegic with minimal movements of both hands.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe possible stroke mechanism in our patient is intracranial atherosclerosis of right vertebral artery which is also reflected in a case report by Zhang et al.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Other causes of bilateral MMI include atherosclerosis of basilar artery or branch vessels and occlusion of vertebral artery or anterior spinal artery. In contrast to unilateral medial medullary infarction, patients with bilateral MMI has poor prognosis.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nIn conclusion, bilateral MMI is rare and commonly associated with poor prognosis. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion of bilateral MMI in patients who present with tetraparesis and bulbar palsy in order to prevent morbidity and mortality.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nDr Shaalina Nair, corresponding author contributed to gathering patient data and writing the case report, Dr Low Soon Chai contributed to editing of case report and MRI images.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:59:52", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:03:00", "cost": 188.519}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:03:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:59:51"}

However, many drugs from this group are hydrophilic, and as such, undergo preferential gastrointestinal absorption and first-pass metabolism. As a result, the onset of their action is delayed, with a peak activity observed no earlier than 30 to 45 minutes post-administration.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,12–14]</u></a></sup>\n\nAn alternative approach to the treatment of BTcP is the administration of highly lipophilic opioids which are readily absorbed via the oral mucosa, and hence, provide a more rapid onset of analgesia than the hydrophilic oral agents. Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic opioid suitable for oral transmucosal administration.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,9,15]</u></a></sup> Sublingual fentanyl citrate (sublingual fentanyl; Abstral) has been developed to provide rapid-onset analgesia in BTcP. The product was shown to reach its peak blood concentrations within 10 minutes of sublingual administration,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> and to provide rapid-onset analgesia with the profile of adverse events (AEs) similar to that typical for conventional opioid analgesics.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\nWhile the efficacy and safety of sublingual fentanyl have been already confirmed in clinical trials, we lack real-world evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of this agent in the control of BTcP. Given the heterogeneous presentation of breakthrough cancer pain and the need for a tailored treatment thereof, the aim of this study is to observe the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of sublingual fentanyl for the alleviation of BTcP in Korean patients. Additionally, the study may provide an insight into the specific needs of Korean patients with regards to pharmacological control of BTcP.\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\n### 2.1 Study design overview\n\nThe study is a non-interventional, observational study conducted in 13 academic hospitals in the Republic of Korea. Patients with BTcP who were prescribed with the sublingual tablet of fentanyl citrate, marketed as Abstral, are followed up for twelve weeks to collect the information about dose titration, pain status, quality of life, and AEs related with the product . The main objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of Abstral in Korean patients with various cancers in a real-world clinical setting.

To be eligible for the study the patients needed to\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> have a history of previous unsuccessful treatment for BTcP with other fentanyl products,\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> have at least one episode of BTcP per day during the week preceding the enrollment,\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> receive opioids for persistent cancer pain, and\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> show tolerance to opioid therapy, that is, receive oral morphine ≥60 mg/d, fentanyl patch ≥25 μg/h, oxycodone ≥30 mg/d, oral hydromorphone ≥8 mg/d, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week or longer.\n\nPatients who used Abstral within one month before the enrollment, had contraindications for treatment with Abstral, participated in an opioid-related clinical trial within 30 days before the enrollment, or suffered from neuropathic pain are excluded from the study.\n\n### 2.4 Product overview, dosage and administration methods\n\nAbstral is immediate-release fentanyl citrate in sublingual formulation indicated for the management of BTcP in adults with cancer who are already receiving maintenance opioid therapy for chronic persistent cancer pain and are considered to be opioid-tolerant. Each sublingual tablet contains 100 μg, 200 μg, 300 μg, or 400 μg of fentanyl. The dose of Abstral should be individually titrated upwardly until the optimal maintenance dose is achieved, which means that all patients must receive 100 μg of fentanyl as an initial dose. If adequate analgesia is achieved within 30 minutes of the initial dose, no further titration is required. Otherwise, the dose needs to be increased at 100 μg increments, up to 800 μg. If the sufficient analgesic effect has not been achieved, Abstral can be re-administered after 30 minutes. During the dose titration, 100 _μg_ or 200 _μg_ tablets can be used, but more than four tablets cannot be administered simultaneously. The number of administrations should not exceed two per one BTcP episode, and administration for another BTcP episode should be made at least 2 hours later.\n\n### 2.5 Data collection schedule\n\nStudy-related data are to be collected at baseline, Week 1 (± three days), Week 4 (± one week), and Week 12 (± four weeks). As the study is non-interventional, the schedule of clinic visits and medical decisions, including prescription or withdrawal of Abstral, remains solely at the investigator's discretion. Information about patient demographics, past medical history, previous treatment for BTcP, the reason for its discontinuation, and maintenance opioid therapy was collected as baseline data. Validated Korean version of Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form is used to assess pain intensity and its impact on the patient functioning.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> In addition, pain diaries are distributed to patients at each clinic visit, to collect the information about the administration time and dosage of Abstral, pain intensity, and daily sleep disturbance record. During the baseline visit, patient expectations regarding the analgesic effect of Abstral are determined with an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS, 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable), to be verified at Week 1. The information about concomitant medications and any AEs occurring after administration of Abstral is collected throughout the study period.\n\n### 2.6 Study endpoints\n\nThe primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects who achieved successful titration of Abstral. The titration is to be considered successful if\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> no additional dose of sublingual fentanyl is given within two hours of Abstral administration during the maintenance phase,\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> a decrease in pain intensity by at least 2 points of the NRS is observed at 30 minutes post-dosing, and\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> adverse drug reactions, if any, are tolerated by the subject. Secondary endpoints include the analgesia achievement rate at Week 1 based on the NRS goal set by the subject, Abstral maintenance dose after the dose titration, Abstral maintenance doses at Week 4 and Week 12, BPI scores, maximum pain intensity among all incidences of BTcP, pain intensity difference at 30 and 60 minutes from the pre-dose score and the quality of sleep.\n\nFor safety endpoints, AEs having a causal relationship with Abstral are to be analyzed. More exploratory analyses may be carried out depending on the available data, and the additional analyses will be prespecified in the statistical analysis plan.\n\n### 2.7 Criteria for subject withdrawal\n\nSubjects can be dropped out from the study if they withdraw their consent for participation, the investigator assesses the subject as ineligible for the study participation, Abstral is discontinued due to serious AE, or the subject is lost to follow-up or dies. For those who are prematurely dropped out from the study, data collected up to the withdrawal point are to be included in the analysis.\n\n### 2.8 Definition of an adverse event and AE reporting\n\nAEs are defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom or disease occurring in a subject after administration of Abstral, regardless of a causal relationship with Abstral. Adverse drug reaction is defined as any adverse event in the case of which causal relationship with Abstral cannot be ruled out. Causality categories for the AEs are classified in accordance with the local regulations. Except for the cases not applicable for the causality assessment, AEs falling into any of the remaining causality categories are deemed as related with Abstral.\n\nAEs can be collected as objective data, such as abnormal laboratory results, investigator's observations, or reports by the subject or the subject's caregiver delivered via telephone, letter, or e-mail. Investigator assesses all recognized AEs and collects the relevant data, such as start and stop dates, intensity, causality with Abstral, treatments to resolve the event, if any, and the outcome thereof. If any serious AE occurs during the study period, the investigator should report it to the sponsor within 24 hours from the time of emergence, regardless of the event's causality with Abstral. Reporting to the local institutional review board (IRB) of each investigational site is to be done following the applicable IRB rules. The sponsor should report a serious adverse drug reaction to the applicable local authority within the legally defined time frame. If pregnancy is identified during the study, the investigator should report it to the sponsor within five days from the time of awareness. If the outcome of the pregnancy satisfies the definition of a serious AE, it should be reported following the same procedures as for other serious AEs. Any serious AE resulting in death, hospitalization, or prolongation of hospitalization due to cancer disease progression will not be considered as a serious adverse drug reaction.\n\n### 2.9 Data collection, quality control and assurance\n\nAll predefined study data are collected on the paper case report form. Regular site monitoring is ongoing by a contract research organization to verify the completeness of the data collected on the case report forms against the source documents. An independent site audit can be done according to the quality assurance policy of the sponsor or the contract research organization. As this study is not an interventional study, a data monitoring committee was not considered to be necessary. All study data will be collected, managed, and analyzed in accordance with the principles of good clinical practice.\n\n### 2.10 Sample size estimation and statistical analysis methods\n\nThe total number of subjects was determined as 309 based on the following assumptions: a total of 262 subjects’ data will guarantee the precision of confidence interval (CI) for the primary endpoint (assumed as 64.4%) at the width of 0.12. The success rate of the primary endpoint was based on the previous study by Nalamachu et al.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Considering a 15% drop-out rate, a total of 309 subjects are targeted for the enrollment.\n\nAll enrolled subjects who receive at least a single dose of Abstral and are followed up for safety at least once will be included in the safety analysis. Among them, the subjects who have at least one effectiveness datum are to be included in the efficacy set. The primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed with the effectiveness set. The number and percentage of subjects achieving successful dose titration at Week 1, Week 4, and Week 12 will be presented, along with 95% CIs. For analgesia achievement rate at Week 1, the number and percentage of subjects whose NRS at Week 1 is less than the set goal at the baseline will be presented with 95% CIs. Descriptive statistics will be presented for the secondary endpoints that are collected as numerical data, such as maintenance doses, BPI scores, pain intensity differences, maximum pain intensity, and the number of sleep disturbances. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be prepared by an independent statistician before database lock.\n\n### 2.11 Ethical aspects and data protection\n\nThe final version of the protocol and consent form  were reviewed and approved by IRB of each hospital. If any further amendment is needed, the amendments will be submitted to the IRBs for approval before implementing any changes. Any of study-related activities were initiated after each IRB approval on the study protocol and the related documents. Investigators approach individual subject candidate to ask his/her voluntary participation in the study. The subject's data are collected only if the patient provides written consent to participate in the study. The subjects can withdraw their consent on the use of their data for the study purposes at any time during the study period. No source data containing personal information of the subjects will be exported outside the investigational site, and all the study data collected on the case report form will be anonymized. Study-related documents and data will be kept for three years after the completion/termination of the study. The study is conducted in compliance with the study protocol, local regulations, and the principles of good clinical practice, and the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration.\n\n### 2.12 Data dissemination plan\n\nThe study is registered in the www.clinicaltrials.gov , where the study status will be timely updated. Except for the current publication of the study design, the results of this study will be shared in a peer-reviewed journal within a year after the clinical study report is finalized. All investigators will have a right to access the raw data of which ultimate ownership lies with the sponsor, A. Menarini Korea Ltd.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nDevelopment of highly lipophilic opioids that can be absorbed via oral mucosa constituted a milestone in the management of BTcP. As a highly lipophilic compound, fentanyl is suitable for transmucosal administration, and hence, its analgesic effect is observed much earlier than in the case of hydrophilic immediate-release opioids.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Abstral, the sublingual fentanyl is a fast-absorbing tablet containing a mixture of fentanyl and soluble carrier particles.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> Due to its rapid absorption via oral mucosa,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> sublingual fentanyl provides effective analgesia within 10–15 minutes of administration in opioid-tolerant patients with BTcP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Available evidence suggests that sublingual fentanyl may be superior to other immediate-release fentanyl formulations, such as oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate and fentanyl buccal tablets (FBT).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> The sublingual mucosa is considerably more permeable than the buccal area and, therefore, could allow more rapid absorption of suitable molecules.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21,22]</u></a></sup> Further, unlike for sublingual fentanyl, a significant amount of the active substance from the formulations agitated against the inside of the cheek or placed between the cheek and gum may be swallowed, resulting in two phases of absorption, variable bioavailability and later onset of action.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20,23]</u></a></sup> Finally, manipulation of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate against the cheek was shown to be associated with application site reactions, such as gum bleeding and irritation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe efficacy and long-term tolerability of sublingual fentanyl were verified in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III trial of 131 opioid-tolerant American patients with BTcP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> After a 2-week open-label titration phase, 61 patients were randomized to a double-blind efficacy study during which they received either sublingual fentanyl or placebo, followed by a long-term safety analysis lasting for up to 12 months. The rate of successful titrations (59.5%) was similar like in previous studies of oral transmucosal fentanyl.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,25]</u></a></sup> Sublingual fentanyl provided effective analgesia at all available dose strengths, from 100 μg to 800 μg. The study drug was superior to placebo in terms of the sum of pain intensity difference at 30 min and 60 min post-administration, as well as with regards to pain intensity difference and pain relief at all post-dose time points across the 60-minute evaluation period. Sublingual fentanyl was tolerated well, with ≥1 study drug-related AE found in 41 out of 131 (31.3%) patients included in the safety set. The most common AEs were nausea (12.2%), vomiting (5.3%) and somnolence (4.3%). The pattern of AEs was consistent with that observed previously in other trials of oral transmucosal fentanyl.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,25]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe findings presented above were complemented by the results of a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter phase III study of 139 opioid-tolerant American patients with BTcP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> A total of 69% of the patients, in whom an effective dose of sublingual fentanyl has been identified over a 2-week titration phase, entered a maintenance phase that lasted up to 12 months. Administration of the study drug contributed to a significant improvement in reported satisfaction with pain medication, as shown by an increase in the patients’ global evaluation of medication scores at six months of treatment and the end of the study. Despite high levels of the underlying disease, the study patients did not show a deterioration in the quality of life measured with the BPI and the depression, anxiety, and positive outlook scale. Furthermore, some of the quality of life indices, e.g. current pain, pain relief, and pain interference with daily functioning for the BPI and depression component of the depression, anxiety and positive outlook scale have improved significantly over the study period. The safety profile of sublingual fentanyl was similar to that reported previously by Rauck et al.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> with AEs considered to be possibly or probably related to the study drug found in 49 out of 139 (35.3%) patients.\n\nDue to its real-world approach to data collection, the present study is intended to add to the existing evidence reviewed above. Unlike in previous trials of sublingual fentanyl,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17,24]</u></a></sup> the list of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the present study is relatively short, which will likely make the study group more representative for the entire population of cancer patients suffering from BTcP. Further, all treatment-related decisions are left solely on the investigator's discretion, which will enable to analyze the outcomes of the treatment in various clinical scenarios, unlikely to be tested in a traditional clinical trial. These two features of the present study seem to be essential in the context of BTcP management. BTcP is a highly heterogeneous condition requiring an individualized approach. Hence, the information about the most effective treatment schemes tailored to patients’ needs and less common AEs, if any, can be obtained with real-world studies and a growing body of evidence suggests that this type of studies provides more generalizable results compared with traditional randomized clinical trials.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup>\n\nMoreover, an important methodological difference between the present study and previous trials needs to be emphasized; unlike in the previous trials,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17,24]</u></a></sup> the present study includes patients with a history of unsuccessful control of BTcP with other fentanyl formulations than sublingual fentanyl. Hence, the study might explain whether switching from one immediate-release fentanyl to another provides a clinical benefit and/or is associated with any specific risk.\n\nAside from the purely clinical benefits discussed above, this study might also have an added value, i.e. provide information about specific needs of Korean cancer patients with BTcP with regards to pain control. While the incidence and clinical presentation of BTcP are generally not infrequently dealt within available literature, even less is known about the characteristics of this condition in the population of Korean cancer patients. Based on our yet unpublished experiences and some scarce literature data,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,27]</u></a></sup> we expect some ethnic/cultural differences in attitudes to cancer pain management, both among Korean patients and Korean physicians; identification of such differences might be of interest for the global research community. Further, the results of this study might be important from a local perspective, providing an argument for a modification of prescription practices currently in the Republic of Korea.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** All authors equally contributed to the design of the study.\n\n**Funding acquisition:** Sang Won Park acquired the financial support for the project leading to this publication.\n\n**Investigation:** All authors except Sang Won Park recruit patients and conduct the study.\n\n**Methodology:** Jin Seok Ahn, Youn Seon Choi, and Sang Won Park further developed the details of the study methodology.\n\n**Project administration:** Jin Seok Ahn and Sang Won Park are responsible for the management and coordination of the study activity planning and execution.\n\n**Supervision:** Jin Seok Ahn, Youn Seon Choi, and Sang Won Park are responsible for the oversight of the study activity planning and execution.\n\n**Writing:** Jin Seok Ahn, Youn Seon Choi, and Sang Won Park wrote the original draft and all authors participated in the reviewing and editing of the manuscript.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "2.12 Data dissemination plan\nThe study is registered in the www.clinicaltrials.gov , where the study status will be timely updated.

Menarini Korea Ltd.", "content": "1 Introduction\n--------------\n\nBreakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) can be generally defined as a transient exacerbation of pain occurring on a background of otherwise stable persistent pain in cancer patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> However, published definitions and criteria for BTcP vary considerably,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u></a></sup> and hence, available data on the occurrence of this condition are highly inconsistent, with the reported prevalence rates between 19% and 89%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,4–8]</u></a></sup>\n\nRegardless of its prevalence, BTcP has a detrimental effect on the quality of life and everyday functioning of cancer patients, and thus, its control represents an important therapeutic objective.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,9]</u></a></sup> Typically, the onset of BTcP is rapid; the pain does not last long and has a severe intensity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Due to such characteristics, the primary treatments of BTcP nowadays are immediate-release opioids, along with adequate control of the background pain with around-the-clock administration of long-acting analgesics.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Traditional immediate-release opioid analgesics are effective and convenient as the patients themselves can adjust the dose to their actual needs. However, many drugs from this group are hydrophilic, and as such, undergo preferential gastrointestinal absorption and first-pass metabolism. As a result, the onset of their action is delayed, with a peak activity observed no earlier than 30 to 45 minutes post-administration.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,12–14]</u></a></sup>\n\nAn alternative approach to the treatment of BTcP is the administration of highly lipophilic opioids which are readily absorbed via the oral mucosa, and hence, provide a more rapid onset of analgesia than the hydrophilic oral agents. Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic opioid suitable for oral transmucosal administration.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,9,15]</u></a></sup> Sublingual fentanyl citrate (sublingual fentanyl; Abstral) has been developed to provide rapid-onset analgesia in BTcP. The product was shown to reach its peak blood concentrations within 10 minutes of sublingual administration,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> and to provide rapid-onset analgesia with the profile of adverse events (AEs) similar to that typical for conventional opioid analgesics.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\nWhile the efficacy and safety of sublingual fentanyl have been already confirmed in clinical trials, we lack real-world evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of this agent in the control of BTcP. Given the heterogeneous presentation of breakthrough cancer pain and the need for a tailored treatment thereof, the aim of this study is to observe the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of sublingual fentanyl for the alleviation of BTcP in Korean patients. Additionally, the study may provide an insight into the specific needs of Korean patients with regards to pharmacological control of BTcP.\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\n### 2.1 Study design overview\n\nThe study is a non-interventional, observational study conducted in 13 academic hospitals in the Republic of Korea. Patients with BTcP who were prescribed with the sublingual tablet of fentanyl citrate, marketed as Abstral, are followed up for twelve weeks to collect the information about dose titration, pain status, quality of life, and AEs related with the product . The main objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of Abstral in Korean patients with various cancers in a real-world clinical setting. The study is sponsored by A. Menarini Korea Ltd, the marketing authorization holder of Abstral in the Republic of Korea.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nStudy schematic.

The first IRB approval was obtained on May 04, 2017. Enrollment of the first patient occurred on July 04, 2017, a total of 136 patients have been recruited in the study as of December 15, 2020. The study is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.\n\n### 2.3 Subject selection and eligibility criteria\n\nThe study includes adult male and female patients ≥19 years of age, both inpatients and outpatients, with uncontrolled BTcP for which Abstral was indicated. To be eligible for the study the patients needed to\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> have a history of previous unsuccessful treatment for BTcP with other fentanyl products,\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> have at least one episode of BTcP per day during the week preceding the enrollment,\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> receive opioids for persistent cancer pain, and\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> show tolerance to opioid therapy, that is, receive oral morphine ≥60 mg/d, fentanyl patch ≥25 μg/h, oxycodone ≥30 mg/d, oral hydromorphone ≥8 mg/d, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week or longer.\n\nPatients who used Abstral within one month before the enrollment, had contraindications for treatment with Abstral, participated in an opioid-related clinical trial within 30 days before the enrollment, or suffered from neuropathic pain are excluded from the study.\n\n### 2.4 Product overview, dosage and administration methods\n\nAbstral is immediate-release fentanyl citrate in sublingual formulation indicated for the management of BTcP in adults with cancer who are already receiving maintenance opioid therapy for chronic persistent cancer pain and are considered to be opioid-tolerant. Each sublingual tablet contains 100 μg, 200 μg, 300 μg, or 400 μg of fentanyl. The dose of Abstral should be individually titrated upwardly until the optimal maintenance dose is achieved, which means that all patients must receive 100 μg of fentanyl as an initial dose. If adequate analgesia is achieved within 30 minutes of the initial dose, no further titration is required. Otherwise, the dose needs to be increased at 100 μg increments, up to 800 μg. If the sufficient analgesic effect has not been achieved, Abstral can be re-administered after 30 minutes. During the dose titration, 100 _μg_ or 200 _μg_ tablets can be used, but more than four tablets cannot be administered simultaneously. The number of administrations should not exceed two per one BTcP episode, and administration for another BTcP episode should be made at least 2 hours later.\n\n### 2.5 Data collection schedule\n\nStudy-related data are to be collected at baseline, Week 1 (± three days), Week 4 (± one week), and Week 12 (± four weeks). As the study is non-interventional, the schedule of clinic visits and medical decisions, including prescription or withdrawal of Abstral, remains solely at the investigator's discretion. Information about patient demographics, past medical history, previous treatment for BTcP, the reason for its discontinuation, and maintenance opioid therapy was collected as baseline data. Validated Korean version of Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form is used to assess pain intensity and its impact on the patient functioning.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> In addition, pain diaries are distributed to patients at each clinic visit, to collect the information about the administration time and dosage of Abstral, pain intensity, and daily sleep disturbance record. During the baseline visit, patient expectations regarding the analgesic effect of Abstral are determined with an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS, 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable), to be verified at Week 1. The information about concomitant medications and any AEs occurring after administration of Abstral is collected throughout the study period.\n\n### 2.6 Study endpoints\n\nThe primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects who achieved successful titration of Abstral. The titration is to be considered successful if\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> no additional dose of sublingual fentanyl is given within two hours of Abstral administration during the maintenance phase,\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> a decrease in pain intensity by at least 2 points of the NRS is observed at 30 minutes post-dosing, and\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> adverse drug reactions, if any, are tolerated by the subject. Secondary endpoints include the analgesia achievement rate at Week 1 based on the NRS goal set by the subject, Abstral maintenance dose after the dose titration, Abstral maintenance doses at Week 4 and Week 12, BPI scores, maximum pain intensity among all incidences of BTcP, pain intensity difference at 30 and 60 minutes from the pre-dose score and the quality of sleep.\n\nFor safety endpoints, AEs having a causal relationship with Abstral are to be analyzed. More exploratory analyses may be carried out depending on the available data, and the additional analyses will be prespecified in the statistical analysis plan.\n\n### 2.7 Criteria for subject withdrawal\n\nSubjects can be dropped out from the study if they withdraw their consent for participation, the investigator assesses the subject as ineligible for the study participation, Abstral is discontinued due to serious AE, or the subject is lost to follow-up or dies. For those who are prematurely dropped out from the study, data collected up to the withdrawal point are to be included in the analysis.\n\n### 2.8 Definition of an adverse event and AE reporting\n\nAEs are defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom or disease occurring in a subject after administration of Abstral, regardless of a causal relationship with Abstral. Adverse drug reaction is defined as any adverse event in the case of which causal relationship with Abstral cannot be ruled out. Causality categories for the AEs are classified in accordance with the local regulations. Except for the cases not applicable for the causality assessment, AEs falling into any of the remaining causality categories are deemed as related with Abstral.\n\nAEs can be collected as objective data, such as abnormal laboratory results, investigator's observations, or reports by the subject or the subject's caregiver delivered via telephone, letter, or e-mail. Investigator assesses all recognized AEs and collects the relevant data, such as start and stop dates, intensity, causality with Abstral, treatments to resolve the event, if any, and the outcome thereof. If any serious AE occurs during the study period, the investigator should report it to the sponsor within 24 hours from the time of emergence, regardless of the event's causality with Abstral. Reporting to the local institutional review board (IRB) of each investigational site is to be done following the applicable IRB rules. The sponsor should report a serious adverse drug reaction to the applicable local authority within the legally defined time frame. If pregnancy is identified during the study, the investigator should report it to the sponsor within five days from the time of awareness. If the outcome of the pregnancy satisfies the definition of a serious AE, it should be reported following the same procedures as for other serious AEs. Any serious AE resulting in death, hospitalization, or prolongation of hospitalization due to cancer disease progression will not be considered as a serious adverse drug reaction.\n\n### 2.9 Data collection, quality control and assurance\n\nAll predefined study data are collected on the paper case report form.

Menarini Korea Ltd.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nDevelopment of highly lipophilic opioids that can be absorbed via oral mucosa constituted a milestone in the management of BTcP. As a highly lipophilic compound, fentanyl is suitable for transmucosal administration, and hence, its analgesic effect is observed much earlier than in the case of hydrophilic immediate-release opioids.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Abstral, the sublingual fentanyl is a fast-absorbing tablet containing a mixture of fentanyl and soluble carrier particles.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> Due to its rapid absorption via oral mucosa,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> sublingual fentanyl provides effective analgesia within 10–15 minutes of administration in opioid-tolerant patients with BTcP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Available evidence suggests that sublingual fentanyl may be superior to other immediate-release fentanyl formulations, such as oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate and fentanyl buccal tablets (FBT).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> The sublingual mucosa is considerably more permeable than the buccal area and, therefore, could allow more rapid absorption of suitable molecules.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21,22]</u></a></sup> Further, unlike for sublingual fentanyl, a significant amount of the active substance from the formulations agitated against the inside of the cheek or placed between the cheek and gum may be swallowed, resulting in two phases of absorption, variable bioavailability and later onset of action.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20,23]</u></a></sup> Finally, manipulation of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate against the cheek was shown to be associated with application site reactions, such as gum bleeding and irritation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe efficacy and long-term tolerability of sublingual fentanyl were verified in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III trial of 131 opioid-tolerant American patients with BTcP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> After a 2-week open-label titration phase, 61 patients were randomized to a double-blind efficacy study during which they received either sublingual fentanyl or placebo, followed by a long-term safety analysis lasting for up to 12 months. The rate of successful titrations (59.5%) was similar like in previous studies of oral transmucosal fentanyl.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,25]</u></a></sup> Sublingual fentanyl provided effective analgesia at all available dose strengths, from 100 μg to 800 μg. The study drug was superior to placebo in terms of the sum of pain intensity difference at 30 min and 60 min post-administration, as well as with regards to pain intensity difference and pain relief at all post-dose time points across the 60-minute evaluation period. Sublingual fentanyl was tolerated well, with ≥1 study drug-related AE found in 41 out of 131 (31.3%) patients included in the safety set. The most common AEs were nausea (12.2%), vomiting (5.3%) and somnolence (4.3%). The pattern of AEs was consistent with that observed previously in other trials of oral transmucosal fentanyl.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,25]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe findings presented above were complemented by the results of a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter phase III study of 139 opioid-tolerant American patients with BTcP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> A total of 69% of the patients, in whom an effective dose of sublingual fentanyl has been identified over a 2-week titration phase, entered a maintenance phase that lasted up to 12 months. Administration of the study drug contributed to a significant improvement in reported satisfaction with pain medication, as shown by an increase in the patients’ global evaluation of medication scores at six months of treatment and the end of the study. Despite high levels of the underlying disease, the study patients did not show a deterioration in the quality of life measured with the BPI and the depression, anxiety, and positive outlook scale. Furthermore, some of the quality of life indices, e.g. current pain, pain relief, and pain interference with daily functioning for the BPI and depression component of the depression, anxiety and positive outlook scale have improved significantly over the study period. The safety profile of sublingual fentanyl was similar to that reported previously by Rauck et al.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> with AEs considered to be possibly or probably related to the study drug found in 49 out of 139 (35.3%) patients.\n\nDue to its real-world approach to data collection, the present study is intended to add to the existing evidence reviewed above. Unlike in previous trials of sublingual fentanyl,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17,24]</u></a></sup> the list of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the present study is relatively short, which will likely make the study group more representative for the entire population of cancer patients suffering from BTcP. Further, all treatment-related decisions are left solely on the investigator's discretion, which will enable to analyze the outcomes of the treatment in various clinical scenarios, unlikely to be tested in a traditional clinical trial. These two features of the present study seem to be essential in the context of BTcP management. BTcP is a highly heterogeneous condition requiring an individualized approach. Hence, the information about the most effective treatment schemes tailored to patients’ needs and less common AEs, if any, can be obtained with real-world studies and a growing body of evidence suggests that this type of studies provides more generalizable results compared with traditional randomized clinical trials.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup>\n\nMoreover, an important methodological difference between the present study and previous trials needs to be emphasized; unlike in the previous trials,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17,24]</u></a></sup> the present study includes patients with a history of unsuccessful control of BTcP with other fentanyl formulations than sublingual fentanyl. Hence, the study might explain whether switching from one immediate-release fentanyl to another provides a clinical benefit and/or is associated with any specific risk.\n\nAside from the purely clinical benefits discussed above, this study might also have an added value, i.e. provide information about specific needs of Korean cancer patients with BTcP with regards to pain control. While the incidence and clinical presentation of BTcP are generally not infrequently dealt within available literature, even less is known about the characteristics of this condition in the population of Korean cancer patients. Based on our yet unpublished experiences and some scarce literature data,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,27]</u></a></sup> we expect some ethnic/cultural differences in attitudes to cancer pain management, both among Korean patients and Korean physicians; identification of such differences might be of interest for the global research community. Further, the results of this study might be important from a local perspective, providing an argument for a modification of prescription practices currently in the Republic of Korea.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** All authors equally contributed to the design of the study.\n\n**Funding acquisition:** Sang Won Park acquired the financial support for the project leading to this publication.\n\n**Investigation:** All authors except Sang Won Park recruit patients and conduct the study.\n\n**Methodology:** Jin Seok Ahn, Youn Seon Choi, and Sang Won Park further developed the details of the study methodology.\n\n**Project administration:** Jin Seok Ahn and Sang Won Park are responsible for the management and coordination of the study activity planning and execution.\n\n**Supervision:** Jin Seok Ahn, Youn Seon Choi, and Sang Won Park are responsible for the oversight of the study activity planning and execution.\n\n**Writing:** Jin Seok Ahn, Youn Seon Choi, and Sang Won Park wrote the original draft and all authors participated in the reviewing and editing of the manuscript.</u>", "index": 15110, "show": true, "start": 15110, "end": 15558, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:43:15", "endTime": "2024/09/19 15:01:00", "cost": 1064.585}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 23:00:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:43:15"}

These mutations classically cause central core disease (CCD; MIM#117000) and the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility trait (MIM#145600), which are usually dominantly inherited, but recessive mutations have been recognized recently.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,6–9]</u></a></sup> A dramatic expansion in the identification of additional histopathological variants has found that _RYR1_ mutations are associated with multiminicore disease, congenital fiber-type disproportion, CNM, and King Denborough syndrome.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,5,7,10–14]</u></a></sup> Before NGS became widely available, ryanodine receptor type 1 (_RYR1_; MIM#180901) mutations were found in some sporadic cases of autosomal recessive CNM, but NGS has led to a dramatic increase in the identification of recessive _RYR1_\\-related CNM. In 2010, a definite association of CNM with _RYR1_ was established.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,5,15]</u></a></sup> Particularly among cases with recessive _RYR1_ mutations, CNM is not so rare.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u></a></sup>\n\nWe report a case of a Japanese male patient with recessive _RYR1_\\-related CNM. He had an exceedingly severe phenotype and congenital chylothorax, which is a very rare complication of CM.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA male neonate from non-consanguineous Japanese parents presented with generalized hypotonia and respiratory distress at birth in Germany. Three minutes after birth, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. He also had bilateral pleural effusions, which were diagnosed as chylothorax on laboratory examination . There were no central venous catheters in place, and no risk factors for chylothorax were identified. The patient was managed with drainage and octreotide acetate. Hypotonia, ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, facial weakness, and proximal muscle weakness were observed after birth. Muscle biopsy from the vastus lateralis performed at the age of 15 days showed global atrophy of muscle fibers with an extended spectrum of caliber and an increased number of muscular cells with an enlarged and centrally placed nucleus corresponding to the description of CNM. The NGS assay detected _RYR1_ gene mutations, which were c.5989G>A  and c.1441-2A>G. The c.5989G>A  mutation was registered in HGMD . Although the c.1441-2A>G mutation had not been registered in HGMD, as known here is the acceptor splice site of intron 13, we judged that this variant was expected to affect splicing in this area. Taken together, we concluded that these variants would affect the phenotype of our patient. The mother was heterozygous for the former mutation, and the father was heterozygous for the latter mutation. These variants were validated using Sanger sequencing. Other mutations (e.g. _MTM1_ and _DNM2_) were not detected. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of recessive _RYR1_\\-related CNM. There were no patients with CM in the parent's family, including his older brother. When the patient was six months of age, chylothorax could be managed with middle-chain triglyceride milk and diuretics. However, he developed a persistent ventilator requirement, necessitating tracheostomy. When he was eight months of age, he and his family moved to our hospital in Japan before receiving home care, and hypotonia was very severe, and he could move only his mouth and fingers. Furthermore, his clinical course was so rapidly progressive that he could not move his fingers when he was one year of age. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed marked diffuse non-selective atrophy of the lower limbs at the age of one year and four months . He was alive at four years of age but did not show any clinical improvement requiring ventilator and tube feeding. His family, including a sister who was two years younger, had no symptoms of CM.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nChest X-ray.

Furthermore, this case presented with congenital chylothorax as a very rare complication of recessive _RYR1_\\-related CNM.\n\nIn previous reports of _RYR1_\\-related CM, the cases did not reach high scores on the disease severity rating scale for ambulatory and respiratory status, but our case showed the most severe score.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u></a></sup> No cognitive involvement in _RYR1_\\-related CNM has been previously reported.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> On the other hand, we could not make an intellectual evaluation for our case because of the patient's lack of response. The common clinical features of recessive _RYR1_\\-related CNM in the study cohort were early onset of symptoms with hypotonia, motor development delay, proximal muscle weakness, and a stable clinical course with no exacerbations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Temporary improvement or improvement over time in conditions has been reported.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,16]</u></a></sup> Severity has been reported to be intermediate between the most severe form of CNM due to mutations in the _MTM1_ gene (XLMTM) and mild dominant cases associated with mutations in the _DNM2_ gene.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,7,10]</u></a></sup> However, our patient had an exceedingly severe phenotype indistinguishable from the XLMTM phenotype compared to previously reported cases because he required mechanical ventilation since birth and his hypotonia rapidly worsened.\n\nIn most cases of recessive _RYR1_\\-related CM, reduced _RYR1_ protein expression and dihydropyridine receptor have been reported.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,5,8,14]</u></a></sup> Amburgey et al investigated the genotype-phenotype correlations of 106 cases of recessive _RYR1_\\-related CM. In that report, the majority of patients with CNM/CNM-like disease had at least one hypomorphic allele, and a large proportion of patients with a severe phenotype had at least one hypomorphic allele, compared to patients with a mild phenotype.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> In our case, the c.5989G>A  mutation was a missense mutation, and c.1441-2A>G was an intron mutation of the acceptor splice site. Genetic analysis involving the identification of mRNA and protein expression will be more useful in these cases.\n\nFurthermore, our case had marked diffuse non-selective involvement of the thigh and lower leg muscles on MRI. Zhou et al characterized muscle MRI of the thigh and lower legs in _RYR1_\\-related CM. In patients with typical clinical features of CCD and dominant _RYR1_ mutations, there was a consistent pattern of selective muscle involvement characterized by relative sparing of the rectus femoris, gracilis, and adductor longus within the thigh, and sparing of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius within the lower legs. In patients with more generalized weakness and wasting, extraocular muscle involvement, and recessive _RYR1_ mutations, diffuse involvement of the thigh and lower leg muscles was observed, with some residual selectivity corresponding to that observed in the first group.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> Another report demonstrated that the consistent findings of relative sparing of involvement of the rectus femoris in comparison to the other components of the quadriceps complex was seen in patients with recessive _RYR1_ mutations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\nFinally, our patient had a chylothorax at birth. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of _RYR1_\\-related CM associated with congenital chylothorax. In other types of CM, three cases of congenital actin myopathy, XLMTM, and _DNM2_\\-related CNM have been reported. All cases were so severe that the patients died at the ages of 4, 9, and 5 weeks, respectively.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18–20]</u></a></sup> Several hypotheses have been discussed, but no conclusions have been reached. On the other hand, congenital chylothorax without malformation of the thoracic duct or a postoperative complication is frequently described in patients with congenital myotonic dystrophy (CMD).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21–24]</u></a></sup> There are several reports on the commonalities between CMD and CM. In the muscle pathology of CMD, the presence of numerous immature fibers with peripheral halo is a characteristic feature, together with an increased number of fibers with centrally placed nuclei and hypotrophy of type 1 fibers, mimicking XLMTM and CNM.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> Moreover, dystrophic features have been observed in biopsies from patients with _ACTA1 (Actin, Alpha, Skeletal Muscle 1)_ disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> Furthermore, in myotonic dystrophy type 1, disrupted mRNA splicing has been reported in several genes, which include _RYR1_.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u></a></sup>\n\nBoth our case and the reported cases of CM with congenital chylothorax had a more severe condition. Although the reasons are not clear, congenital chylothorax with CM, regardless of pathologic features and genotype, can probably be considered as an indicator of severe phenotypes such as CMD.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nCongenital chylothorax can lead to severe phenotypes or respiratory distress. The phenotype of CM is heterogeneous and varies. To predict the clinical course and prognosis, it is important to consider not only genotype and histological classifications, but also complications.\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment\n--------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Dr. Jakob Matschke at the Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf for histopathology analysis; Dr. Angela Abicht at Friedrich-Baur-Institute, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich for genetic analysis, and the medical editor from the Division of Education for Clinical Research at the National Center for Child Health and Development for editing this manuscript.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dr. Tanaka took care of the patient, conceptualized and designed the case report, drafted the initial manuscript, reviewed the available literature, and revised the manuscript.

It has affected more than 11.5 million people and caused death in more than 2.5 million.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Other than direct infection, COVID-19 has caused an immense psychological and socio-economic impact globally.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> As time elapses since the onset of the pandemic, new data is emerging with regards to the long-term complications of the disease. These complications involve various organ systems, ranging from psychiatric to organic symptoms.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3–8]</u></a></sup> Understanding the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 infection is imperative in order to effectively manage the healthcare burden secondary to the pandemic. The main objective of this meta-analysis will be to combine and statistically analyze the existing data on the long-term complications in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection.\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\nThis protocol is written following meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology Guidelines for Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u></a></sup> The protocol is registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews 删除5：<u>(registration number: CRD42021240027)</u>.\n\n### 2.1 Data sources search terms and search strategy\n\nTo reach the study objectives, searches will be carried out in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane library. The following search term will be used: (“Post Covid”) OR (“Post Covid-19”) OR (“Post coronavirus”) OR (“After COVID”) OR (“Post Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus \\[SARS-CoV-2\\]”) OR (“After SARS-CoV-2”) AND (“Complications”) AND (“sequelae”)\n\nThe systematic method specifies that all published research comprise of the literature search long-term complications of COVID-19 infection. The search strategy is deemed appropriate to minimize the risk of selection and detection bias. The search results will be exported to Endnote, where screening will be done, and duplicates will be excluded. Included studies will be manually screened to select other relevant studies from the references.\n\nA populated PRISMA-protocol checklist was used as an aid to authors to clearly, completely, and transparently let reviewers and readers know what authors intend to do.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n\n#### 2.2.1 Types of studies\n\nEligible studies should report the complications of COVID-19 infection in patients recovered from the infection. All literature, including clinical trials, case reports, case series, and observational studies (retrospective and prospective) from any date till March 2021 in the English language, will be included. Studies in languages other than English will not be included.\n\n#### 2.2.2 Participants\n\nThe study population will include pediatric (≤ 18 years) as well as adult (>18 years) patients who developed long-term complications of COVID-19 infection. The included patients should have a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and should have a documented recovery confirmed with a negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Included patients should have complication in any system, at least 3 months after the first positive RT-PCR.\n\nExclusion criteria include patients with COVID-19 who did not have a positive RT-PCR upon diagnosis, those who had complications during the infection (defined by a positive RT-PCR) and those who had onset of complications in less than 3 months of the positive RT-PCR.\n\n### 2.3 Data extraction (selection and coding)\n\nFour members (FA, HC, RS, NEO) will individually determine the eligibility of the references exported to the citation manager. The authors will screen the articles from title, abstract and keywords following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results from each author will be cross-checked by another to ensure accuracy of implementation of inclusion and exclusion criterion. Any disagreements will be carefully evaluated and solved by an independent member (PI). Subsequently, the initial four members will then scrutinize the full-length articles for inclusion in the study. A Prisma flowchart will be formulated of the whole selection process .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nPrisma flowchart diagram.</u>\n\nFour members (BM, PI, OT, HW) will individually extract the data from the finalized articles into the data extraction sheet. Results of each member will be double-checked by another member among the group in order to maintain accuracy. The data collection sheet will comprise of digital object identifier, author name, study title, year of publication, patient demographics (number of patients, gender, age, nationality, body mass index), symptoms of COVID-19 infection with duration (fever, cough, dyspnea, sputum production, chest pain, headache, flu, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, loss of sensation of taste and smell), diagnostic methodology (RT-PCR, high-resolution computed tomography), duration of positivity of RT-PCR, time of onset of complications and category of complications (cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system, endocrine system, immune and lymphatic system, musculoskeletal system, nervous system, renal system, reproductive system, psychiatric system, and others). Data collection sheet will also include duration of the complications till an outcome (resolved, not resolved, improved, deteriorated, and death). Lastly it will include treatments given during the COVID-19 infection and for the complications.\n\n### 2.4 Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis of the outcomes will be done using descriptive statistics will be used to describe the socio-demographic and clinical parameters of the population, with continuous variables presented as means (±standard deviation) or Median (interquartile range) as appropriate. Additionally, categorical variables were presented as numbers (percentages or proportions). Pairwise comparisons, where applicable, between continuous and categorical study variables were carried out with student t-test and chi-square tests.\n\n### 2.5 Assessment of methodological quality (risk of bias)\n\nTwo members (FA and NO) will assess the study's validity using the methodological methods and categories outlined in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, as well as PRISMA and other relevant guidelines. If the members will reach a disagreement, a staff meeting will be arranged to come to a conclusion. Other potential issues such as baseline imbalance will also be considered. The effect of certain biases (e.g. publication bias, selective reporting within studies) on cumulative evidence will be evaluated. The effect of such biases will be further assessed by plotting the effect by the inverse of its standard error.\n\nThe resultant funnel plots 通用删除1(英):<u>(using applicable standard statistical software like CMA and STATA)</u> will be analyzed for their symmetry manually and formally with Egger test to see if the effect decreased with increasing sample size.\n\n### 2.6 Meta-analytic approach\n\nThe meta-analysis will be performed and conducted using standard statistical softwares like CMA and STATA. Confidence intervals (CI) will be set at 95%. Inconsistency index will be used to assess inter-study heterogeneity. When significant heterogeneity is present (i.e. I2 >50%), we will implement a random-effects model in order to calculate pooled estimates of specific effect size measures along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).\n\nWe will conduct a Subgroup analysis depending on potential factors and covariates that might affect primary outcome measures mainly. To investigate individual studies’ effect concerning the meta-analysis's primary outcome measures, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted.\n\nWe intend to produce a network plot to represent the data from all trials included in the analysis. Contribution by each direct comparison to the network estimate will be calculated according to the direct treatment effect variance and the network structure, which will be summarized in a contribution plot.\n\nWe will also formulate a forest plot of the estimated summary effects. It will summarize CIs for all comparisons, relative mean effect or other effect size measure, and prediction on each comparison in one plot.\n\nStatistical analysis will be conducted on potential subgroups and stratifications (e.g. stage and severity of the disease, age group, gender, clinical significance, and co-morbidity, etc.) that may affect primary outcome measures.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThere has been a global dissemination of knowledge with the availability and open access to the rapidly accumulating literature on the pathophysiology, transmission, clinical course, and management of COVID-19 infection. This has had a considerably positive impact on healthcare, more so in the resource limited part of the world, where the access has remained somewhat restricted. Current focus of the medical and scientific community is COVID-19 vaccination and post COVID-19 complications.\n\nComplications during COVID-19 such as respiratory failure, venous thromboembolism, cardiac injury, myocarditis, cardiogenic shock, encephalopathy, and superimposed have been studied and helped alter or augment the management guidelines in the past year.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12–15]</u></a></sup> With more and more patients recovering from the infection, there is accumulating data on various types of post recovery complications. Such complications either continue throughout the infection and after or start after recovery from the acute phase.

She visited our hospital because of vaginal discomfort. Vaginal examination revealed a 6 cm uterine endocervical polyp. Hysteroscopy revealed a uterine cervical polyp with the stalk attached to the left wall of the cervical canal, and multiple endometrial polyps in the fundus, corneal area, anterior and posterior wall of the uterine cavity. Transvaginal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple intramural uterine myomas. The tumor marker levels were as follows; carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); 0.9 IU/ml, CA19–9; 4.0 IU/ml, CA125; 18 IU/ml. Cytology of uterine endocervix and endometrium were normal. Pre-operative blood tests showed mild anemia (hemoglobin 10.7 g/ L), but coagulation profile (platelet count 29.2 × 10<sup>9</sup> / L, prothrombin time 12.7 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time 26.6 seconds, fibrinogen 250 mg/ dl, bleeding time 1.3 minutes) was normal.\n\nWe diagnosed uterine endocervical polyp and multiple endometrial polyps with uterine myomas. We performed hysteroscopic resection of endocervical polyp and endometrial polyps with TruClear, the hysteroscopic morcellator system. First, we dilated the internal os of the uterine cervix with Hegar dilators, and inserted the hysteroscopy. There were multiple endometrial polyps in the fundus, corneal area, anterior and posterior wall of the uterine cavity. We resected endometrial polyps with TruClear, and there was no apparent remnant in the uterine cavity.  Next, we morcellated the stalk of the uterine endocervical polyp with TruClear, then avulsed the endocervical polyp with the placenta forceps.  After resection, there was no apparent bleeding from the uterus. The operating time was 32 minutes and blood loss volume during surgery was 1 g. Next morning, 13 hours after surgery, the patient complained of vaginal bleeding and massive hemorrhage from the uterus was noted. We inserted the balloon catheter in the uterine cavity to stop hemorrhage, but it was unsuccessful. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed extravasation in the uterine cavity.  Amount of blood loss was totally 345 g. Uterine angiography showed extravasation from the branch of the left uterine artery,  and uterine arterial embolization (UAE) with gelatin sponge particles was performed. After UAE, hemorrhage was completely stopped, and the patient was discharged 3 days after surgery. Pathological diagnosis was uterine endocervical polyp and endometrial polyps without malignant findings. Afterwards, postoperative hysteroscopy showed no significant findings in the uterine cavity and the patient is currently asymptomatic.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nOperative findings.

There was no apparent bleeding from uterine cavity during surgery, and we found no apparent vessels on the endocervical canal. In view of the location of bleeding, it is possible that during resection of endocervical polyp, hysteroscopic morcellation could cause mechanical damage to the left uterine artery, which would become worse after surgery. There is no denying that insertion of Hegar dilator or placental forceps could damage uterine artery, but there were no apparent findings of cervical laceration and bleeding just after surgery, so it is unlikely that these procedures could cause massive hemorrhage. We found no prominent blood vessels in the uterine wall, but the size of endocervical polyp was large with a broad base, and there could be abundant blood flow beneath the stalk of the endocervical polyp. As of now, the safety of hysteroscopic morcellation in resection of endocervical polyp is not established,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> so it is crucial to consider the clinical benefit and risk of resection of endocervical polyp with hysteroscopic morcellation.\n\nHowever, there is a disadvantage of inability to coagulate bleeding vessels encountered during surgery in hysteroscopic tissue removal system, although there are other devices with coagulation and vaporizing system.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> As mentioned, there is no report of significant intraoperative or postoperative bleeding,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8–11]</u></a></sup> but it is crucial to consider the possibility of significant bleeding in hysteroscopic tissue removal system. Management option for intrauterine bleeding includes intracavitary placement of a Foley catheter with a 30-ml balloon providing counter-pressure, or more, depending on the uterine size, but in rare cases, the bleeding may require UAE or hysterectomy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> In our case, inserting balloon in uterine cavity was performed, but did not reduce bleeding, and UAE was performed successfully, avoiding hysterectomy. Also, we should consider using electro-coagulation technique, including bipolar electrosurgical devices, for any possibility of hemorrhage during hysteroscopic morcellation surgery.\n\nIn conclusion, we report a case of massive hemorrhage after resection of endocervical polyp and endometrial polyps with hysteroscopic tissue removal system. Hysteroscopic tissue removal system has optimal potential to result in shorter operative time, higher success rates and fewer complications. However, it is not clear whether hysteroscopic morcellation of endocervical polyp is safe, and it is not possible to coagulate bleeding vessels encountered during surgery. Therefore, surgeons should consider the possibility of significant hemorrhage associated with hysteroscopic morcellation. Also, use of electrocoagulation devices may clinically benefit in case of significant bleeding with hysteroscopic morcellation surgery.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Kazuki Takasaki, Hirofumi Henmi.\n\n**Data curation:** Kazuki Takasaki, Yusuke Sakuhara.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Utako Ikeda.\n\n**Investigation:** Kazuki Takasaki, Yusuke Sakuhara.\n\n**Methodology:** Kazuki Takasaki, Hirofumi Henmi, Yusuke Sakuhara.\n\n**Supervision:** Hirofumi Henmi, Toshiaki Endo.\n\n**Visualization:** Kazuki Takasaki, Yusuke Sakuhara.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Kazuki Takasaki.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Hirofumi Henmi, Utako Ikeda.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:34:15", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:34:21", "cost": 5.607}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:34:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:34:14"}

Recent advances in insulin preparations, insulin delivery systems, and glucose monitoring have made improvement of glycemia in patients with T1D more feasible. However, even when using these techniques in conjunction with intensive insulin therapy, maintaining postprandial glucose levels within the non-diabetic range remains challenging.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> One difficulty is that increasing the daily dose of insulin to lower the mean glucose levels can cause severe hypoglycemia and weight gain. Improvements will be needed to the adjunct therapies in order to improve glycemic control in patients with T1D without increasing these adverse side effects.\n\nSodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are insulin-independent hypoglycemic agents that inhibit glucose reabsorption from the proximal renal tubules.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> In Japan, two SGLT2 inhibitors, ipragliflozin and dapagliflozin, are available as adjuncts to insulin therapy in patients with T1D. A meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitors as an add-on to insulin therapy in T1D showed that SGLT2 inhibitors significantly decreased the levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight and total insulin dose but did not increase hypoglycemia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> A pooled analysis of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from phase III clinical trials of dapagliflozin (DEPICT-1<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> and -2<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup>) demonstrated a significant improvement in the percentage of time in the targeted glucose range (% time in range \\[TIR\\]) of 70 − 180 mg/dL (3.9 − 10.0 mmol/L), mean 24-hour glucose values, and glycemic variability.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Similar favorable results of CGM were observed in several studies in Japanese patients with T1D who were treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7–9]</u></a></sup> It is considered that SGLT2 inhibitors can potentially decrease the magnitude of blood glucose levels without increased risk of severe hypoglycemia because the amount of glucose excreted in the urine is regulated dependent on the blood glucose concentrations.\n\nHowever, the above meta-analysis demonstrated an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after administration of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T1D.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA can occur with near-normal glucose levels in patients with T1D, which is known as euglycemic DKA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> The treatment of euglycemic DKA can be delayed because the recognition and diagnosis are potentially difficult. Clinicians should educate T1D patients to mitigate the risk of developing DKA when initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor based on the international consensus<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> and the recommendations on the proper use of SGLT2 inhibitors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn recent years, the importance of glucagon in the pathogenesis of diabetes has been discussed.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13–15]</u></a></sup> Following the development of a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for glucagon in 2014,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> the dynamics of glucagon secretion were elucidated in healthy subjects,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> type 2 diabetes<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18–20]</u></a></sup> and gestational diabetes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> These studies suggested that inadequate hyperglucagonemia observed especially in the postprandial phase might contribute to an exacerbation of hyperglycemia in diabetic patients. We recently reported that glucagon response impacts postprandial glucose excursions independently of residual β-cell function in patients with T1D.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup>\n\nIt has been reported that the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin stimulated glucagon secretion from pancreatic α-cells.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24]</u></a></sup> It remains controversial whether these results were caused by a direct effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on α-cells or by a compensatory mechanism triggered by acutely declining blood glucose levels.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> Moreover, it remains unknown whether the increase in glucagon levels is a class-effect of all SGLT2 inhibitors or a drug-effect of a particular SGLT2 inhibitor.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u></a></sup> If an SGLT2 inhibitor enhances glucagon secretion, its adjunctive treatment might contribute to protection from hypoglycemia, leading to stabilization of glycemic fluctuation in patients with T1D. Conversely, the elevated glucagon levels may exacerbate postprandial hyperglycemia. Since glucagon promotes not only endogenous gluconeogenesis but also ketogenesis under the condition of insulin insufficiency, it is also important to investigate the association between glucagon secretion and euglycemic DKA in T1D patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\nWe designed the current study to clarify whether the fasting glucagon levels and the glucagon response to ingestion of a mixed meal are altered after administration of the SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin. We will investigate whether the glucagon responses under ipragliflozin treatment are associated with amelioration/deterioration in glycemic control and glycemic variability in patients with T1D. Moreover, we will explore whether the glucagon levels are associated with the levels of ketone bodies under the SGLT2 inhibition by ipragliflozin. Herein, we describe the study protocol . The results of this study are expected to provide evidence regarding the effect of ipragliflozin on the glucagon secretion and glucometabolic outcomes in patients with T1D.\n\n2 Methods/design\n----------------\n\n### 2.1 Objective\n\nThis study aims to determine whether the fasting glucagon levels and the glucagon response to ingestion of a mixed meal are altered after administration of ipragliflozin as an adjunctive therapy to insulin treatment in patients with T1D. We will also investigate whether the glucagon responses under ipragliflozin treatment are associated with amelioration/deterioration in glycemic control and variability.\n\n### 2.2 Study design\n\nThis is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label, prospective exploratory trial to assess the association of ipragliflozin on glucagon secretion and glucometabolic outcomes in patients with T1D. The study will be conducted at eight centers in Japan. In total, 30 patients with T1D will be recruited in the study, with a 12-week duration of observation. The target sample size is 24 patients, but we will recruit 30 patients to account for a potential dropout rate of 20%.\n\n### 2.3 Ethical considerations\n\nThe study was approved by the ethical committee of Nagasaki University Hospital (approval no. 20032311) and also approved by the local ethics committees in the other seven centers. The study was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry (study no. UMIN000039635). The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u></a></sup> the Clinical Trials Act of Japan 通用删除1(英):<u>(Act No. 16 of April 14, 2017)</u>, the Protection of Personal Information Act of Japan, and the present study protocol.\n\n### 2.4 Study endpoints\n\n#### 2.4.1 Primary endpoint\n\nThe primary endpoint is the change in fasting glucagon levels and glucagon responses to ingestion of a mixed meal between baseline (Week − 4) and 12 weeks after the administration of ipragliflozin (Week 12).\n\n#### 2.4.2 Secondary endpoints\n\nSecondary endpoints are changes in the following items from baseline to 12 weeks after the administration of ipragliflozin: body weight, HbA1c, glycated albumin, the required daily dose of insulin, values obtained from the mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), albuminuria, advanced glycation end products, diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites, percentage of time in the targeted range (TIR; glucose levels 70 − 180 mg/dL) and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions, which were obtained from the intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM). For each parameter, any change will be determined based on the difference between the values at baseline (Week − 4) and those at Week 12.\n\n#### 2.4.3 Safety endpoints\n\nAll adverse events occurring during the trial will be recorded. We will compare the percentages of time below range of glucose levels < 70 mg/dL and time above range of glucose levels > 180 mg/dL as measured by isCGM, and the levels of serum β-hydroxybutyrate between baseline (Week − 4) and 12 weeks after ipragliflozin administration (Week 12). We will evaluate the frequency of development of ketosis defined as a level of blood β-hydroxybutyrate > 0.6 mmol/L during the study period.\n\n### 2.5 Participant recruitment\n\nParticipants will be recruited at six centers in Japan: Nagasaki University Hospital, Hyogo College of Medicine Hospital, Kumamoto Central Hospital, Kobe University Hospital, Showa University Hospital and Clinic Masae Minami. The study will be fully explained to potential participants by investigators. Participants will be asked to voluntarily sign an informed consent form before their participation.\n\n### 2.6 Inclusion criteria\n\nPatients will be required to meet all of the following inclusion criteria:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Diagnosed with T1D by diabetologists based on the criteria of T1D defined by the Japan Diabetes Society.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u></a></sup>\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Indicated for ipragliflozin as an adjunctive to insulin therapy due to an inability to achieve a good level of glycemic control (HbA1c > 7.5%) despite receiving intensive insulin therapy with the use of isCGM.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Confirmed to have absolute insulin deficiency as defined by a fasting C-peptide concentration < 0.6 ng/mL and/or an increment of C-peptide levels < 0.6 ng/mL during the glucagon challenge test.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Using an isCGM system with FreeStyle Libre (Abbott, Chicago, IL).\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Age of ≥20 years.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> Outpatients\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> Willingness to provide written informed consent.\n\n### 2.7 Exclusion criteria\n\nPatients with any of the following will be excluded:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Use of any SGLT2 inhibitors within 12 months before enrollment.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> A previous history of ketoacidosis within 12 months before enrollment.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> An eating disorder.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Regular consumption of a low-carbohydrate diet.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Alcohol abuse or alcohol consumption ≥20 g/d.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> Severe renal dysfunction defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> Severe anemia defined as a hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u> Hypersensitivity or allergy to SGLT2 inhibitors including ipragliflozin.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(9)</u> Body mass index < 20.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(10)</u> Previous history of repeated severe hypoglycemia, urinary tract infection or genital infection.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(11)</u> Pregnancy or breastfeeding.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(12)</u> HbA1c levels ≥11% at enrollment.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(13)</u> Judged inappropriate to participate by the study investigators.\n\n### 2.8 Withdrawal criteria\n\nPatients will be withdrawn from the study prematurely for the following reasons:\n\n*   They ask to leave the study.\n*   Ipragliflozin must be withdrawn for any reason(s).\n*   In the investigator's opinion, continuation in the study will be detrimental to the patient's well-being.\n\n### 2.9 Study protocol\n\nThe time schedule of the study is shown in Table 1. Participants must fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria described above to be eligible for inclusion at the beginning of the trial. The investigators will recruit participants from among their outpatients, and will obtain written informed consent from the participants at Week − 8. All investigators must register each participant's information at the Clinical Research Center of Nagasaki University Hospital. Participants will undergo an MMTT (1<sup>st</sup>\\-MMTT) to evaluate their glucose tolerance and secretory responses in insulin/glucagon at Week − 4. Participants will be included when they fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria at both Week − 4 and Week 0.\n\n删除9：<u>Table 1:\n\nThe time schedule of the study. AGEs: advanced glycation end products; d-ROMs: diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites; isCGM: intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring.</u>\n\nParticipants will take orally administered ipragliflozin (Suglat; Astellas Pharma Inc, Tokyo, Japan) at 50 mg once a day in addition to the previous treatment of insulin from the beginning of the treatment period (Week 0). Investigators can increase the dosage of ipragliflozin up to 100 mg from Week 4. The investigators will continue to administer ipragliflozin and conduct the necessary examinations and surveys until Week 16 in accordance with the schedule described in Table 1. The investigators will refer to the patient's isCGM results to adjust the insulin dose based on their own judgement. When adjusting the dose of insulin, it is necessary to follow the recommendations<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> to avoid hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis.\n\nAnother MMTT (2<sup>nd</sup>\\-MMTT) will be performed at Week 12 to evaluate the changes in the fasting glucagon levels and glucagon responses to a meal ingestion between baseline and 12 weeks after administration of ipragliflozin. The investigators will also obtain the laboratory data at Week 12. All clinical data including the results of isCGM will be obtained until 16 weeks after the administration of ipragliflozin (Week 16).\n\n### 2.10 MMTT\n\nThe investigators will confirm that the blood glucose level of each patient is within 70 − 199 mg/dL at the start of the MMTT to avoid the development of extreme hyperglycemia. If a patient's fasting glucose is not within 70 − 199 mg/dL, the MMTT will be postponed to another day. Both MMTTs (the 1<sup>st</sup>\\- and 2<sup>nd</sup>\\-MMTT) will be carried out under the condition of overnight fasting. During the MMTTs, the patients treated with an insulin pump will be kept on their basal rate of insulin infusion. The patients treated with multiple daily injections will receive their basal insulin as usual. For participants who customarily take their basal insulin in the morning, the basal insulin will be injected at least 2 hours before the MMTT. Bolus insulin administrations will be allowed until at least 4 hours before the MMTT if the participants need additional insulin to lower their fasting glucose levels under 200 mg/dL. Ipragliflozin and all the other antidiabetic agents will be continued until the preceding day of each MMTT. The participants will receive neither premeal bolus insulin nor oral antidiabetic agents (including ipragliflozin) in the MMTT.\n\nA can of 200 mL (200 kcal) liquid meal composed of 28.6 g carbohydrates, 10 g protein and 4.4 g fat (Calorie Mate LIQUID Café au Lait; Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Tokyo, Japan), which provides a caloric ratio similar to a modern Japanese diet, will be used for the MMTT. If the body weight of a patient is less than 33.3 kg, the dosage of the meal will be reduced to 6 mL/kg.\n\nThe investigators will confirm whether the blood glucose concentrations of the participants exceed 400 mg/dL every 30 minutes during the MMTT by using devices for self-monitoring of blood glucose. Patients whose blood glucose levels increase over 400 mg/dL will immediately receive their necessary dose of bolus insulin, which will be calculated by using their insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio.\n\n### 2.11 Laboratory measurements\n\nIn each MMTT (at Week − 4 and Week 12), the levels of plasma glucose (mg/dL), plasma glucagon (pg/mL), serum insulin (μU/mL), and serum C-peptide (ng/mL) will be measured at fasting (0 min) and at 30, 60 and 120 minutes after the ingestion of the liquid meal. We will also measure the serum levels of GA, total ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate, insulin antibody, advanced glycation end products, and diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites at fasting in each MMTT. Urine specimens will be obtained on each MMTT day for the measurement of the albumin/creatinine ratio.\n\nBlood samples for plasma glucagon will be obtained using BD P800 tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Plasma glucagon will be measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). The levels of serum insulin and C-peptide will be measured by using an ECLusys kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).\n\nAs shown in Table 1, we will measure the patient's complete blood count and serum (plasma) levels of sodium, potassium, chlorine, total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, creatine kinase, uric acid, glucose, and HbA1c at every visit of the study (Week − 8, − 4, 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16), and (for patients withdrawing from the study) at early discontinuation.\n\n### 2.12 Adverse events\n\nAll adverse events that occur during the trial will be recorded in the clinical record and the case report form (CRF). Investigators will explain adverse events to the patients and take appropriate measures immediately. A serious adverse event will be defined as any untoward medical event that occurs at any dose and that results in death, a life-threatening condition, hospitalization, or significant disability or incapacity. All serious adverse events occurring between the signing of the informed consent form and the end of the trial will be documented in the medical records and the CRFs.\n\n### 2.13 Data collection and management\n\nThe investigators will fill in all of each patient's data in a CRF. It is necessary that all data recorded in the CRF be consistent with the original material, unless data recorded directly in the CRF are used as the source material. During the study, the investigators will collect data at each visit in accord with the schedule in Table 1. All the data will be entered by the data manager. Research electronic data capture will be used as the clinical data management system. Once the data are checked, they will be fixed by the data manager.\n\nAll patients will use anonymized isCGM reader devices with their patient number during the study period. The investigators will download the stored data in the reader to each center's stand-alone personal computer at each visit. The data will be stored on a universal serial bus flash drive with their patient number and sent to Nagasaki University Hospital at the end of the study period.\n\nAll study findings and documents will be made confidential, and patients will always be identified by their patient number, never by name. Confidential patient-identifying documents will be maintained by the investigators to preserve participant anonymity.\n\nDuring the study, a sponsor-investigator will perform regular site visits to review the protocol compliance, conduct source data verification, assess drug accountability and management, and assess laboratory procedures to ensure that the study is being conducted according to all pertinent requirements.\n\n### 2.14 Statistical analysis\n\nThe repeated-measures analysis of variance will be used to test differences in the values of plasma glucose, serum C-peptide, plasma glucagon and the increments of glucagon (ΔGlucagon) from fasting to each time point during the MMTT between before (Week − 4) and after administration of ipragliflozin (Week 12). The paired t-test will be used to test differences in the patients’ clinical characteristics and laboratory values between Week − 4 and Week 12. We will apply the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the time-course changes in each of the glucose values (mean amplitude of glycemic excursions and the percentages of time below range/TIR/ time above range) obtained from the isCGMs. If we find any changes in the values of plasma glucagon (including values of ΔGlucagon) between Week − 4 and Week 12, we will perform further analyses to seek associations between those changes and their clinical characteristics.\n\nAll data will be fixed before analysis. All tests of significance will be done at a two-tailed significance level of 0.05. Data relevant to the study will be analyzed using JMP Pro 15 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to clarify whether an adjunctive therapy of ipragliflozin alters the glucagon response to ingestion of a mixed meal in patients with T1D. We will also investigate the impact of the change in glucagon secretion on the glycemic control and ketogenesis in patients with T1D receiving ipragliflozin.\n\nFasting hyperglycemia and paradoxical increase in postprandial glucagon levels have been observed in diabetic patients, including patients with T1D.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> The inappropriate secretion of glucagon often causes exacerbation of hyperglycemia. Conversely, it was reported that the counter-regulatory response of glucagon to hypoglycemia was impaired in patients with longstanding T1D,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u></a></sup> resulting in recurrent hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness. These findings suggested that the glucagon dysregulation could impact the fluctuation (variability) of glucose levels.\n\nIt is not fully understood the mechanism that glucagon secretions are increased by dapagliflozin and empagliflozin<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24]</u></a></sup> but not by canagliflozin.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> Bonner et al reported that an inhibition of SGLT2 by dapagliflozin in pancreatic α-cells triggered glucagon secretion directly.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u></a></sup> In contrast, Solini et al reported that SGLT2 expression was nearly undetectable in murine α-cells, and also demonstrated that dapagliflozin modulated glucagon secretion in an SGLT2-independent manner.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u></a></sup> Based on these results, Solini et al assumed that dapagliflozin-induced hyperglucagonemia is mainly driven by a compensatory mechanism in response to an acute decline in blood glucose levels, which might be a class-effect for SGLT2 inhibitors. Suga et al recently reported that SGLT1 predominantly expressed in α-cells played a significant role in enhancing glucagon secretion and that canagliflozin, but not dapagliflozin, suppressed glucagon secretion by inhibition of SGLT1 in pancreatic α-cells.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> The differences in the selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1 between canagliflozin (which has low selectivity for SGLT2) and dapagliflozin (which has high selectivity for SGLT2) may affect glucagon secretion regulated through SGLT1 in α-cells. Since the SGLT2/SGLT1 selectivity of ipragliflozin was higher than that of canagliflozin but lower than that of dapagliflozin, it is difficult to estimate the glucagon response modified by ipragliflozin treatment in patients with T1D.\n\nSGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA is the most crucial adverse effect reported in patients with T1D treated by SGLT2 inhibitors. Patients with T1D receiving SGLT2 inhibitors can develop DKA without increasing levels of blood glucose even after insulin discontinuation. The euglycemic DKA may often be detected late and may be aggravated at the time of diagnosis. Actually, the Food and Drug Administration in United States has not approved the prescription of any SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with T1D. The European Medicine Agency gives limited approval to use of dapagliflozin in only adult T1D patients with body mass index ≥27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Increased levels of plasma glucagon due to receiving SGLT2 inhibitors have been proposed as a potential mechanism of euglycemic ketoacidosis,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u></a></sup> because glucagon promotes ketogenesis in the liver. Perry et al reported that dapagliflozin-induced hyperglucagonemia did not mediate increases in ketogenesis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u></a></sup> They concluded that the combination of insulinopenia and dehydration was necessary and sufficient for development of euglycemic ketoacidosis under the treatment of dapagliflozin. Capozzi et al recently reported even in the setting of complete lack of insulin signaling, glucagon was not necessary for the enhanced ketone production in response to dapagliflozin.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u></a></sup> Further studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitors-induced ketogenesis.\n\nThe current study has certain limitations. First, the sample size is relatively small (n = ∼30). Second, it is a single-arm, exploratory trial and lacks a placebo control group. Third, the follow-up period of the study may be insufficient to lead to a definitive conclusion regarding the effect of ipragliflozin on glycemic control and glucagon secretion. Despite these limitations, our research also has strengths. There has been no study assessing changes in glucagon response to SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T1D in a clinical setting. This study may contribute to elucidation of the pathophysiological role of glucagon in glycemic control and ketogenesis in patients with T1D receiving SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThe author thank Dr Shuntaro Sato, Dr Nobuaki Takehana, Ms Tomomi Saito and all the staffs at all participating research institutions for their support.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Ichiro Horie, Tadahiro Kitamura, Yoshiki Kusunoki, Yushi Hirota, Tomoyasu Fukui, Yasutaka Maeda, Masae Minami, Takanori Matsui, Atsushi Kawakami, Norio Abiru.\n\n**Data curation:** Yuta Nakamura, Shigeki Tashiro.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Yuta Nakamura, Ichiro Horie.\n\n**Funding acquisition:** Norio Abiru.\n\n**Investigation:** Yuta Nakamura, Ichiro Horie, Masaki Kobayashi, Yoshiki Kusunoki, Kenro Nishida, Akane Yamamoto, Yushi Hirota, Tomoyasu Fukui, Dan Sekiguchi, Yasutaka Maeda, Masae Minami, Takanori Matsui, Norio Abiru.\n\n**Project administration:** Norio Abiru.\n\n**Supervision:** Norio Abiru.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Yuta Nakamura, Ichiro Horie, Norio Abiru.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:17:55", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:18:16", "cost": 21.875}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:18:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:17:54"}

This infection typically presents in immunocompromised patients, patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, or those with a history of prolonged corticosteroid use.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> The disease is exceedingly rare in immunocompetent patients.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 36-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis C and who is an active injection drug user (IDU) presented to an outside hospital with acute hemiparesis of the left upper and lower extremities upon waking. The Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission was 15. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with and without contrast revealed a gadolinium-enhancing lesion adjacent to the right basal ganglia and thalamus consistent with an abscess, with surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect causing a 6-millimeter right-to-left midline shift involving the right lateral ventricle .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nMRI T1. Multiple solid and ring-enhancing masses scattered throughout the right basal ganglia extending into the right thalamus. MRI = magnetic resonance imaging.</u>\n\nThe patient was placed on broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic therapy and underwent stereotactic biopsy of the lesion. Biopsy revealed multinucleated giant cells and scattered groupings of non-septate hyphae with right-angle branching consistent with zygomycete infection. Culture of the biopsy site was positive for _Rhizopus oryzae (R oryzae)_, and she was transitioned to amphotericin B lipid complex (AmB) (5 mg/kg daily) and voriconazole. Her remaining infectious and immunologic workup was unremarkable, including undetectable hepatitis C viral RNA and a negative fourth generation HIV immunoassay. The basic metabolic profile and complete blood count were within normal limits; blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative.\n\nComputed tomography of the face and maxilla showed focal mucosal thickening along the floor of the right maxillary sinus correlating to periodontal disease; however, there was low suspicion that her teeth were a clinically significant source of infection. Chest imaging findings were normal.\n\nOn AmB (5 mg/kg daily), her clinical status worsened. In response, the AmB dose was increased to 10 mg/kg daily, and voriconazole was replaced with isavuconazole 372 mg daily. Repeat brain imaging at the outside hospital revealed new lesions and worsening vasogenic edema. After being admitted for 30 days at an outside hospital, the patient was transferred to our hospital for escalation of care and neurosurgical opinion. Upon admission to our hospital, the decision was made to proceed with hemicraniotomy with abscess debridement and culture. No intraoperative complications were observed. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed a ring-enhancing lesion inferior to the resection cavity with surrounding edema (Image 2). Despite surgical intervention, she continued to exhibit new and worsening neurological findings, including right lateral gaze palsy, left facial weakness, left hemi-neglect, and left ankle clonus. This was attributed to worsening vasogenic edema, despite aggressive dexamethasone treatment. At this point, isavuconazole was replaced with anidulafungin (200 mg daily).\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nMRI T2. Extensive vasogenic edema with mass effect and midline shift. MRI = magnetic resonance imaging.</u>\n\nWithin one week of AmB-anidulafungin initiation, the patient's functional status improved; repeat brain imaging two and five weeks later demonstrated a leftward midline shift, which improved from previous findings. After 40 days at our hospital (70 days total inpatient), she was discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation center on a six-month course of intravenous amphotericin B 5 mg/kg daily and anidulafungin 200 mg daily. No toxicities to anti-fungal medications were observed, and no drug level monitoring was indicated. On follow-up examination six weeks after discharge, she exhibited moderate peripheral vision loss, poor hearing, and paresis of the left upper extremity. She noted improved strength of her left lower extremity but exhibited residual foot drop. Using the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living tool, her score was 6, indicating an ability to live independently.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> The patient died one year later secondary to drug overdose.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nMucormycosis is a rare, life-threatening fungal infection predominantly affecting immunocompromised hosts.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Risk factors for infection include immunocompromised status, history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, prolonged use of corticosteroids, bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, prolonged neutropenia, iron overload, and IDU.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u></a></sup> The most common route of inoculation is inhalation, though spores can also enter the systemic circulation through breaks in the skin. Although the exact mechanisms have not been elucidated, the predilection of mucormycosis for certain anatomic sites seems to be affected by the underlying risk factor. For example, patients with diabetic ketoacidosis are most likely to present with sinus involvement whereas patients with transplanted organs and malignancy more commonly present with pulmonary infection.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Disseminated disease is most commonly seen in patients in an iron-overloaded state or those treated with deferoxamine.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,4]</u></a></sup>\n\nIsolated cerebral infection constitutes approximately 5% of all mucormycosis infections, but has a fatality rate exceeding 60%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> Despite its rarity, isolated cerebral mucormycosis is the most common presentation among IDUs, constituting between 62% to 82% of mucormycosis infections in this subgroup.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> Brain lesions are most commonly located within the basal ganglia, secondary to hematogenous spread.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,5–7]</u></a></sup> It is likely that illicit injection drugs or cutting agents contaminated with _Rhizopus_ or _Mucor_ spores enter the systemic arterial circulation, seeding the perforating branches of the middle cerebral artery.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5–7]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe 2013 guidelines recommend surgical debridement and immediate first-line antifungal treatment with liposomal or lipid-complex amphotericin B.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Both AmB and posaconazole have shown in vitro activity against Mucorales, although posaconazole therapy is only recommended for salvage therapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8–10]</u></a></sup> In addition, isavuconazole has been deemed a well-tolerated alternative to amphotericin B with similar efficacy against _Rhizopus spp_.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u></a></sup>\n\nImportantly, echinocandins show minimal in vitro activity against _R oryzae_.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12–14]</u></a></sup> However, the discovery that _R oryzae_ expresses a homologue of 1,3-β-glucan synthase, the target enzyme for echinocandins, points to a possible mechanism by which echinocandins can successfully treat Mucorales infection.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12–14]</u></a></sup> Combination polyene-echinocandin therapy has emerged as an increasingly common treatment strategy as clinicians strive for improved patient outcomes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12,14]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn a mouse model of disseminated mucormycosis, Ibrahim et al. showed that caspofungin alone does, in fact, have activity against _Rhizopus spp._, and further showed that caspofungin-AmB combination therapy has synergistic properties.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12–14]</u></a></sup> Reed at al. concluded that patients treated with polyene-caspofungin combination therapy experienced significantly improved short- and long-term outcomes compared with patients treated with polyene therapy alone. Importantly, this conclusion has also been applied to patients with cerebral extension.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn vitro studies have shed light on other possible combination therapies that act synergistically against Mucor species, including AmB-rifampin, terbinafine-voriconazole, posaconazole-caspofungin, and itraconazole-terbinafine.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,15–17]</u></a></sup> AmB-anidulafungin, the combination utilized for our patient, has been shown to exhibit in vitro synergy against certain strains of Mucorales, but indifference towards others.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Ibrahim et al. treated mice in their murine model of disseminated mucormycosis, and found that anidulafungin, too, displays synergy when combined with AmB lipid complex.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> These results point towards a polyene-echinocandin class effect against Mucorales molds.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe clinical significance of combination therapy remains unclear.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> However, in light of the unacceptably high mortality rate associated with isolated cerebral mucormycosis, it is imperative that clinicians continue to investigate outcomes with combination therapy so that stronger conclusions can be drawn. Our case highlights the importance of dual antifungal therapy as an adjunct to surgical management of invasive mucormycosis. Although our patient suffered from residual neurologic deficits and headache, she was able to use the restroom and walk independently with a cane. Using the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living tool, her score was 6, indicating an ability to live independently.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup>\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nFor patients with a history of IDU who present with brain abscesses (especially in the basal ganglia), mucormycosis should be high on the clinicians’ differential diagnosis. Early intervention with surgical debridement and antifungal therapy can minimize permanent neurological sequelae and mortality. In critically ill patients and in those who fail polyene monotherapy, a combination of AmB-anidulafungin therapy may provide a possible survival benefit. Further study of synergy and combination therapy for isolated cerebral mucormycosis must be conducted before clinical conclusions can be drawn.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nTessa LeWitt: Conceptualization, project administration, writing—original draft, writing—reviewing, and editing.\n\nSeema Joshi: Conceptualization, project administration, writing—original draft, writing—reviewing, and editing.\n\nErica Herc: Conceptualization, formal analysis, supervising, writing—reviewing and editing</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:03:29", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:04:52", "cost": 83.402}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:04:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:03:28"}

The previous refractive error before LASIK was unknown.\n\nPhysical examination revealed a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of count finger at 30 cm in OD and 20/30 in the left eye oculus sinister (OS). Slit lamp examination shown a corneal flap with a superior hinge in both eyes, the rest was unremarkable. IOP was 12mm Hg in OD and 15mm Hg in OS. Posterior fundus examination demonstrated a dense vitreous hemorrhage in OD. In the OS, retina examination revealed myopic changes in the macula and a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3.

Slit lamp examination revealed a central separation of the flap, with a significant amount of fluid in the interface, mild peripheral corneal haze, small and medium central keratic precipitates (inflammatory and pigment) and 2+ anterior chamber cells. The retina was attached, with pigmented laser scars in far periphery, vitreous cavity filled with silicon oil and no signs of peripheral vasculitis. IOP in OD was 22mm Hg (icare TAO1i tonometer, icare USA, Raleigh US). Optical coherent tomography (OCT) of the anterior segment showed some fluid in the center of the flap interface, directly over the keratic precipitates .

Six months after PPV, the patient underwent uneventful phacoemulsification with silicon removal. Low dose and frequency of topical steroids were used during the follow-up. The final BCVA was 20/60 in the OD and 20/30 in the OS.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\nLate-onset PISK, occurring several years after LASIK, has been reported previously.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> Most of the reports describe small pockets of fluid accumulation in the flap interface, along with abnormally low or normal IOP. The latter due to an inaccurate estimation of IOP by applanation tonometry that results in an underestimation of the real value (which may be up to 3 times higher).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> The mechanism of fluid accumulation is not well understood, but it is believed to be the result of the aqueous humor transudation across the corneal stroma, due to a transient endothelial dysfunction caused by high IOP or direct inflammatory damage.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,8]</u></a></sup> The fluid preferentially collects in the flap interface because of a lower cohesive tensile strength of the wound.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,9]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn the current clinical case, the authors report an extreme presentation of a symptomatic PISK, with an unusually high amount of fluid collection. Although mild pain and foreign body sensation are not part of the typical PISK symptomatology, there are previous reports of patients complaining of ocular discomfort and eye pain.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> The authors believe that the particular clinical features of this case are the result the combination of the 2 already recognized mechanism of endothelial damage: First, the patient had PPV in where IOP was maintained above 30 mm Hg for about 2 hours. The surgical treatment of a retinal detachment, due to a giant tear, is considered a difficult and demanding procedure.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Although not a rule, the difficulty of the case could potentially impact the duration of the surgical act. A more difficult cases may have more prolonged time in where IOP is constantly maintained through the forced infusion of saline solution. In this case, the surgery lasted at least 2 hours. It is possible that pressure damage was inflicted over endothelial cells during surgery, increasing the force gradient of aqueous toward the stroma. Moreover, the presence of silicone oil as tamponade is a recognized risk factor for high IOP during the postoperative time. It is likely that high IOP went unnoticed during the first weeks of follow-up due to the cushioning effect of the small (but progressive) accumulation of fluid in the interface, which led to inaccurate IOP measurements. Second, there are evidence that suggest an inflammatory damage located in the central endothelium as well. The presence of anterior chamber cells and the preferential localization of keratic precipitates in the central cornea, just below the maximal accumulation of fluid, are potential proof of this fact, and a very interesting finding in this particular case. Finally, the fast resolution of the clinical manifestations with topical hypotensive drugs and steroids adjustment supports further the authors theory.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\n\nIn summary, we name this extreme presentation of PISK as PISK _Magno_ or PISKM. In where both suspected mechanism of endothelial cell damage coincides and lead to an extreme accumulation of fluid in the flap interface, after a difficult PPV. The patient had a good clinical outcome because of the fast resolution of the symptoms and clinical manifestations, due to an adequate response to treatment.\n\n删除3：<u>Internal review board approval\n------------------------------\n\nThe case report was reviewed and approved by the local Internal Review Board.

A wide bone tumor resection, including the deltoid insertion in the proximal humerus, significantly worsens the shoulder function.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u></a></sup> A reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is a prosthesis designed for semi-constrained structure, with a hemispherical glenoid component and a concave matching cup on a stem fixed to the humerus, and can be 1 of the solutions for extensive bone defects of the shoulder. A polypropylene mesh sheet is a useful material for reconstructing muscular tendon attachment by suturing the muscle insertion to the mesh via fibrous tissue formation. Compared to a smooth surface of the metal prosthesis, using a polypropylene mesh sheet enables a flexible reconstruction of the muscle insertion. Many reports have demonstrated the effectiveness of polypropylene mesh sheet for reconstructing the muscle insertion after tumor removal from the bone.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe normal RSA method is contraindicated in case of deltoid muscle (D) dysfunction because of postoperative dislocation of the shoulder. We were able to obtain good functional recovery of the deltoid and rotator cuff by combining RSA, polypropylene mesh sheet, and muscle-tendon transfer surgery.\n\nCase presentation\n-----------------\n\nAn 83-year-old male complained of pain in his right shoulder. He visited a nearby hospital and was diagnosed with a malignant bone tumor in the right proximal humerus on magnetic resonance imaging. Two days later, he fell, fractured his shoulder joint, and was then transferred to our hospital. His medical history was pertinent for hypertension. Plain radiographs and computed tomography showed osteolytic bone fractures of the proximal shaft of the humerus and intramedullary calcification of the proximal humerus. No metastasis was detected. A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed low intensity, whereas the T2-weighted image showed a heterogeneous change from low to high intensity with slight enhancements in the intramedullary area of the proximal humerus. An extra-osseous mass at the fracture site showed a distinct intensity from the intramedullary site of the tumor that was low on the T1-weighted image and isointense on the T2-weighted image; strongly enhanced image of the mass was also seen . Above all, we suspected pathological fracture of primary high-grade malignant tumor like dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. The staging of this malignancy was stageIIB (T2N0M0). We performed a wide surgical resection and reconstruction of the shoulder function with RSA combining with a polypropylene mesh sheet. The surgical margin was planned at a distance of more than 1 cm from the tumor (wide 1-cm margin), and the osteotomy line was 3 cm from the tumor.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nPlain radiographs, CT images and coronal MRI after the fracture.

(C) A T2-weighted image showing a heterogeneous change from low to high intensity in the intramedullary region of the proximal humerus and an extra-osseous mass at the fracture site showed a distinct intensity from the intramedullary site of the tumor.</u>\n\nThe surgery was performed under general anesthesia. The surgical incision extended along a straight line from the anterior shoulder to the anterior aspect of the arm. The D, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi (LD), teres major (TM), rotator cuff tendons, brachialis, lateral and medial heads of the triceps, and short head of the biceps, which are attached to humerus, were all resected more than 1 cm away from the extra-skeletal tumor mass. A transverse osteotomy was made in the humeral shaft 16 cm below from the proximal end of the humeral head, which was distal to the deltoid insertion, and a curative tumor resection was performed. According to the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society classification system, the resection was classified as S3S4.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> During the procedure, the axillary nerve and posterior circumflex humeral artery were carefully preserved to maintain innervation and blood supply to the D. An RSA prosthesis (Aequalis, Tornier Inc. France) was selected for reconstructing the huge defect in the proximal humerus. The humeral component was fixed in the distal shaft of the humerus with antibiotic-loaded bone cement (Simplex, Stryker Inc. Japan). Rotator cuff tendons were irreparable, and we performed tendon transfer with LD and TM in place of dissected posterior rotator cuffs as a modified L’Episcopo procedure.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> The transferred LD and TM tendons were sutured around the posteromedial aspect of the polypropylene mesh sheet (Bard mesh, Bard Inc. NJ) winded around the prosthesis stem with the arm in external rotation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> And then, we performed tendon transfer with pectoralis major in place of the dissected anterior rotator cuff. The long head of the biceps brachii and the brachialis muscle were fixed to the mesh sheet with the elbow flexed. The distal D insertion was retracted distally and sutured to the mesh sheet with the arm in abduction position . The operating time was 2 hours and 35 minutes. Postoperative X-ray showed an appropriate position of the implant without dislocation . The macroscopic surgical margin was a wide 1-cm margin, and the pathological diagnosis confirmed dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma with a negative margin. The patient was immobilized in 30° of abduction for 6 weeks postoperatively using an abduction pillow. Postoperatively, passive range of motion (ROM) exercises were gently performed for 6 weeks, after which active ROM exercises commenced. Three months postoperatively, active abduction of the right shoulder was 75°, flexion was 80°, and external rotation was 0°. Four months postoperatively, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score was 19.4, the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 83%, the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score was 89%, and the Enneking score was 21. The patient showed a functional limitation in the range of motion, but he could wash his mouth and use chopsticks with his repaired right hand in his activities of daily living. Lung metastases were observed 1 year after the surgery. Subsequently, subcutaneous recurrences were also observed, and the patient died of lung metastases.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nThe LD and TM were transferred by the modified L’Episcopo procedure by suturing them around the posteromedial aspect of the polypropylene mesh winded around the implant stem with the arm in external rotation.

According to the report by Morgan, the deltoid proximal insertion is 61 通用删除7(英):<u>(55–75)</u> mm from the great tubercle of the humerus, and the distal insertion is 158 通用删除7(英):<u>(142–172)</u> mm from the great tubercle of the humerus.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> There are some cases of osteotomy exceeding 140 mm, which would mean that most of the deltoid insertion would have to be resected<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,16,17]</u></a></sup> . One case involved the authors attaching the D insertion to an allograft, which provided 90° of shoulder abduction, although the nonunion of the allograft-host bone junction is an issue that still needs to be solved.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> This case supports our results that reconstructing the insertion of the D will achieve functional active abduction in the shoulder joint. Moreover, using a polypropylene mesh makes it easy to reconstruct the muscle insertion by suturing it to the polypropylene mesh anywhere we want, and the use of mesh in the procedure is also less time-consuming.\n\nTable 1 - Reverse shoulder arthroplasty cases of humerus osteotomy exceeding 140 mm, which would mean most of the deltoid muscle insertion would be resected.\n\n| Authors | Age | Follow-up (mo) | Diagnosis | Size of resection (mm) | Muscle reconstruction | Degrees abduction | Degrees forward flexion | External rotation | DASH | MSTS (%) | TESS (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Guven et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> | 31 | 22 | Chondrosarcoma | 160 | Repair to prosthesis | 30 | 30 | 0 | 28.3 | 60 | – |\n| King et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> | 40 | 18 | Chondrosarcoma | 145 | Repair to allograft tendons | 90 | 120 | 0 | – | – | – |\n| Kaa et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> | 49 | 136 | Chondrosarcoma | 180 | Repair to prosthesis | – | – | – | – | 73 | 80.65 |\n| Kaa et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> | 19 | 12 | Osteogenic sarcoma | 150 | Repair to prosthesis | – | – | – | – |  | 66.13 |\n| Current study | 83 | 12 | Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma | 160 | Repair to mesh | 75 | 80 | 0 | 19.4 | 83 | 89 |\n\nDASH = disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand, MSTS = musculoskeletal Tumor Society, TESS = Toronto Extremity Salvage Score.\n\nShoulder dislocation is the main complication following RSA because the muscle volume is reduced and soft-tissue tension is decreased.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> Although RSA is originally contraindicated for reconstruction after wide tumor resection resulting in loss of the D function, we succeeded in reconstructing abduction function by reattaching D to the polypropylene mesh. We also reconstructed posterior stability and external rotation function by transferring the LD and TM to the posteromedial aspect of the polypropylene mesh (modified L’Episcopo procedure) and reconstructed anterior stability and internal rotation function by transferring the pectoralis major muscle to the anterior aspect of the polypropylene mesh. With these reconstruction techniques, we were able to achieve joint stability. Advantages of RSA using a synthetic mesh include gaining favorable ROM and stability of the shoulder joint. Possible disadvantages include increasing the infection risk and mesh migration and displacement. The stability and ROM using this technique are superior to those of RSA and conventional arthroplasty with a synthetic mesh, respectively.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u></a></sup> Indications of this technique are for individuals with preserved D and their dominant axillary nerve. On the other hand, we must be careful in choosing this procedure for active young individuals because the long-term complications remain unclear. This case report suggests that RSA using the stem covered by the polypropylene mesh is an effective method for reconstructing shoulder joint function and preventing dislocation, whereas the previous methods did not achieve sufficient function and stability.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in English literature on the reconstruction of a massive defect in the proximal humerus using RSA and a polypropylene mesh by suturing the D-tendon combined with modified L’Episcopo procedure. Reconstruction of the deltoid insertion using polypropylene mesh surrounding the stem of an internal prosthesis during RSA is a less time-consuming procedure and achieves relatively favorable shoulder function. This procedure may be useful for reconstructing the proximal humerus after removal of a malignant tumor in elderly patients and can preserve the D and its dominant axillary nerve.\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment\n--------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Takashi Shimoji, Tomoyuki Tanaka for hospitalization for treatment.

One survey showed that the world's mean body mass index (BMI) increased by more than 55% from 1985 to 2017.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Obesity is associated with reduced social opportunities and quality of life, and it is a determinant of several intermediate risk factors associated with increased mortality and lower life expectancy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> In addition, obesity is related to endocrine and metabolic diseases and underpins major chronic diseases such as hypertension, cancer, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u></a></sup> Obesity can be divided into two types: simple and secondary. Simple obesity occurs when energy intake exceeds energy consumption, without other diseases or medical factors, and accounts for approximately 95% of total obesity cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began to spread, and to limit the spread of the virus, physical distancing measures between individuals were enforced worldwide. COVID-19 containment measures, such as social distancing, have a severe negative impact on psychological health and lifestyle maintenance.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> There have been many reports of individuals becoming overweight due to changes in their dietary habits during the social distancing period.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,7–9]</u></a></sup> Even in children, a reduction in the level of physical activity, increase in time using smartphones, and increased body weight have been reported.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> COVID-19 and social distancing have increased social interest in childhood obesity.\n\nCurrently, diet, exercise, behavioural changes, and anti-obesity drugs are being used to help overweight and obese people to lose weight. However, synthetic chemical drugs have high costs and potential side effects, and the number of approved anti-obesity drugs is small. For this reason, patients and clinicians are looking for complementary and alternative treatment methods to treat obesity, such as using medicinal plants<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup>; these and herbal medicines are used to treat obesity in East Asia, and studies have been conducted to identify their anti-obesity effects. According to several studies, medicinal plants and herbal medicines can reduce weight by suppressing appetite, promoting metabolic activity, reducing fat absorption, increasing lipolysis, and decreasing lipogenesis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of studies have reported the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicine on treating simple obesity. A systematic review of herbal medicine treatment for simple obesity in adults has also been published,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> but there has been no systematic review specifically focused on herbal medicine treatment for simple obesity in children and adolescents. Therefore, we decided to conduct this study to systematically evaluate the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicine treatment for simple obesity in children and adolescents and provide clinical evidence for clinicians and patients to make treatment decisions.\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\n### 2.1 Study registration\n\nThis protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis was registered on the Open Science Framework platform 删除5：<u></u> This protocol was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols guidelines.\n\n### 2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria for study selection\n\n#### 2.2.1 Type of studies\n\nAll relevant randomized controlled trials will be included.

Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) will be used for data extraction. We will extract the following items: data for study identification, participant information, sample size, intervention and comparison, outcome measurement, adverse events, and treatment period. If there is a disagreement between the two researchers, it will be resolved through discussions with other researchers.\n\n#### 2.4.3 Risk of bias assessment\n\nThe risk of bias will be assessed independently by two researchers. The Cochrane Handbook criteria version 5.2.0 will be used as a tool to evaluate the risk of bias. We will evaluate seven domains:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> random sequence generation;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> allocation concealment;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> blinding of participants and personnel;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> blinding of outcome assessment;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> incomplete outcome data;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> selective reporting; and\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> other sources of bias.\n\nThe risk of bias will be scored on three levels: “Low risk,” “High risk,” and “Unclear” Disagreements will be discussed with other researchers until a consensus is reached.\n\n#### 2.4.4 Measures of treatment effect\n\nFor dichotomous data, such as the ‘effective rate of clinical symptoms’ and ‘adverse events,’ we will report relative risks with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous data such as ‘BMI reduction,’ ‘bodyweight reduction,’ ‘waist circumference,’ ‘hip circumference,’ and ‘height,’ we will report the mean difference with 95% confidence intervals.\n\n#### 2.4.5 Management of missing data\n\nIf individual patient data are not available, we will contact the corresponding authors of the studies to acquire and verify the data. If complete data cannot be provided, they will be removed.\n\n#### 2.4.6 Assessment of heterogeneity\n\nWe will evaluate the heterogeneity of all studies using the chi-square and _I_<sup>2</sup> tests. We will perform a meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model if there is no heterogeneity (_I_<sup>2</sup> ≤ 50%). If the results show significant heterogeneity (_I_<sup>2</sup> > 50%), we will perform a meta-analysis using a random-effects model and a subgroup analysis to determine the possible cause of heterogeneity.\n\n#### 2.4.7 Assessment of reporting biases\n\nWe will use funnel plots to detect reporting biases.\n\n#### 2.4.8 Data synthesis\n\nData synthesis will be performed using Review Manager version 5.3. for Windows (Copenhagen, Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, 2012). We will use a fixed-effects model if there is no heterogeneity. If significant heterogeneity is presented, we will use the random-effects model, and then subgroup analyses will be performed. The following subgroup analyses will be considered: sex, period of treatment, intervention cycle, and disease course.\n\n### 2.5 Ethics and dissemination\n\nEthical approval is not required because there are no privacy concerns. The findings of this systematic review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nObesity has a high prevalence in children, and it has increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In modern times, herbal medicine treatment has been widely used for simple obesity in children and adults, and increasing numbers of randomized controlled trials regarding simple obesity in children are being published. To date, however, no systematic assessment of the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicine on children with simple obesity has been reported. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicine treatment for simple obesity in children. This study may have some limitations because of imperfect data collection, such as missing data and the risk of heterogeneity due to different measurement tools. We hope that the results of this study can provide more clinical evidence to help clinicians and patients make decisions about clinical practice in the treatment of childhood simple obesity.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Soo Bo Shim, Hye Lim Lee.\n\n**Data curation:** Soo Bo Shim, Hyun Hee Lee, Hye Li Ahn.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Soo Bo Shim, Hyun Hee Lee.\n\n**Methodology:** Soo Bo Shim, Hye Lim Lee, Ju Ah Lee.\n\n**Supervision:** Hye Lim Lee, Ju Ah Lee.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Soo Bo Shim.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Hye Lim Lee, Ju Ah Lee.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:36:15", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:37:43", "cost": 87.831}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:37:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:36:14"}

Complete blood count, kidney function, liver function, and glucose levels were within the normal range before the patient was discharged. Postoperative TDRI was scheduled for May 2021. He was advised to visit the surgical oncology outpatient clinic every week in the first month after surgery and then every 3 months in the first year. During these visits, a complete laboratory profile and general and local examinations of the operative bed were performed. Radiology was decided based on the patient's symptoms. The headache and facial bone aches improved significantly after the surgery. However, he complained of paresthesia in the facial and head regions. No new masses occurred.\n\nIn May 2021, he was admitted to receive TDRI guided by the thyroid-stimulating hormone blood level after being deprived of TST for 4 weeks and an iodine-rich diet for 2 weeks. The patient was given a printed sheet for postoperative TDRI care regarding fluid intake, optimal toilet usage, maintaining distance from people, and maintaining good oral hygiene. Immediately after TDRI treatment, the health physicist monitored the radiation levels. WBIS performed 5 days after TDRI and before patient discharge revealed multiple metastases affecting the right maxilla, both lungs, and left tibia. The physicist determined the safe time for discharge after TDRI. Acute iodine toxicity manifested in the form of neck tenderness and swelling, nausea, swollen salivary glands, taste changes, and excess tears. The patient underwent an anti-inflammatory protocol. The patient was allowed to resume the TST on the fifth day. He was advised to visit the Nuclear Medicine Unit weekly for the first 2 weeks after discharge, mainly to manage the TDRI toxicity, and then every 3 months during the first year. During these visits, general and local examinations were performed and the laboratory profile included the thyroid profile. The TST was adjusted according to the thyroid profile if needed. Thyroglobulin assessment was not requested in the follow-up because of the presence of thyroglobulin antibodies. Another TDRI was recommended after six months. No external radiotherapy was administered to the tibial metastasis because there was no pain. Until now, the patient follow-up was regular, with no new events.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nA search through PubMed from 1990 to 2021 using the search terms “papillary thyroid carcinoma +oral metastasis” without using software filters revealed 125 publications among which,7 publications matched our topic.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7–13]</u></a></sup> While searching for the search terms “papillary thyroid carcinoma +maxillary metastasis” within the same period, three publications were retrieved.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10,14,15]</u></a></sup> Papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) account for 80% and 7% of all thyroid carcinomas, respectively. They differ histologically from the rarer type of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated anaplastic carcinomas, which together account for 5% of thyroid carcinomas, as well as from medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, which arises from parafollicular C cells.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> Although the initial diagnostic criterion for PTC was the presence of a papillary growth pattern, in the latter half of the last century, nuclear criteria for diagnosis have also become important. The nuclei of PTCs have been described as clear, ground glass, or empty. These nuclei are larger and more oval than normal follicular nuclei, and contain hypodense chromatin. In PTC, these nuclei often overlap.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> FTC tends to metastasize hematogenously, most commonly to the bones and lungs in 6% to 20% of cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> On the other hand, distant metastasis in PTC is less than 5%<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> and usually occurs in the lung, bone, and brain, in descending order of frequency.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> The common sites of bone metastasis in PTC are the spine, pelvis, and ribs.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> Generally, bone metastasis is a result of a multistep process, including the loss of cell-to-cell adhesion, invasion, and dissemination through the blood and/or lymphatics. Numerous processes enhance metastasis, including epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity, cancer stem cells, noncoding RNAs, cytokines, and receptor tyrosine kinase pathways.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> Considering the rarity of metastasis to the bones of the maxilla, immunohistochemistry was necessary in our case. The panel of antibodies for TG, TTF-1, CK7, and CK20 that we applied was reported to be beneficial when the thyroid origin of a metastatic tumor is considered.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22–23]</u></a></sup>\n\nA search of PubMed from to 1990–2021 revealed seven publications on oral metastasis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7–13]</u></a></sup> Four of these publications described 7 cases of mandibular metastasis, while the remaining three publications described three cases with metastasis in the malar region,gingiva, and maxilla . All these cases were women except for 3, and all were above 50 years, except for 3. The duration between the diagnosis of primary metastasis and the diagnosis of metastasis was not reported in five cases. The duration was 3,5 and 7 years in the three cases. In one case, the diagnosis of the primary tumor and the metastases were concomitant to each other, and in another case, metastasis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry without the appearance of a primary tumor.\n\nWhile searching for the search terms “papillary thyroid carcinoma +maxillary metastasis” within the same period, three publications were retrieved.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10,14,15]</u></a></sup> The first of these three publications was by Bhansali et al,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> who reported a 60-year-old woman who presented with progressively increasing painless swelling over the right cheek for 3 months. It was firm, non-tender, arising from the maxilla with intra-oral protrusion and 5 cm in the greatest dimension. Upon examination, the patient simultaneously had a mobile nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid. Fine needle aspiration cytology suggested a follicular neoplasm with positive immunostaining for thyroglobulin. Radiology revealed a lytic lesion in the maxilla, mandible and 9th rib. The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy. Histopathology of the thyroid nodule showed a follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. WBIS following total thyroidectomy further confirmed lesions in the maxilla, mandible, and rib, and no residual thyroid tissue. She was recommended TDRI for osseous metastasis but was lost to follow-up. The second publication was by Fatahzadeh et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> who reported maxillary metastasis from a follicular variant (PTC) in a 43- year-old woman. The patient presented with pain and bleeding in the mouth immediately after palliative radiotherapy of the lungs and different bones due to metastasis from PTC. Oral examination revealed an exophytic mass that displaced the maxillary right second molar and emerged from the palatal gingival sulcus. Cone beam CT detected a mass measuring 3 cm in the greatest dimension, destroying the alveolus behind the right first molar with effacement of the sinus floor. Incisional biopsy and immunohistochemistry confirmed PTC of the follicular variant. The patient was recommended palliative external radiotherapy for the mass, but no data on survival were reported.\n\nThe third case was reported by Shimmura et al 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u>,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> who reported a 76-year-old woman with a complaint of right intermittent epistaxis that started two years ago. She had a medical history of PTC for 8 years and had undergone total thyroidectomy, neck dissection twice, stereotactic radiation therapy for metastases to the cervical vertebrae and parapharyngeal space, and TDRI. A year prior, another cervical lymph node metastasis was noted. Sinonasal endoscopy revealed bleeding from the accessory ostium of the right maxillary sinus. CT head and neck revealed a mass filling the right maxillary sinus. MRI showed a well-circumscribed, smoothly marginated tumor with a peripheral low area and central and inhomogeneous area on T1-and T2-weighted images, primarily suggesting an organized hematoma. To stop the bleeding, endoscopic sinonasal surgery was performed to examine the tumor and perform excision. Endoscopic-modified medial maxillectomy was performed. The tumor measured approximately 3 × 2 cm with a stem, including a feeding artery, based on the anterior wall of the right maxillary sinus. The feeding artery was cauterized and the tumor was resected en bloc. Histopathological diagnosis and immunohistochemistry revealed a metastatic PTC tumor in the maxillary sinus. The decided treatment policy was to undergo just planned lymph node resection because of her advanced age. Two years postoperatively, there was no recurrence or epistaxis.\n\nThe common features between our case and the previously discussed three female cases are tumor size (≥ 3 cm), relatively delayed diagnosis of the maxillary mass, and the existence of other distant metastases sites. However, our case differed from these cases in terms of gender and age at presentation (male patient of a relatively young age).\n\nCT is commonly used to image the maxillofacial region. A bone-window algorithm better delineates the details of a bony lesion. CT scan is sensitive in detecting calcified tumor matrix, bone changes, and cortical destruction. MRI is not frequently used to diagnose maxillofacial bone lesions. T2- and T1-weighted images and a post-contrast study can be used for the diagnosis of soft tissue lesions with bony tumors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup>\n\nOur patient required debulking surgery to improve both symptomatology and cosmesis. Defects involving the maxilla and midface require free-flap reconstruction. The type of flap selected depends on the extent of the skin, soft tissue, and bone resected. Limited volume defects with large skin surface requirements are best reconstructed using radial forearm fasciocutaneous or enterocutaneous flaps. The rectus abdominus myocutaneous flap provides a larger soft tissue volume and skin surface. Structures such as the lips, eyelids, and nose should be reconstructed separately using local flaps if possible. Ideally, free tissue should not be incorporated into these structures. Most patients can obtain good results using this algorithm.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe treatment plan for our metastatic case is similar to that in the literature.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u></a></sup> Surgery plus TDRI plus TST remains the preferred therapeutic option for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. As distant metastases are radioactive iodine-avid, 131I should be administered every 6 months for 2 years, and less frequently thereafter. Radioactive iodine is supposed to control symptoms and delay progression but may not completely cure metastasis; tyrosine kinase inhibitors were not among our therapeutic options as they are approved for the treatment of only radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nMaxilla metastasis of PTC is rare, usually occurs in women, and is usually associated with other metastases. When maxillary bone metastasis occurs, physicians, dentists, and pathologists should not exclude the possibility of metastatic PTC. Therefore, pathological confirmation through immunohistochemistry should be performed. Multidisciplinary treatment is mandatory.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nShadi Awny, Islam Abdo, Ahmed Fareed, Essam Attia, Ahmed Setit, and Amir Zeid: selected the topic, performed the biopsy, surgery, postoperative care, and shared in writing the draft.\n\nDoaa Khedr, and Ahmed Agamy carried out the radiological diagnosis and shared in writing the draft.\n\nMohamed Roshdy and Sara Elzayat followed up the case while in the Nuclear Medicine Unit and shared in writing the draft.\n\nHeba Salah: did the pathology lab work\n\nAmal Halim: Collected the literature, wrote and revised the manuscript.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:29:53", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:30:19", "cost": 26.14}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:30:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:29:53"}

Patients who are poor surgical candidate are left with limited options which include continuing chest tube for a prolonged period of time and bedside pleurodesis. Endobronchial valves are not approved by Food and drug authority for this condition. Their off-label use requires an Institutional Review board approval, a process that can take many weeks. Although the role of bronchoscopic methods have been described since 1990,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> there are only a couple of case reports describing this novel approach.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u></a></sup> We present the case of a persistent pulmonary-pleural air leak in an inoperable patient for whom blood-patch with thrombin injection resulted in resolution of the air leak.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 69-year-old female came to the emergency room with symptoms of dry cough and shortness of breath for the past few days. He was unable to speak in full sentences at the time of presentation. This was accompanied by right sided dull chest pain. Her past medical history was significant for severe emphysematous Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), as well as two episodes of right sided pneumothoraces in the past year, where each episode was treated with a small-bore chest tube insertion and admission to the hospital. She was an active chronic smoker with over 56-pack year smoking history. She was on home oxygen 4 to 6 L/min, and used her inhaled corticosteroids and anticholinergics regularly as prescribed.\n\nHer physical Examination revealed a cachectic lady in moderate respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 25 to 28 breaths/min. Breath sounds were diminished on the left side and absent on the right side. A Chest X-ray (CXR) performed on presentation showed a large right sided pneumothorax for which a right-sided pigtail catheter was inserted. Her shortness of breath subsequently improved, and a repeat CXR showed a decrease in the size of pneumothorax. However, a strong air-leak was noted. Over the next 5 days, the patient continued to have persistent air leak and also developed subcutaneous emphysema. A computed tomography chest showed severe emphysema with apical blebs.\n\nThoracic surgery was consulted for possible video-assisted thoracoscopic resection of blebs and mechanical pleurodesis. After a careful evaluation, the patient was deemed to be a poor candidate for surgery due to the severity of the illness and high-risk morbidity and mortality from the procedure. Tube pleurodesis was not attempted because of incomplete expansion of the lung and an elevated likelihood of developing hydropneumothorax. The patient lived alone and declined to be discharged with a Heimlich valve.\n\nInterventional pulmonology service was consulted for endobronchial valve placement. As endobronchial valves are not approved for this indication, we decided to perform a novel procedure called an endobronchial blood patch with thrombin injection.\n\nIn this technique, the fistula was first localized using a balloon occlusion study, and found to be in the superior segment (B6) of the right lower lobe. Following localization, a swan ganz catheter was inserted into the superior segment and the balloon was inflated. 10cc of the patient's own blood was then injected through the catheter, followed by 5000 U of Thrombin injection. The catheter was then removed.\n\nImprovement in the leak was seen the next day from Grade 3, Inspiratory to Grade 1, Forced Expiratory (Cerfolio Classification of Air Leaks), and stopped completely by the third day. The patient was successfully discharged home 2 days later.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nPhysiologically, there is no communication between the pleura and the airways. When there is an abnormal communication present between the two, it may be termed as either a broncho-pleural fistula (BPF) or alveolopleural fistula, depending upon the site of communication. If the communication is before the segmental bronchus, it is called a BPF and if it is beyond the segmental bronchus, it is referred to as an alveolo-pleural fistula.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Etiologies of fistula formation include thoracic surgery, necrotizing pneumonia, lung abscess, trauma, tuberculosis, emphysematous COPD, mechanical ventilation, and trauma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> The incidence of BPF is as high as 20% and 0.5% after pneumonectomy and lobectomy respectively.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> If the fistula exists for a prolonged period of time, it predisposes the patient to pleural space infections.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax due to underlying severe COPD may also lead to a fistula formation.\n\nInitial management of a pneumothorax is by needle aspiration with or without chest tube insertion. After chest tube insertion, patients are admitted for continuous observation and daily CXR. Removal of the chest tube is dependent upon cessation of air leak. A persistent air leak is defined as an air leak beyond 5 days post chest tube insertion.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Persistent air leaks are difficult to treat, especially in a critically ill patients when the morbidity and mortality from the surgery are high. These patients are left with limited options including continuing chest tube for an extended period of time or bedside pleurodesis. This is where less invasive therapy to treat these fistulas can have a role. There are numerous devices described and techniques such as sealants, sclerosis of airways using alcohol, metal coils, Watanabe spigots and many others, with mixed results.\n\nThere are a handful of case reports<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u></a></sup> for the endobronchial blood patch technique. The proposed mechanism of blood patch involves using patient's own blood as a patch to close the fistula between the lung and the pleural cavity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Only one report describes the use of thrombin.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Use of Swan-ganz has been described once.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> We propose using 5000 units of Thrombin to facilitate rapid clotting and create a stronger patch. Blood first acts as a mechanical seal and then induces an inflammatory reaction causing fibrosis with mucosal proliferation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup>\n\nThis is the first such case report describing the use of blood patch with co-administration of thrombin through Swan-ganz catheter, in the United States. However, further case series are needed to standardize this novel procedure, which can be a great tool in treating pneumothoraces in critically sick patients, where surgery is either contraindicated or difficult to perform.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nMuhammad Perwaiz-First author, Rajiv Pasrich- Reviw of literature Gujrot Grewal-Collected clinical date for case report Richard J.

She had no medical history and was 160 cm tall and 53 kg at the time of visit. Fetal nuchal translucency was 1.3 mm at 11 weeks of gestation and Down risk 1:250 positive in integrated test at 16 weeks of gestation at the local clinic. Her laboratory findings performed at local clinic were as follows: Alphafetoprotein: 103.84 international units (IU)/mL: 2.4333 MoM (Multiple of medians), human chorionic gonadotropin: 34.64 IU/mL: 2.651 MoM, unconjugated estriol: 3.61 nmol/L: 0.872 MoM, inhibin-A: 187.20 pg/mL: 1.010MoM. She attempted to undergo amniocentesis at 17 weeks of gestation but it could not be performed because she had no amniotic fluid. We performed ultrasonography at 18 weeks and 6 days of gestation. The size of fetus was appropriate to weeks, but the amniotic fluid index was 3.0 cm. The amniotic fluid was inadequate, and the fetus was adhered to the womb. Bilateral kidney of the fetus appeared normal . The placenta was very thick with placenta previa . Because of the lack of amniotic fluid, we tested for cell free deoxyribonucleic acid, and the results showed ‘trisomy of 21 high risk’. No other structural abnormalities were observed on the ultrasound. Her laboratory findings were as follows: Anti Cardiolipin Ab IgM: negative, Anti Cardiolipin Ab IgG: negative, Anti-beta2-GP I IgG: negative, Anti-beta2-GP I IgM: negative, Lupus anticoagulant screening: negative, free protein S (immunological): 32.4% (60%–150%), protein S (functional): 40% (60%–150%).

We performed ultrasonography 3 days later and found that the volume of amniotic fluid had further decreased. At 20 weeks, ultrasound showed an enlarged placenta and the pregnancy ended with IUFD. If the patient delivered vaginally, excessive bleeding was expected due to previa totalis. So, the patient delivered a dead male fetus (230 g) by hysterotomy with no external definite anomalies. The final chromosomal test of dead fetus revealed trisomy 21, and no autopsy was performed. The bulky placenta weighted 0.7 kg and measured 12 × 8 × 4 cm, all dimensions over the 95 percentile for gestational age with a prominent multiple grape-like vesicular mass involving the whole placenta. The umbilical cord measured 10 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter, with 2 arteries and 1 vein . A pathological examination led to the diagnosis of PMD . Microscopically, the stem villi were large and edematous with cystic change and had large thick-walled blood vessels within the stroma. The intermediate and some distal villi showed small vessel proliferation with chorangiomatosis-like features. Since PMD does not recur, the patient is preparing for the next pregnancy.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nMacroscopic view of the placenta showing a bulky placenta weighing 0.7 kg with prominent multiple grape-like vesicular mass involving whole placenta.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nThe microscopic examinations.

(Hematoxylin and eosin staining, x100).</u>\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThe main differential diagnoses of PMD are partial hydatidiform mole, dichorionic twins of a normal fetus and complete mole, and confined placental mosaicism. Sonographic features (thickened placenta with hypoechoic spaces) of PMD are very similar to those of the partial moles. The other differential diagnoses of these ultrasonographic findings include chorioangiomas and subchorionic hematomas. However, these findings are common in PMD. Also, the enlargement in the surface transfer area is a result of the increased placental volume and number of vessels within the stem villi. During the third trimester, the chorionic plate vessels in a PMD placenta are dilated and tortuous.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Histology is the gold standard of diagnosis as it helps in distinguishing PMD from partial hydatidiform mole. In contrast to partial hydatidiform mole, the histology of PMD features clusters of enlarged, proximal stem villi with central cistern formation and absence of trophoblastic proliferation or hyperplasia.\n\nPMD should be included in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions of the placenta on ultrasonography. Placenta may appear thickened and cysts are typically located on the fetal surface of the placenta.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> PMD in the first trimester shows no blood flow in the cystic spaces of the placenta on color Doppler. However, in the third trimester, large vascular areas with turbulent blood flow are observed, either arterial or venous, which are located mainly under and at the level of the chorionic plate.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> These changes are due to the progressive dilation of chorionic arteries and veins, which become aneurysmal. On color Doppler, high velocity and low resistance flow is seen in the mass and large feeding vessel with increased vascularity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> However, in cases that terminate before 20 weeks of gestation, the chorionic plate vessels are not dilated, and the normal and abnormal areas are not clearly linear, suggesting that the vascular malformations develop progressively.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> In this case, the ultrasonogram showed placenta was enlarged at 20 weeks of gestation, but the worm-like pattern in the placental parenchyma was unclear. As the pregnancy advances, tangled congested vessels grossly resembling gray-white or dark-red wormlike structures may be identified within the parenchyma and are often most prominent in the sub chorionic plate region near the fetal surface. Cohen et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> described 3 cases of PMD associated with fetal aneuploidy:trisomy 13 (47, XX, t(1:3) (q32;q32) + 13), Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY), and triploidy (69, XXX). Pregnancy outcomes have been reported to range from healthy, uncomplicated pregnancies, to adverse maternal and/or neonatal complications.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> The maternal complications include preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and premature delivery. Fetal complications include severe IUGR in half of the cases. In the same study IUFD was reported to be high (about 18%), and 1 third of the newborns died within 2 months of extra uterine life.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> These causes of IUFD remain unclear and may be heterogeneous.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Thrombosis of the chorionic vessels and umbilical cord anomalies are likely causes of IUFD in PMD cases. Fetal death may be explained by a potentially chronic hypoxia which is a consequence of obstructive fetal vascular thrombosis and a decrease in maternal fetal gas exchange as a result of an insufficient amount of normal chorionic villi.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14]</u></a></sup> In our case, the histological examination revealed that the dilated chorionic vessels were edematous with focal cyst formation and thick-walled muscular blood vessels may provoke IUGR and fetal death. The diagnosis of PMD is confirmed only after the evaluation of placental pathology. Grossly, it is characterized by placentomegaly, dilated or even aneurysmal chorionic vessels and enlarged hydropic or cystic villi. Microscopic findings include mesenchymal hyperplasia and edema of stem-cell villi, which contain thick-walled vessels. A characteristic feature is the absence of trophoblastic hyperplasia, which is a hallmark of gestational trophoblastic disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u></a></sup>\n\nPMD is mainly a pathological diagnosis but it is necessary to consider it as a differential diagnosis when cystic lesions in the placenta are detected during pre-natal ultrasound. This case provides a valuable experience that a placental abnormality diagnosed on ultrasound during pregnancy can adversely affect the fetal outcomes and thus requires close monitoring.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThe authors are grateful to Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital for its assistance and encouragement.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Writing-original draft preparation**: Kim YS.\n\n**Writing-review, Pathology**: Jang SH.\n\nAll authors read and approved the final manuscript.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:51:14", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:51:27", "cost": 13.17}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:51:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:51:13"}

It is a type of anastomotic leakage and a rare complication that occurs after low anterior resection.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> It is reported to occur in 1.9% to 9.9% of patients after surgery.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2–6]</u></a></sup> Although it is a rare complication, it causes unpleasant symptoms such as recurrent vaginal/urinary tract infections and psychosocial burden to patients, and it significantly reduces patients’ quality of life.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> The incidence rate of RVF did not differ between patients who underwent anastomosis using a circular stapler and hand-sewn anastomosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup>\n\nTreatment of RVF often requires surgical procedures. Various surgical procedures using various flaps have been reported but these surgeries leave large scars on the patient's body and are often invasive.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,6,11–13]</u></a></sup> We report a case of RVF after a low. anterior resection that was successfully treated with a laparoscopic omental flap. The omentum is an ideal flap because of its wide mobility and adequate blood supply. Our procedure was performed laparoscopically, which is beneficial for gaining a clear view of areas with difficult access, such as the pelvis. It was performed using the same port site as the primary operation and did not leave a new scar.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nAn 89-year-old woman presented with bloody feces and was diagnosed with rectal cancer following colonoscopy. She had a medical history of hypertension and dementia. Her colonoscopy results showed a raised tumor with a round surface that occupied the lumen of the lower rectum . The tumor was too large, and we could not detect intestinal attachment of the tumor through colonoscopy. Laparoscopic low anterior resection with D3 lymph node dissection was performed. After total mesorectal excision, the rectum was incised 2 cm distal to the tumor using three 45 mm cartridges of a linear stapler. The anastomosis was performed with a 25 mm circular stapler using the double-stapling technique (DST). We confirmed that there was no inclusion of the vaginal wall during anastomosis. After performing the anastomosis, the leak test results were negative. A 10-mm Silascon duple drain (Kaneka Medical Products, Japan) was inserted into the colon through the anus. It was placed 1–2 cm proximal to the DST anastomosis stapler line and fixed to the skin on the left side of the buttock. An 8 mm silicone drain was inserted into the colon through the anus beyond the stapler line and into the intraperitoneal cavity through one of the port sites. The surgery lasted 5 h and 5 min, and the total blood loss was 10 ml. The tumor size was 9 cm × 6 cm  and the pathological stages were T3, N0, M0, stage IIA (8th edition TNM Classification).\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nColonoscopy findings and resected specimen **(**A) A raised tumor located in the lower rectum was observed by colonoscopy.

As she had a history of dementia, she did not actively get out of the bed after the surgery. The rectal drain was removed 5 days postoperatively. On the 6th day, we noticed intestinal fluid in the anterior part of her diaper. Blood test results showed increased inflammation; white blood cell 23250/μm, lymphocyte 89.4%; C-reactive protein 10.54 mg/dl. Urinalysis revealed bacteria in the urine. Digital rectal examination results showed that approximately 1 cm of the colonic wall proximal to the anastomosis stapler line was missing. Computed tomography scans showed no free air in the peritoneal cavity but revealed an abscess in the perineum proximal to the stapler line . We conducted an enema examination using a contrast agent. When the contrast agent was injected into the rectum through the anus, it immediately flowed into the vagina. There was a 1 cm large fistula between the colon and the vagina. The presence of RVF was confirmed. After we diagnosed RVF, primary surgical video was reviewed, and we confirmed that the vaginal wall was not involved during the anastomosis.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nComputed tomography (CT) images and enema examination using contrast agents (A) CT scan showing the coronal section of the patient's pelvis on the 6th day after laparoscopic rectal resection.

Under general anesthesia, the first trocar was inserted through the upper left side of the abdomen, where the stoma was planned and not at the trocar site of the primary surgery to avoid organ injuries. A 12 mm trocar was successfully inserted into the abdominal cavity, and pneumoperitoneum was achieved. We then inserted a 10 mm trocar into the umbilical region and the lower right side of the abdomen and a 5 mm trocar into the upper right side and the lower left side of the abdomen. These port sites were the same as those used in the primary operation. The omentum was detached from the center of the transverse colon to the splenic fold. Subsequently, we opened the omental bursa and carefully preserved the left gastroepiploic artery and vein to preserve the blood flow of the omental flap. The omental flap was formed, and we confirmed that it had reached the pelvic floor. After performing transverse colostomy, we flushed 2 L of saline from the anal side of the colostomy to irrigate the descending colon and rectum. We then placed a 10-Fr Neraton tube from the vagina through the fistula into the anus to guide the exfoliation of the perineum laparoscopically. Subsequently, we carefully exfoliated the adhesions in the vagina and rectum and detected a 2 cm fistula in the perineum . We exfoliated the vaginal and rectal adhesions around the fistula . Subsequently, we suspended the pneumoperitoneum and sutured the vaginal and rectal walls individually through the perineum by interrupted sutures using 3–0 Vicryl . We repeated the pneumoperitoneum, laparoscopically placed the omental flap in the perineum, and secured the flap with four sutures using a 3–0 polydioxanone suture material . The duration of the surgery was 4 hours and 8 minutes, and the total blood loss was 100 ml.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nImage of laparoscopic omental flap surgery (A) A Neraton tube was located in the fistula (black arrow).

The results of the enema examination 14 days postoperatively showed no RVF . The patient underwent a procedure to close the colostomy 36 days after the second surgery. There has been no recurrence of RVF for more than a year since the patient was discharged.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nClassically, DST anastomosis has been reported to be a risk factor for RVF.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> However, Woo et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> reported that the incidence rates of RVF do not differ between DST and hand-sewn anastomosis. Watanabe et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> reported that the risk factors for RVF after a low anterior resection are poor nutritional status before surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, tumor size larger than 45 mm, total blood loss of more than 200 mL intraoperatively, and lateral lymph node dissection. An anastomosis made at a site less than 5 cm from the anal verge is also related to RVF.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u></a></sup> Ours was a high-risk case because the tumor was larger than 45 mm, and the site of the anastomosis was 3 cm proximal to the anal verge.\n\nThe utility of transanal drainage tubes to prevent anastomotic leakage after colorectal cancer surgery with DST reconstruction has been previously reported.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> We used a 10 mm Silascon duple drain (Kaneka Medical Products, Japan) as a transanal drain after low anterior dissection. Rectal examination and computed tomography examination showed that the fistula was located 1 cm proximal to the anastomosis staple line. The primary surgical video confirmed that the vaginal wall was not involved in the anastomosis. Intestinal fluid from the vagina was observed a day after the anal drain was removed. By examining variations in intestinal contact and crushing pressure caused by a transanal drain, Nishigori et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> revealed that the pressure caused by the tip of the drain is a risk factor for intestinal wall perforation. In our case, the transanal drain was inserted approximately 1 to 2 cm proximal to the DST anastomosis stapler line. The transanal drain was fixed to the skin on the left side of the buttocks. Since the patient had dementia, she did not actively get out of bed after the surgery. We believe that this allowed the drain to remain in the same position, consistently pressing on the rectal wall. Considering that the symptoms related to an RVF appeared the day after removing the transanal drain, we believe that the tip of the drain had continuously compressed the intestinal tract, causing colorectal perforation and RVF formation.\n\nVarious surgical procedures have been proposed to repair an RVF after a low anterior resection, such as transvaginal or transanal resection or closure of the fistula, redo coloanal anastomosis, and repair with a gracilis muscle flap.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,6,11–13]</u></a></sup> The overall success rate of RVF treatment varies from 43% to 100%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,11–14]</u></a></sup> The success rate of RVF treated with an omental flap is high. Hagen et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> reported a 95% success rate, while Schloericke et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> reported a 100% success rate. Hagen et al and Schloericke et al also reported that the recurrence rate of fistula was 5% and 0%, respectively. In surgical treatments using tissue flaps to repair an RVF, the quality of the flap is important. An ideal flap has wide mobility with adequate blood supply, accurate apposition of healthy tissues without tension, a layered meticulous closure, and is easy to manipulate at the rectal anastomotic site<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15]</u></a></sup>. By separating it from the left side of the transverse colon, the omentum satisfies these conditions. Additionally, by preserving the left gastroepiploic artery and vein, the blood supply to the omentum was preserved. Omentum has the characteristics of promoting angiogenesis by the action of angiogenic factors and supplying fibroblasts and is considered to have an anti-inflammatory effect due to its abundance of lymphoid vessels.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> Postoperative RVF is often inflamed, but these characteristics of the omentum make it an ideal flap, and this is considered to be one of the reasons for the high success rate.\n\nIn selecting a treatment for postoperative RVF, it is necessary to understand the size of the fistula. There are reports on postoperative RVF successfully treated with non-surgical procedures such as estriol vaginal tablets, fibrin glue, and endoscopic closure.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19–21]</u></a></sup> Estriol is an estrogen hormone that is related to muscle relaxation, vasocongestion, and lubrication of the vagina.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> Applying estriol to the vagina results in increased vaginal compliance, decreased vaginal pH, increased vaginal blood flow, and improved lubrication. Fujita et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> reported cases of RVF successfully treated with estriol in Japan from 2007 to 2019. Six out of 13 cases had fistulas of 3 mm in diameter, one was smaller than 3 mm, and six were not described. An RVF with a fistula smaller than 3 mm in postmenopausal women may be a good indication for estriol vaginal tablets. Shibata et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> reported that a fistula size larger than 1 cm is one of the factors that contribute to the failure of non-surgical treatment. Postoperative RVF with a large fistula may be a good indication for omental flap surgery.\n\nIn our procedure, we were able to perform complete laparoscopic omental flap surgery through the port site used in the primary surgery without requiring a new surgical wound. However, in other surgical treatments, such as gracilis muscle interposition, a large skin incision is required on the thigh, and postoperative motility disturbance can potentially occur. However, the limitation of omental plastic surgery is that it is not applicable to patients who have undergone omentectomy. There is also a risk that the omental flap may not be pulled down to the perineum due to adhesion.\n\nThe benefit of using laparoscopy to exfoliate adhesions in the perineum is that it provides a secure field of view. In narrow areas, such as the pelvis, it is often difficult to gain a good view of the surgical area, and a better view leads to a safer course of surgery. However, appropriate visualization during reoperation may be difficult because of the effects of adhesions. These weak points could be compensated by placing a Neraton catheter through the rectovaginal fistula and using it as a guide. In our case, we placed the Neraton catheter transvaginally through the fistula. The Neraton catheter serves as a valuable guide for fistula identification.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nIn summary, we report a case of RVF after a low anterior resection that was successfully treated with laparoscopic omental flap surgery. The omentum is an ideal flap organ. Using laparoscopy to repair a fistula enables a good access and the Neraton tube can be a helpful guide for identifying fistulas.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nThis study was conceptualized by Dr. Kobayashi.

She had cough and nasal discharge for 2 weeks, and fever on the day of admission. She had no history of hospitalization, and there was no developmental delay observed. Vaccination including pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B, the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-inactivated polio virus vaccine (DPT-IPV), bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) were currently up to date for her. Her cousin has a history of septo-optic dysplasia and epilepsy. At the time of admission, her heart rate was 140 to 160 beats per minute, blood pressure was 126/68 mm Hg, and body temperature was 39.8 °C. On physical examination, she appeared weak due to the seizure episodes. Her Glasgow Coma Scale was E3V4M5 without nuchal rigidity. The third seizure occurred while placing peripheral intravenous catheter, and seizure did not stop until we gave her diazepam 0.3 mg/kg intravenously. After performing skin preparation 3 times using 70% isopropyl alcohol, blood was taken from her left medial cubital vein and dorsal vein of right hand in 2 bottles for blood culture.\n\nBlood samples were inoculated in pediatric blood culture vials (PED PLUS/F BD BACTEC<sup>TM</sup> PLUS Resin Media: BD BACTEC FX Blood Culture Systems, BD Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan). Her head computed tomography scan revealed no abnormalities. Lumbar puncture was performed followed by administration of cefotaxime 200 mg/kg/d. Her blood leukocyte count was 12,100/μL (normal range:3,300–8,600), and C-reactive protein level was 0.43 mg/dL. Her urine test and cerebrospinal fluid test showed no abnormalities as well as no organism on Gram stains of both specimens. On the second hospital day her blood culture turned out positive for Gram-negative coccobacilli in 1 of the 2 aerobic blood culture bottles. After 24 hours of incubation, colonies were circular, convex and almost 1 mm in diameter. Non-fermentative, oxidase negative gram-negative rods were found using triple sugar iron (TSI) ager. The VITEK 2 system (bioMérieux, Japan) identified the organism as _A ursingii_. During this process, Urease test showed positive against the usual characteristics of _A ursingii_ and other Acinetobacter species. By way of precaution, the organism was also identified as _A ursingii_ by matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS: Bruker Japan, score 2.434). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed by using broth microdilution MIC method (Dry Plate “EIKEN”; Eiken Kagaku Co.Tokyo, Japan) following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline (M-100-S-27).\n\nThe results showed susceptibility to piperacillin (minimal inhibitory concentration μg/mL), cefotaxime (4 μg/mL), ceftazidime (2 μg/mL), imipenem (≦0.25 μg/mL), amikacin (<1 μg/mL) and resistant to aztreonam (8 μg/mL). Cefotaxime was continued for 10 days on the basis of susceptibility results. Her urine and cerebrospinal fluid culture showed no growth. There was no further seizure episodes and complications, and her fever resolved. She discharged home without further antibiotics.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThe genus Acinetobacter comprises a heterogenous group of non-motile, strictly aerobic, nonfermenting, nonfastidious, catalase-positive, oxidase negative bacteria which presents as short, plump, gram-negative coccobaccili.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u></a></sup> They are widespread in natural moist and hospital environments and are associated with skin colonization of hospitalized patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup>_A ursingii_ is a novel species, which was first identified in 2001<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> and in the past few years there have been several case reports and series of _A ursingii_ bloodstream infections.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7–14,16–18]</u></a></sup>_A ursingii_ usually causes nosocomial infections, however, its ecological niches and virulence have not been clarified yet.\n\nThere have been case reports and series of _A ursingii_ bacteremia, including 11 cases in adults  and 11 cases in children including the our presented case . In the adult cases, the average age was 51 years old (range: 26-99). The ratio of male to female showed 3:8, and 2 cases (2/11, 18%) had septic shock. Four cases (4/11, 36%) had malignancies, and 3 of them received chemotherapy from central venous catheter.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7–9,14]</u></a></sup> Seven cases (7/11, 64%) had central venous catheter, however, there was no clear descriptions of catheter-related blood stream infection such as culture positivity of devices or significant time to positivity of blood cultures between device site and peripheral vein.

In addition, 6 (6/8, 75%) of the NICU cases were premature babies, and 3 of them died; all were born at less than 30 weeks with a birth weight less than 800 g.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u></a></sup> These 3 babies had complications of respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and necrotizing enterocolitis respectively.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u></a></sup> The ratio of male to female showed 6:5 including the presented case. All of the NICU cases had central venous catheters or were placed on mechanical ventilation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u></a></sup> These findings suggest that _A urisingii_ is an emerging pathogen that may cause nosocomial bacteremia and be associated with the use of intravascular catheters and malignancies, otherwise the focus of infection is obscure. In addition, patients with _A ursingii_ bacteremia usually have a good clinical course except premature neonates. As reported in previous studies,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12,18]</u></a></sup> premature babies are immune-compromised, have dermal fragility and devices placed for total parenteral nutrition can be risk factors for _A ursingii_ bacteremia. It is difficult to discern the cause of mortality in premature babies with _A.ursingii_ bacteremia with less than 30 weeks of gestational age because of their complex co-morbidities.\n\nThe susceptibility methods for isolated _A ursingii_ were not standardized in the previous case studies and series, using agar dilution method, disk diffusion test, Epsilometer test or other commercial-based automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing system.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7–14,16,17]</u></a></sup> The susceptibilities to antibiotics for _A ursingii_ bacteremia were categorized into 3 types: susceptible to all class of antibiotics, resistant to cephalosporines and multi-drug resistant including broad spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenem. In adult cases , 9 cases (9/11, 82%) were resistant to cephalosporins, including a case with imipenemase-1 producing carbapenem resistant strain.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> In the cases of children, the susceptibilities were reported in over the half of cases (6/11, 55%) including the present case. No multi-drug resistant strains were reported despite the use of broad spectrum antibiotics for the NICU outbreak cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Regarding diversity of antimicrobial use in adults and pediatrics cases, initial treatment was started with carbapenems in 36% (8/22) of the cases, fluoroquinolones in 14% (3/22) of the cases and 41% (9/22) of the cases used combined antibiotics. The duration of the antibiotics were 7 to 21 days in previous reports.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7–14,16–18]</u></a></sup> There was no case of invasive, continuous bloodstream infection such as endocarditis, deep-seated abscess or osteomyelitis which needed a longer duration of treatment. A case series revealed that about half of the cases of _A.ursingii_ bacteremia which received inappropriate antibiotics within 48 hours after the onset of bacteremia had significantly lower mortality rates compared to _A.baumannii_.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup>_A.ursingii_ may present with low virulence, however the prognosis may not be dependent on antibiotics alone, but also on the patient medical status, usage of intravenous devices and the immune status. It would be appropriate to continue 7 to 10 days of broad spectrum antibiotics, then narrow down when antimicrobial susceptibilities are reported.\n\nThis 9-month-old girl who presented with febrile seizures was found to have community-acquired _A ursingii_ occult bacteremia. Occult bacteremia is defined as a positive blood culture for a pathogen in a well-appearing child without an obvious source of infection.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> In children vaccinated against _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Haemophilus influenzae_, the prevalence of occult bacteremia is less than 1% in those who are febrile. A high rate of febrile seizures, especially complex seizures, has been noted in Japanese children with occult bacteremia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> In addition, febrile seizures are at similar risk for occult bacteremia as those with fever alone, and the incidence of bacteremia may decrease in the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> The presented case had complex febrile seizure with occult _A ursingii_ bacteremia without previous history of seizure disorder followed by benign clinical course.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first case report of community-acquired _A ursingii_ occult bacteremia in a healthy child. The ecology of most Acinetobacter species is still poorly understood.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> These strains can survive in the environment, and have been found on equipment, and on surfaces and materials<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> close to colonized patients. The skin and mucosae of patients can be colonized, and that colonization may last for days to weeks.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24]</u></a></sup> Community acquired infections with Acinetobacter species have been reported in tropical and subtropical area.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> Although there was a community acquired pediatric case of _A ursingii_ bacteremia with gastroesophageal reflex disease,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> there has been no case reports without underlying or previous illness. The presented case with fever followed by seizures was investigated and treated aggressively as a septic, medical emergency despite its obscure focus of infection. Regarding the diagnosis of a blood stream infection, a blood culture positive for _A ursingii_ is difficult to evaluate and it is difficult to differentiate true infection from contamination or colonization. In our institute, the house staff obtain blood cultures using 70% isopropyl alcohol for skin preparation to avoid contamination.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> Once Gram-negative coccobacilli are detected by blood culture, it should be treated as a true infection regardless whether it is nosocomial or community acquired.\n\nCommunity acquired occult bacteremia by Acinetobacter species can be easily overlooked as it is usually a lower virulence strain with a benign clinical course, though fatalities can occur in immunocompromised patients with certain risk factors. Blood cultures positive for _A ursingii_ should be immediately treated with appropriate antibiotics to minimize the risk for complications.\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment\n--------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>We respectfully thank Dr Saori Kinjo for taking care of this patient, and Dr. Byron Izuka for judicious elaborating this article.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Rei Yoshida: Conceptualization, Writing-original draft, Investigation.

Family nursing refers to the conceptual framework of family systems nursing (FSN) developed by Wright and Leahey.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Within this framework, the family is understood as a group of individuals bound by strong emotional ties, a sense of belonging, and a passion for being involved in one another's lives: _“The family is who they say they are_.”<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Hence, throughout the text, family and family member will refer to meaningful relationships that might go beyond genetics and law.\n\nChronic pain was for the first time considered an illness of its own in the 11<sup>th</sup> revision of the International Classification of Diseases, released in June 2018, although not yet implemented.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Thus, a widening of the usual understanding of CNCP as persistent pain without malignant causes is in process. According to International classification of diseases-11, pain is defined as chronic after three months. In a review using the same time span, 19% of the adult European population was found to have CNCP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> In a Danish population, the prevalence of CNCP defined as pain exceeding six months was 26.8%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,4]</u></a></sup> Due to limitations in available definitions and monitoring tools, a systematic review finds that estimates of prevalence and impact of chronic pain vary widely in the literature, between countries, and across studies within the same country.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Far-reaching physical, psychosocial and economic consequences for patients and society are demonstrated.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3,6–8]</u></a></sup> CNCP impacts patients’ social relationships and affects the health of the family.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9–12]</u></a></sup> Children of parents with CNCP have an increased risk of developing CNCP, which indicates that the condition may be reproduced through generations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13–16]</u></a></sup>\n\nAvailable treatments for CNCP rarely result in a resolution of symptoms, and living with some level of pain is the reality,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> thus rendering CNCP a life condition that calls for acceptance. However, patients may experience a lack of understanding and stigmatisation due to the invisible nature of CNCP, which instead of acceptance may lead them to look to the health services for legitimacy in terms of diagnosis and support.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18–22]</u></a></sup> Patients with CNCP have various symptoms and rarely respond to a single therapeutic modality.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> The gold standard in addressing the condition's complexity is a biopsychosocial approach considering CNCP to be the result of the dynamic interaction between physiological, psychological, and social factors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24–26]</u></a></sup> The treatment should take place in interdisciplinary rehabilitative trajectories that focus on pain management to support the patient's acceptance of CNCP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25,27]</u></a></sup> Improvement of self-management, referring to tasks carried out by the patient to live with a chronic condition, may enhance well-being and pain-related outcomes but may also be exhausting in the long-term and impeded by lack of family support.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u></a></sup> Thus, family involvement seems to be vital to reinforce the manageability of CNCP in the whole family, as supported by several studies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,13,15,30–35]</u></a></sup>\n\nIt may be assumed that family involvement already is a natural part of a holistic biopsychosocial approach. Still, the health care system's responsibility to involve family members is neither defined nor determined by law.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[36–38]</u></a></sup> A Danish study reflects this by finding that family involvement in three different pain centres is characterised by arbitrariness and lack of structure. In contrast, patients and their family members experience an existential need for tailored involvement.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[39,40]</u></a></sup> Generally, family involvement in the treatment of patients with CNCP is sparsely represented in research. However, several studies support the importance. A qualitative study of semi-structured telephone interviews investigated patients and family members perception of family involvement after attending a family day as a part of a multidisciplinary pain management programme. The interviews were conducted 2.5–4 months after the family day and followed up by a second interview session 2-4 months later. The study found that family involvement is essential to reach a shared understanding; being “on the same page” is necessary to manage CNCP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u></a></sup> A randomised study investigated the effect of a telephone-based intervention for couples living with CNCP, consisting of four telephone consultations of 60 minutes each as a supplement to a regular pain programme. The couples were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or usual treatment. The study demonstrated a significant effect of the intervention on the partners’ marital satisfaction, maintained at one-month follow-up.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u></a></sup> An Iranian survey investigated contributing factors to the marital function of patients with CNCP and their spouses. Based on correlation and regression analysis of data from multiple questionnaires, the study suggests that the involvement of spouses in the treatment of CNCP may increase marital satisfaction and contribute to a better outcome for both patients and spouses.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u></a></sup> An explorative observational study found that, six months after participating in an intensive three-day cognitive, social intervention with their supportive partners, patients with CNCP experienced a substantial and lasting quality of life improvement.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[44]</u></a></sup> Within diabetes and stroke, the involvement has resulted in reduced stress for spouses, closer family relations and increased family function.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[45,46]</u></a></sup> However, despite the apparent need and indicated benefit, a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, Cinahl, SveMed+ and Web of Science reveals a lack of research illuminating how specific approaches to the design of family involvement will affect manageability in everyday life in families afflicted by CNCP. An intervention consisting of structured FNC based on the conceptual framework of FSN<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,47–49]</u></a></sup> represents a proposal for tailored family involvement. Within this framework, the family as a whole is regarded as the unit of care, which allows the nurses to address the social element of the biopsychosocial approach. In other illnesses, FNC has reduced symptom burden and social limitations and improved self-efficacy, Quality of life, and family support/function.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[50–58]</u></a></sup> Neverthelesss, there is a general need for effect studies and to measure the effect over time.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[59,60]</u></a></sup>\n\n2 Rationale\n-----------\n\nCNCP is a complex chronic condition that should be addressed by a biopsychosocial approach. However, there is a substantial need for research about the effect of interventions addressing the social area of family involvement in the treatment of CNCP. Considering the extensive consequences of CNCP, it is crucial to investigate interventions that may improve management and well-being. The FANCOC-PAIN trial is based on the assumption that family involvement will increase both patients’ and family members’ self-efficacy and positively impact CNCP management. It seems that the benefits of FNC have never been investigated in a population of patients with CNCP and their selected family members. Thus, neither the association in this population between FNC and self-efficacy. By exploring the benefit of FNC, an initial step will be taken to fill the research gap regarding the advantage of various methods in family involvement.\n\n3 Research question\n-------------------\n\nWill FNC in the multidisciplinary treatment of CNCP affect patients and their selected family members, compared to usual treatment, measured primarily by changes in self-efficacy? Secondarily by changes in family function, health-related quality of life (HrQoL) and anxiety/depression?\n\n4 Hypothesis\n------------\n\nFNC with patients with CNCP and their selected family members will improve patients’ and family members’ self-efficacy. If the hypothesis can be confirmed, intervention strategies to support the manageability of CNCP for the whole family may need to be refined.\n\n5 Aim\n-----\n\nTo investigate whether an intervention with FNC in the context of an established CNCP treatment trajectory will improve both patients’ and family members’ self-efficacy compared to patients and family members who receive usual treatment. Furthermore, to investigate the impact on family function, HrQoL and anxiety/depression to identify any effect on these specific psychosocial areas.\n\n6 Method\n--------\n\n### 6.1 Design\n\nThe trial has a prospective non-blinded quasi-experimental design with a baseline and post-test in two comparable groups of patients and their selected family members: The control group receives usual treatment, while the intervention group also receives FNC. A randomised controlled trial is commonly considered the gold standard in health research.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[61]</u></a></sup> A quasi-experimental design does not have the same level of evidence as a randomised controlled trial.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[62]</u></a></sup> Still, quasi-experiments can generate causal evidence with a high degree of external validity that applies to intervention implementation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[63]</u></a></sup> A quasi-experimental design is particularly suitable when the intervention comprises a human act, and the blinding procedure is not possible regarding either the performer or the receiver of the intervention. Also, the quasi-experimental design is chosen due to a management decision in the FANCOC-PAIN study setting, that all employed nurses (n = 8) must carry out the intervention (in the following text, those nurses who carry out the intervention are referred to as “nurses”). As preparation for the intervention, the nurses must be trained at a three-day course to learn the principles of FSN followed by practising FNC with test families. Subsequently, their behaviour regarding family involvement may change, which presumably would influence the data if using a randomised control group. Thus, in coherence with the chosen study design and to prevent potential contamination, data from a “historical” control group will be collected before the onset of the training. The patients and their selected family members for both groups are recruited from the same setting to ensure similarity in the two groups.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[62,63]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 6.2 The FANCOC-PAIN study setting\n\nThe study will take place at the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre (MPC), Department of Anaesthesia, Pain and Respiratory Support, Rigshospitalet. Patients and their selected family members will be recruited from this MPC. The MPC is an outpatient department in the Capital Region of Denmark, treating adult patients from 18 years of age diagnosed with “complex persistent or chronic non-cancer pain” (International classification of diseases DR522e), for whom psychological and social factors often represent a considerable barrier to effective pain management. The current criterion for a referral to the MPC is a pain duration of at least six months. Diagnostic treatment associated with other illnesses must be completed. Patients with acute pain, ongoing cancer, headache/migraine, abuse of alcohol/drugs, and severe unstable psychiatric diseases are not referred to the MPC. The primary aim of the treatment, from a biopsychosocial approach, is to improve patients’ HrQoL. The individual treatment trajectory is based on an assessment carried out by the affiliated interdisciplinary health professionals, consisting of consultants/physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers, and psychologists. Each patient is linked to a responsible consultant/physician and a nurse. The nurses are primarily accountable for adjusting analgesic treatment by regular telephone appointments. The other interdisciplinary health professionals are linked in, based on an assessment of the patients’ needs. If relevant, the patients may participate in various groups with specific content, such as mindfulness or conversations with peers. The overall treatment trajectories are coordinated at interdisciplinary conferences and terminated when therapeutic success has been reached, or an assessment concludes that the patient will not profit from further treatment. The involvement of family members is currently understood as the situations when the patients choose to have family members present at their appointments. If relevant, the patient's partner may be invited to attend the psychologist appointments. Additionally, a voluntary event for patients and family members consisting of two meetings, each of two hours duration, is a standard service offered. Patients are responsible for enrolling on the voluntary event, but a lack of these events combined with cancellations due to insufficient take-up is a common challenge.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[39,64]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 6.3 Eligibility criteria – patients and family members\n\n#### 6.3.1 Inclusion\n\nPatients newly referred to the MPC within the preceding six months will be invited to participate. Each patient chooses between one and a maximum of three family members, in agreement with the comprehensive understanding of family from the FSN framework.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> The family members must be aged 18 years or older.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> The patient and the selected family members constitute a family dyad. Within the family dyad, patients can only be included together with at least one family member. Likewise, family members can only be included together with a patient.\n\n#### 6.3.2 Exclusion\n\nPatients and family members will be excluded if they receive family therapy elsewhere, are cognitively impaired or do not speak Danish. During the trial period, they will be excluded if they commence any professional family intervention other than the FANCOC-PAIN.\n\n#### 6.3.3 Recruitment\n\nThe first author will consecutively recruit patients at the MPC for the control and intervention groups. The ward nurse at the MPC will inform the first author about new patients. The staff will obtain oral consent from the patient, allowing the first author to contact and personally inform them about the study, at the MPC or by a phone call. If the patient is interested, they will be asked to select family members. Family members who give oral consent will be contacted by phone by the first author for further information. Written information will be provided to the respective patient and the selected family members.\n\n#### 6.3.4 Enrolment\n\nThe first author enrols patients and family members who consent to participate and meet the eligibility criteria. Due to the quasi-experimental design, an allocation to control or intervention group is not applicable; neither is blinding of an intervention conducting FNC. Relevant adherence strategies will be used throughout the trial period.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[65]</u></a></sup> The contact with the patients and their family members and the FNC appointments will take place when convenient for them.\n\n### 6.4 Intervention\n\n#### 6.4.1 The framework of the intervention\n\nThe FNC intervention is based on the FSN framework developed by Wright and Leahey.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> FSN is inspired by postmodernism and the biology of cognition and based on theories of systems, communication, cybernetics, and change. According to the system theory perspective, a family is an interdependent system, where family members inevitably influence and are influenced by each other.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,47–49]</u></a></sup> Thus, the illness will affect the entire family system. The illness itself is not the only source of the suffering; illness-related beliefs also have a considerable impact, captured by the Illness Beliefs Model, developed by Wright and Bell.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[47,49]</u></a></sup> The illness belief model is a central model in the FSN framework, illuminating that family members may have varying beliefs regarding the illness. Beliefs can be described as the lenses through which we gaze at the world.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u></a></sup> Our beliefs guide our choices, behaviour, and emotions. Core beliefs are basic concepts directing how we live our lives. They are deeply rooted and often not noticeable to the holder but will emerge through speech and actions. Beliefs cannot be categorised as good or bad, but they may be more or less suitable, and usually, reasonable beliefs may become inadequate to comply with illness-derived changes and thus impede management.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u></a></sup>\n\n#### 6.4.2 The content of the intervention\n\nIn addition to usual treatment, patients in the intervention group will be offered three FNC with their selected family members at three-week intervals. The intervention will be undertaken at the MPC in a comfortable, private room by two nurses; both engaged in the conversations. One has the leading role, while the other observes and contribute with relevant questions, thus serving as a reflecting partner.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[66]</u></a></sup> Provision will be made for a possible fourth conversation if desired by the family when asked. A conversation will last a maximum of 1.5 hours, including documentation time. During the FNC, the participating nurses must concentrate equally on the patient and the family members. The focus will be on the interaction, reciprocity, and connection between the patient, the family members, and those in their day-to-day environment and between the family and the nurses, whose embedded beliefs are also in play, according to system theory.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[48,49]</u></a></sup> The concept will be operationalised by the use of the Calgary Models, consisting of two complementary models: The Calgary Family Assessment Model (CFAM) and the Calgary Family Intervention Model.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> They are separate models, but in practice, they are applied simultaneously to unfolding family members’ illness beliefs and creating a context for changing restricting beliefs. CFAM is an integrated multidimensional framework to obtain knowledge about the specific family in the structural, developmental, and functional area. Genograms and ecomaps are practical tools to map the family and draw the internal and external structures.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> A genogram is a chart of the family constellation and is similar to the genealogical trees known from genetics. An ecomap is a diagram of the family's connections outside the core family and visualises the significant relationships between the family and the world. In this intervention, the genogram and the ecomap will be pictured in one drawing, referred to as a “family tree”, using a blank piece of paper, enabling personalisation. Calgary family intervention model is an organising frame focusing on strength and resilience in the family, describing which cognitive, affective and behavioural interventions the nurses may use.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,47]</u></a></sup> The nurses have a facilitating role and will gain insight into the family by using purposive linear and circular questions with a majority of the circular. The family is induced to discover and reflect on their differing and restricting beliefs and thus supported in finding new ways to manage everyday life with CNCP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,47–49,67–71]</u></a></sup> An example of a circular question could be to ask what the patient would like the family to learn to make everyday life easier for the patient. Use of the “one question question” makes it possible for the nurses to rapidly identify the family's one most urgent need by asking: “If you could have just one question answered through our work together, what would that one question be?”.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[67]</u></a></sup> The nurses should avoid the three most usual mistakes in FSN: 1) The framework for the conversations should be outlined to create transparency as a basis for change. 2) The nurses need to be open and curious about the family members’ multiverse beliefs (based on the consideration of Humberto Manturana, that one true reality does not exist).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u></a></sup> The nurses must enter a neutral non-judgemental position, bracketing objectivity, thus aiming not to take any particular family member's side. 3) Not least, the nurses should hold back advice until family members deliberate express a need for it.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,49,66,69,72]</u></a></sup> A manual and a shorter quick guide tailored to the FANCOC-PAIN trial have been drawn up by the first author and describe each of the three FNC 删除6：<u></u>. Nevertheless, according to the FSN theory, it will be impossible and inappropriate to deliver an identical intervention for all the participating families since the intervention is useful only if the components are adjusted to the particular family's needs.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Likewise, the number conversations in the series depend on the needs of the unique families.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,73]</u></a></sup> For families who feel ready to terminate after two conversations, the intervention will thus be regarded as accomplished.\n\n#### 6.4.3 The nurses’ conditions and training\n\nAll nurses are registered and employed at the MPC for a minimum of six months. They will be trained for the intervention by participating in a three-day course at the MPC by a Danish expert who teaches the FSN principles. The course consists of classes and exercises. Selected literature will be handed out before the start of the course. Nurses employed after this course can work on the intervention after participating in a similar course. After the course, the training will be continued in a three-month pilot test, providing the nurses with an opportunity to practice FNC before the intervention. Family dyads from the control group will be invited to be test families in the pilot test. An expert within FSN will offer regular supervision once a month during the pilot test and intervention period to support translation from theoretical to practical knowledge and ensure that the intervention is delivered according to the manual.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[74,75]</u></a></sup> Furthermore, the first author and two of the nurses will participate in an additional family conversation course (7.5 hp ∼ 7.5 ECTS) offered by Linnaeus University, Kalmar, Sweden. The knowledge gained will be disseminated to the rest of the nurses by video recorded fictional FNCs with the nurses, followed by shared reflections led by the first author. The intervention and the derived learning activities will be added to the usual nursing tasks for MPC nurses. The current funding level will enable a third of the nurses’ time to be released for the intervention.\n\n#### 6.4.4 Facilitation of the intervention\n\nThe first author will lead the project and facilitate the intervention, guided by “The knowledge translation action cycle”.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[76,77]</u></a></sup> During the facilitation process, the first author will attempt to make the intervention feasible by tailoring the content and the associated material to the context of the study setting. The first author will participate in regular nursing and interdisciplinary staff meetings at the MPC to be attentive to potential barriers and obstacles, take them into account and act accordingly.\n\n#### 6.4.5 Fidelity of the intervention\n\nThe fidelity of the intervention will be evaluated by way of the FNC documentation, using templates developed for the FANCOC-PAIN trial. The templates consist of a list of checkboxes, which creates an overview of components used during specific conversations. An additional questionnaire enables a thorough description of how the components were unfolded. The documentation serves a research purpose and will be safely stored following the Danish Data Protection Agency guidelines.\n\n#### 6.4.6 Monitoring and handling of potential harm and unexpected events\n\nThere is no evidence to indicate that interventions based on FSN would be harmful.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[78]</u></a></sup> FNC might create a therapeutic context, but it differs from therapy in the traditional sense because it concentrates only on illness-related family issues.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,46,79]</u></a></sup> The nurses are responsible for referring to relevant collaborators if family problems crop up that are not related to CNCP or go beyond the nurse's field of competence. In the case of unexpected harmful events that could be related to the intervention, they will be systematically recorded in the data management system. Families who experience unexpected events or harm will be offered a conversation with the first author, who leads the project. The specific case will be discussed with the patient's responsible interdisciplinary treatment team at the MPC to decide a clinically well-founded and appropriate reaction and potential termination of the intervention.\n\nAs host and performer of the intervention, the MPC managers, the nurses and relevant interdisciplinary collaborators will be continuously involved by the first author to comply with unanticipated difficulties and clarify mutual needs and expectations. Since the intervention in this non-pharmacological trial is not expected to cause adverse or harmful events, a data monitoring committee is not required. Neither will the trial be subjected to interim analyses due to the expected low risk, a total sample size of 50, and a total trial period of 26 weeks. A steering committee, constituted by the author group, has been established to supervise the FANCOC-PAIN trial and ensure its implementation. The steering committee will be involved if ethical considerations following unexpected events should lead to protocol changes. Radical decisions are always discussed in the steering committee.\n\n7 Outcomes\n----------\n\nThe effect of the intervention will be assessed by various patient-reported outcome measures (PROM). The same PROM will be used to assess both patients and their selected family members at the same time points. In the control group, a baseline test will be conducted after enrolment. A post-test will be conducted in week nine from baseline, after completing the usual treatment, during a period temporally similar to the intervention. In the intervention group, a baseline test will be conducted before the intervention. A post-test will be conducted after the intervention, in week nine from baseline, to detect a likely immediate effect. A follow-up assessment will be conducted four months after the post-test in post-intervention week 26 from baseline to demonstrate an expected long-term effect. 通用删除1(英):<u>(For time schedule, see Table 1. For flow diagram, see Fig. 1)</u>.\n\n删除9：<u>Table 1:\n\nTime schedule.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nCONSORT 2010 Flow Diagram adjusted to the trials quasi-experimental design.</u>\n\n### 7.1 Primary outcome\n\n#### 7.1.1 Self-efficacy measured by the general self-efficacy scale (GSE)\n\nThe primary outcome chosen to evaluate the intervention is the general self-efficacy scale (GSE). General self-efficacy refers to global confidence in one's coping ability across a wide range of demanding or novel situations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u></a></sup> A change in the patients’ and family members’ restricting illness beliefs following participation in structured FNCs is assumed to be reflected as a change in GSE, thus supporting the management of CNCP. GSE has been translated to Danish in line with research requirements, i.e. conducting translation and back-translation by bilingual consultants.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[81]</u></a></sup> The psychometric properties of GSE from samples in 25 countries, including Denmark, were examined by Scholtz et al. Based on their analyses, they suggested that GSE is a universal construct applicable across different cultures.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u></a></sup> GSE consists of ten items with four response categories, each ranging from “not at all true” to “exactly true”. Thus, the score can range from 10 to 40. The higher the score, the higher the general self-efficacy level, but the scale has no cut-off score.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[80,82]</u></a></sup> Cronbach's alpha in the total sample of 25 countries was 0.86, varying from 0.75 in India to 0.91 in Japan. In a Danish population, Cronbach's alpha was 0.87.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 7.2 Secondary outcomes\n\n#### 7.2.1 Family function measured by Iceland-expressive family functioning questionnaire (ICE-EFFQ)\n\nICE-EFFQ is developed based on CFAM for families who experience acute or chronic illness and thus derives from the FSN framework. ICE-EFFQ measures family function within the preceding four weeks and consists of 17 items within four categories: Expressing emotions, collaboration and problem-solving, communication, and behavior.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[83]</u></a></sup> Following a Danish translation and back translation, ICE-EFFQ has been validated in a Danish context.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[84]</u></a></sup> It uses a Likert scale with a scoring range from 1 (almost never) to 5 (all the time). Thus, the score can vary between 17 and 85. A high score indicates a good family function, but no exact cut-off score distinguishes between optimal or less optimal family function. The original questionnaire shows good internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.91.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[83,84]</u></a></sup> In the Danish version, Cronbach's alpha is 0.93.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[84]</u></a></sup>\n\n#### 7.2.2 Health-related quality of life measured by SF12\n\nSF-12 is a generic international instrument with 12 items, often used to assess health results and HrQoL. SF-12 is the short form of SF-36, which has been translated and validated in a Danish context.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[85]</u></a></sup> SF12 is chosen to lessen the burden connected with data collection. As with SF36, the shorter form provides data within the two main categories: Physical health and mental health, each divided into four health domains.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[86]</u></a></sup> The total raw score in each health domain will be transformed into a 0-100 score, again transformed into a T-score. A higher score indicates a better health state.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[87]</u></a></sup> In a health survey from nine European countries, standard and country-specific correlations between SF-36 and SF-12 summary measures are very high, ranging from 0.94 to 0.96 and 0.94 to 0.97, respectively, for the physical and mental summary measures.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[88]</u></a></sup>\n\n#### 7.2.3 Anxiety and depression measured by the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS)\n\nHADS is developed to measure anxiety and depression in general medical outpatient clinics and consider that psychological and biological symptoms of medical diseases are hardly distinguishable. HADS consists of two subscales for, respectively, anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) with seven items and measures self-reported symptoms during the preceding seven days.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[89,90]</u></a></sup> The items are rated on a four-point scale and scored from 0-3, with total scores in each subscale ranging from 0-21. Scores of 7 and below indicate no cases, scores between 8 and 10 indicate doubtful cases, while scores of 11 and above indicate definite cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[90]</u></a></sup> Bjelland et al found a mean Cronbach's alpha for HADS-A on 0.83 and HADS-D on 0.82.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[89]</u></a></sup> A Danish version of HADS is available from the Mapi Research Trust.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[91]</u></a></sup> In a recent Danish study, Cronbach's alpha was 0.87 for HADS-A and 0.82 for HADS-D in patients with cardiac disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[92]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 7.3 Other data\n\nSociodemographics and health information will be collected at baseline from both patients and family members. The sociodemographics comprise gender, age, country of origin, civil status, housing conditions, education, employment, and household income. The family members are additionally asked to specify their affiliation to the patient. For the patients, health information comprises the cause and duration of their CNCP, other known diagnoses, or experiences of anxiety/depression. For the family members, health information consists of the cause and duration of the patient's CNCP and their known diagnoses or experiences of anxiety/depression.\n\n### 7.4 Sample size\n\nThe calculation of the sample size is based on the primary outcome, self-efficacy, measured by GSE, and the results of Scholz et al's study regarding psychometric findings across cultures, including participants (N = 19120) from 25 countries, including Denmark (N = 163) Denmark.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u></a></sup> The study finds an average GSE of 29.72 from the entire sample. In participants from the Danish population, the highest GSE score was found to be 32.87. Based on this, the desired minimum relevant difference is estimated at 15% between the control group and the intervention group. With this, a significance level of 0.05 (α = 5), a power of 80% (β = 20) plus an estimated drop-out of 25%, the sample size is calculated to 25 family dyads in each group. Thus, a total of 50 patient/family dyads must be included. If the patient drops out, the entire dyad drops out. If a family member drops out, the dyad is retained in the project when at least one family member remains. If all family members drop out, the patient drops out as well.\n\n### 7.5 Data collection\n\nThe data collection order will be standardised using a questionnaire 删除6：<u></u> constructed for the FANCOC-PAIN-study, composed of sociodemographics, health information, and the multiple questionnaires associated with the selected instruments. The Danish version of GSE and a permission letter approving the use are available from the GSE user page.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[82,93]</u></a></sup> Permission and admission to apply ICE-EFFQ are obtained from the first authors of the papers presenting the original and the translated Danish version.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[83,84]</u></a></sup> License to the Danish version of SF12 has been obtained from Optum (license number QM048619), while license to access the Danish version of HADS from the Mapi Research Trust has been obtained from GL Assessment (Account Number 127887). In the constructed questionnaire, the wording in GSE and ICE-EFFQ is similar to the Danish translation,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[84,93]</u></a></sup> while SF12 and HADS also kept the original layout.\n\nPatients with CNCP are vulnerable and often lack resources, as mentioned above. Therefore, data from both patients and family members will be collected by structured telephone interviews. These will be conducted conveniently for the participant, by the first author, who will be aware of diminishing the interviewer effect.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[94,95]</u></a></sup> The questionnaire will be handed out or emailed in advance. The time burden will be 15–30 minutes for each interview, depending on the participants’ need to ask questions and converse. Due to the data collection method, the first author will be immediately aware of the PROM scores, which involves an ethical obligation to react to critical values, especially regarding the HADS. The first author will inform the responsible staff at the MPC if a patient's HADS-A or HADS-D score is 11 or above, indicating a definite case.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[90]</u></a></sup> In cases of family members scoring this high, they will be encouraged to contact their general practitioner. Similar action will be taken if the first author is left with grave concern about the participant's well-being concerning other PROM scores. Information about these precautions will emerge from the oral and written information.\n\n### 7.6 Data management and confidentiality\n\nThe first author and the co-authors do not have access to the patients’ medical records and thus only have information derived from the collected trial data. Following the Danish Data Protection Agency guideline, data will be securely processed and stored in the RedCap data storage system, serving as the primary tool to manage the project. After the structured telephone interview, data will be entered into RedCap by the first author and will only be accessible to the author group. At enrolment, the first author will allocate an identification code to each patient and family member. The association between the identification code, participant information (name, phone number, email, address, and family dyad affiliation) will be listed in a transfer key stored electronically on a secure drive, separate from the trial data in RedCap. After its final use, data will be filed according to national guidelines.\n\n### 7.7 Data analysis\n\nData analysis will be conducted using SPSS version 25 for Windows. The analysis intends to apply descriptive measures and analytical tests. For normally distributed variables, parametric tests will be carried out using a paired T-test, while non-parametric statistics using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test will address variables differing from a normal distribution. A multiple regression model will be elaborated, utilising groups of GSE distribution as the outcome variables. The statistical analysis aims to describe and compare the control and intervention groups for patients and family members. The significance level (alpha) will be set at 0.05. Thus, statistical significance and confirmation of the hypothesis will be claimed, if the _P_\\-value in the primary outcome is equal to or less than .05. The primary and secondary outcomes measured by the instruments GSE, ICE-EFFQ, SF12 (physical and mental health), HADS-A, and HADS-D will be analysed on the level of total median and mean scores, scores on the subscale, or domains and, when applicable, on item level using logistic regression analyses. HADS-A and –B will be dichotomised using a cut-off value of 11 since a value of 11 or above indicates definite cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[90]</u></a></sup> Interpretation of data will be guided by available user manuals.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[82,87,96]</u></a></sup> Statistical comparisons will be conducted investigating the differences between baseline and post-test, post-test, and follow-up and baseline and follow-up for both the control group and the intervention group. This study's main limitation is considered to be according to non-identifiable events that may occur between week nine and the follow-up measure at week 26, which may influence the outcome measures. Data collection via structured telephone interviews has the potential advantage of reducing missing data. It will still be registered as missing data if the participant within specific items is unable to answer. Missing data will be handled by imputation using mean or subgroup mean substitution.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[62,97]</u></a></sup> The analysis plan will be adjusted to a final version before the final patient's enrollment, and statistical assistance will support the data analysis.\n\n8 Discussion\n------------\n\nThe FANCOC-PAIN trial investigates whether an intervention with FNCs in the context of an established CNCP treatment trajectory will improve both patients’ and family members’ self-efficacy compared to patients and family members who receive usual treatment. Furthermore, the intervention's impact on family function, HrQoL and anxiety/depression to identify any effect on these specific psychosocial areas. CNCP is a complex chronic condition, and the biopsychosocial approach has become the gold standard in treatment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24–26]</u></a></sup> It may be assumed that family involvement is already an evident and mandatory service to address the treatment approach's social part. However, despite the claim of being biopsychosocial, the area of family involvement in the treatment of CNCP remains underexplored in research. For a condition with such widespread consequences as CNCP,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,6–16]</u></a></sup> where the cessation of symptoms with available treatment is limited,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> it is essential to investigate interventions with the potential to increase management and well-being for both patients and family members. With this trial, we make an initial step to fill the research gap regarding the benefits of family involvement. We know that FSN has been useful in other illness areas, but to our knowledge, we are the first to investigate whether an intervention based on the FSN framework will have a positive effect on this population. Thus, the study will contribute with vital knowledge regarding the effect of this specific method on the performance of involvement and create a research starting point into the role of the family in its wide-ranging sense. According to the FSN framework, FNC will support a change in the patients and family members, restricting illness beliefs, helping them to find new ways to handle everyday life with CNCP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[47,49]</u></a></sup> A change in restricting illness beliefs is assumed to be reflected as a change in GSE, referring to confidence in one's coping ability in demanding or novel situations, such as illness.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[80]</u></a></sup> Thus, GSE is considered to be a relevant primary outcome.\n\nThis trial is the first sub-study in an overall mixed-methods study,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[98–100]</u></a></sup> aiming to explore the impact of family involvement through an intervention with FNC. The second sub-study, a phenomenological hermeneutical study, will explore, by individual interviews with patients and family members, what the intervention means for the lived lives in families afflicted of CNCP. The findings from this will be merged with the results from the FANCOC-PAIN trial to elaborate on the effect of the intervention.\n\nThe planned intervention with FNC differs from usual nursing practice. According to Kitson et al, it is evident that clinical nurses use less time to address the patient's psychosocial and existential problems than on traditional tasks, such as medication.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[101]</u></a></sup> At the MPC, the nurses’ primary job currently is to adjust the patients’ analgesic treatment. By embarking on an FSN approach, the focus will be on the family's interaction. Among health professionals specialised within CNCP, concerns about being qualified to involve family members have been identified.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u></a></sup> The nurses may be worried about their competencies and the implication for their daily work. Thus, the facilitation of the intervention is expected to constitute a complex process. Since the intervention's outcome depends on the involved nurses’ performance, a particular focus on their process is required.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[102–105]</u></a></sup> Therefore, a third longitudinal qualitative descriptive sub-study will conduct focus-group interviews with the nurses before their training, pre-intervention and after the intervention is completed. The findings from the first and second focus-group interview will contribute to mould the intervention. Overall barriers and facilitators regarding learning and conducting FNC will be illuminated and reveal vital patterns in facilitating complex interventions depending on human acts. If it turns out that the intervention is effective and valuable for patients with CNCP and their selected family members and feasible to learn and put into practice for nurses in a clinical setting, it may be implemented as standardised helpful nursing practice. In that case, the findings from sub-study three may guide implementation, thus strengthening the utility of the trial results and the entire study.\n\n9 Dissemination\n---------------\n\nThe trial results will be published in a scientific international peer-reviewed journal and be disseminated to patients suffering from CNCP through relevant patient organisations. The reporting will strive to meet the recommendations in the CONSORT 2010 checklist.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[106]</u></a></sup>\n\n10 Ethics approval and consent to participate\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe study will follow the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[107]</u></a></sup> The Committees on Health Research Ethics in the Capital Region of Denmark approved the study (recording number: H-19016896), as did the Danish Data Protection Agency (j.nr. P-2019–508). The participants will receive written and oral information about the project. Informed written consent will be obtained. Data will be anonymised throughout the analysis process and in reporting the results. The aim is to include a maximum of three family members for each patient, but if this forces the patient to choose between the family members, the number may be increased.\n\n11 Consent for publication\n--------------------------\n\nThe first author will obtain written consent from both patients and family members. The consent form will follow the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics guidelines. The participants are asked to sign if they agree that they have received adequate written and oral information about the study's aim, method, advantages, and disadvantages of accepting participation. Furthermore, that they agree with the abovementioned precautions if the PROM scores demand an immediate response. This trial does not involve collecting biological specimens for storage. However, patients from the intervention group are asked to permit the use of their data in case of withdrawal from the trial. The informed consent forms are available from the corresponding author on request.\n\n12 Availability of data and materials\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe datasets generated during the current study are not available due to the General Data Protection Regulation but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe are very grateful for the allocated fundings from the Novo Nordic Foundation, the Dagmar Marshall Foundation and the Danish Nurses Organisations Research Foundation. We want to thank the Department of Anaesthesia, Pain and Respiratory Support for supporting the trial and the MPC for hosting it. We especially want to acknowledge the nurses at the MPC for their willingness to take on the role. We are grateful that Associate Professor Birte Oestergaard and Associate Professor Barbara Voltelen, as experts in the area, agree to be at our disposal while learning the essence of FSN.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nThe author group consists of health professionals with substantial research resources within pain, nursing, and family involvement, ensuring scientific depth and high quality.

However, _Nocardia_ species in routine aerobic cultures usually require 5 to 21 days for growth, resulting in delayed diagnosis and poor prognosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Therefore, a correct diagnosis of _Nocardia_ meningitis in immunocompetent patients is challenging.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup>\n\nWe report our experience with a case of _Nocardia_ meningitis that was not accurately diagnosed before death. Of note, the patient developed multiple folliculitis on his face and neck a few days before the headache with meningeal irritation onset. The autopsy results are herein reported.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 64-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with a fever that had developed 7 days earlier. His comorbidity was aortic stenosis. He had no history of immunosuppressive conditions, including diabetes mellitus and head trauma.\n\nOn physical examination, his vital signs showed that body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were 37.5°C, 136/75 mmHg, 85 beats/min, and 97% in room air, respectively. Skin examination showed multiple folliculitis on his face and neck , which had developed 2 days earlier. Laboratory results were as follows: C-reactive protein (CRP), 19.38 mg/dL (normal range, 0–0.14 mg/dL); hemoglobin, 13.9 g/dL (normal range, 11.6–14.8 g/dL); white blood cell count, 15,080/μL (normal range, 3300–8600/μL) (neutrophils 85.2%, lymphocytes 6.6%, eosinophils 0%); and platelet count, 262 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL (normal range, 158–348 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL). Renal and liver function tests were unremarkable. Serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgG4 were normal. Autoimmune antibodies, including antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, anti-SSA antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase antibody, were negative. The serum procalcitonin (PCT) level was within the normal limit. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (including head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis) revealed no remarkable findings. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed pre-existing aortic stenosis but no vegetation. Blood and urine cultures were negative.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nMacroscopic photographs of the skin. Multiple folliculitis on the patient's face (A) and neck (B).</u>\n\nOn day 4 of hospitalization, he developed a diffuse headache with meningeal irritation (nuchal rigidity, jolt accentuation of headache, neck flexion test, and Kernig sign). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a cell count of 1,248/μL (normal range, 0.0–3.3/μL) (polymorphonuclear cells 89.7%, monomorphonuclear cells 10.3%); protein, 67 mg/dL (normal range, 10–40 mg/dL); and glucose, 39 mg/dL (normal range, 50–75 mg/dL) (simultaneous blood glucose, 138 mg/dL). Gram staining and smears for acid-fast bacilli yielded negative results. We could not perform magnetic resonance imaging because of his claustrophobia.\n\nBased on the CSF examination findings and multiple folliculitis on the face and neck, bacterial meningitis or meningeal neuro-Behçet disease was tentatively diagnosed. Thus, we empirically started the patient on meropenem (2 g, every 8 h) and dexamethasone (9 mg, every 8 h). Dexamethasone was administered for 4 days, followed by 50 mg/day of prednisolone. The patient initially responded to treatment with the improvement of fever, headache, and folliculitis. His serum CRP level became normal, and follow-up CSF examination revealed that the cell count also decreased to 373/μL on day 11 of hospitalization. The antibiotics were stopped on day 15 after 12 days of empiric treatment. However, prednisolone was continued but reduced to 20 mg/day, considering the possibility of meningeal neuro-Behçet disease at that time. The cell count in the CSF further decreased to 52/μL on day 26, and the serum levels of CRP and PCT were within normal ranges.\n\nWhile folliculitis considerably improved, the patient's headache did not stop but rather worsened. The CSF examination on day 36 revealed an increased cell count to 1,037/μL, and the next day he suddenly died. Repeated blood and CSF cultures consistently returned negative results during his clinical course.\n\nAfter obtaining written informed consent from the patient's family, an autopsy was performed. Macroscopic examination revealed a cloudy brain stem . Microscopic examination showed extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells in the subarachnoid space, especially the brain stem, cerebellum, whole spinal cord, and cerebral base . In the brain stem and cerebellum, focal infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed in the parenchyma . Gram staining of each tissue revealed delicate, filamentous, branching gram-positive rods , and Kinyoun staining showed acid-fast bacteria , consistent with the features of _Nocardia_ species. No noticeable infectious lesions were observed in the other organs. Autopsy culture of the surface of the brain stem grew _Nocardia_ species. This isolate was not included in a clade of reported _Nocardia_ species based on the BLAST search of the 16S rDNA sequences, and the homology of the type strain _N niigatensis_ W8186 was 98.7% (1454/1473 bp). Thus, we classified the isolate as _Nocardia_ species deposited it as IFM 12203 at the Medical Mycology Research Center, Chiba University, through the National Bio-resource Project, Japan. The final diagnosis was meningitis due to _Nocardia_ species.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nAutopsy findings of the brain. (A) The surface of the brain stem was cloudy.

(D) Kinyoun staining shows thin long branching acid-fast filaments (400 × ).</u>\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nWe encountered a case of undiagnosed _Nocardia_ meningitis before death. The autopsy revealed extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells in the subarachnoid space, especially the brain stem, cerebellum, whole spinal cord, and cerebral base, where _Nocardia_ species were detected.\n\nOur case was not immunocompromised, and the route of infection was unknown.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, 11 _Nocardia_ meningitis cases in immunocompetent individuals have been reported (cases with CNS trauma and procedures were excluded). Twelve cases, including our case, are summarized in Table 1. The mean age of the patients was 39.4 years, with only 1 female and 11 males. CSF findings of the cases presented with bacterial meningitis patterns, such as neutrophilic pleocytosis, elevated protein level, and low glucose level in the CSF. The most frequently isolated species was _N asteroids_, which is known as the most common _Nocardia_ species in human _Nocardia_ infections.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Almost a third (33%) of the patients presumably developed meningitis as secondary infection disseminated from respiratory infection sites. The remaining (67%) patients did not have obvious infection sites other than the CNS lesions, suggesting that _Nocardia_ meningitis developed as the primary infection. The overall mortality rate of the 12 cases was 41.7%. Bross et al reviewed 28 cases of _Nocardia_ meningitis and reported that the mortality rate was 57%, in which both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients were included.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Therefore, _Nocardia_ meningitis has been shown to result in poor prognosis regardless of immune status.\n\nTable 1 - Clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcome in immunocompetent patients with _Nocardia_ meningitis.\n\n| Reference (yr) | Age (yr), sex | CSF culture | Time to positivity of CSF culture | Species | Portal of entry | CSF cell count (/μL) | poly: mono (%) | CSF glucose (mg/dL) | Simultaneous blood glucose (mg/dL) | CSF protein (mg/dL) | Outcome |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jacobson 通用删除7(英):<u>(1948)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> | 28, F | Positive | 7 d | _N asteroides_ | Unknown | 4790 | 83:17 | undetectable | NA | NA | Survived |\n| Gilligan 通用删除7(英):<u>(1962)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> | 32, M | Positive | 12 d | _N asteroides_ | Lung | 4000 | NA | 35 | NA | 80 | Expired |\n| Carlile 通用删除7(英):<u>(1963)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> | 7, M | Negative |  | _N asteroides_ | Lung | 936 | 87:13 | 15 | NA | 300 | Expired |\n| Richter 通用删除7(英):<u>(1968)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> | 39, M | Positive | 8 d | _N asteroides_ | Unknown | 200 | 60:40 | 45 | NA | 137 | Survived |\n| Lope ES 通用删除7(英):<u>(1977)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> | 51, M | Negative |  | _N asteroides_ | Unknown | 750 | NA | NA | NA | NA | Survived |\n| Norden 通用删除7(英):<u>(1983)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> | 49, M | Negative |  | _N asteroides_ | Lung | 800 | 96:4 | 60 | NA | 93 | Survived |\n| AL Soub 通用删除7(英):<u>(2007)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> | 45, M | Positive | NA | _Nocardia_ sp. | Unknown | 1350 | 40:60 | 32.4 | 82.8 | 250 | Survived |\n| Kandasamy 通用删除7(英):<u>(2008)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> | 43, M | NA |  | _N farcinica_ | Unknown | NA | NA | NA | NA | NA | Survived |\n| Beuret 通用删除7(英):<u>(2015)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> | 51, M | NA |  | _N farcinica_ | Unknown | NA | NA | NA | NA | NA | Expired |\n| Senard 通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u> | 12, M | Positive | 48 h | _N elegans/aobensis/africana_ complex | Lung | 50 | 40:60 | 7.2 | NA | 700 | Expired |\n| Moniuszko 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> | 52, M | Positive | NA | _N farcinica_ | Unknown | 2240 | NA | 13 | NA | 1609 | Survived |\n| our case | 64, M | Negative |  | _Nocardia_ sp. | Unknown | 1248 | 90:10 | 39 | 138 | 67 | Expired |\n\nCSF = cerebrospinal fluid. F = female, M = male.\n\nIn our case, consecutive culture examinations were negative. In Table 1, six of 12 _Nocardia_ meningitis cases were diagnosed based on the positive results of the CSF culture. In the other 6 cases, CSF culture tests were negative in 4; thus, the 6 cases were diagnosed as _Nocardia_ meningitis based on cerebral abscess, meningeal tissues, and lung abscess cultures. This shows that identifying _Nocardia_ in CSF is difficult; and even when detected, a long culture time, usually over a week, is required . _Nocardia_ species are relatively slow-growing bacteria; therefore, they can be undetectable in routine microbiological examinations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup>\n\nOur patient's serum PCT levels did not increase, which also hindered accurate diagnosis. PCT is a protein of 116 amino acids produced by C-cells of the thyroid gland in healthy individuals.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> In inflammatory conditions, PCT is produced by liver, kidney, fat, and muscle cells in response to toxic metabolite from microbes (e.g. lipopolysaccharide) or inflammatory mediators (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u></a></sup> Serum PCT levels are usually elevated in sepsis, especially bacterial sepsis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> However, no increase is usually observed in viral or fungal infections.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u></a></sup> Thus, it has been proposed that bacterial meningitis can be ruled out when serum PCT level is within normal limit.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> In nocardiosis, it was reported that serum PCT levels may be normal or increase slightly even in active nocardiosis patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Therefore, nocardiosis cannot be ruled out based on the normal PCT range.\n\nA unique clinical feature in our case is that multiple folliculitis on his face and neck appeared a few days before the onset of headache with meningeal irritation. This prompted the possibility of meningeal neuro-Behçet disease as a differential diagnosis in this patient. Mucocutaneous manifestations, including multiple folliculitis, are very common in Behçet disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Neuro-Behçet disease occurs in 3.7% to 7.5% of patients with Behçet disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> It presents as aseptic meningitis but can demonstrate neutrophilic pleocytosis in the CSF.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> In addition, serum PCT levels are not elevated in active Behçet disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup>\n\nGiven the very close timing of _Nocardia_ meningitis and multiple folliculitis onset, the most reasonable possibility is to diagnose disseminated nocardiosis. Regrettably, we were unaware of this before the patient's death. The skin is an important lesion site in nocardiosis, along with the CNS and lungs. Manifestations of primary cutaneous nocardiosis include folliculitis or carbuncles.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> Disseminated nocardiosis can present with cutaneous skin lesions, which may be the first sign of the disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Thus, the patient's folliculitis pus should have been cultured, and if we had done so, an early diagnosis might have been made.\n\nIn this case, antimicrobial agents were administered for 12 days, as described in the case presentation. The optimum antimicrobial therapy duration for acute bacterial meningitis is unknown. In the absence of controlled clinical trials in adults, the recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is based on current clinical practice. In the European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines, antimicrobials use for 10–14 days is recommended for unspecified bacterial meningitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> However, the appropriate antimicrobial therapy duration for bacterial meningitis should depend on the causative pathogen. For nocardiosis involving CNS, treatment duration is not specified; some studies have suggested a significantly longer period, perhaps a year or more.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,19,20]</u></a></sup>\n\nNocardiosis is not easily diagnosed because of difficulties in microbiological examination. In immunocompetent individuals, nocardiosis may not usually be considered. Our case findings suggested the need to consider disseminated nocardiosis when patients present meningitis with skin infection lesions, such as folliculitis.\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment\n--------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Masaki Ishimatsu (Department of Clinical Laboratory, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan) for the microbiological analyses and useful discussions.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Conceptualization:** Shintaro Yamamoto, Shunichi Fujita, Tomoyuki Mukai, Yoshitaka Morita.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Data curation:** Shintaro Yamamoto, Shunichi Fujita, Hirotake Nishimura, Takashi Yaguchi.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Supervision:** Tomoyuki Mukai, Yoshitaka Morita.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Writing – original draft:** Shintaro Yamamoto, Tomoyuki Mukai, Yoshitaka Morita.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Writing – review & editing:** Shintaro Yamamoto, Tomoyuki Mukai, Shunichi Fujita, Hirotake Nishimura, Takashi Yaguchi, Yoshitaka Morita.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:17:15", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:17:34", "cost": 18.726}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:17:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:17:14"}

Case presentation\n---------------------\n\nThe patient’s written consent was obtained to participate at this research, as well as formal ethical approval from the institutional review board at the institution where the patient was observed and treated. Demographic and historical data were changed to protect patient anonymity without compromising the clinical picture.\n\nThe patient was interviewed twice. The first interview took place on the 18th of January 2021, when her obstetrician referred her because of an FOC. During her first visit, she was seen by a consultant psychiatrist specializing in women’s mental health and was diagnosed with tokophobia and major depressive disorder.\n\nThe second interview took place 8 months later. During this visit, in addition to the clinical interview, different aspects of her mental health were assessed: overall depression, perinatal depression, generalized anxiety, maternal functioning, and FOC. Arabic-language versions of all assessment tools were used. We personally translated the Barkin Index of Maternal Functioning (BIMF).\n\n### 2.1. Translation of the BIMF\n\nThe BIMF was translated in accordance with the Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research Principles of Good Practice issued by the Translation and Cultural Adaptation Group number one. We obtained permission from the developer of the BIMF, Dr Barkin, to translate and use this instrument. Forward translation was performed independently by 2 bilingual physicians: a consultant psychiatrist (Dr S.F.) and a psychiatry resident (Dr L.K.). A meeting was held for their discussion, with the mediation of a third, bilingual consultant psychiatrist (Dr W.K.). During this meeting, a third version, provided by Dr Barkin and produced by Morningside Translation number two, was used for input. Any discrepancies in the 3 versions were discussed until a consensus was reached for all items.\n\nThe resulting Arabic version was proofread by an Arabic-language specialist (A.A.). Subsequently, a back-translation was performed by a professional translator (S.B.), followed by a review discussion with Drs W.K. and M.H. (another bilingual psychiatrist). This review was performed to consider any differences between the back-translation and original English version. This input was used to generate a more accurate Arabic version of the BIMF.\n\nSubsequently, a cognitive debriefing of the Arabic version was performed. This step involved testing the instrument on a small, representative group of individuals to test alternative wording and determine the understandability, interpretation, and cultural sensitivity of the translation. Dr M.H. performed this step with a group of eight mothers who resembled the target study population. An interactive discussion with these mothers provided information that was taken into account and incorporated into the final version of the index.\n\nFinally, the Arabic index was reviewed, proofread, and finalized by Dr W.K. This translation and cultural adaptation were shared and discussed with Dr Barkin. It is important to note that a semantic, rather than literal, translation was used to reflect the meaning behind each statement, ensuring that the Arabic translation was linguistically appropriate. The main adaptations are presented below.\n\nItem 7: “I am comfortable allowing a trusted friend or relative to care for my baby (can include baby’s father or partner).” The words “or partner” were not included in the Arabic version, as, in the target population (Saudi Arabic, highly religious), children are only born in wedlock, and mothers’ partners would only be husbands or ex-husbands. Therefore, the phrase “or partner” would be perceived as confusing or offensive.\n\nItem 10: “I trust my feelings (instincts) when taking care of my baby.” The word “maternal” was added before “instincts,” as, in the Arabic language, the word “instincts” alone carries a meaning closer to “drives” and would not accurately convey the meaning of the question.\n\nItem 20: “I am satisfied with the job I am doing as a new mother.” The phrase “recently delivering mother” is preferable in Arabic to the literal translation, “new mother,” which conveys the meaning of “first-time mother.”\n\n### 2.2. Interview process\n\nBoth authors (a consultant psychiatrist specializing in women’s mental health, and a medical student) were present during the second interview after getting ethical approval and patient consent, they were available to clarify any questions regarding the scales. The patient was asked to complete each measure twice: once to capture her current state of mind (7 months postpartum) and once as a retrospective measure to capture her state of mind during her previous visit (while she was pregnant).\n\nThe Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure the severity of depression symptoms following childbirth,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>26</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> along with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>27</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale was used to determine her level of anxiety.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>28</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In addition, the BIMF was used to estimate her maternal functioning in the year after childbirth,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>29</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> and the FOC visual analog scale (FOC scale) was used to assess her fear of delivery.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>30</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe EPDS is a ten-item, self-report measure designed to detect depression symptoms in postpartum women based on their mood during the previous 7 days.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>26</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The EPDS has been adopted both in research and clinical settings and is available in 57 languages.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>31</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The PHQ-9 is a 9-item scale, widely used to screen for depression.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>27</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> It is a dual-purpose instrument that can be used to screen for depression and to assess the severity of depression symptoms.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>27</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> It is also useful for monitoring the outcomes of depression therapy.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>27</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The GAD-7 is used to evaluate the severity of anxiety symptoms during the previous 2 weeks.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>28</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Studies have revealed that it is associated with depression, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and the demographic risk factors of generalized anxiety disorder.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>28</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The BIMF is a 20-item, self-report measure of overall maternal functioning in the year following delivery.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>29</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The score is obtained as the sum of the 20 items (items 16 and 18 are reverse-coded), and the total score ranges from 0 to 120, with higher scores indicating higher functioning.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>29</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The BIMF was completed only once, to reflect the patient’s postpartum state, as it is not applicable during pregnancy.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>29</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The FOC scale is a 2-item, visual analog scale used to measure concerns related to delivery.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>30</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Roche et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>32–36</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> were the first to propose it as a viable measure of FOC; visual analog scales are more commonly used to assess other emotions.\n\nAt the FOC scale, the participant was asked to rate her feelings about the impending birth by responding to the question, “How do you feel right now about the approaching birth?” She responded by placing a mark on two 10-cm lines with the following 2 anchor words: “calm/worried” and “no fear/strong fear.”删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>37</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> For the FOC scale, the patient was asked to rate how she felt during her last visit and just before her delivery.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>37</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\n### 2.3. First visit\n\nMs. Arwa (a pseudonym) first visited our clinic as a 43-year-old married woman. At the time, she had been pregnant for eight weeks. This was her fifth pregnancy. She had 4 healthy children, aged between 10 and 24 years, and no history of miscarriage or abortion. Ms. Arwa had a degree in education and had previously worked in the academic sector but was currently staying at home as a housewife. She was from a middle class family; her husband worked in the health sector.\n\nMs. Arwa was referred to the psychiatry outpatient clinic by her obstetrician because of depression symptoms and fear of pregnancy and childbirth. These symptoms started 4 weeks before her first visit, as soon as she learned that she was pregnant. The fifth pregnancy had been unplanned; initially, she had trouble accepting it, remaining in a state of denial about her pregnancy for several weeks.\n\nUpon being interviewed by the consultant psychiatrist, the patient reported symptoms of depression, including low mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. In addition, she slept less than normal and had a decreased appetite. She admitted that she secretly wished that she would miscarry but that she had no intention of actively harming herself or the fetus.\n\nMs. Arwa also described a fear of labor, and, more specifically, the fear of being exposed, the lack of control, and the lack of privacy during labor. She requested a cesarean section (CS), which she felt offered more control, dignity, and privacy. She expressed fear that her mental state was harming her baby. She longed for the baby to be delivered as soon as possible, to stop this perceived harm.\n\nMs. Arwa stated that she experienced no other social or health-related stressors and that she had the support of her husband and family. Her relationship with her husband seemed to be good. Indeed, he was present for a portion of the evaluation and supported anything that would benefit his wife’s mental and psychological health.\n\nIn terms of Ms. Arwa’s past perinatal mental health history, she declared that she had not experienced psychological, physical, or sexual trauma of note in the past. However, she admitted to having been very uncomfortable during her first pelvic exam at the age of 20, and during all subsequent pelvic exams, and she recalls crying and being distressed.\n\nIt appears that Ms. Arwa had a traumatic experience during her first delivery. She reported that she had not been prepared for the experience. She experienced several aspects as traumatic and invasive, including the presence of multiple medical staff in the room, the position she had to assume during labor, and the physical exposure.\n\nMs. Arwa also seemed to have experienced mild depression during her third and fourth pregnancies. She reported symptoms of low mood, a passive desire that the pregnancies would not continue, and regretting being pregnant. She said she hated her appearance when she was pregnant, e.g. she felt that she had gained too much weight. The depressive episodes resolved spontaneously after delivery without the aid of a psychiatrist or medication. She stated that she did not experience any postnatal depression or anxiety after any of the deliveries.\n\nIn terms of her general psychiatric history, Ms. Arwa reported that she had never visited the emergency room or been admitted to the hospital for mental health-related reasons. She had never visited a psychiatrist, taken psychotropic medications, or undergone psychotherapy.\n\nIn terms of Ms. Arwa’s obstetric history, her age of menarche was 15 years and she had a regular menstrual cycle. All four of her previous pregnancies were normal, without complications. She delivered full-term babies via spontaneous vaginal delivery. All her babies were healthy, with no need for observation or admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, and they were discharged along with their mother. She had breastfed all her babies without complications.\n\nMs. Arwa’s first 4 pregnancies were planned. She used oral contraceptive pills after the third pregnancy for 5 years, and again for 5 years after her fourth pregnancy. After that, she had an intrauterine device inserted for 5 years. By the time it was removed, she believed that she would not need contraception at her age. Her last (current) pregnancy was a surprise. Of note, Ms. Arwa enjoyed motherhood and her children overall, and reported that, if she were not so afraid of childbirth, she would have had more children.\n\nMs. Arwa had no other relevant medical or surgical history. Moreover, there was no family history of psychiatric disorders.\n\nDuring Ms. Arwa’s first visit, her vital signs and the results of routine investigations and physical examinations were normal. She was a tidy, cooperative lady with an average build. During the examination of her mental status, she was visibly pregnant and displayed an average level of grooming and hygiene. We detected no disturbances in her orientation or memory. Her mood was sad, and her affect was depressed and tearful. She had thoughts of hopelessness and worthlessness, and feelings of guilt. She displayed excessive anxiety about the delivery and the health of her fetus, without expressing thoughts of suicide or of harming others. She spoke with a normal rate, rhythm, volume, and tone. Moreover, there were no indications of formal thought disorder, abnormal behavior, or abnormal perception, and her insight and judgment were intact.\n\n### 2.4. Management plan\n\nAfter consultation with Ms. Arwa, her husband, and her obstetrician, she was diagnosed with a major depressive episode and tokophobia. The collaborative care plan involved support and education. Psychotherapy was recommended, but the waitlist at the institution was very long. Ms. Arwa did not want to take medication for fear of harming the fetus. It was collaboratively agreed that a CS was indicated in her case, as her obstetric risk was low, she did not plan to have any more children, and, in her mind, this was the only thing that would ease her anxiety and make her feel in control of her body and her dignity.\n\n### 2.5. Second visit\n\nAs the first evaluation occurred during the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and clinics were closed for a portion of the year, we could not perform close psychiatric follow-up during the rest of her pregnancy and immediately after delivery. However, eight months after the delivery, the second evaluation was performed. At that time, Ms. Arwa reported that she had no symptoms of depression or anxiety and that she was bonding well with her baby. In fact, she reported feeling considerably better since the decision to undergo a CS was made, and that she returned to her baseline state immediately after the delivery.\n\nDuring the second visit, Ms. Arwa had a bright, reactive affect and euthymic mood, and she came across as substantially different than during her first visit. As mentioned in the methodology section, during the second visit, she completed several scales to indicate her levels of anxiety, depression, and FOC; the scores are provided in Table 1 and Figure 1. There was a marked reduction in her GAD, PHQ-9, EPDS, and FOC scores. This indicated a reduction in anxiety, depression, and FOC. Her postpartum BIMF score indicated positive maternal functioning.\n\nTable 1 - Patient scores for various scales.\n\n|  | First visit | Second visit |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| EPDS | 27, indicating severe depression | 9, indicating mild depression |\n| PHQ-9 | 19, indicating moderately severe depression | 3, indicating minimal depression |\n| GAD7 | 21, indicating severe anxiety | 3, indicating minimal anxiety |\n| BIMF | Not applicable during pregnancy | 108, indicating high maternal functioning |\n| FOC visual analog scale | 10 for both worry and fear, indicating high worry and fear\\* | 0 for worry and 5 for fear, indicating low worry and moderate fear |\n\nBIMF = Barkin Index of Maternal Functioning, EPDS = Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, FOC = Fear of Childbirth, GAD7 = 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PHQ-9 = Patient Health Questionnaire-9.\n\n<sup>*</sup>Here, column 2 in FOC visual analog scale indicates her feelings on the day of her scheduled C-section, not her second clinic visit.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nFear of childbirth scale.</u>\n\n### 2.6. Management after the second visit\n\nMs. Arwa was discharged from the psychiatric clinic as she felt well and did not need therapy or medication. For contraception, tubal ligation was performed during CS, with her prior consent.\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nThis case report describes a patient with tokophobia, including her presentation, risk factors, comorbidities, treatment, and evolution of symptoms. As discussed earlier, there are 2 types of tokophobia: primary and secondary. Ms. Arwa had secondary tokophobia as she had no problems during her first pregnancy and only developed an FOC after her traumatic experience during her first delivery. Her experience is not uncommon, as secondary tokophobia has been reported by many parous women who have experienced traumatic delivery.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>38</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nMs. Arwa reported that the most disturbing elements in her experience were the loss of privacy in the delivery room, the feelings of shame, and the loss of control. These are common themes described by other women, similar to neglect during delivery, poor communication, loss of autonomy, and inadequately resourced health systems, which lead to loss of privacy during delivery.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>39</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However previous experiences seem to remain etched on the mother’s mind and leave scars in the shape of fear, anxiety, a lack of faith in their ability to give birth, and diminished trust in maternity care. This can contribute to the development of a deep FOC.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>40</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nIn addition to the traumatic experience of her first delivery, Ms. Arwa had several risk factors and comorbidities associated with the development of tokophobia. The fifth pregnancy was unplanned, which may be strongly associated with the FOC, as discovered in studies in different countries in Europe and Asia.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>41–44</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> This may be due to increased stress among women with an unplanned pregnancy; unplanned pregnancy may mean the woman has other life plans, which can understandably increase the degree of fear among these women.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>45</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nAt her first assessment, Ms. Arwa experienced symptoms of perinatal depression and considerable anxiety. The relationship between mental disorders and tokophobia is complex.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>46–48</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Several studies have revealed a connection between an FOC and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and bipolar disorder.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>46–48</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In 1 study, depression and anxiety disorders were twice as common among women who had an FOC during pregnancy than among those who did not.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>49</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Other studies revealed that anxiety and depression were risk factors for tokophobia.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10–12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>14–16</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Moreover, depression can reinforce the FOC during pregnancy.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>50</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nIt is difficult to determine causality or whether the above are risk factors or general associations. In the case of Ms. Arwa, she only developed psychiatric symptoms after learning that she was pregnant, which suggests that her depression and anxiety were comorbidities or even the results of her FOC, rather than pre-existing risk factors.\n\nRegarding Ms. Arwa’s reaction to the pregnancy, she considered termination and expressed a strong desire for delivery by CS, both of which are commonly reported reactions by women with tokophobia.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>51</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In 1 study, 19.1% of pregnant women with an FOC in Western countries preferred to have a non-medically indicated CS as a solution to their problem.\\[通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>52</a></sup></u>\\] Such requests are often motivated by a desire to protect oneself against the pain of labor and to rather place the overall responsibility for the course of the labor on the medical staff.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>44</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe treatment for tokophobia plays a role in the reduction of the pregnant woman’s fear.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>49</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>51</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>53–55</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The treatment provided in this case involved education, reassurance, and collaboration across disciplines and with the family. The literature advises the creation of a preventive and supportive environment. A multidisciplinary approach and interdisciplinary cooperation among all healthcare providers involved in this process are required.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>56</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nMs. Arwa was referred to a professional psychologist for therapy to help her overcome her FOC. However, she did not access this service because of long waiting lists and the closure of many clinics during the pandemic. Psychological intervention is considered a first-line treatment option for mild to moderate depression; if a woman is experiencing a moderate to severe depressive episode or has a history of moderate to severe recurrent depression, the guidelines published by the American Psychiatric Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend initiation of antidepressant medication.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>57</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Considerations in the recommendation of psychotherapy include the patient’s willingness, access to skilled practitioners, and financial accessibility. Pregnant patients are likely to prefer psychotherapy over medication.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>58</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nDespite some controversy and risks, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have high safety profiles, are commonly used during pregnancy, and are associated with a low risk of teratogenicity.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>59</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Antidepressant medication was discussed as an option for Ms. Arwa. However, she was not open to taking antidepressant medications to alleviate her symptoms of depression and anxiety because of her beliefs about medication and her fear of harming the fetus.\n\nMs. Arwa’s treatment also involved the collaborative decision to perform a CS after her informed consent was obtained and after thorough discussion with her obstetrician and husband. On the 1 hand, obstetricians try to restrict the reversion to CS to minimize the complications of operative delivery,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>60</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> and the financial cost of CS also has to be taken into account.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>61</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> On the other hand, just as there are physical indications for CS, there are personal or psychological indications; the patient’s anxiety and fear may influence and inform an obstetrician’s decision to perform a CS.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>62</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Indeed, according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, tokophobia is considered an indication for elective CS.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>62</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nIt is worth noting that Ms. Arwa reported symptomatic relief after her first visit to the psychiatrist and further relief after her visit with her obstetrician once the collaborative decision to perform a CS was made. Full symptomatic recovery was achieved immediately after delivery, and she did not require any further postoperative intervention.\n\nThis study has some limitations. First, some of the data collected for the questionnaires were retrospective and were subject to recall bias. However, clinical assessments, the gold standard in clinical diagnosis, were performed in real time at 2 separate appointments. Thus, the scores from the questionnaires simply serve to confirm the clinical impression and to provide a quantitative reference point.\n\nCase reports cannot be used to draw a strong conclusion about assessment and management, but they nevertheless provide an in-depth analysis of a particular case and suggest a framework or approach in terms of how to address rare clinical cases. More research is required to study the prevalence of tokophobia in pregnant women.\n\nIn conclusion, we presented a case report of a woman with tokophobia, and discussed risk factors, comorbidities, and possible treatments, in the attempt to increase clinical awareness of the assessment and management of this disorder, which remains a relatively new concept and understudied.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Investigation:** Wid Kattan.\n\n**Methodology:** Wid Kattan, Rahaf Albarraq.\n\n**Supervision:** Wid Kattan, Rahaf Albarraq.\n\n**Validation:** Wid Kattan.\n\n**Visualization:** Wid Kattan, Rahaf Albarraq.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Wid Kattan, Rahaf Albarraq.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Wid Kattan, Rahaf Albarraq.\n\nCorrection\n----------\n\nOn page 5, the reference citation 68 has been corrected to 52.

Introduction\n----------------\n\nA chronic illness known as overactive bladder (OAB) is characterized by symptoms of the lower urinary tract that include urgency, frequency, and nocturia.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Urge incontinence may also occur. The cholinergic and muscarinic receptors are strongly related to OAB. The primary contractile neurotransmitter in the human bladder detrusor muscle is acetylcholine, and muscarinic receptor antagonists like oxybutynin, tolterodine, trospium chloride, darifenacin, solifenacin, and propiverine work by competitively inhibiting acetylcholine’s binding to muscarinic receptors on detrusor smooth muscle cells and other bladder wall structures.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nTo treat the symptoms of OAB, the antimuscarinic medication propiverine, a benzilic acid derivative, has a mixed mode of action.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Propiverine inhibits calcium influx and modifies intracellular calcium, which reduces muscle spasms in the smooth muscle of the bladder, where it blocks muscarinic receptors to lower bladder contractility.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nAntimuscarinic medications lack muscarinic receptor specificity. The vast range of side effects with these medications is also mainly explained by the widespread distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes (M1–M5) in the central nervous system (CNS) and the rest of the body.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> A few of the CNS consequences are agitation, confusion, delirium, falls, hallucinations, cognitive impairment, sleepiness, dizziness, and exhaustion.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nSome case studies link the use of oxybutynin and tolterodine with memory loss and cognitive impairment.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> There are also a few reports that link anticholinergic drugs with hallucinations and psychotic symptoms. For instance, oral oxybutynin, tolterodine, and solifenacin use have all been linked to reports of hallucinations and psychotic episodes. However, these episodes are mostly associated with delirium and confusion.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nDespite the above-mentioned studies, little is known about how anticholinergic drugs, particularly propiverine, might cause visual hallucinations. We were unable to locate any reports of visual hallucinations brought on by propiverine without cognitive dysfunction.\n\nIn this case report, we describe a man who used propiverine capsules at therapeutic doses and had visual hallucinations without delirium or disorientation.\n\n2\\. Case presentation\n---------------------\n\nA 62-year-old male patient who presented to the urology outpatient clinic with complaints of urinary incontinence was treated by a urologist with propiverine capsules at 30 mg/day. One week later, the individual again presented to the urology outpatient clinic because he was experiencing visual hallucinations. On physical examination at the urology outpatient clinic, his general condition was good, he was conscious, his blood pressure was 110/80 mm Hg, his pulse rate was 85/min, his respiratory rate was 23/min, his pupils were isochoric, and a normal sinus rhythm was noted on the electrocardiogram. No medications other than propiverine capsules were taken. Complete blood count and biochemical parameters were within normal range. The patient was then referred to the psychiatric outpatient clinic by the urologist. On mental status examination, the patient was conscious, cooperative, and oriented. He described visual hallucinations of geometric shapes and various animal images that lasted most of the day. Because of these images, which began 3 days after ingestion of the propiverine capsule and continued for 4 days, his mood was partly anxious. Except for the visual hallucinations, no perceptual disturbance was noted. His cognitive functions were normal. His mini-mental test score was 27. No abnormalities were noted on routine physical examination, blood chemistry, endocrinology, or brain examinations cranial tomography and electroencephalogram (EEG). He had no history of psychiatric illness. There were no known psychiatric disorders in his family.\n\nDue to the close temporal association of visual hallucinations with the initiation of propiverine, we recommended discontinuation of treatment. The patient’s visual hallucinations disappeared 3 days after the treatment was stopped. Eventually, he returned to his premorbid level of functioning. The patient was referred to the urology outpatient clinic for re-treatment of his urinary incontinence with recommendations. We obtained a written informed consent form from the patient for this case study.\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nAn anticholinergic medication must also be able to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and act centrally to impair cognitive function.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The range of negative effects on the CNS caused by anticholinergic drugs includes situations from sleepiness to hallucinations, severe cognitive decline, and even coma.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nPropiverine is regarded as an antimuscarinic drug that has little blood–brain barrier penetration rate.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> As a result, fewer adverse effects on the central nervous system are expected when compared to other antimuscarinic drugs.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe absence of a history of mental illness in the patient, the onset of visual hallucinations concurrent with propiverine use and rapid regression after drug discontinuation, and the lack of an organic cause in brain imaging and electrophysiological tests all pointed to propiverine as the likely cause of the visual hallucinations. The probability of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) was assessed for causality using the Naranjo scale and was evaluated at 6 points. This result is consistent with a probable ADR.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nTo our knowledge, our case study is the first report that a patient experienced pure visual hallucinations without delirium or confusion during the use of anticholinergic drugs at therapeutic doses. Additionally, this is the first report of psychotic symptoms being linked to propiverine use.\n\nThere are 5 primary subtypes of muscarinic receptors: M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5. The brain expresses all 5 muscarinic receptor subtypes. Most of the M2 and M3 subtypes are found in the detrusor smooth muscle.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The M4 receptor is thought to be involved in regulating the ventral tegmental dopamine neurons to inhibit dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway and lessen psychosis, whereas the M3 receptor is thought to be most significant for detrusor contraction in humans.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Propiverine bound to M1–M5 receptors with the same order of affinity for all 5 subtypes.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe BBB’s permeability is not constant over the course of a person’s life, and several factors, including growing older, taking certain drugs, stress, and several comorbid disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease, can affect how well the BBB functions.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Due to aging-related changes in antimuscarinic receptor number and distribution, BBB permeability, and a variety of prescribed medication metabolisms, older adults have a likely increased risk of experiencing negative antimuscarinic effects.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>17</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Therefore, it should be assumed that all antimuscarinic OAB drugs can pass through the BBB and enter the CNS.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nSeveral anticholinergic risk scores have been developed to help physicians reduce the usage of medications with anticholinergic effects in patients with cognitive impairment.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In elderly patients, a statistically significant increased risk of harmful anticholinergic effects is linked to higher anticholinergic drug scale (ADS) scores.

The subject’s overall score is then calculated by adding the scores for all of the medications they take.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The ADS lists fall, disorientation, and dizziness as central adverse effects, whereas dry mouth, dry eyes, and constipation are peripheral adverse effects.

This situation caused us to interpret the relationship between the drug and the side effect at a probable level and prevented us from establishing a certainty connection.\n\n4\\. Conclusion\n--------------\n\nThe usage of drugs with possible anticholinergic effects should be kept in mind in patients who present to the psychiatry or emergency department and describe visual hallucinations. Healthcare practitioners need to be careful since anticholinergic medications have possible adverse effects. The symptoms might range from mild cognitive impairment and delirium to severe hallucinations without any cognitive loss. Clinical decisions to lessen the anticholinergic burden may be guided by the ADS and tables listing medications with recognized anticholinergic effects. In particular, in older adults, efforts should be made to raise physician awareness of anticholinergic adverse effects.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Mahmut Selçuk.\n\n**Data curation:** Mahmut Selçuk.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Mahmut Selçuk.\n\n**Investigation:** Mahmut Selçuk.\n\n**Methodology:** Mahmut Selçuk.\n\n**Project administration:** Mahmut Selçuk.\n\n**Resources:** Mahmut Selçuk.\n\n**Supervision:** Mahmut Selçuk.\n\n**Validation:** Mahmut Selçuk.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Mahmut Selçuk.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Mahmut Selçuk.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:16:40", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:16:51", "cost": 11.781}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:16:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:16:39"}

Introduction\n----------------\n\nAfter lenvatinib was reported in 2015 to be efficacious for radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) with disease progression,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> real-world treatment outcomes have been reported.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Multi-kinase inhibitors have been added to the conventional postoperative standard of treatment for total thyroidectomy in addition to thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression and RAI therapy.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Although lenvatinib treatment elicits a high response rate and prolongs overall survival and progression-free survival, complete remission is rare. Owing to dose reduction or drug withdrawal caused by adverse effects (AEs), the effect of lenvatinib is not sustained over the long term, and patients die from progressive disease. In other cases, sudden anaplastic transformation and death may occur even if disease control is achieved.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nWe believe that lenvatinib can be used for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) because of its high response rate and rapid therapeutic effects. As a new treatment option, the use of lenvatinib as NAC for inoperable thyroid cancer has not yet been established, and curative surgery should be performed once the tumor shrinks. We reported 1 case of NAC in 2020,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> and presently, we report 5 other cases of patients who received NAC from 2019 to 2021 and included a follow-up of the previously reported case.\n\n2\\. Methods\n-----------\n\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kanagawa Cancer Center (institutional review board approval number 27-61 and 2021-88). All patients provided comprehensive consent, stating that their samples collected for medical examination could be used for investigation and clinical research. All patients provided signed informed consent. Table 1 shows the background and lenvatinib administration status of the 5 patients. We elected to treat the patients with NAC because they had pleural, laryngeal, and esophageal invasion, and radical surgery would have required an extended surgery and increased the possibility of surgical risks. Tumors were observed using ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) scan every 1 to 2 weeks after the start of lenvatinib treatment. Surgery was performed when the tumor had stopped shrinking.\n\nTable 1 - Background of patients who underwent neoadjuvant lenvatinib treatment and surgery.\n\n| Patient information | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age | 75 | 72 | 68 | 61 | 66 |\n| Sex | F | F | M | F | F |\n| Pathology | PTC | PTC | FTC | ATC | PTC/ATC |\n| Body height (cm) | 147.4 | 147 | 182 | 153 | 153.2 |\n| Body weight (kg) | 49 | 39.4 | 935 | 45 | 54.9 |\n| T | 4b | 4a | 4a | 4a | 4a |\n| N | 1b | 1b | 1b | 1b | 1b |\n| Stage | 4b | 3 | 4b | 4c | 4b |\n| Infiltrating organ | Pleura | Larynx | Esophagus | Esophagus | Esophagus |\n| Pulmonary metastasis\\* | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n| Initial dose (mg) | 20 | 14 | 24 | 24 | 24 |\n| Dosing period (mo) | 4.7 | 3.1 | 2.9 | 2.0 | 1.7 |\n| Withdrawal (d) | 7 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 10 |\n| Maximum diameter (mm) | 68 | 35 | 60 | 51 | 43 |\n| Best response (mm) | 47 | 28 | 40 | 30 | 29 |\n| Response | PR | SD | PR | PR | PR |\n| Pre-treatment Tg | 6490 | 16.4 | 3480 | 0.97 | 2.74 |\n| Post-treatment Tg | 952 | 12.9 | 387 | 2.18 | 12.2 |\n| Pre-treatment TgAb | 14 | 143 | 16 | 382 | 51 |\n| Post-treatment TgAb | 10 | 45 | 13 | 365 | 49 |\n| Overall survival (mo) | 26.4 | 11.8 | 4.7 | 6.7 | 3.6 |\n| Life and death† | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| Adverse event |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  Hypertension | 1 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 |\n|  Hand-foot syndrome | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 |\n|  Diarrhea | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n|  Loss of appetite | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n|  Proteinuria | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 |\n|  Fatigue | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n|  Hair loss | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n|  Cavity formation | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 |\n\nATC = anaplastic thyroid cancer, FTC = follicular thyroid cancer, PTC = papillary thyroid cancer, Tg = thyroglobulin (ng/mL), TgAb = thyroglobulin antibody (IU/mL).\n\n\\*Yes = 1, no = 0.\n\n†1 = died, 0 = alive.

The remaining 3 patients were started at 24 mg. The dose was reduced when AEs occurred. AEs were graded from 1 to 5 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 . Treatment response was evaluated using the RECIST criteria .删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> When the tumors that had responded stopped shrinking, the patient underwent surgery with 4- to 7-day preoperative lenvatinib withdrawal. In case 5, during withdrawal due to grade 3 hand–foot syndrome, dyspnea due to bilateral recurrent nerve palsy occurred, and emergency surgery was performed; thus, the withdrawal period for lenvatinib in that case was 10 days.\n\n3\\. Case presentation\n---------------------\n\n### 3\\. 1. Case 1\n\nCase 1 was that of a 75-year-old woman with an unremarkable medical history (height, 147 cm; weight, 49 kg). The patient was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) on thoracoscopic tumor biopsy. This case was previously reported.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> We report the long-term follow-up outcomes in this patient. Postoperatively, the patient was able to lead a normal life with no progression of pulmonary metastasis; however, brain metastasis was observed 3 months after surgery, and the patient was treated with the gamma knife procedure. Brain metastasis gradually increased and progressed, and bone metastasis occurred in the 20th month. The patient had no difficulty in daily life but died from an enlarged brain metastasis at 26.4 months.\n\n### 3\\. 2. Case 2\n\nCase 2 was a 72-year-old woman with a history of diabetes (height, 147 cm; weight, 39 kg). She was diagnosed with PTC based on cytological findings. She had upper airway stenosis and hoarseness, and NAC was initiated to avoid total laryngectomy. Dyspnea resolved, and the tumor shrank; thus, total thyroidectomy was performed, and RAI treatment was administered for the residual tumor in the larynx. However, although no therapeutic effect of RAI was observed, the current status was maintained for 11.8 months, and the patient had no problems with daily living.\n\n### 3\\. 3. Case 3\n\nCase 3 involved a 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension (height, 182 cm; weight, 94 kg). The patient was diagnosed with a follicular neoplasm via cytology. He experienced discomfort when swallowing and had lung metastasis, but the localized tumor was large and had invaded the tracheobronchial region and the esophagus. Therefore, NAC was introduced, and complete local surgical resection was possible after shrinkage was observed. Currently, the patient is undergoing RAI treatment for lung metastasis and has been under follow-up for 4.7 months.\n\n### 3\\. 4. Case 4\n\nCase 4 was that of a 61-year-old woman with an unremarkable medical history (height, 153 cm; weight, 45 kg). The patient was diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) by core-needle biopsy. In this case, esophageal and skin involvement was observed in addition to ATC, and due to a fear of difficulty in oral intake, NAC was performed. The tumor shrank, and surgery was performed. However, during postoperative external-beam radiation, a recurrent mass appeared in the esophagus, which rapidly worsened, and the patient died 6.7 months.\n\n### 3\\. 5. Case 5\n\nCase 5 was that of a 66-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and hypertension (height, 153 cm; weight, 55 kg). She was referred to our hospital because of dysphagia secondary to thyroid cancer. She was diagnosed with PTC by cytology, and NAC was administered to reduce esophageal invasion. Cavity formation occurred, and lenvatinib was withdrawn for 1 week and then resumed at a reduced dose; however, the cavity did not worsen. Pathological results revealed concomitant ATC. After surgery, esophageal infiltration recurred, and the patient experienced difficulty with oral intake; therefore, a gastrostomy tube was inserted.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, NAC resulted in tumor shrinkage in all cases; therefore, surgical resection was preferred over pre-treatment. No serious AEs were observed . Only case 5 showed grade 3 hand–foot syndrome, and lenvatinib was withdrawn 1.7 months after treatment initiation. As shown in Figure 2, the best response was achieved from 1.7 to 4.7 months (average, 2.9 months), and the dose was reduced upon occurrence of AEs; surgery was performed when the shrinkage stopped. Only case 5 underwent emergency surgery for bilateral recurrent nerve palsy. As lenvatinib was not administered after surgery, wound healing was not delayed, and the surgical wound healing process was satisfactory in all 5 patients. The progression of each case is described below.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nCT images (A) before treatment and CT images (B) showing best response after lenvatinib treatment are shown for cases 1 to 5. These images are selected slices in which the largest diameter of the tumor is shown. The area surrounded by the red dotted circle is the targeted tumor. Before treatment, the tumors in these patients were determined to be inoperable, while the post-treatment images show that the lesion is resectable.

In all cases except case 4, the lenvatinib dose was reduced due to AEs. Case 5 withdrew due to grade 3 cavity formation and HFS. Therefore, the lenvatinib effect did not continue, and surgery was performed when the red arrow indicated that further reduction was not expected. Patient 4 did not require a dose reduction, but surgery was performed because the reduction in tumor size stopped after 2.1 mo. Thereafter, gamma knife therapy was performed in case 1 for brain metastasis, and external-beam radiation was performed in case 4, but both patients died from their current disease. Cases 2, 3, and 5 are still alive. AE = adverse events, HFS = hand–foot syndrome.</u>\n\n4\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nSome case reports on NAC for thyroid cancer, especially ATC, have been published.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>8–11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> There have been several reports of neoadjuvant combined with other therapies in DTC.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12–14</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Recently, 2 reports of NAC treatment for DTC or poorly DTC with TKI drugs have been summarized in Table 2, all with good results.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>15–18</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Although the prognosis of patients with inoperable thyroid cancer is poor, NAC may reduce the risk of complications, allow safe surgery, and improve outcomes. Ideally, NAC should be administered to increase the curability of DTCs in which radical resection is impossible due to local invasion; however, advanced DTCs are often associated with distant metastases. Complete local resection can prolong survival even in patients with distant metastasis.\n\nTable 2 - Series of case reports that utilized neoadjuvant TKI therapy for thyroid cancer and their subsequent outcomes.\n\n| Study reference | Year | Age/sex | Histology | TNM | TKI (daily dose) EBR± | Duration (wk) | Days off | Outcome |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gay et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> | 2019 | 81/F | PDTC | T4NxM0 | Lenvatinib (10 mg)EBR+ | 8 | 14 | Lesion size slightly reduced |\n| Stewart et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> | 2019 | 73/F | PTC | T4aN1bM1 | Sorafenib (800 mg)Lenvatinib (10–14 mg) | 414 | 14 | Reduction in tumor volume from 31 × 59 × 32 mm to 17 × 28 × 22 mm |\n| Danilovic et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> | 2018 | 20/M | PTC | T4aN1bM1 | Sorafenib (800 mg)EBR+ | 52 | 14 | Reduction to cervical mass, metastatic lymph nodes, and pulmonary nodules |\n| Tsuboi et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> | 2017 | 73/M | PTC | T4aN1bM0 | Lenvatinib (14 mg) | 22 | 17 | Tumor decreased in size by 84%, and the cervical lymph nodes by 56% |\n| Nava et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> | 2019 | 32/M | PTC | T4aN1bMx | Sorafenib (800 mg) | 24 | 30 | 70% tumor reduction |\n| Iwasaki et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> | 2020 | 75/F | PTC | TxN1bM1 | Lenvatinib (10–20 mg) | 16 | 7 | Tumor shrinkage, and the major axis reduced in diameter from 68 to 48 mm |\n| Alshehri et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> | 2021 | 56/F | PDTC | T4aN1bM1 | Sorafenib (400 mg)Lenvatinib (10 mg) | 48 | 28 | Reduction in tumor volume from 9 × 9 × 4.4 cm to 7.2 × 6.6 × 3.7 cm |\n\nEBR = external beam radiation, PDTC = poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, PTC = papillary thyroid cancer, TKI = tyrosine kinase inhibitor, TNM = tumor nodes metastasis classification.\n\nIn contrast, in ATC, which has a very poor prognosis, local control is possible, even with palliative resection, which prolongs survival.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Therefore, if an actionable gene mutation is found by gene panel testing, and if it is possible to delay treatment until a therapeutic agent is found, NAC combined with palliative resection may be a viable treatment strategy. In cases 4 and 5, oral intake was possible as the tumor shrank for 2 months, which led to a delay.\n\nIn DTCs with a relatively good prognosis, NAC may be a therapeutic strategy when radical surgery compromises quality of life.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> It is significant that the tumor decreased to a size that permitted safe resection, although in locally advanced cases, such as case 1, it is rare. If total laryngectomy is selected as a curative surgery for T4a patients with laryngeal invasion, a significant decrease in quality of life can be anticipated. We selected NAC and performed surgery after reduction, as in case 2, and the patient was able to lead a long and normal life after surgery. In case 3, the tumor was completely resected without tracheotomy or esophageal reconstruction. These results are promising for patients with advanced thyroid cancer, and we hope that this report will be evaluated as a precedent for safe NAC treatment and will be considered a treatment option. NAC with lenvatinib is a new treatment option for both patients and surgeons, and provides a breakthrough for patients with inoperable thyroid cancer.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThe authors thank Enago  for editing the manuscript draft.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nHI prepared the manuscript.

Introduction\n----------------\n\nEwing’s sarcoma (ES) is a malignant bone tumor that occurs mainly in children and adolescents. It was initially described by James Ewing, an American pathologist, in 1921.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Extraskeletal Ewing’s sarcoma (ESES) is a rare condition, with an incidence of 0.4 per million. It belongs to the ES family of tumors (ESFT), which is a group of tumors characterized by the presence of round tumor cells that share common neural histology and chromosomal translocation.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> It can develop within the soft tissues of any part of the body, although the most common sites include the upper thigh, buttocks, upper arm, and shoulders.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Primary Ewing sarcoma of the kidney is rare, representing approximately 1% of all renal tumors. Even with optimal treatment, the prognosis of renal ES is poor, and up to 50% of the cases have metastasis at the initial diagnosis.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Herein, we report an extremely rare case of primary Ewing sarcoma of the kidney, presenting initially with isolated right oculomotor nerve palsy due to compression of the nerve as a result of orbital bone metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of renal Ewing sarcoma with this initial presentation.\n\n2\\. Case report\n---------------\n\nA 53-year-old Filipino woman presented to our emergency department with a 4-week history of double vision and jaw pain. Her medical history included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease due to obstructive uropathy caused by recurrent kidney stones. Additionally, she was diagnosed with endometrial adenocarcinoma (stage IA) 18 months prior to presentation, for which she underwent hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Upon further history-taking, she reported unintentional weight loss and fatigue during the same period. She denied fever, headache, flank pain, dysuria, or hematuria. Her vital signs were within the normal limits. On examination, she was alert and fully oriented, and right third cranial nerve palsy with binocular diplopia was observed (the eye deviated downward and outward with complete ptosis). In addition, no other focal neurological deficits were observed at that time.\n\nInitial blood tests revealed normocytic anemia, hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed subtle changes. Accordingly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed, which showed a right sphenoid bone lesion affecting the cranial nerves in that area, an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal area, and a right mandibular mass . Based on the previous result, the decision was made to do a whole-body positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging that showed a large left kidney mass suggestive of primary renal cancer with bone, lung, and lymph nodes metastases . The case was discussed by the oncology team, who recommended proceeding with biopsy of the left apical lung lesion under radiological guidance. After biopsy, the patient was discharged from the hospital and was followed-up for 10 days.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nAxial brain MRI in T1WI sequence pre-contrast (A) and post-contrast (B) showing a subtle expansion of the medial aspect of the lesser wing of right sphenoid bone at the orbital apex with abnormal post-contrast enhancement at the orbital apex with possible secondary compression of the cranial nerve (yellow arrow).

Neurological examination revealed a power of 0/5 in both lower limbs. Subsequently, MRI revealed spinal cord compression due to a vertebral pathological fracture caused by multiple vertebral metastases . The neurosurgery team recommended non-surgical interventions. The patient received intravenous dexamethasone without any improvement in lower limb power. The lung biopsy report was indeterminate, and the decision to perform a left kidney biopsy was made.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3.:\n\nWhole-body PET/CT, (A) showing homogeneous uptake in a 11 cm sized left renal lesion and in some adjacent perinephric nodules as well as enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes.

The sample was sent to the Mayo Clinic Pathology Laboratory to confirm the diagnosis . Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic Ewing sarcoma of the kidney (stage 4).\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 4.:\n\nLeft renal mass biopsy.

FLI-1 = friend leukemia virus integration 1.</u>\n\nBased on its high efficacy in treating ES, the patient was started on the VAC-IE protocol (vincristine, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide, alternated with ifosfamide and etoposide). Unfortunately, the patient developed severe ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy immediately after the first dose. Given the poor performance status of the patient and the stage of cancer, palliative care was decided upon. Unfortunately, the patient died 4 months after the initial diagnosis due to multiorgan failure.\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nIsolated oculomotor nerve palsy (cranial nerve III palsy) is commonly encountered in daily clinical practice. It can occur because of a local pathology anywhere along the nerve pathway between the midbrain and orbital area.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> There are many causes of oculomotor nerve palsy, with most cases related to diabetes mellitus (due to microvascular pathology) and cerebral aneurysms (due to external compression).

It has been proposed that the origin of ES of the kidney might be from neural cells that invaginate the kidney during human organogenesis.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> It occurs more frequently in males than in females, with a ratio of 2:1.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> the most common presenting symptom is abdominal/flank pain (in approximately 2/3 of the patients). Other common clinical manifestations include hematuria and a palpable abdominal mass. The most common sites of metastasis are the lungs, liver, and bone.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Interestingly, Our patient initially presented with headache, ptosis, and paraplegia (features of metastasis), and the renal mass was discovered incidentally on imaging studies. A somatic reciprocal t (11; 22) (q24; q12) chromosomal translocation has been found in approximately 90% of EES cases, which generates EWSR1-FLI-1 fusion transcripts that disturb mitosis, leading to tumorigenesis.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe radiological findings of renal ES, like most renal tumors, are non-specific, and the definitive diagnosis is mainly based on histopathology and immunohistochemical pattern.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The Radiological findings in renal ES include a large and ill-defined solitary renal mass with heterogeneous contrast enhancement depicting mixed areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.

However, renal ES cases are usually managed similarly to other ESFT. The current standard chemotherapy for ESFT includes doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide, alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide (VAC-IE regimen). The principal treatment for localized renal ES is surgical resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy.

In a review by Tariq et al, the median survival time of patients with advanced disease was estimated to be 5.6 months. On the other hand, localized disease has a better prognosis, with a survival rate of 18 to 51 months. Other poor prognostic criteria include age >40 years and large tumor size, as in our case.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\n4\\. Conclusion\n--------------\n\nRenal Ewing sarcoma is a rare malignancy that frequently metastasizes at the time of initial diagnosis. The radiological manifestations could not differentiate this entity from renal cell carcinoma, and histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses are essential to confirm the diagnosis. Even with aggressive chemotherapy, metastatic renal Ewing sarcoma is inevitably fatal within a few months of diagnosis. Based on our case, clinicians should consider metastatic malignancy as a differential diagnosis in patients with unexplained cranial nerve palsy.\n删除1：<u>Authors contributions\n---------------------\n\nAFA-M: conceptualization, literature review, data collection, and manuscript writing.

However, only a small subset of patients have derived meaningful clinical benefit. Our laboratory preclinical studies showed that apatinib inhibited migration and invasion, as well as PD-L1 expression, in osteosarcoma by targeting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Because anti-angiogenic agents may modulate the tumor-immunosuppressive microenvironment, combinations of antiangiogenics with immune checkpoint blockers have become an attractive strategy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> The apatinib plus camrelizumab for an unresectable high-grade osteosarcoma (APFAO) study was a non-comparative, single-arm, open-label, phase II trial that evaluated the activity and safety of apatinib mesylate in combination with camrelizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) in patients with previously treated advanced osteosarcoma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe results of this APFAO trial have contributed to a body of evidence, suggesting that anti-PD-1 antibody might not be the key treatment for osteosarcoma, especially for patients with multiple metastases outside the lung. However, in this cohort, we observed 2 cases with durable disease control (1 with partial response for nearly 2 years and 1 with stable disease for 18 months) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Supplemental Digital Contents 1, https://links.lww.com/MD/F52 and 2, https://links.lww.com/MD/F53)</u>.\n\nHere, we present detailed clinical information on these 2 patients to discuss the clinical features of this combination therapy.\n\nCase presentation\n-----------------\n\n### Case 1\n\nA 44-year-old male without an obvious past history of trauma presented with right hip pain to the orthopedic oncology clinic on March 31, 2017. We did not observe any obvious abnormality in his plain film , while his magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed intra-osseous lesions with some liquid cavity as well as an ectosteal edema signal . For initial diagnosis, the orthopedic oncologist performed a core-needle biopsy for the lesion, with pathology showing no obvious malignant cells. Then intralesional curettage surgery was done on May 2, 2017 with bone grafting and internal fixation with a plate, whereas the pathological report revealed high-grade osteosarcoma manifesting as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) of bone . Thus, a second surgery was performed on May 19, 2017 with the aim of wide resection, with artificial prosthesis implantation for bony reconstruction. We delivered routine osteosarcoma chemotherapy afterwards following the protocol of Peking University People's Hospital 通用删除1(英):<u>(Supplemental Digital Content 3, https://links.lww.com/MD/F54)</u>. However, shortly after, the patient developed multiple pulmonary metastases and local recurrence . Immunohistochemistry analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections for PD-L1 was done using an anti-PD-L1 antibody (clone 22C3, Cat# M3653; DAKO; Glostrup, Denmark) and the Dako Autostainer Link 48 platform, for which the sample was obtained from the first curettage surgery. Specimens were scored by the pathologists using the tumor proportion score, which is the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete membrane staining at any intensity. We found that 90% of the specimens were positive . We conducted geno-profiling of the patient's surgical sample using the Illumina High-Throughput Sequencing Platform and found the patient had a tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 1.5 Muts/Mb, gene amplification of CRKL and LZTR1, as well as mutation of H3F3A G35L, which is a characterized gene mutation for giant cell tumors.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nClinical information of case 1.

The target lesions in the lung nearly disappeared at first-cycle's clinical evaluation, while the relapsed lesion located beside the prosthesis still manifested a maximum standard uptake value (SUV) of 6.2 . Thus, we concluded a partial response after confirmation that the evaluation was done in May 2018. His disease remained stable with clear lungs, elevated maximum SUV, and calcification of the relapsed lesion  until the end of the therapeutic phase of this trial on February 1, 2020. The dose of apatinib was reduced to 250 mg on June 15, 2018 because of grade 3 anorexia and pain of extremities according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 , and he never resumed dosing of 500 mg. Due to concern about his proximal femoral lesion, resection for pathological identification was suggested multiple times. However after receiving surgery twice, the patient decided not to undergo resection again, but rather, chose core-needle biopsy of the calcification lesion . There seemed to be no tumor cells microscopically . However after stopping apatinib in February 2020, the patient complained of pain of the lesion, so local therapy with radiation to the proximal femur was advised. To date of March 1, 2020, he remains disease-free.\n\n### Case 2\n\nA 14-year-old girl was scheduled for amputation on November 14, 2017 due to left proximal tibial and fibular osteosarcoma and poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy  following the same protocol we described above. Her disease progressed during chemotherapy after definitive surgery in March 2018, with multiple calcified pulmonary metastases. She subsequently provided informed consent on August 10, 2018 for enrollment in the APFAO trial (Patient #44). PD-L1 immunohistochemistry of her former surgery showed 5% tumor proportion score , and the sequencing of her specimen revealed a TMB of 1.1 Muts/Mb. She had somatic genomic variations of DNA in FGFR4 G388R exon9 and GRM3 A291T exon 3, while microsatellite was stable.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nClinical information of case 2.

With calcification of all those target lesions, we did not observe any shrinkage of tumor volume. Her chest computed tomography was renewed on February 18, 2020 , with duration of stable disease lasting for more than 18 months. The positron emission tomography scan of those lesions showed no SUV uptake compared with normal tissues .\n\nFor these 2 patients, surgical tissue samples were obtained for NGS analysis using a panel of 450 cancer-related genes (OrigiMed, Shanghai, China) on February, 2019 and November, 2019.\n\nWe found CRKL amplification in patient 1 and FGFR4 G388R variation in patient 2. CRKL is mainly involved in MAPK signaling pathway by activating RAS and immune system signaling pathway.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> FGFR4 G388R mutation was reported in activation of FGFR4 signaling, which led to the phosphorylation of FGF receptor and further activated the downstream MAPK/ERK signaling.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup>\n\nApatinib, an antiangiogenic drug, may decrease MAPK signaling pathway downstream of VEGFR receptor by inhibiting the action of VEGFR tyrosine kinase, so as to benefit the 2 patients. However, our previous study showed high objective response but short-term activity of apatinib in advanced osteosarcoma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn this study, both patients showed low TMB, microsatellite stable, and PD-L1 positive expression, especially 90% expression of PD-L1 in patient 1. Therefore, it is speculated that the long time benefit in these 2 patients may have a greater correlation with combined immunity therapy.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\nImmunotherapy is attractive for advanced tumors for its durable responses and hypotoxic features compared with chemotherapy and target therapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> Drugs targeting the PD1/PD-L1 pathway have shown significant clinical activity across several different cancer types.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u></a></sup> However, the majority of patients do not respond to these agents.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,16,18,19]</u></a></sup> Regarding osteosarcoma, by high-throughput genetic sequencing to compare genomic disparities between primary tumors and corresponding pulmonary metastatic tumors, it has been shown that metastatic tumors are more immunogenic.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Specifically, metastases have more neoantigens, higher expression of PD-L1, and more tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes than corresponding primary tumors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Various preclinical studies have suggested that immunotherapy might be an option for osteosarcoma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,11,20–22]</u></a></sup> However, not much improvement has been made since a randomized controlled trial was designed for pegylated interferon alfa-2b<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> and liposomal muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> A retrospective study by Paoluzzi, Cacavio, Ghesani, Karambelkar, Rapkiewicz, Weber, Rosen<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> revealed that the combination of pazopanib and nivolumab might result in 50% of the evaluable patients for clinical benefit.\n\nThe APFAO trial was the first to report a prospective trial using a combination of angiogenetic tyrosine kinase inhibitors and PD-1 antibody in osteosarcoma. However in this study, synergistic effects were not identified in most of the population and until last follow-up, only 2 relatively long-term survivors (more than 18 months) were observed, which was inconsistent across studies<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10,16,23,24,26,27]</u></a></sup> and while the overall trend is that immunotherapy does not have overwhelming activity in sarcomas as observed with melanoma<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u></a></sup> or non-small cell lung cancer,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u></a></sup> it is clear that patients with certain characteristics may respond and investigators will continue to evaluate the use of immunotherapy in specific sarcomas, such as alveolar soft part sarcoma.\n\nBoth the patients reported in this article had marked PD-L1 expression. In the APFAO trial with an initial PD-L1-positive expression rate as low as 21.4% (6/28), we did not observe any ORR benefit but prolonged PFS in patients with PD-L1-expressing tumors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> However, this observation could be explained by the fact that the osteogenic lesions with calcification might not shrink like other solid tumors. During the study, we made note of an interesting observation regarding the site of tumor lesions and disease progression, of which we found that patients with pulmonary lesions only had a tendency for longer PFS than those with bone lesions (_P_ = .017), which was also in accordance with these 2 cases. Case 1 (Patient #10) obvious carried mutation of H3F3A G35L, while some part of the specimen showed pathological features of UPS, which reminds us whether these patients responding to anti-PD-1 therapy were having malignant giant cell tumors or UPS of bone. This deduction has driven us to design more basic and clinical research to further investigate. For both of these cases, the TMB were low, while microsatellites were stable, which were also in accordance with what we observed in most osteosarcoma patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup>\n\nAnother interesting observation was seen in case 2 with stable disease. It is entirely possible that some of the patients simply had indolent disease, such as the gastrointestinal sarcoma and well-differentiated liposarcoma. However, osteosarcoma is generally not considered indolent disease, and its stabilization in an advanced setting in response to immunotherapy may serve as an indication of activity. During former trial of single apatinib,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> we also observed 2 cases with overall survival lasting nearly 3 years, however, both of whom progressed rapidly after a year's apatinib treatment and changed to other angiogenetic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, cabozantinib, pazopanib, and levantinib) afterwards and received radiotherapy in combination.\n\nA study had revealed that human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) homozygosity and LOH at HLA-I represent a genetic barrier to effective immunotherapy. Heterozygous HLA-I genotypes facilitate presentation of a more diverse set of tumor antigens to T cells.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u></a></sup> Both patients in our study showed HLA-I heterozygosity and had a low HLA-I evolutionary divergence (HED) score (reference cutoff value of 7.887). HED was a strong determinant of survival after treatment with ICIs. Even among patients fully heterozygous at HLA-I, patients with an HED in the upper quartile respond better to ICIs than patients with a low HED.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe low expression of HBV was detected in tumor tissue of patient 1. HBV infection can regulate the efficacy of PD-1 immunotherapy by influencing tumor microenvironment,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u></a></sup> which needs to be further confirmed by clinical HBV detection. There were 3 neoantigens predicted by NGS detection in tumor tissue of patient 2, but the function of neoantigens needs further verification.\n\nTo date, most research to predict clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapies has focused on tumor immune phenotype, somatic genomic features, tumor microenviroment and so on. The complexity of human immune mechanism determines that there is no accurate and reliable efficacy predictor at present, and only combined multiple biomarkers can accurately and comprehensively predict the response to immunotherapy.\n\nIn summary, our 2 long-term survivors in the trial APFAO suggested osteosarcoma might not always be refractory to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 axial therapy. More prospective trials are needed to determine biomarkers that may aid in patient selection for this combination.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe thank all the patients and their families for participating in this clinical trial.

We present the case of a patient with nephrotic syndrome due to primary FSGS presenting with postprandial abdominal pain while on prednisone therapy, who was diagnosed with isolated superior mesenteric vein thrombosis (SMVT).\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 19-year-old patient with a medical history of congenital horseshoe kidney, preserved renal function, and a baseline creatinine level of 60 μmol/L presented to the emergency department with a complaint of bilateral peripheral edema and foamy urine for one week. History revealed no associated hematuria, fever, arthralgia, new rash, or previous or current thromboembolism. The patient was taking over the counter whey protein supplements but denied taking anabolic steroids or illicit drug use. No personal or family history of thrombophilia was reported.\n\nPhysical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/80 mm Hg and significant pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities. Initial urinalysis showed 3+ protein and 2+ blood, and an elevated 24-hour urine protein of 17.19 g/d. His creatinine level at presentation was 91 μmol/L, and his serum albumin level was 16 g/L. Investigations for secondary etiologies of glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, including serum protein electrophoresis and serological tests for immunoglobulins, complement, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, HIV, and hepatitis serology were negative. A kidney biopsy showed mixed-type FSGS with classic, perihilar, and tip lesions and near-total foot process effacement on electron microscopy. The patient was diagnosed with primary FSGS based on the histological features, acute symptom onset, and lack of identifiable secondary etiology.\n\nInduction therapy with high-dose prednisone (80 mg/d per oral) was initiated in addition to furosemide and ramipril. After 2 weeks of treatment, his 24-hour urine protein level decreased to 11.5 g/d, and his serum albumin level improved slightly to 20 g/L. We planned to continue high-dose prednisone for 6 weeks, followed by gradual tapering.\n\nProphylactic anticoagulation for thromboembolism was discussed with the patient considering his low serum albumin level, but the patient declined because of social reasons. Furthermore, based on his symptoms and objective measurements of proteinuria and serum albumin levels, the response to treatment was assessed as satisfactory. Therefore, prophylactic anticoagulation therapy was not initiated.\n\nFour months after his initial presentation to the hospital, he presented to the emergency department with postprandial abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography showed subacute near-occlusive SMVT with partial ischemia of a 15-cm segment of the distal ileum. At this time, prednisone therapy was tapered to 25 mg daily, and he was compliant with treatment. A 24-hour urine protein level of 3.5 g/d, serum albumin level of 34 g/L, and normal serum creatinine level indicated partial remission of FSGS. Thrombophilia workup including protein C, protein S, Antithrombin III, Factor V Leiden, and prothrombin gene mutations, was negative. Anticoagulation with 5 mg warfarin and intravenous unfractionated heparin using a titrated heparin infusion protocol to keep activated partial thromboplastin time at 50 to 70 seconds was started and subsequently transitioned to tinzaparin (14,000 IU). On the 4th and 5th day of treatment, the international normalized ratio was therapeutic at 2.3 and 2.4 respectively, after which the tinzaparin was stopped and the patient was maintained on 5 mg of warfarin. On discharge, the patient's symptoms resolved with conservative treatment of SMVT, while prednisone therapy for FSGS continued. His discharge medications included warfarin, prednisone, ramipril, furosemide, and omeprazole. At 2,4, and 6 weeks of follow-up visits, the patient showed a good response to therapy, and he reported disappearance of symptoms. Proteinuria returned to baseline, with no negative side effects. His creatinine level continued to be normal. Follow-up computed tomography angiography of the abdomen showed resolution of the thrombus and associated ischemic changes. At 3 months follow up, the patient revisited, and he continued to be pain-free with partial remission of primary FSGS. He completed 6 months course of warfarin targeting an International Normalized Ratio of 2 to 3 with no signs of superior MVT recurrence or medication side effects during follow-up visits.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nHere, we present a case of SMVT in a patient with primary FSGS, which was in partial remission with steroid therapy. Extensive thrombus burden involving the superior mesenteric, portal, and splenic veins in a 13-year-old boy with frequently relapsing FSGS treated with steroids and tacrolimus has been previously reported.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolated SMVT in an adult patient with primary FSGS with nephrotic-range proteinuria.\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that nephrotic syndrome is a risk factor for thromboembolism, although the level of risk may vary according to the underlying etiology.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,9]</u></a></sup> The incidence of VTE in primary FSGS ranges from 2% to 12%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,10,11]</u></a></sup> In a large cohort study of 1313 patients with idiopathic glomerulonephritis,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> it was reported that the median interval between the initial clinical diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome and onset of VTE was 272 days. The incidence of thromboembolism was the highest within the first six months after the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u></a></sup> Among primary nephrotic syndromes, membranous nephropathy confers the highest risk of VTE, independent of the extent of proteinuria, albumin level, and other VTE risk factors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> However, relapse of nephrotic syndrome has been implicated as a risk factor for VTE in FSGS.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Our patient presented with SMVT while in partial disease remission and his serum albumin level was 34 g/L. This suggests that the prothrombotic state conferred by nephrotic syndrome extends beyond the acute stage of the disease, regardless of the serum albumin level.\n\nThe risk of VTE in nephrotic syndrome is inversely proportional to the serum albumin level, especially at concentrations < 20–25 g/L; however, it is directly proportional to the severity of proteinuria.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,11]</u></a></sup> The ratio of proteinuria to serum albumin is a more sensitive and specific predictor of VTE than either factor alone.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> The exact pathophysiology of venous thrombosis in nephrotic syndrome has not been elucidated. Several mechanisms that promote a thrombophilic milieu have been suggested.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,14]</u></a></sup> Altered permselectivity of the glomerular basement membrane promotes loss of antithrombotic factors such as antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> Hypoalbuminemia enhances hepatic synthesis of fibrinogen and other pro-thrombotic factors, including factors V and VIII.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,14]</u></a></sup> Other contributory mechanisms include thrombocytosis, hyperreactive platelets, and reduced fibrinolysis due to reduced plasminogen levels.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,14]</u></a></sup> Thrombophilia is further enhanced by steroid therapy, volume depletion, and administration of diuretics.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,9,14,15]</u></a></sup>\n\nVTE complications in nephrotic syndrome most commonly present as pulmonary emboli, deep vein thromboses, and renal vein thrombosis, but MVT is rare.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u></a></sup> The non-specific presentation of MVT poses additional challenges in reaching the correct diagnosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> The current knowledge of MVT in nephrotic syndrome is based on case reports. In pediatric patients, portal vein thrombus with extension into the superior mesenteric vein has been reported in biopsy-proven FSGS and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> In previous reports, adults with nephrotic syndrome presenting with abdominal pain and distension have been diagnosed with extensive MVT and ischemic bowel, which is similar to that in the present case.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,6,15–17]</u></a></sup> Minimal change disease was the predominant underlying pathology in these cases, and only one patient had membranous nephropathy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,6,15–17]</u></a></sup> These cases were successfully treated using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) with or without bridging to warfarin, in addition to steroid therapy for nephrotic syndrome. The duration of anticoagulation varied and, in some reports, it was not specified.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4,6,15,17]</u></a></sup> Such variations are most likely attributable to the paucity of standardized guidelines for MVT management in patients with nephrotic syndrome.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup>\n\nHeparin and oral vitamin K antagonists are considered first-line treatments for confirmed thromboembolism in nephrotic syndrome.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,14]</u></a></sup> Anticoagulation is continued for the duration of nephrotic-range proteinuria.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> Heparin may also alleviate proteinuria by reinstating the charge selectivity of the glomerular basement membrane.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> However, antithrombin III depletion may predispose patients with nephrotic syndrome to heparin resistance.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Oral therapeutic agents, including warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (direct factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors) are variably plasma protein bound; hence, their efficacy and safety are influenced by hypoalbuminemia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> A small pilot study comparing rivaroxaban and LMWH for VTE treatment demonstrated similar efficacy with regard to VTE recurrence and propagation of existing thrombi without significant differences in bleeding risk.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Extrapolation of these data to clinical practice is limited by the small sample size of 16 patients, single-center experience, and lack of patients with SMVT.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Moreover, therapeutic anticoagulation has not been compared with thrombolytic agents in randomized control trials in this patient population.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> The latter may have a role in patients with a massive clot burden, end organ damage and hemodynamic instability.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14,21]</u></a></sup> Thrombolytic therapy with urokinase was employed in a patient with extensive MVT and steroid-dependent minimal change disease without bleeding complications.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> The use of thrombolytic agents is limited to patients with acute presentations reporting within six hours of symptom onset.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> Until large-cohort randomized controlled trials of therapeutic modalities for VTE treatment in nephrotic syndrome are conducted, it is reasonable to continue with the current anecdotal practice. Concomitant treatment of the underlying disease that precipitated the nephrotic-range proteinuria was also emphasized in this setting.\n\nEvidence supporting the initiation of primary prophylaxis for VTE in nephrotic syndrome is scarce and limited by the lack of randomized clinical trials.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,14,22,23]</u></a></sup> In clinical practice, patients with severe nephrotic syndrome and hypoalbuminemia (albumin < 20–25 g/L) are considered candidates for prophylactic anticoagulation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines suggest warfarin for thromboprophylaxis in patients with albumin levels < 25 g/L.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> However, the merit of using this albumin cut-off has not been well studied.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> In a single-center retrospective analysis, LMWH was effective in reducing the incidence of VTE in patients with nephrotic syndrome due to primary glomerulonephritis and serum albumin levels < 20 g/L after a median follow-up of 154 weeks.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> The overt and occult gastrointestinal bleeding rates were 0.69% and 1.4%, respectively. Experts recommend continuation of prophylactic anticoagulation for the first 6 months of nephrotic syndrome, considering that it is associated with the highest risk of VTE.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13,19]</u></a></sup> Until definitive evidence to support clinical decision making is available, the initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation and duration of therapy should be decided on a case-to-case basis after a thorough discussion of its pros and cons with the patient <sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,23]</u></a></sup>.\n\nWe describe a unique case of an adult patient with nephrotic syndrome due to biopsy-proven FSGS presenting with isolated SMVT, while in partial disease remission and with near-normal serum albumin level. The patient responded well to anticoagulation therapy with heparin transitioning to warfarin. Although nephrotic-range proteinuria is a well-recognized risk factor for VTE, there is a paucity of evidence-based guidelines to support clinical decision making regarding prophylactic anticoagulation and the duration of prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation. This patient presented with VTE while in partial disease remission, which suggests that the hypercoagulable state may extend beyond the acute stage of the disease and is independent of the serum albumin level. Understanding the timing during which the patient is at the highest risk for VTE will help determine the optimal treatment duration. Therefore, a predictive model to identify high-risk patients who are more likely to benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation therapy is required. Lastly, the choice of evidence-based anticoagulation therapy for nephrotic syndrome with VTE remains to be determined.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Mohammed Somaili.\n\n**Data curation:** Mohammed Somaili, Carol Wang.\n\n**Visualization:** Mohammed Somaili.\n\n**Project administration:** Basma Alrefa**’**ei.\n\n**Supervision:** Mohammed Somaili.\n\n**Validation:** Mohammed Somaili.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Mohammed Somaili, Carol Wang.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Mohammed Somaili, Omar Almansour.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:53:29", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:56:17", "cost": 168.1}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:56:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:53:28"}

The average age of patients is 43 years.

She had no salient medical history; she gave birth to two children, and reported uterine bleeding during the last six months. During the physical examination she had pain on palpation of the right lower abdominal quadrant and adjacent lower abdomen. Laboratory tests were within normal limits.\n\nThe patient underwent an ultrasonography exam of the abdomen and pelvis. The examination revealed an enlarged right ovary measuring 73 × 40 × 51 mm in size with a volume of 78 cm<sup>3</sup>. A mass of approximately 4 cm in diameter (37 × 27 × 37 mm) was detected in the ovary. The lesion had a cystic and a solid part. Echogenic elements were discovered in the cystic part which was compatible with the characteristics of a dermoid cyst. The uterus measured 50 × 29 × 25 mm in diameter with no lesions. No pathological findings were observed in the left ovary. Blood tumor markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (<0,50 ng/ml) and Cancer Antigen 125 (19,34 U/ml), were normal. However, the beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels were slightly high (6,06 mIU/ml). There were no abnormalities in the typical examination of the thyroid gland. Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) was within the normal limits.\n\nA computed tomography scan of the abdomen was scheduled to identify the mass preoperatively. It revealed a mass in the right ovary, 4 cm in diameter, with fatty density compatible with dermoid cyst. The uterus had no significant lesion and no fluid was observed in the Douglas space. The lymph nodes in the posterior peritoneal space showed no enlargement.\n\nAdditional abdominal magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of the mass with clear margins, high T1 signal, and T2 sequence indicating dermal cysts. The dimension of the mass was 73 × 40 × 51 mm with increased vascularization and showed visible echogenic elements. All the above characteristics of the lesion were compatible with a dermoid cyst. The patient was informed of her condition, she consented for the proposed surgical treatment and was scheduled for operation.\n\nHysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on the fourth postoperative day.\n\nPathologic examination of the removed mass confirmed the presence of a mature cystic teratoma of the right ovary, in which papillary thyroid carcinoma was noted, covering 65% of the lesion, 1.4 cm in diameter. More specifically , thyroid tissue with follicles of various sizes was observed, which were smeared with cuboidal epithelium. Some of the follicles showed eosinophilic endotracheal secretions, which were organized in nodular formations, surrounded by cystic fibrous elements. Additionally, in Figure 1b, thyroid cell tumor was identified, showing features of papillary thyroid carcinoma. In particular, cells with characteristic inclusions, intranuclear cavities and relative nuclear atypia were observed. All the above findings were typical of a mature cystic ovarian teratoma. The surgical resection margin was clear at a distance of 2 mm. The vessels and the nerves of the mass had no sign of neoplastic cells. The lesion was classified as T1aN0M0 according to the AJCC Pathologic tumor staging. A polyp, 1.2 cm in diameter, was found inside the uterus while the mucosa of the uterus had no sign of neoplastic lesion. Both salpinges were free of pathological findings. The mucosa of the cervix had mild inflammatory lesions.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nA: Pathological image of the removed mass showing features of papillary thyroid carcinoma. B: Pathological image of the removed mass showing features of papillary thyroid carcinoma.</u>\n\nA follow-up ultrasound examination was performed four months after the surgery with no signs of recurrence or any other complications. Metastatic work-up after surgery was not found to be necessary according to the pathologic findings of the mass. Another follow-up examination is scheduled one-year post-op.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nTeratoma is a type of germ cell tumor which can contain different types of tissues such as hair, muscle, bone or even teeth. These tissues originate from either the endoderm, the mesoderm or the ectoderm. The most common area of appearance is in the ovary, the testicle or the tailbone.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,10,11]</u></a></sup> Teratomas are classified as mature or immature. The difference between these two is that mature teratomas are usually benign and appear as cystic lesions, while immature teratomas are malignant and have a solid appearance.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> According to the literature,5% to 20% of mature cystic teratomas contain thyroid tissue.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,15]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe term struma ovarii is used when a mature cystic teratoma of the ovary contains at least 50% of thyroid tissue.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> The frequency of struma ovarii among all ovarian teratomas is less than 3%, while some reports claim it to be approximately 5%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,15]</u></a></sup> Mature cystic teratomas are typically benign and malignant transformation has been reported in less than 5% of the cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of malignancy found in a struma ovarii. Other types of malignant tumors are follicular thyroid carcinoma, follicular variant of papillary carcinoma and highly differentiated follicular carcinoma of ovarian origin.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> There are no guidelines regarding the treatment of malignant mature cystic teratomas. Clinical and pathological information has to be considered for therapeutic decisions and management of the patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe histologic and morphologic features of the thyroid tissue are difficult to determine during pathological and microscopic examination. The frequency of metastasis of a malignant struma ovarri varies from 5% to 23%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u></a></sup> Metastasis usually occurs in the abdominal cavity while liver, lungs, brain and bones are less common sites. They can spread via lymphatic and blood pathways.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe ultrasonography characteristics of a struma ovarii are clearly defined round boundaries and smooth contours.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> A cyst with thickened boundaries or a multilocular cyst can be present. The mass is usually isoechoic, hyperechoic, or could cause acoustic shadowing.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17,18]</u></a></sup> Signs of dermoid cysts and struma pearls confirms the presence of struma ovarii. Doppler flow imaging can reveal increased vascularization and confirm the blood flow inside the mass.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\nLaboratory findings also vary greatly. In most cases, the level of serum thyroid stimulating hormone is low, while T3 and T4 are both high. In some cases, one of the two, either T3 or T4, might be elevated.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u></a></sup> In the literature, only one case of struma ovarii appearing with pure T3 thyrotoxicosis has been described.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> Less than 5% of patients with struma ovarii develop hyperthyroidism. However, in case of hyperthyroidism, Grave's disease usually occurs.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> Moreover, the patients reportedly have a lower uptake of radioiodine in the thyroid gland but a higher uptake in the pelvic region.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> Few patients show elevated levels of cancer antigen 125.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,11]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe thyroid tissue found in a struma ovarii can secrete T3 and T4. This secretion can cause thyrotoxicosis which is described as another symptom of struma ovarii. Thyrotoxicosis can occur in approximately 8% of patients with struma ovarii and is caused by high T3 and T4 levels in the blood. It has also been described as the presence of high free triiodothyronine levels with the levels of free T4 remaining within the normal range 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. In 2020, Prentice et al. described the first case of a struma ovarii secreting only T3 hormone. The treatment of this potentially life-threatening disease is the use of antithyroid medication, like carbimazole, in combination with surgical removal of the thyroid gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Our patient had no abnormalities in the typical examination of the thyroid gland. T3 and T4 was within the normal limits before the operation. After the operation the patient was strongly advised to visit an endocrinologist and have a regular ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland, to monitor any possible malignant transformation.\n\nAt a molecular level, the rearranged during transfection/proto-oncogene (RET/PTC) genes, particularly RET/PTC 1 and RET/PTC 3 is known to be related with the development of papillary thyroid carcinoma. A nonclonal expression of this oncogene is observed in benign tumors which proves the role of the modulations of these genes in tumorigenesis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> Moreover, the Barr bodies and the karyotype (46 XX) plays an important role in the development of a mature cystic teratoma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup>\n\nTimmerman _et al._ proposed a model which provides the tools to discriminate the benign and malignant ovarian masses and to assess the risk of malignant transformation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> This can be used to improve the management of women with ovarian pathology. Several aspects are taken into consideration to predict the presence of ovarian malignancy. The first model contains 12 variables, such as the diameter of the solid component of the mass, the presence of ascites and the past history of ovarian cancer.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> The second model is simple and contains 6 variables including the presence of acoustic shadows in the ultrasound examination and the irregularity of the internal cyst walls. There are six levels of diagnostic confidence: certainly malignant, probably malignant, uncertain but considered malignant, uncertain but considered benign, probably benign and certainly benign.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> In our case the risk of malignancy was determined at 29.6%.\n\nThe surgical treatment of malignant struma ovarii varies and depends on the age of the patient and the presence of metastasis. Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are proposed for postmenopausal women. Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or cystectomy is recommended for women in the reproductive age. In case of a metastatic struma ovarii aggressive treatment is required, including thyroidectomy and adjuvant treatment with radioactive iodine, even though the effectiveness of this specific treatment remains controversial.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14,20,23,27]</u></a></sup> This approach was proposed by Janszen et al and Tzelepis et al aiming to reduce the rate of recurrence and mortality. The risk of recurrence is lower when the tumor is smaller than 2 cm, is located only in the ovary and there are no aggressive histopathological features.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20,23]</u></a></sup> For these patients Yassa et al proposed unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and levothyroxine to keep thyroid stimulating hormone levels at 0.1 to 0.5 mIU/L as the definitive treatment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup>\n\nTaking all the above parameters into consideration we decided the best treatment for our patient was surgical removal of the mass by performing hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. No other complementary treatment was required, and the patient was advised to have frequent check-up by an endocrinologist.\n\nThere are no specific guidelines for the treatment of thyroid cancer in an ovarian teratoma. The biological behavior of these type of cancers is yet unclear and many studies have revealed recurrence rates between 7.5% and 35%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14,27]</u></a></sup> This emphasizes the importance of long-term monitoring of the patients even up to 10 years after the operation.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nStruma ovarii is a relatively uncommon medical condition that is mostly benign. The principal characteristic of struma ovarii is that the thyroid tissue comprises more than fifty percent of the total tissue. They represent the most commonly occurring mature teratomas. Symptoms vary from patient to patient and in most cases diagnosis is incidental. In most cases hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy is the definitive treatment. Unilateral or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy are also choices of treatment depending on the age of the patient and the risk of malignancy. Thyroidectomy as a complementary treatment remains debatable and further research in this field is required. The patients with benign papillary thyroid teratoma typically show no signs of recurrence or any post-operative complications. However, long-term monitoring is essential. Defining the criteria for the risk of malignancy plays a critical part in the management of a patient with struma ovarii. Alternative or complementary treatment to hysterectomy is under investigation and more clinical trials are necessary.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nAI and ChE conceived the case report.

It is not only associated with widespread extension into the pelvic cavity, but often infiltrates the large blood vessels, requiring highly invasive surgical treatment, including removal of these tumors. We report a case of IVLM that extended into the ovarian and internal iliac veins and the pelvic cavity, which was completely resected after multidisciplinary treatment including preoperative administration of the gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist relugolix.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 49-year-old Chinese woman (gravida 1, para 1) was referred to our hospital after a regular follow-up of uterine myoma in a Chinese hospital during which she was informed of a rapid increase in pelvic tumor accompanied by intravascular extension. She was diagnosed with uterine myoma when she was 40 years old. There was no significant medical history or family history. She was not menopausal, and her menstrual cycle was 28 days. Her height was 158 cm, weight was 58 kg, and body mass index was 23.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. On internal examination and transvaginal ultrasonography, she had a firm tumor 170 mm in diameter below the umbilicus. We performed abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and maximum intensity projection with contrast media. An irregular and homogeneous tumor was detected in the pelvic region, showing that the mass originated from the uterus, but did not suggest bleeding or necrosis in it. The tumor had spread outside the uterus, into the broad ligament and the right uterine vein. It had also spread into the right internal iliac vein and bilateral ovarian veins, giving a “worm-like” mass image. In particular, the tumor in the right ovarian vein extended near the inflow to the inferior vena cava (IVC) . Contrast computed tomography showed no evidence of metastasis to the inferior vena cava and cardiac ultrasonography showed no evidence of metastasis to the right cardiac atrium. It was considered to correspond to stage 2 diseases according to Ma's classification.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nImages of pelvic tumor.

In particular, the tumor in the right ovarian vein extended near the inflow to the inferior vena cava.</u>\n\nResults of a complete blood count, blood coagulation test, and blood biochemistry test showed nothing of note. Serum tumor marker values were all below the cut-off: lactate dehydrogenase, 193 U/mL (normal: 124–222); cancer antigen 125, 12.8 U/mL (normal: 0.0–35.0); carcinoembryonic antigen, 0.4 ng/mL (normal: 0.0–5.0); cancer antigen 19-9, 6.9 U/mL (normal: 0.0–37.0). Serum hormonal tests of follicle stimulating hormone (4.7 mIU/mL) and estradiol (E2; 639 pg/mL) did not suggest menopause. There was no deep vein thrombus in the lower limb upon vascular ultrasonography.\n\nPathological diagnosis by computed tomography-guided biopsy was also considered, but imaging diagnosis suggested IVLM and probable estrogen-dependent tumor rather than uterine sarcoma. We therefore decided to perform preoperative hormone therapy with relugolix (Relumina, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan and ASKA Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) to reduce the surgical risk and increase the likelihood of complete resection during laparotomy. Relugolix is a new gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist that strongly suppresses E2 early in the administration period, and we used its immediate effect to rule out biological malignancy. After explaining the situation to the patient and obtaining her informed consent, we started treatment of relugolix (40 mg/d, orally). Two weeks after the start of relugolix administration, the tumor showed a reduction of 26.5% in volume, and the E2 value dropped below the measurement sensitivity level. Therefore, the tumor was considered to have low biological malignancy, and the possibility of IVLM was judged to be high. After 8 weeks of relugolix treatment, the main tumor showed a reduction of 48.5% in volume, and the tumor that had spread into the veins had also reduced in size. After a total of 20 weeks’ treatment with relugolix, the tumor had reduced by 76.3% in volume. The reduction effect was judged to have reached a plateau, so we decided to proceed with surgical removal . The only adverse event reported by the patient due to relugolix was mild hot flush.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nTumor volume change rate. Tumor volume was calculated by measuring 3 diameters (D1, D2, D3) by MRI (volume = D1 × D2 × D3 × π / 6). After 20 weeks of relugolix administration, the tumor had shrunk by 76%.</u>\n\nTo reduce intraoperative bleeding, the internal iliac and uterine arteries were selectively embolized bilaterally with iomeprol before surgery. Laparotomy was then performed as follows:\n\nThe right ovarian tumor-filled vein was ligated and cut off from the inflow to the inferior vena cava.\n\nThe left infundibulopelvic ligament was dissected, the left uterine artery was dissected from the branch of the internal iliac artery, and the anterior layer of the left vesicouterine ligament and the left parametrium were dissected.\n\nBecause it was expected that many tumors were filling the branch vessels of the right internal iliac vein system, the right internal iliac artery was ligated and dissected at the distal side of the superior gluteal vein branch.\n\nAfter cutting the right uterine artery from the branch of the internal iliac artery, the right cardinal ligament including the right deep uterine vein was dissected, and the anterior layer of the right vesicouterine ligament was also dissected.\n\nThe vaginal cuff was dissected, and the uterus, both ovaries and both fallopian tubes were removed with the tumors that had spread into the pelvis. Finally, it was confirmed that there was no residual tumor in the vein in the pelvic cavity and the tumor had been completely removed . The operating time was 442 minutes and intraoperative blood loss was 1045 g.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nIntraabdominal and histopathological findings of the pelvic tumor.

Part of the tumor also extended into the blood vessels near the right ovary (50 × 20 mm) . In the lesion, there were densely proliferating spindle-shaped cells with cigar-like nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Spindle-shaped cells lacked apparent nuclear atypia and mitosis, and did not show necrosis . Immunohistochemistry showed spindle-shaped cells, a small number of which were positive for smooth muscle actin, partially positive for desmin and caldesmon, and negative for CD10; very few MIB-1 positive cells were also observed. In addition, estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors were also positive in these cells. Based on these findings, the final diagnosis was intravenous leiomyomatosis.\n\nThere were no notable events in the postoperative course and the patient was discharged on the 10th day postoperatively. To prevent disease recurrence, the patient continued taking relugolix after discharge from hospital for 5 months postoperatively. We then switched to the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (2.5 mg/d, orally). At 14 months postoperatively, the patient showed no signs of recurrence of IVLM and no adverse events due to relugolix or letrozole.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nHistologically, IVLM is considered to be a benign leiomyoma that originates either from the cells in the smooth muscle of the myometrium, or from smooth muscle cells from uterine or pelvic vein walls and invades the intima of myometrial sinuses.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Biologically, it appears similar to a malignant tumor, and its molecular genetics are thought to lie between those of leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Risk factors are previous hysterectomy/myomectomy or coexisting uterine myoma. The median age of patients with IVLM is 45 years and it is considered estrogen-dependent.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u></a></sup> Ectopic extension is observed in 30% to 80% of cases at the time of diagnosis, and it often extends to the uterine vein rather than the ovarian vein.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> Furthermore, it spreads to the inferior vena cava via the internal iliac and common iliac veins and may reach the right cardiac atrium or the pulmonary artery.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u></a></sup> IVLM does not show specific symptoms when the disease extends into the pelvic cavity or large blood vessels, but if it reaches into the cardiac cavity, it causes dyspnea, syncope, edema and palpitation. In addition, sudden death may occur. Age (∼ 50 years), advanced stage of the disease, and incomplete surgical resection are important factors that determine recurrence or prognosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup>\n\nAlthough early diagnosis of IVLM is difficult, typical MRI findings in advanced cases indicate a tumor arising from uterine leiomyoma and having a “worm-like” appearance in the pelvic vein.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8–10]</u></a></sup> In the present case, a pelvic mass containing images of worm-like structures extending into the veins was observed, and it was considered a typical MRI finding of IVLM. Occasionally in such cases, a differential diagnosis from low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LG-ESS) is necessary. An MRI of our patient's tumor showed a homogeneous image without intra-tumoral bleeding or necrosis. Furthermore, tumor invasion of LG-ESS into the great vessels is extremely rare,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u></a></sup> so we considered that our patient's tumor was extremely unlikely to be LG-ESS.\n\nSurgical resection is considered the optimal treatment for IVLM and has a good long-term outcome if complete resection is achieved. Total hysterectomy with a sufficient margin, salpingo-oophorectomy, and resection of pelvic veins are effective treatments for extended tumors. There are also some reports of effective removal of a tumor that has reached the vena cava or the heart.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,6,7,9,13]</u></a></sup> However, in cases with residual tumors after resection, recurrence has been observed between 7 months and 15 years after the initial surgery, with a 3-year recurrence rate of 33%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> It has been reported that aromatase inhibitors and GnRH agonists are moderately effective for patients with incompletely resected or inoperable tumors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15]</u></a></sup> Additionally, advanced disease requires multidisciplinary treatment considering tumor infiltration and risk of death.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> Since IVLM generally expresses estrogen receptors, preoperative and postoperative antiestrogens therapies are suggested to facilitate tumor debulking surgery and to prevent recurrence.\n\nIn our patient, IVLM was strongly suspected by preoperative imaging. Moreover, we anticipated that the tumor would be present deep in the pelvis, with a complex spread, and that it would be difficult to resect completely. Preoperative administration of relugolix enabled us to reduce surgical invasion and achieve complete surgical removal, and administration was continued postoperatively to prevent recurrence. Preoperative administration resulted in a remarkable reduction of the tumor size, and arterial embolization immediately before surgery allowed the tumor to be safely and completely removed. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the efficacy of a GnRH antagonist against IVLM. Furthermore, there are very few reports demonstrating the efficacy of preoperative hormone therapy for IVLM, and this might be the first case in which preoperative hormone therapy was effective when combined with subsequent surgery. Complete resection without residual tumor provides the best prognosis for patients with IVLM, so preoperative hormone therapy followed by radical surgery is a reasonable strategy in clinical practice.\n\nRelugolix exerts its effect by directly antagonizing the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland, suppressing the secretion of gonadotropin and, as a result, suppressing the secretion of E2 and progesterone from the ovary. It has been used in Japan for the treatment of uterine leiomyoma since 2019 and has the following properties:\n\nIt avoids the increase in E2 secretion (flare up) seen with GnRH agonists.\n\nMedication compliance is good, owing to oral administration.\n\nSerum E2 concentration rapidly decreases to 20 pg/mL within 24 hours of administration, resulting in rapid onset of effects.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe early effect of relugolix in our patient allowed us to exclude the possibility of uterine sarcoma non-invasively, which helped with the differential diagnosis. In addition, the only side effect reported by the patient was mild hot flushing, and long-term administration was possible. The present case suggests that relugolix may become the first choice of hormone therapy for IVLM, although further experience with relugolix should be accumulated. Furthermore, in our patient, letrozole was administered after relugolix to prevent postoperative recurrence. Aromatase inhibitors were selected to reduce the E2 concentration. We will continue letrozole for as long as it is tolerated, paying attention to any joint pain or osteoporosis.\n\nIn conclusion, the present report is the first to describe a patient with IVLM who showed a remarkable response to the GnRH antagonist relugolix. Preoperative hormone therapy with relugolix followed by radical surgery is a promising strategy for patients with IVLM.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe thank Dr. Nobuyuki Shiraga from the Department of Radiology at Toho University Omori Medical Center for his helpful cooperation.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nMN, SK, TY and YK treated the patient and collected her clinical data.

She described it as a continuous dragging sensation. She denied nausea, vomiting, or fever. Two weeks after the onset of the pain, she noticed frothy and dark-colored urine followed by some pedal edema. The patient also described itching that mainly involved upper limbs and trunk but denied any skin and eye discoloration. Upon presentation, her vitals were within the normal range, and physical examination was remarkable for a palpable liver about 4 cm below the costal margins. She was evaluated with an ultrasound of the abdomen, urine analysis, and basic metabolic panel. The initial workup was significant for hepatomegaly of 18 cm, nephrotic range proteinuria (5.5 gm/d normal range 0.03–0.15 gm/24h), low albumin (19, normal range: 35–52 gm/L) with deranged liver enzymes (Alkaline phosphatase 795, normal range 35–194 U/L, Alanine aminotransferase 108, Aspartate aminotransferase 116, normal range 0–33 U/L) and a minimally elevated calcium (2.58 mmol/L, normal range: 2.15–2.5 mmol/L).

Patient is also planned to be seen in medicine clinic to repeat the AIH workup.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThere are generally 2 types of biliary overlap syndromes, that is, AIH-PSC and AIH- PBC, with a prevalence of 6 and 7 percent, respectively.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Various clinical features of these 3 domains of liver injury can be comparable to each other, that is, jaundice, pruritis, elevated liver enzymes, hence diagnosis can be challenging.\n\nThe diagnosis of AIH can be clinically made if patients have all of the following:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Transaminases at least twice as higher as the upper normal limit (UNL)\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> High IgG levels or at least 1 positive antibody, that is, anti-nuclear antibody/ASMA with at least 1:40 titer, Anti-liver kidney microsomal-1 antibody , anti-Liver Cytosol antibody 1, or anti-soluble liver/liver pancreas antibodies.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Exclusion of Alcoholic, viral, or drug-induced liver injuries.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup>\n\nA liver biopsy is usually required to confirm AIH but is not necessary for the diagnosis of PBC and PSC.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u></a></sup> Patients who fulfill the above criteria or who have histologic features of AIH, but have clinical features of overlap, should be investigated further to rule out concomitant PBC or PSC. This includes patients who present with the serological, immunological, and clinical picture of inflammatory and cholestatic liver injury unusual of the classical presentation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup>\n\nA diagnosis of a concomitant PSC can be confidently made in the presence of all of the following:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Biliary strictures on cholangiogram\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Cholestatic liver injury pattern\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Negative anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) titer<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup>\n\nParis criteria have high sensitivity and specificity (92% and 97%, respectively) to make a diagnosis of AIH-PBC overlap syndrome.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> However, overlap syndrome cannot be excluded entirely with low scores, as these patients may have a less severe form of overlap syndrome.\n\nA diagnosis of a concomitant PBC can be confidently made with Paris criteria (all of the following):\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Interface hepatitis on histology\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Alanine aminotransferase ≥ 5 times the UNL or IgG ≥ 2 times the UNL or positive ASMA\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Alkaline phosphatase ≥ twice the UNL or gamma-glutamyl transferase ≥ 5 times the UNL or positive AMA titer or destructive cholangitis<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup>\n\nAlthough overlap syndrome has been described in combination with primary cutaneous amyloidosis, its association with AL amyloidosis is an infrequent occurrence.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup>\n\nOur patient had an overlap of possible AIH with confirmed PSC, which was found to be secondary to AL amyloidosis. PSC was diagnosed by the cholangiography findings of multifocal central biliary strictures, a cholestatic pattern of the liver injury, and negative AMA. Autoimmune involvement was suspected due to raised transaminases, a significant ASMA titer, classic age, and female sex.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> However, we could not proceed with the biopsy to confirm AIH as the patient refused.\n\nAL amyloidosis is the most common cause of systemic amyloidosis. It occurs due to extra-cellular accumulation of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains typically secreted secondary to a plasma cell proliferative disease.\n\nThe diagnosis of AL amyloidosis can be made by the presence of:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Amyloid-related systemic syndrome (Nephrotic syndrome in our case)\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Positive Congo red staining of amyloid protein from biopsy tissue (Renal and BM biopsies in our case)\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Light-chain-related disease (BM biopsy revealed kappa and lambda light chains in our case)\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Monoclonal plasma cell proliferative disorder (BM biopsy showed at least 8 percent of plasma cells in our case)<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe liver is involved in around 30 percent of cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> However, damage to the biliary channels leading to cholestasis picture is a rare occurrence that can make the diagnosis difficult and may lead to delayed treatment, which in turn can have organ threatening consequences.\n\nThis new entity is a medical dilemma, challenging to diagnose and treat with correction of the primary disease being the cornerstone of the management process. Reduction in the production of the light chains is the most crucial initial step in systemic amyloidosis. With advancements in chemotherapy, there are several options available to treat AL amyloidosis, with melphalan and dexamethasone showing promising results.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> The symptomatic treatment of the resulting overlap syndrome must go hand in hand, along with the primary pathology. Such patients should be started on low dose Ursodeoxycholic acid (13–15 mg/kg/d) for pruritis and corticosteroids if symptoms are severe.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10,13]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe primary aim of treatment in AL amyloidosis is to mitigate the turnover of the proliferation of the toxic plasma cells from the body. Although majority of patients have monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, a subset can progress to develop multiple myeloma. These patients can be treated with immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors lenalidomide and bortezomib.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Other newer drugs include daratumumab and pomalidomide which have shown promising results.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup>\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nAL amyloidosis can very rarely present as AIH-PSC overlap syndrome, manifesting with raised liver enymes, biliary strictures, pruritis and positive liver antibodies. Patients with amyloidosis involving multiple organ systems, especially at a young age, should be worked up to rule out malignancy. The treatment of AIH-PSC overlap syndrome should be accompanied by that of the primary amyloidosis for definitive management.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nAuthors would like to acknowledge Dr Dina Soliman for providing BM histopathology images, Dr Mohamed Ameer Hamza Shah, for providing magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography images and Dr Mohammed Akhtar for providing kidney biopsy Histopathology images.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Case identification and eligibility assessment:** Hammad Shabir Chaudhry\n\n**Critical Review of manuscript and revisions:** Mohamed A Yassin, Salah Suwileh, Fateen Ata\n\n**Initial manuscript writing:** Hammad Shabir Chaudhry, Fateen Ata, Rohit Sharma, Muhammad Yasir.\n\n**Literature review:** All authors\n\n**Review and approval of the final manuscript:** All authors\n\n**Review of manuscript and revisions in gastroenterology part:** Ahmed Elnajjar\n\n**Review of manuscript and revisions in hematology part:** Mohammed Gaber</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:48:37", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:49:05", "cost": 27.446}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:49:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:48:37"}

Computed tomography of his abdomen and pelvis was performed on day 30 of intubation without any significant bony abnormalities. Tylenol and repositioning were used to control pain. He was subsequently extubated after 43 days, stabilized, and admitted for acute rehabilitation for ICU-associated weakness 15 days later. He had 4/5 strength in his bilateral upper extremities and bilateral hallux dorsiflexion and ankle plantarflexion, 3/5 in bilateral ankle dorsiflexion and knee extension, and 2/5 bilateral hip extension. His voice was also hoarse upon presentation. He continued to experience worsening hip pain, which was somewhat relieved with medications such as tylenol, robaxin, and lidocaine patches. The pain eventually transitioned to bilateral and limited his movements during therapy sessions. Bilateral hip radiographs were obtained on rehabilitation day 35 (day 103 of overall hospitalization), which demonstrated Booker Grade 3 HO on the right and Booker Grade 2 on the left .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nPelvis and bilateral hip X-ray showing nonspecific soft tissue mineralization about the medial right femoral neck that is new since a computed tomography (CT) two months prior and increased in conspicuity compared to an X-ray one month prior.</u>\n\n3 Assessment/results\n--------------------\n\nThe patient was unable to take NSAIDs, a common HO prophylaxis agent, due to his COVID-19 anticoagulation requirements (apixaban 5 mg twice a day), which could have increased the risk of bleeding and stroke. Therefore, the endocrine system was consulted to determine if bisphosphonate therapy could help. They advised against the use of this type of medication because it is not used often anymore for HO, and there is no solid evidence for its use in pre-established HO. Subsequently, radiation oncology was consulted to determine whether RT would be an option. Similarly, they deemed it unlikely to help this patient and advised against it due to the lack of evidence that it can help previously established HO. The patient proceeded with symptomatic treatment, including tylenol, tizanidine, and lidocaine patches. Additionally, PT was performed to increase the ROM of both hips. He attended 60 minutes of PT, occupational therapy and speech language pathology daily. He performed active and passive ROM exercises in PT and with the help of nursing staff between therapies. Midway through his rehabilitation stay, the patient's active ROM of the hip was 124 °on the right and 134 °on the left. The passive ROM was 135 °on the right and 105 °on the left. Throughout the course of therapy, ROM continued to improve, and the pain continued to improve. An outpatient orthopedics consult was placed to see if surgery would be an option when HO was mature, which they suggested could be. The patient continued with daily PT, occupational therapy, and speech language pathology and was discharged from rehab two months after admission. At discharge, his HO pain had decreased and was well-controlled with tizanidine, PT, and as needed Tylenol. He was not started on NSAIDs after recovering from COVID-19 and was still on his twice daily 5 mg apixaban for his history of recurrent PEs.\n\n4 Discussion\n------------\n\nProlonged intubation and ICU stay are risk factors for the development of HO and should be considered early on admission. Prompt prophylaxis against or early identification of HO with rapid initiation of treatment with aggressive ROM and pain control should be initiated. There have been many studies looking at how to treat HO prophylactically. RT works because osteogenic precursor cells are radiosensitive.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Another study noted that recurrence of hip HO after surgery with RT prophylaxis was about 10%, compared to 30% without prophylaxis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> A drawback of RT is that it may increase the risk of cancer in treated individuals.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Although the dose is low for prophylaxis, many treated patients are elderly. More studies are needed to examine younger patients and have longer follow-up periods to adequately address this risk.\n\nRT for established HO has not been well studied. Three papers discussed this topic. The first was a case report of two patients with established HO treated with RT.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> They noted decreased pain and increased ROM in both patients; however, no radiographic changes occurred. The authors noted that the decreased pain may have been due to some possible active HO formation occurring and pain receptors being ablated by treatment. The second is a report of three patients with neurogenic HO who were treated with radiation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Pain decreased as ROM increased. X-rays reported no more growth, and all of the results remained consistent at 4–6 months of follow-up. They contribute to radiation by halting the differentiation of osteoblasts and ablating pain receptors. The last report looked at one patient with traumatic brain injury.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Because the patient's pain was refractory to indomethacin, radiation was administered. Pain and alkaline phosphatase levels decreased, but pancytopenia occurred. New HO was formed in the patient's shoulder; however, no new HO was formed in the treated locations. Although these studies suggest that radiologic improvement is unlikely, there are promising pain relief and ROM improvements with this therapy option. RT for this patient's established HO was not warranted due to his possible continuous inflammatory state, timeframe from HO formation, and clinical condition while working to get better and improve strength and fatigue in rehabilitation.\n\nBalboni et al noted that indomethacin treatment (25 mg three times a day) for 5 to 6 weeks after surgery can significantly decrease the chance of HO formation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Despite the positive results, the study showed a slight increase in the risk of nonunion of long bone fractures compared to another commonly used modality, RT. When indomethacin and RT (800cGy) were compared within 3 days postoperatively, Burd et al found no significant difference between the two therapies for HO formation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Although NSAIDs are a common prophylactic treatment, they are not advised in patients on anticoagulation treatment, such as in this patient, because of the increased risk of bleeding and strokes.\n\nSeveral studies have shown the relationship between HO and COVID-19. Stoira et al noted that HO was significantly associated with longer mechanical ventilation for each additional week.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Of note, the HO rate was found to be four times higher than the rate of HO in patients with acute respiratory distress, likely due to systemic inflammatory conditions and local myositis. A letter in response to this article talked about three patients with COVID-19 who underwent surgery for HO.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> They noted that HO was likely due to prolonged inflammation and that there are many similarities between HO after COVID-19 and neurogenic HO, including risks, morphology, and development, so it should be treated as a neurogenic HO. Another case examined the timing of HO formation in four COVID-19 positive patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> They noted that pain occurred 40 days after extubation in the groin and hip, and 30 days after extubation in the shoulder. HO caused joint and muscle pain, soft tissue swelling, erythema, and heat 4–12 weeks post-onset. Actual bone maturation occurred after 6 months. They urge that early and continuous mobilization is needed to prevent pain and increase ROM.\n\nBisphosphonates have also been used as prophylaxis against HO formation. More recent evidence suggests that they only prevent mineralization of the ectopic bone matrix, so ossification can occur once the agent is discontinued.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Additionally, they may lead to impaired fracture healing, which can often be comorbid with spinal cord injuries and traumatic brain injuries, suggesting that it is not a great option for patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup>\n\nSurgery is an option for established HO. This is usually used when HO is severe and causes significant pain, swelling, and/or decreased ROM.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Some contraindications to surgery include inadequate soft tissue envelopes or inability to participate in rehabilitation afterwards. Additionally, surgery for HO is not often performed in the first 12–18 months of onset due to increased risk of recurrence and bone not all being fully mature yet.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Because of this, these patients often miss a key rehabilitation period.\n\nThere are also many conservative treatments for HO. These include medications such as tylenol, lidocaine patches, and muscle relaxers, as well as modalities such as icing, movement, and stretching. The goal of therapy is pain control and continuous mobilization to improve ROM and function. These measures are often attempted before RT or surgery. Additionally, these can be used for people who are not surgical candidates due to recent HO formation before the 12–18-month timeframe, comorbid conditions and others.\n\nThe next steps for this patient include continuing his medication regimen and therapies to increase ROM and hopefully decrease pain and inflammation as well as surgery to remove the HO in the future once clinically stable enough and within a good HO operating timeframe (plus radiation prophylaxis), or RT whenever he has another surgery or trauma in the future. The strengths of this study include the exploration of an array of treatment options and quality imaging to show what the patient's HO looks like. Limitations include this being a case report of only one patient and the retrospective nature of the study.\n\n5 Conclusion\n------------\n\nHO is a known complication in COVID-19 patients requiring extended intubation, which presents unique treatment challenges related to this diagnosis. Although there are well-researched treatment options for HO prophylaxis, more research is warranted to identify ways to treat established HO. Due to the lack of literature support, it is unclear whether RT would benefit patients with established HO. Focusing on controlling a patient's pain and improving their ROM are the main modalities used to control established HO. More research is needed to look at surgical options and prophylactic measures in COVID-19 positive patients to be able to manage their HO appropriately and ensure that they can recover well.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization**: Natalie Van Ochten, Akhil Shori, Matthew A.

Attempts to control vascular inflammation using other immunosuppressive treatments, such as methotrexate or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, have not been validated clinically.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> In patients with GCA, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is usually up-regulated within the inflamed arteries and its serum concentrations are elevated.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-interleukin (IL) 6 receptor antibody, has been shown to be effective in patients with GCA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Giant-Cell Arteritis Actemra (GiACTA), a double-blind trial of TCZ for GCA treatment, demonstrated the clinical efficacy of TCZ, which allowed the tapering GCs doses needed to manage GCA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Although the results demonstrated that TCZ combined with GC prevented the relapse of GCA during GC tapering, recent reports suggested that TCZ monotherapy may suppress the vascular inflammation in certain patients with GCA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> In this report, we present a case of GCA with the advanced temporal artery stenosis. The patients were initiated on TCZ monotherapy which resulted in the rapid eradiation of the clinical manifestations as well as the resolution of vascular inflammation and stenosis.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nAn 87-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital for examination of temporal headache. One month prior to the admission, he presented with newly-onset right-sided headache, which radiated to the neck, and lasted for 4 hours. Analgesic medications relieved the pain, however, the frequency of pain gradually increased. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed no findings that cause temporal headache. The patient was referred to our hospital for further examination.\n\nThe patient denied jaw claudication, polymyalgia or visual disturbance. His previous medical history was significant for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cerebral infarction. On admission, his body temperature was 36.5°C and his blood pressure was 131/56 mmHg. Clinical examination of the patient was unremarkable except for the detection of distended right temporal artery with tenderness. Laboratory data  showed a decrease of hemoglobin and albumin levels. In addition, c-reactive protein level of 7.60 mg/dL, erythrocytes sedimentation rate of 65 mm/hr, serum amyloid A of 445 μg/mL, and IL-6 of 16 pg/mL, which are useful biomarker for GCA,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> were elevated. Additionally, anti-U1RNP antibody test was positive with low titers . Color duplex sonography (CDS) imaging showed thickening of the wall of the right temporal arteries and luminal stenosis . A biopsy of the right superficial temporal artery was performed. Pathological findings revealed the formation of granuloma with lymphocyte infiltration and multiple giant cells in arterial wall, accompanied by destruction of the wall structure . These findings suggested the presence of GCA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> The clinical course is summarized in Figure 3. The patient was diagnosed with GCA based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) GCA‘s criteria.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Because on his age and cardiovascular risk, he received TCZ according to the approved dose (162 mg, subcutaneously once weekly) by Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan. After the initial dose of TCZ, laboratory data showed a decrease in white blood cells 通用删除1(英):<u>(WBC; 1700/μl, Fig. 3)</u>. Due to the TCZ-related leukopenia, oral prednisolone (PSL) (20 mg/d) was prescribed. After the recovery of WBC counts, he received second injection with the reduced dose of TCZ (162 mg, biweekly injection). The patient responded well to the TCZ treatment, which resulted in the eradication of temporal headache after 3 weeks from the start of TCZ. Laboratory data at 4 weeks from the start of TCZ showed normalized C-reactive protein (≤0.10 mg/dL) and serum amyloid A (< 4.0 μg/ml) values concomitant with the improvement of temporal artery wall dilatation. Oral PSL doses were successfully tapered to 5 mg/d under the TCZ treatment (162 mg, biweekly injection) without recurrence of headache. A biweekly dose of TCZ of 162 mg subcutaneous injection was continued in combination with prednisolone (5 mg/d) during 8 months from the start of TCZ. The follow-up CDS examination was performed 5 months later. As shown in Figure 1 (C, D), the right temporal artery examination showed a marked reduction of the halo sign, and a strong reperfusion flow was evident.\n\nTable 1 - Laboratory findings and cytokine profile on admission.\n\n| Peripheral blood |  | Immunoserological tests |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Red blood cells | 361×104/μL |  C-reactive protein | 7.60 mg/dL (<0.30) |\n|  Hemoglobin | 10.3 g/dL |  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate | 65 mm/hr (<15) |\n|  Hematocrit | 30.6% |  Serum amyloid A | 445 μg/mL (<8.0) |\n|  Platelet | 41.5 × 104/μL |  IgG | 2,531 mg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(861-1,747)</u> |\n|  White blood cells | 3,600 /μL |  IgA | 291 mg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(93–393)</u> |\n|   Neutriphil | 56.0% |  IgM | 80 mg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(50–269)</u> |\n|   Eosinophil | 1.0% |  Immunoelectrophoresis | No M-peak |\n|   Monocyte | 22.0% |  Complement 3 | 132 mg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(73–138)</u> |\n|   Lymphocyte | 21.0% |  Complement 4 | 29 mg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(11–31)</u> |\n|   Baso | 0% |  ANA | < × 80 Speckled 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–159)</u> |\n|  |  |  Anti-ds-DNA Ab | (−) (<9.9) |\n| Blood chemistry |  |  Anti-U1RNP Ab | 9.7 U/mL (+) (<4.9) |\n|  Total protein | 7.5 g/dL |  Anti-SSA Ab | \\>240 U/mL (+) (<6.9) |\n|  Total bilirubin | 0.7 mg/dL |  Anti-SSB Ab | (−) (<6.9) |\n|  Albumin | 3.0 g/dL |  PR3-ANCA | (−) (<2.0 U/mL) |\n|  Asparate aminotransferase | 22 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(13–30)</u> |  MPO-ANCA | (−) (<3.5 U/mL) |\n|  Alanine aminotransferase | 16 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(10–42)</u> |  HBs Ag | (−) |\n|  Lactate dehydrogenase | 185 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(124–222)</u> |  Anti-HCV Ab | (−) |\n|  Alkaline phosphatase | 208 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(106–322)</u> |  β-D glucan | <6.0 (0–11.0) |\n|  Creatine Kinase | 67 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(59–248)</u> |  Interleukin-6 | 16 pg/mL (<4.0) |\n|  Blood urea nitrogen | 17 mg/dL |  |  |\n|  Cr | 0.79 mg/dL | Urinalysis |  |\n|  Ferritin | 157 ng/mL |  Blood | (2+) |\n|  Na | 140 mEq/L |  Protein | (±) |\n|  K | 4.1 mEq/L |  Dysmorphic red blood cell | (+) |\n|  Cl | 104 mEq/L |  |  |\n\nANA = anti-nuclear antibody, HBsAg = hepatitis B v, IgA = immunoglobulin A, IgG = immunogolobulin G, IgM = immunoglobulin M, MPO-ANCA = myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, PR3-ANCA = proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nColor duplex sonography images of the right temporal artery.

Importantly, eradication of clinical inflammatory symptoms and acute phase reactants, which are useful biomarkers for GCA,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> preceded the resolution of the stenosis as well as the wall thickening of temporal artery. Large vessel involvements due to GCA are common, and could lead to vascular complications, such as stenosis or dissection of these vessels.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> In addition, there is uncertainty regarding the potential influence of steroids on the atherosclerosis that affects large vessels.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Another complication associated with the use of GCs to treat GCA is the persistent vascular inflammation despite the apparent clinical control of the disease. Repeated temporal artery biopsy demonstrated that GC treatment may not suppress vascular inflammation in GCA even at high doses.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup>\n\nBiologic therapeutics have emerged recently as potentially effective treatments for large vessel vasculitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> There is a strong rationale in support of the treatment of GCA using biologics based on the data from randomized clinical trial of TCZ.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> The data demonstrated the potential efficacy of TCZ under the combination of GCs in induction of disease remission.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Furthermore, sustained glucocorticoid-free remission was demonstrated in the clinical trial using TCZ combined with tapered prednisone, in which primary outcome was the rate of glucocorticoid-free remission in GCA patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> More recently, TCZ was demonstrated to induce remission when used as monotherapy in the treatment of large vessels arteritis including GCA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> However, there is little evidence to support the benefit of TCZ in the repair of the advanced vascular damage, such as vessel stenosis or occlusion in patients with GCA. Clinical outcomes in patients with GCA depend on the degree of vascular involvements.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> Vascular failures, such as impaired vision, are generally higher in patients with cranial GCA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> Large vessel stenosis can also result in serious ischemic complication in patients with GCA. Therefore, the major goal of the treatment of GCA is to prevent ischemic damage and halt the progression of cranial artery stenosis. Although GC is the mainstay of therapy for GCA, their long-term use is associated with the morbidity related to their AEs such as atherosclerosis. There is no clear evidence that supports the use of immunosuppressant drugs for the treatment of GCA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Anti-cytokine treatments have been considered as optional therapies for refractory GCA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> Combining TCZ with GCs had been demonstrated to reduce the GC doses needed to manage GCA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> In our case, TCZ treatment resulted in the disappearance of the halo sign, leading the normalization of the stenotic temporal artery, after 5 months of initiation of TCZ treatment. Long-term outcomes and vascular morbidity data are still needed to determine the effectiveness of immunosuppressive treatments for GCA.\n\nUltrasound (US) techniques could detect the vascular inflammation and damage in patients with GCA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> The utility of US as an imaging modality for the follow-up of vascular mortality in patients with GCA is well-established.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> CDS is a technique that assesses the vascular wall inflammation and the lumen, which enables the measurement of blood flow.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> Therefore, CDS is considered to be useful for the diagnosis and assessment of the vascular damage associated with GCA. Little information is available regarding the assessment of the vascular inflammation or damage associated with GCA during the follow-up periods. Collectively, we documented the resolution of vascular inflammation and stenosis using CDS imaging method in patients with active GCA. During the treatment course, in addition to the early blunting of the acute phase markers and disappearance of symptoms, resolution of the thickening of the vessel wall and stenosis in temporal arteries was confirmed by CDS at 5 months following the initiation of TCZ treatment. These findings suggest that GCA could be successfully treated in naïve patients using TCZ monotherapy, and follow-up CDS studies are useful in monitoring the effect of TCZ through the detection important clinical outcomes such as vascular damage.\n\nThere are several limitations of this case control study. First, a single case report is not sufficient to confirm the efficacy of TCZ compared with a control group receiving standard treatment. Additionally, the relatively short observation periods may not be sufficient to confirm the drug long-term efficacy. Nevertheless, this case report demonstrated that newly diagnosed patient with GCA responded to the TCZ monotherapy. Additional analysis is still needed to determine the optimal length and parameters of the infusion protocols of TCZ for GCA patients receiving minimal dose of GCs.\n\n4 Conclusions\n-------------\n\nThe present case with GCA was successfully managed by TCZ with complete resolution of temporal artery stenosis as demonstrated by CDS imaging. The resolution of temporal artery stenosis may represent a favorable response to TCZ, since the GCs were used at low doses due to the TCZ-related leukopenia. Thus, TCZ treatment as a monotherapy resulted in the resolution of vascular stenosis. Additional clinical studies are needed to establish the long-term efficacy and the appropriate TCZ treatment regimens.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Haruki Matsumoto, Tomoyuki Asano, Erina Suzuki, Yuichiro Kiko, Osamu Suzuki, Mitsuko Matsuda, Shuzo Sato, Makiko Yashiro-Furuya, Jumpei Temmoku, Yuya Fujita, Naoki Matsuoka, Hiroshi Watanabe.\n\n**Supervision:** Kiyoshi Migita.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Haruki Matsumoto, Kiyoshi Migita.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Haruki Matsumoto, Kiyoshi Migita</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:03:02", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:03:27", "cost": 24.812}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:03:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:03:01"}

The urorectal septum malformation sequence (URSMS) was first reported in 1987, and is characterized by absence of urethral and vaginal perineal openings, imperforate anus, and internal genitourinary anomalies, including hypoplastic bladder/rectum/urethra/uterus, uro-rectal-vaginal fistulae, Müllerian duct defects, and impaired kidney function.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> This case report describes a patient with anal atresia diagnosed after birth and a remnant retrocaval ureter, colon cyst with giant calculus diagnosed in his fourth decade of life.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 40-year-old man presented to the emergency department with complaints of acute pain in the right lower abdomen. His medical history was significant for anal atresia (surgically treated), gallstones, and sialolithiasis. The patient's birth history was not recorded. The patient denied any family history of URSMS. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the right ureteral course, with normal appearing external genitalia. Anal examination was not performed as the patient declined. The complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry, and coagulation profile showed white blood cells 12.10 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (normal range: 4–10 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), neutrophils 9.95 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (normal range: 1.8–6.3 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), lymphocytes 1.07 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (normal range: 1.1–3.2 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), and monocytes 0.63 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (normal range: 0.003–1.3 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Urine analysis revealed protein 2+ (normal: negative), blood 2+ (normal: negative), ketones +(normal: negative), white blood cells 49/uL (normal: <5/uL), and red blood cells 301/uL (normal: negative). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the whole abdomen revealed calculus in the right retrocaval ureter, an enlarged upper urinary tract and renal pelvis, which caused acute pain in this patient , and hydronephrosis. The proximal ureter assumed a reverse J persisting 1 cm past the margin of the inferior vena cava (IVC), indicating a type I retrocaval ureter, leading to reversed formation of the ureter, creating an environment for ureter calculi formation. There was a round giant calculus measuring 8.2 cm × 6.2 cm × 7.3 cm in the pelvic cavity cyst close to the bladder (on the right side), with bladder and seminal vesicle glands compressed . The cyst was connected to the prostatic urethra. The bilateral seminal vesicle glands and prostate gland were normal but appeared compressed by giant calculi. However, the patient did not present with frequent micturition. The cystoscope showed duplicated urethra arising from the prostatic urethra, one leading to a normal depressed bladder with ureter, and the other leading to a complete cyst without ureter . To remove the giant calculus, cystolithotomy lithotomy was performed, and the pelvic cavity cyst was incised. Postoperative retrograde pyelography showed that the cyst was connected to the prostatic urethra and shared a common urinary tract with the normal bladder, with absence of calculus, which confirmed the preoperative CT observation of the duplicated urethra . Pathological examination revealed that the cyst originated from the colon tissue . Thus, the diagnosis of URSMS was confirmed. However, further genetic tests were not performed as the patient refused. The patient underwent a stable postoperative course for 1 month without recurrence. To rebuild the retrocaval ureter and remove the calculus, the patient underwent a secondary surgery procedure with laparoscopic ureteroureterostomy and ureteroneocystostomy. Post-surgical CT showed that the right ureter was reconstructed and assumed a normal position passing anterior to the IVC. The patient underwent a stable postoperative course for 3 months without recurrence or complications.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nAbdomen computed tomography showing the right ureter passing behind the inferior vena cava.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nPelvic computed tomography showing the large calculus (right) with depressed bladder (left).</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nCystoscopy showing duplicated urethra arising from prostatic urethra, one leading to normal compressed bladder with ureter, and the other 1 leading to a complete cyst.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 4:\n\nPost-operation retrograde pyelography showing the cyst connected to the prostatic urethra and sharing a common urinary tract with the normal bladder.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 5:\n\nThe histopathology showing large amounts of digestive glands, which suggests the cyst was made of colon tissue.</u>\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nMultiple developmental abnormalities were observed in this case, especially the genitourinary system and digestion system, including retrocaval ureter, anal atresia, and colon duct cyst.\n\nRetrocaval ureter is a congenital anomaly of venous development, occurring in 1:1000 live births.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> It occurs predominantly on the right ureter, in which the ureter passes behind the IVC. This is due to abnormal embryologic development of the IVC, in which the major portion of the infrarenal IVC persists ventral to the ureter, resulting in compression of the ureter. It usually manifests in the third or fourth decade.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> There are 2 types of retrocaval ureter.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> In type I, also named “low loop” form, the proximal ureter descends to the level of third or fourth lumbar vertebra and turns back in the shape of a reverse “J” to pass behind the lateral margin of the IVC. Type I is also associated with moderate to severe hydronephrosis. In type II, also named “high loop,” the ureter passes behind the IVC at the level of the ureteropelvic junction. Type II retrocaval ureters are rare and usually do not cause obstruction. Patients with symptoms and moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis are recommended for surgical treatment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> CT of this patient showed that the proximal ureter assumed a reverse J persisting 1 cm past the margin of the IVC, indicating a type I retrocaval ureter, leading to reversed formation of the ureter, creating an environment for ureter calculi formation. The patient's past history showed that he had gallstones and sialolithiasis, which indicated that the patient was susceptible to stone formation compared to the normal population. In this case, the patient underwent ureteroneocystostomy, and the postoperative CT showed that the normal structure of the ureter was restored, which may prevent the formation of new calculi in this patient.\n\nThe patient was born with anal atresia, which is one of the most frequent congenital anomalies occurring in 1: 2000–5000 deliveries. Half of them present with VACTERL (vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac malformations, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> In this patient, however, only isolated anal atresia was present. Among the 4.6 million deliveries in 33 European countries, there were 1846 cases of anal anomalies, and 672 (36%) cases were isolated cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> The report also indicated the morphologic divisions of anal atresia, including supralevator and infralevator anal atresia, with or without fistula, congenital anal fistula presenting with cloaca, which indicates the differences in characteristics between divisions of anal atresia, and the complicated disorders occurring during the development period. Minor developmental disturbances that occur during progenitor formation or later periods of blastogenesis may lead to isolated anal atresia. Furthermore, a small disturbance occurring in the later stage of blastogenesis may generate milder monotopic disorder, leading to an isolated disturbance during late blastogenesis that may produce a milder monotopic defect, resulting in a single anomaly.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe patient was initially diagnosed as “mesonephric duct cyst,” because the cystoscopy showed the cyst was connected to the prostatic urethra and shared a common urinary tract. Mesonephric duct cyst is a benign cystic structure arising from the mesonephric duct, which develop into hemitrigone, bladder neck, urethra, seminal vesicle, vas deferens, efferent ducts, epididymis, and paradidymis during male embryogenesis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> The embryological genitourinary system develops around the 13th to 22nd week. The pronephros is nonfunctional and regresses by the end of 4th week. The mesonephros functions as the primary kidney, and remnants form several male genital structures. The mesonephric cord contacts and fuses with the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct. The ureteric bud grows from the mesonephric duct and develops into the renal pelvis. The kidneys develop from both metanephric mesoderm (blastema) and ureteric bud, which occurs from 5th week to 32nd week. The anorectal and urogenital channels share a common passage until 5th week and separate into the urogenital sinus and anal canal by the urorectal septum. In males, the urogenital sinus develops into the urinary bladder. The inferior part becomes the pelvic and penile urethra, and the pelvic part becomes the prostatic and membranous portions of the urethra. When the mesonephric duct cysts become large, they hold urine like the bladder.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9–11]</u></a></sup> Mesonephric duct cyst is frequently reported in females, named “Gartner's duct cyst.” Mesonephric duct remain as vestigial structures and are usually diagnosed on physical examination showing a cyst connected to the vagina.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup>\n\nAbnormalities associated with URSMS include the presence of ambiguous genitalia, absence of urethral and vaginal openings, imperforate anus, hypoplastic bladder/rectum/urethra/uterus, uro-rectal-vaginal fistulae, Müllerian duct defects, and impaired kidney function.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> This case reports a pathologically confirmed colon duct cyst connected to the urethra, forming a “double urethra” with anal atresia, which led to a diagnosis of URSMS. Calculus is not a common presentation. The URSMS is usually discovered in early childhood. The late presentation in this case was because the patient could not afford medical treatment, and he reported to the hospital only because of the pain due to calculus.\n\nThe term ‘urorectal septum malformation sequence’ was first described by Escobar<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> to describe anomalies arising from failure of migration of and/or fusion of the urorectal septum with the cloacal membrane, including ambiguous genitalia, lack of perineal openings, and müllerian and urinary tract anomalies. Another form of URSMS, the ‘partial urorectal sequence’, was described by Wheeler and Weaver<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> including a single perineal/anal opening that drained a common cloaca in combination with an absent (imperforate) anus. The partial URSMS includes a variety of external genital malformations, and males tend to have a wider range of genital malformations, including hypospadias, bifid scrotum, penoscrotal transposition, an absent penis, and different renal anomalies, including unilateral agenesis, multicystic dysplasia, and hydronephrosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup>\n\nMultiple theories have been proposed to explain the development of URSMS. The URSMS includes a full urorectal septum malformation sequence and a partial urorectal sequence. The mechanism underlying URSMS development remains unknown. The most accepted theory was that early in week 4–6, during urogenital and anal orifice formation, the urorectal sequence, consisting of the mesoderm, extends until it fuses with the cloacal membrane, resulting in an anterior urogenital sinus and a posterior rectal canal. In week 7, the 2 membranes ruptures and creates an environment for the anus, genital, and urinary systems.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> Escobar<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> suggested that this failure of migration and/or fusion of the urorectal septum with the cloacal membrane leads to persistence of the cloaca and cloacal membrane, resulting in the absence of urethral and vaginal openings and anal atresia. Weaver<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> suggested that both partial and full urorectal septum malformation are divisions of disorders caused by abnormal septation of the urorectal septum. The complete absence of breakdown of the cloacal membrane and abnormal urorectal septum development leads to a full URSMS. Meanwhile, partial breakdown of the cloacal membrane led to the presence of a single perineal/anal opening in the partial URSMS. The lack of caudal mesodermal cells in the caudal region of the embryo contributes to the incomplete descent of the urorectal septum and deficient development of the hindgut. Abnormal induction of the early external genital structures and/or lack of the mesoderm to form these structures contributes to abnormalities of the external genitalia. In females, the internal genital anomalies may result from mechanical interference by the persistent cloaca, or due to a deficiency of the mesoderm required to develop into different organs and result in a bifid vagina and uterus. Mesrobian et al built a mouse model and showed that etretinate, which is a potent teratogen, could lead to a variety of abnormalities that are recognized as constituting caudal regression, including spina bifida, imperforate anus, genitourinary anomalies, omphalocele, and limb anomalies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> Jo Mauch T built a lamb model and showed that teratogen could be a possible etiologic factor.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\nRecent studies have shown that some gene mutations can lead to URSMS.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u></a></sup> Shh and the Shh-responsive transcription factors Gli2 and Gli3 have been shown to be involved in mammalian foregut development.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19–21]</u></a></sup> In mice model, it has been shown that Shh-responsive transcription factors Gli2 and Gli3 were crucial to hindgut development. Absent of Shh, Gli2, and Gli3 leads to a spectrum of congenital anorectal malformations in mutant mice, similar to pediatric patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> Ephrin-B2 and the ephrin receptors EphB2 and EphB3 are cell surface molecules essential in the developing nervous system and play important roles in cell adhesion events that tubularize the urethra and partition the urinary tracts. It has been shown that mice lacking ephrin-B2 present a fully penetrant failure in cloacal septation. Animals showed severe anorectal malformations characterized by an absence of the rectum and formation of a fistula that aberrantly connects the intestines to the urethra at the base of the bladder. The study showed that Eph and ephrin molecules play important roles in midline cell–cell adhesion and fusion events.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup>\n\nUrorectal septal malformation is a complicated congenital anomaly resulting from a failure of fusion of the urorectal septum with the cloacal membrane. This case presented with a rare urorectal septal malformation, resulting in giant calculi formation and anal atresia. The patient underwent surgery to treat his anal atresia immediately after delivery, but the colon cyst remained until his fourth decade with a giant calculus, which also suggested that the urorectal septum malformation did not affect his routine daily life. The most likely explanation is that during the early stage of embryo development, the urorectal septum did not fully form, leading to a colon cyst connecting to the real urethra. For some reason, the colon duct ended with a cyst, misleading us to the diagnosis of a mesonephric duct cyst before the pathology report. However, this cyst cannot drain urine as efficiently as the real bladder, resulting in giant calculi development in the cyst. The reason for calculus formation is unknown. The diagnosis was challenging, and pathology was needed not only to confirm the diagnosis but also to understand the embryogenesis of the digestive system and genitourinary system.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Xue Zeng.\n\n**Data curation:** Xue Zeng.\n\n**Investigation:** Jing-Jing Yao.\n\n**Supervision:** Bo Xiao, Bo-Xing Su, Jian-Xing Li.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Xue Zeng.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Xue Zeng, Bo Xiao, Bo-Xing Su, Chao-Yue Ji.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:43:10", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:45:47", "cost": 157.073}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:45:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:43:09"}

The size of perianal BCC is small and is found to be less than 2 cm.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3–5]</u></a></sup> Here. we present a patient with a condyloma-like huge peri-anal BCC.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 60-year-old Chinese man presented with a progressively growing perianal mass that had been growing for 8 years. The diameter of the perianal mass was ultimately up to 7 cm, accompanied by intermittent bleeding, with no significant personal or family history and no history of anogenital warts, sexually transmitted disease, malignancy, inflammatory dermatosis, or arsenic exposure. Physical examination revealed a huge exophytic condyloma-like nodular lesion approximately 5.5 × 7 cm in size with surface ulceration just below the anal verge. Digital examination of the rectum yielded normal results and no other pathological findings on whole-body examination . Laboratory test results were normal; HIV, HSV, and syphilis serology results were negative. The colonoscopy yielded normal results. Histopathological evaluation of a punch biopsy specimen revealed BCC. A total excision was performed . Because the tumor was very close to the anus. We removed part of the external sphincter, and transverse colostomy was performed to prevent feces from contaminating the wound. The size of gross specimen was 5.5 × 7 cm, Postoperative pathological result was BCC, The results of immunohistochemical marker was CK20(+), CDX-2(−), CK7(−), SMA(+), CEA(−), AE1/AE3(−), Ki67(65%+), Her2(−), GCDFP15(−), S-100(−), HMB45(−), BER-Ep4(+), and part of the specimen's incisal margin was infiltrated by cancer (, so local radiotherapy was required. However, the wound healing was poor and a sinus gradually formed, so local radiotherapy was delayed. Tunnel thread-drawing therapy for drainage was implemented 28 days after surgery , and potassium permanganate sitz bath was performed. After a month of recovery, we removed the thread-drawing drainage and started local radiotherapy (absorbed dose total (DT) 60Gray (Gy)/30fraction) and the wound healed completely . Stoma reversal was conducted 4 months after surgery and postoperative anal function was satisfactory. Physical examination and enhanced CT of the head, chest, and abdomen were conducted at 6 months and one year after surgery, and no signs of recurrence or metastasis were detected. Furthermore, the patient was asymptomatic at one-year follow-up.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nExophytic nodular lesion approximately 5.5 × 7 cm in size with surface ulceration just below the anal verge (Knee-chest position).</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nThe wound after tumor removal.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nThe wound after sutured with a drainage strip.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 4:\n\nThe specimen after total excision, exophytic condyloma-like nodular lesion approximately 5.5 × 7 cm in size with surface ulceration.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 5:\n\nThe postoperative pathological result, Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stain (original magnification 100x) showing anastomosing cords of basaloid cells with overlying connection to epidermis and stromal retraction.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 6:\n\nThe tunnel thread-drawing therapy for drainage on 28 days after surgery.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 7:\n\nThe completely healed wound 2 months after surgery.</u>\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nBCC is usually a small, slow-growing skin malignancy that arises from the basal layer of the epidermis. It is primarily caused by heavy episodic and chronic sun exposure and rarely metastasizes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Perianal BCC is an uncommon skin malignancy,0.2% of all anorectal cancers are BCC, and less than 0.08% of BCC are located in the perianal region.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u></a></sup> A review of the literature reveals that it is more commonly present in the male sex (80% of the patients), and the mean presentation age varies from to 65–75 years.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> The etiopathogenesis of perianal BCC includes chronic trauma such as itching, chronic dermatitis, nevoid BCC syndrome, p53 mutation, immune deficiency, sexually transmitted disease and arsenic exposure.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,9]</u></a></sup> The majority of the perianal BCC are less than 2 cm.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> BCC is difficult to diagnose and is often overlooked as an inflammatory dermatosis because it is uncommon and is located in an inconspicuous skin area. The classic histology of perianal BCC reveals peripheral palisading and peritumoral slits.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Immunohistochemical staining is also useful because perianal BCC usually displays diffuse and strong staining for SMA and Ber-EP4,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10–12]</u></a></sup> while basaloid squamous cell carcinoma does not.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Positive immunohistochemical reactivity with pancytokeratin, EMA, and CEA is not consistent with perianal BCC and may suggest a diagnosis of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe standard treatment is wide local resection.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,13]</u></a></sup> Although Mohs micrographic surgery is generally used in patients with large lesions, it requires specialized training and has a longer operating time and higher cost.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> So in this case we performed local wide resection, and because the tumor was very close to anus, we removed part of the external sphincter. Furthermore, to prevent feces from contaminating the wound, transverse colostomy was conducted. However, the tumor was huge, and the wound healing was poor and a sinus gradually formed, for which thread-drawing drainage and potassium permanganate sitz bath were performed. For a few BCC patients with invasion proximal to the dentate line or anal sphincter, abdominoperineal resection may be needed.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14–15]</u></a></sup> Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for lesions ≥T2, elderly patients, or patients with relevant comorbidities.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14,16]</u></a></sup> In this case, part of the incisal margin of the specimen was infiltrated by cancer, so we performed local radiotherapy (DT60Gy/30fx). BCC has a good prognosis and rarely metastasizes. Two large case series have reported a Five-year survival rate of 100%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,7]</u></a></sup> We achieved a cure with total excision of the lesion combined with radiotherapy in our patient, and no recurrence or metastasis occurred during the 1 year follow-up.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nWe present a case of isolated large perianal BCC in a patient with no known risk factors. For huge perianal BCC, local wide resection is the preferred treatment and because the wound is large and close to the anus, transverse colostomy is needed. However, it is difficult to ensure a safe incisal margin if the tumor size is large, in which case, radiotherapy is also required.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nZhi-ming GAN was in charge of conceptualization, supervision, and writing – original draft, Jian-hua XU and Chao ZHANG were in charge of Resources and Visualization, and Ya LUO was in charge of Writing – review & editing.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:16:05", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:16:11", "cost": 5.935}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:16:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:16:05"}

This is due to insufficient awareness of the disease and low screening efforts, with most patients already at an advanced stage at the first time of diagnosis. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of preoperative diagnosis and the necessity of relevant investigations by analyzing a ARMM patient with multiple organ metastases.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 49-year-old male was admitted to the hospital due to altered defecation habits for four years, hematochezia and difficult defecation for two months. His personal history and family history were not significant. He lost 5 kg of weight in 2 months. Rectal examination revealed a 2.0 cm × 1.0 cm mass on the anterior rectal wall at 2 cm from the anus. The mass was hard and poorly mobile, and the finger sleeve withdrawn was without blood staining after rectal examination. Colonoscopy suggested an invasive growth mass with uneven surface located in the rectum about 2 cm from the anus . A tissue biopsy was taken from the lesion site. Pathological results showed MM of the rectum. Under the microscope, the tumor cells submitted for inspection were diffusely distributed in sheets, and there were organ-like structures in some areas . The tumor cells were medium in size, rich in cytoplasm . Nuclei were slightly eosinophilic, with round or oval nuclei, relatively small, with frequent mitotic phenomena .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nColonoscopy findings: A-F, blue arrows point to ARMM.

Intraoperative exploration revealed that there were multiple metastatic nodules of MM on the right liver septum, pelvic peritoneum, and small intestine. About 40 ml of bloody ascites could be seen in the pelvic cavity. The tumor was located under the rectal peritoneal reflection. The excised specimens were 18 cm long and 3 cm in diameter, with the anal canal. A mass measuring 5.0 × 3.2 × 2.5 cm was found 2 cm from the anus.

Only 20% of ARMM cases have obvious melanin deposits.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> So, clinicians need a combination of pathological examination and immunohistochemistry to assist in the diagnosis of patients who have no pigmentation under colonoscopy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,12,13]</u></a></sup> There is no significant difference in mortality between males and females in ARMM, and the incidence is positively correlated with age. The incidence of females is 1.6 to 2.3 times higher than that of males.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> ARMM progresses very rapidly and can metastasize early in the disease via the bloodstream or lymphatic reflux pathway. Interestingly, 7% of patients with brain metastases have no obvious clinical symptoms,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> similar to the ARMM patient with brain metastases reported here. Compared to other anorectal malignancies, the probability of inguinal lymph node metastasis is higher in ARMM than in peri-enteric lymph nodes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup>\n\nAs far as we know, there is no international standardized treatment protocol for ARMM at present. There are various clinical treatment methods for ARMM, such as surgery,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> radiotherapy,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> chemotherapy,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> immunotherapy,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> and targeted therapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23,24]</u></a></sup> Among the clinical treatments, surgery is the first choice for early-stage ARMM patients. Cheung<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> reported that surgery could prolong the survival of ARMM patients even when distant metastases occur. There are two surgical procedures for ARMM: wide local excision (WLE) and APR. In 1995, Brady<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> reported that 90% of long-term surviving patients had been treated by APR, which provided better control of ARMM. In 2002, Ballo<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> suggested that WLE, in conjunction with radiotherapy, could control the local metastasis rate. The superiority of the two procedures, WLE and APR, remains controversial. However, there was no difference between the two in the control of local recurrence.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> Nilsson<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> and Yeh<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> have proposed the importance of ensuring negative surgical margins of the specimen in ARMM procedures. In addition, an advanced ARMM case can achieve a better prognosis when WLE is combined with postoperative adjuvant therapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u></a></sup> The prognosis of ARMM patients is related to tumor size, clinical stage, neurological invasion, and immunotherapy. Suzuki had reported that tumor size (≥243 mm) is a shorter predictor of overall survival (OS) and survival without distant metastasis in patients with MM.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u></a></sup> Slingluff et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u></a></sup> believed that clinical staging is the only prognostic factor of MM. The median survival time of ARMM patients with stage I, II, and III is 24 months, 17 months, and 8 months, respectively, and the 5-year OS rate is 26.7%, 9.8%, and 0, respectively.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u></a></sup> It is obvious that lower the stage of cancer, better the prognosis. In fact, neurological invasion is also an important prognostic factor. After 5 years of follow-up, all patients (65 patients) with neurological invasion have relapsed and died.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u></a></sup> With more research on MM, scholars have found that immunotherapy also has a vital impact on the survival of MM patients. A phase III clinical trial comparing the efficacy of ibritumomab in combination with dacarbazine to dacarbazine plus placebo found that the combination increased the 5-year OS rate from 8.8% to18.2%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u></a></sup> Larkin et al also reported that the 5-year OS of MM patients treated with ipilimumab combined with nivolumab was 60%, and the Progression-free survival (PFS) was 38%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u></a></sup> Even if the lymph node metastasis is positive,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u></a></sup> aggressive treatment of advanced MM patients can lead to better prognosis. Unfortunately, we selected APR for this patient with advanced ARMM without a full assessment of his physical condition which may have led to poor prognosis.\n\nThe definition of primary gastrointestinal MM is that the lesion only occurs in the digestive tract, and there is no apparent primary lesion in skin and eyes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u></a></sup> Currently, there is no standard staging for rectal MM, and the TNM stage of colorectal cancer is usually used. Therefore, we diagnosed the patient as stage IV primary ARMM. ARMM is an intensely aggressive tumor with a high probability of inguinal metastasis. Several enlarged inguinal lymph nodes may also be palpable on physical examination. According to Antoniuk's study,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> simultaneous lymph node dissection is required. In our patient, bilateral inguinal ultrasound suggested benign lymph node lesions, however we missed clearing these lymph nodes during the surgery. Also, the diagnosis of brain metastases was missed because of the absence of preoperative neurological clinical manifestations. Hence, for advanced ARMM, we need to screen for common metastatic sites, such as the liver and brain. The preoperative hepatobiliary and splenic ultrasound in our patient suggested cystic solid changes of 19.6 mm in diameter in the posterior lobe of the right liver, but the nature of the occupying lesion was not further investigated. After reviewing the patient's clinical data again, we realized that this lesion was most likely a liver metastasis. Therefore, we believe that the correct course of treatment is to further refine the abdominal enhancement CT to fully assess the patient's physical condition. If a limited metastasis to the liver is observed, it should be resected.\n\nFor early diagnosis and treatment, we believe teaching activities should be carried out to popularize the treatment guidelines of ARMM and enhance the awareness and attention of clinicians to this disease. A complete interrogative physical examination and ancillary tests are also required. For most patients with blood in the stool, we have summarized 3 treatment steps: (I) rectal examination, (II) colonoscopy for biopsy,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> and (III) immunohistochemical staining (S-100, HMB-45, and vimentin),<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,12,13]</u></a></sup> especially for ARMM without hyperpigmentation. Once the mass is confirmed as ARMM, endorectal ultrasound may be taken into consideration to assess tumor thickness and surrounding lymph nodes. A whole-body CT scan is required to evaluate the presence of enlarged lymph nodes or distant metastases. Finally, multi-disciplinary team is required and the patient's physical tolerance status and tumor metastasis should be comprehensively evaluated to explore the best-individualized treatment plan.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nThis study reports on a ARMM patient with brain metastases and liver metastases. We present the importance of pathology combined with immunohistochemistry to diagnose this disease and emphasize the essential need for auxiliary examinations. For patients with advanced ARMM, the combination of WLE with adjuvant therapy can be more effective with good prognosis.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThe author would like to thank all the staff in Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical University for their contribution on our research.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nHH Z conceived the study design.

The most common form is neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1, 96%), followed by neurofibromatosis type 2 (3%), and a lesser known form, schwannomatosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup>\n\nBoth hereditary forms of NF-1 and neurofibromatosis type 2 follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance; therefore, only 1 faulty gene is required from the parents for the offspring to develop the disease. In both hereditary and spontaneous NF, the mutations involve tumor suppressor genes, whose mutation leads to uncontrolled division of cells, resulting in the neurofibromas characteristic of the disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Neurofibromas are generally indolent, slow-growing tumors thatcommonly affect the skin, but can also affect other regions, notably the central nervous system.\n\nThe hallmarks of NF-1 symptoms are primarily cutaneous neurofibromas, skin café-au-lait spots, and skinfold freckling.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Other manifestations include pigmentary abnormalities, skeletal dysplasia, and low-grade gliomas.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> The condition is progressive and symptom burden typically accumulates over the patient's lifespan, with life expectancy of NF-1 approximately 8 to 12 years lower than that of healthy controls.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup>\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no report has hitherto described a patient with NF-1 who developed sudden bilateral lower limb paralysis with no evidence of cord compression on imaging studies. In this case report, we describe a 30-year old male with NF-1 who developed sudden bilateral lower limb paralysis following a mild trauma, and discuss the clinical features and associated complications of the disease.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 30-year-old male presented with sudden-onset bilateral lower limb paralysis and lower back pain, which he stated began just after he fell while trying to stand up from his seat. He stated that he was not able to stand up or feel his lower limbs. The patient walked to work that day, where he worked as a secretary. He denied any prodromic signs that preceded the fall, such as pain, confusion, or body weakness. There was no prior history of back pain, significant illness, or lifting of heavy objects. According to the patient, he developed lower limb paralysis and lower back pain only after the fall. In addition to lower limb paralysis and lower back pain, the patient also complained that he was unable to pass urine or stool.\n\nThe patient did not present with any symptoms suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and was not previously treated for TB. He had no history of any other motor symptoms (such as previous episodes of muscle weakness, loss of balance, or coordination issues) or sensory symptoms prior to that day.\n\nUpon physical examination, the lungs, heart, and abdomen were unremarkable, and the patient exhibited normal vision and hearing, with no abnormalities of the eye and no Lisch nodules. A neurological examination showed a Glasgow Coma Score of 15/15, normal muscle bulk, but a muscle power grade of 0 in all muscle groups of the lower limbs. The patellar tendon and Achilles tendon reflex, as well as plantar extensor response, were absent bilaterally. Sensation was absent in the T11 dermatome.\n\nThe patient's liver function test, renal function test, serum electrolyte levels, and C-reactive protein levels were normal upon admission. His plasma lactate dehydrogenase level was normal at 118 U/L (reference range, 109–245). He tested negative for HIV, anti-nuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor. The GeneXpert test for TB from sputum was negative. Cerebrospinal fluid biochemistry was normal, and a Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli was negative.\n\nChest radiography was performed to rule out pulmonary tuberculosis, as Pott disease was initially entertained as a differential. The chest X ray was normal and did not support the diagnosis of TB or Pott disease. A lumbar sacral radiograph  showed an enlarged vertebral canal but no vertebral fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine  showed a normally maintained kyphotic curvature of the dorsal spine. No evidence of spondylolisthesis was found. The intervertebral discs were normal in morphology, facet joints were normal at all levels, and pre/paravertebral collection was observed. Posterior erosion/scalloping of the vertebral bodies was observed at L2 to L5 and S1. The vertebral canals in the lumbar and sacral segments were markedly increased. There was no evidence of cord compression on either the computed tomography or MRI. It was only after repeated MRI studies that herniation of nerve root sleeves, with marked compression of traversing nerve roots, was noted.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nX- ray: Widened vertebral canal at the lumbar vertebra.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nMRI scan: Sagittal MRI showing dural ectasia with posterior vertebral scalloping from L2 to L5 and S1. Herniation of nerve root sleeves with compression of traversing nerve roots and lateral meningoceles were also noted.</u>\n\nThe diagnosis of NF-1 was made using the clinical diagnostic criteria agreed upon at the consensus meeting of the National institute of Health 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[Table 1\\]</u> (NIH criteria).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> The patient showed characteristic subcutaneous nodules over the face and trunk associated with café-au-lait spots, but no axillary or inguinal freckling. The patient's mother and all 4 siblings had similar subcutaneous nodules. The patient reported that these subcutaneous neurofibromas have been present since childhood. This led to the diagnosis of NF-1.\n\nTable 1 - NIH Diagnostic criteria for type 1 neurofibromatosis.\n\n| Two or more of the following criteria are required for diagnosis: |\n| --- |\n| 1\\. Six or more café-au-lait spots over 5 mm in prepubertal individuals and over 15 mm in postpubertal individuals |\n| 2\\. Two or more neurofibromas of any type or 1 plexiform neurofibroma |\n| 3\\. Freckling in the axilla or groin |\n| 4\\. Optic glioma |\n| 5\\. Two or more Lisch nodules |\n| 6\\. Presence of a distinct osseous lesion, sphenoid wing, dysplasia or thinning of a long bone with or without pseudoarthrosis |\n| 7\\. A first degree relative who meets the above criteria for NF1. |\n\nNF-1 = neurofibromatosis type 1.\n\nNo treatment was initiated specifically for NF-1. In the hospital, the patient received analgesics, antibiotic cover (gentamicin and cefuroxime) for management of a urinary tract infection that the patient developed in the ward, lactulose (to manage constipation), and enoxaparin (prophylactic anticoagulation). There was no improvement in NF symptoms. The patient eventually developed sepsis, and following a clinical decline, he succumbed to his illness 6 weeks after admission. Sepsis is thought to be a complication of urinary tract infection and not directly linked to NF-1.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nWe present a case involving a 30-year-old man with NF-1 who developed bilateral lower limb paralysis. Although his NF-1 gene was not investigated, he was diagnosed with NF-1 based on the clinical criteria established at the National Institutes of Health consensus conference.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> The clinical diagnosis of NF-1 relies on identifying at least 2 of the following 7 diagnostic criteria: neurofibromas, café-au-lait macules, Lisch nodules, skinfold freckling, optic pathway tumors, family history, or bone dysplasia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> In addition to the 7 diagnostic criteria, there are other features that are increasingly reported as common manifestations of NF-1. These include motor deficits, muscle weakness, and poor coordination.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u></a></sup> Historically, these deficits in NF-1 were solely attributed to central nervous system dysfunction from intracerebral neurofibromas, although recent studies have shown a role for the NF-1 gene product, neurofibromin, in metabolism and muscle growth, which may indicate a more direct effect.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup>\n\nDural ectasia is a circumferential expansion of the dural sac and has been frequently reported to be associated with NF-1, with as many as 70% to 80% of all cases of dural ectasia found in patients with NF-1.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Dural ectasia is also associated with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and ankylosing spondylitis, and may also occur idiopathically.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> The expanding dura can cause erosion of the vertebral body and pedicle, and may in severe forms result in destabilization, fracture, or dislocation of the spine. Destabilization of the spine due to severe erosion of the vertebral bodies in NF-1 can occasionally lead to spontaneous subluxation or dislocation and, subsequently, spinal cord injury.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12–14]</u></a></sup> Spinal deformity is the most common orthopedic complication in NF-1, classified into non-dystrophic and dystrophic types based on the absence or presence, respectively, of skeletal deformities on plain radiographic evaluation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u></a></sup> Dystrophic changes include vertebral scalloping, widened spinal canal and foramina, rib penciling, elongated and attenuated pedicles, and associated paraspinal masses.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,17,18]</u></a></sup> Our patient presented with dural ectasia and vertebral scalloping localized mainly at the lumbar vertebrae, with evidence of herniation of nerve root sleeves with compression of traversing nerve roots on MRI.\n\nNakamura et al. reported 7 cases of NF-1 with symptoms of spinal cord compression following mild trauma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Imaging studies of all 7 cases showed dysplastic changes associated with NF-1, including vertebral scalloping, dural ectasia, and paravertebral soft tissue mass. Following the recognition of spinal deformities, stabilization of the vertebral column can be achieved either through posterior fixation and/or anterior fixation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18,20]</u></a></sup> Posterior fixation is preferred because anterior fixation is associated with a higher risk of dural injury and uncontrollable leakage of cerebrospinal fluid.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> These 2 procedures were the mainstay treatment in Nakamura's study and resulted in a good outcome in 6 out of 7 patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup>\n\nWhile our patient presented with features of cord compression, there was no evidence of cord compression, vertebral subluxation, or dislocation. It was only after repeated MRI studies that herniation of nerve root sleeves with marked compression of traversing nerve roots was noted. This was thought to account for the patient's neurological symptoms. The patient unfortunately developed sepsis, while in the ward and succumbed before a multidisciplinary team could discuss his definitive management.\n\nBased on these findings, it should be noted that dystrophic changes in NF-1 might lead to rapid aggravation of neurological symptoms even after a mild trauma, and that these patients may present with or without evidence of cord compression on imaging. Clinicians should anticipate both dystrophic changes and orthopedic complications associated with NF-1, such as spinal cord injuries, which, if managed early, may have a favorable clinical outcome.\n\n删除3：<u>### 3.1 Uncited reference\n\n<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup>.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Victor Mutua.\n\n**Informed consent:** Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of the case details.\n\n**Investigation**: All authors\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Victor Mutua, Newnex Brian Mong’are, Brian Nyamweya Bundi.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Victor Mutua, Newnex Brian Mong’are, Brian Nyamweya Bundi, David Oriko, Peter Kitunguu, Chris von Csefalvay.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:05:07", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:05:20", "cost": 12.832}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:05:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:05:06"}

The causative virus is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the clinical course of COVID-19 can lead to premature death because of the massive viral infection, hypoxia, massive cytokine storms, respiratory disorder, misdirected host immune-response, micro-thromboembolism, microvasculitis and other lethal condition.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> The symptoms of COVID-19 are diverse. One of the symptoms of COVID-19, dysgeusia with SARS-CoV-2, is associated with viral access to the olfactory bulb and is commonly reported in the early stages of infection.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> However, this symptom in the early phase of COVID-19 may reflect viral expansion in the host, which should not be confused with the viral access to the host's central nervous system; the virus can spread by other pathways in most neuroanatomical areas. Under the COVID-19 pandemic setting, if the COVID-19 patient has fever and dyspnea as typical symptoms of COVID-19 with dysgeusia, it may take a long time to reach the correct diagnosis because of dilemma between COVID-19 or other diseases. The axon, transsynaptic, perineural, blood, lymph, or Trojan routes can gain multiple accesses to the virus from peripheral neural networks and eventually invade the brain and brainstem.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> It may also be associated with local inflammation-derived damage and thrombi-derived damage to the respiratory reflexes in both the lung neuronal network and brainstem center. In addition to the neurological symptoms associated with infection, long-term neuropsychiatric effects that may occur months after host recovery cannot be ruled out.\n\nHere, we report a valuable case of fever, dysgeusia, and dysosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic that needed to be differentiated from COVID-19.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 76-year-old man became aware of fever for 5 days with severe dysosmia and dysgeusia before admission. On the day of his visit to our hospital, he was suspected to have COVID-19 at the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) center and underwent a PCR test. Subsequently, he developed nausea at home and was transferred to our emergency department. At the time of admission, his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 (Eyes 4, Verbal 5, Motor 6) and abnormal vital signs were body temperature 37.5°C with an oxygen saturation of 96% (room air) and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min.\n\nOn examination, he appeared ill and was febrile at 37.5°C. His blood pressure was 149/87 mm Hg, pulse was 87/min, respiratory rate was 22/min, and O<sub>2</sub> saturation was 96% breathing room air. On physical assessment, the left lung was clear, but the right lung showed hypophonesis to auscultation of breathing sounds. However, we could not detect other abnormalities, such as abdominal or neurological abnormalities (e.g. verb disorder, paralysis) or sensory and motor disorders. He had a history of cerebral infarction without functional disorders, such as paralysis, and reported a heavy smoking history (1 pack/d, 35 years). The results of the blood analysis are presented in Table 1. These findings indicated elevated inflammatory reaction (white blood cell 18200 /μl, neutrophils 81.2% and C-reactive protein 18.96 mg/dL) and hepatobiliary system abnormalities (aspartate transaminase 93 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 100 U/L, lactic acid dehydrogenase 807 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 1115 U/L, γ-guanosine triphosphate 260 U/L, total bilirubin 2.1 mg/dL), indicated severe inflammation with liver dysfunction. Chest radiography showed decreased permeability in the right hilar region, and infiltrative shadows in the bilateral lung fields . A whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass with a hollowing-out lesion and sharp edge around the lung lesion on the right middle lobe with infiltrated shadow and no obvious ground-glass opacities , multiple low-density nodules in the liver, and no significant abnormalities in other organs. Based on the CT findings, we suspected that the cause of his symptoms was pneumonia due to COVID-19 or obstructive pneumonia due to lung neoplasia. In addition, considering that his history of cerebral infarction sequelae may have caused dysosmia, we performed a CT scan of the head to investigate the cause of the dysosmia and the high body temperature. Head CT showed a ring-enhanced mass lesion measuring 17 × 15 mm and moderate cerebral edema around the mass lesion on the right frontal lobe of the brain, which was suspected to be metastatic cancer from another organ . Based on the above results, we suspected pneumonia associated with COVID-19 or primary lung cancer and metastatic brain tumor with peripheral obstructive pneumonia as the cause of his symptoms at this time. So we hospitalized him and performed a systemic survey during hospitalization.\n\nTable 1 - Blood analysis in the emergency room.\n\n| Subjects | Value | Normal Range |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| White Blood Cell (/μL) | 18200 | 4500–10000 |\n| Neutrophil (%) | 81.2 | 45–75 |\n| Basophil (%) | 0.3 | 0–0.5 |\n| Eosinophil (%) | 7.1 | 0–7 |\n| Lymphocyte (%) | 5.3 | 18–45 |\n| Monocyte (%) | 5.5 | 1–10 |\n| Red Blood Cell (×106/μL) | 4.64 | 4.7–6.1 |\n| Hemoglobin (g/dL) | 14.2 | 13.8–17.2 |\n| Platelet (×103/μL) | 320 | 150–400 |\n| LDH (U/L) | 807 | 119–229 |\n| AST (U/L) | 93 | ≦ 30 |\n| ALT (U/L) | 100 | ≦ 30 |\n| ALP (U/L) | 1115 | 38–113 |\n| γ-GPT (U/L) | 260 | ≦ 50 |\n| CK (U/L) | 28 | 60–287 |\n| T.Bil (mg/dL) | 2.1 | 0.2–1.2 |\n| BUN (mg/dL) | 17 | 7–24 |\n| Creatinine (mg/dL) | 1.05 | ≦ 1.00 |\n| Na (mEq/L) | 134 | 135–147 |\n| K (mEq/L) | 4.8 | 3.3–4.8 |\n| Cl (mEq/L) | 97 | 98–108 |\n| Ca (mEq/L) | 9.0 | 8.6–10.4 |\n| CRP (mEq/L) | 18.96 | ≦ 0.3 |\n\nγ-GTP = γ-guanosine triphosphate, ALP = alkaline phosphatase, ALT = alanine aminotransferase, AST = aspartate aminotransferase, BUN = blood urea nitrogen, CK = creatine kinase, CRP = C-Reactive Protein, LDH = lactic acid dehydrogenase, T.Bil = total bilirubin.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nChest X-ray at admission showed decreased permeability in the right middle lung field and infiltration shadows in the bilateral lung fields.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nChest CT showed a mass lesion with hollowing-out lesion and sharp edge around the lung lesion on the right middle lobe on the lung with infiltrated shadow.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nBrain CT showed a ring-enhancing lesion 17 × 15 mm and moderate cerebral edema around the mass lesion on the right frontal lobe of the brain, suspected metastatic cancer from other organ.</u>\n\nHe was admitted to our hospital and was immediately administered a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The PCR results were negative. Additionally, the result of SARS-CoV-2 PCR collected before visiting our hospital in a family clinic was also confirmed to be negative. Other viral infections were also tested, but no findings suggestive of coexistence were confirmed. In other words, the cause of dysgeusia was not COVID-19. In the next step, we consulted a pulmonologist to distinguish the mass lesion on his right upper lobe from peripheral obstructive pneumonia, and the mass lesion with edema in his brain caused us to suspect a metastatic tumor from primary lung cancer. After admission, we performed various tests for a definitive diagnosis, eventually leading to the diagnosis of primary lung cancer by biopsy sample, poorly differentiated non-small cell adenocarcinoma, metastatic brain tumor, and multiple liver metastases from lung cancer. Cytokeratin 19 fragment was 1.8 ng/mL, and carcinoembryonic antigen was 31.7 ng/mL. We had no additional data on tumor markers. Since pneumonia could not be ruled out, the respiratory physician started empiric treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam. For brain tumor whole-brain radiotherapy (total 60 Gy) was scheduled, and for peripheral edema around the brain tumor, concentrated glycerin and corticosteroids were administered. However, after the start of aggressive treatment for his symptoms (except for chemotherapy) his condition deteriorated sharply, making it impossible to continue aggressive treatment. The symptoms of dysosmia and dysgeusia persisted throughout the clinical course. Sixteen days after admission, he died of liver dysfunction and massive lung cancer.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nHere, we describe a patient presenting with fever, dysosmia, and dysgeusia, which are specific symptoms of COVID-19 in the early phase of COVID-19. There are various causes of dysgeusia; therefore, it is important to make a comprehensive diagnosis to check the accompanying physical symptoms, analyze the data and imaging findings.\n\nThe pathophysiological mechanisms that cause dysosmia and/or dysgeusia remain unknown. Dysosmia and/or dysgeusia are associated with various viral infections, such as influenza.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> The lack or loss of sense of smell or taste due to a viral infection that targets the upper respiratory tract could be easily ruled out from the patient's history. Infection of the upper respiratory tract can induce dysosmia and/or dysgeusia due to viral damage to the olfactory epithelium.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> COVID-19 infection can occur before and immediately after the onset of symptoms.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Early symptom recognition might aid in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 and may allow rapid quarantine and isolation of patients. According to a previous report,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> 15% of patients suffered from dysosmia and/or dysgeusia in the early stage of COVID-19, with a median duration of recovery of 7 days for both symptoms. In another report, a systematic review and meta-analysis of confirmed COVID-19<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> showed that 52.7% of the patients had dysosmia and 43.9% of the patients had dysgeusia. Dysosmia and dysgeusia are frequent symptoms in the early phase of COVID-19. In relation to these symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 is known to be neurotropic and spreads to nerves, into the neuroepithelium and olfactory bulb via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9–11]</u></a></sup> The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, the major host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 for cell binding and penetration, is widely expressed on epithelial cells of the nasal<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> and oral mucosa.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> The above characteristics of the invasion pathway SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the human body induce direct inflammation of the olfactory epithelium and damage the mucosal epithelial cells of the oral cavity. Therefore, both local inflammation and neuropathy could induce COVID-19 to cause dysosmia and dysgeusia.\n\nAs with other causes of dysosmia and dysgeusia, we must distinguish abnormalities in olfaction, abnormalities in the oral environment, sensation of taste, abnormalities in nerves and centers that transmit taste stimuli, and psychogenic abnormalities. In general, the causes of dysosmia and dysgeusia include brain tumor, demyelinating disease, pons hemorrhage, pontine infarction, and thalamic infarction.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14–18]</u></a></sup> The gustatory pathway is transmitted from the facial and chorda tympani nerves to the solitary tract nucleus. It is transmitted to the primary gustatory cortex via the ventral posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus. It is then transmitted to the orbitofrontal cortex and is thought to integrate with the sense of sight and smell to cause a sense of taste. In this case, metastatic brain tumors are thought to have caused dysgeusia due to impaired conduction to the primary gustatory cortex and orbitofrontal cortex.\n\nIn our case, it was initially thought that the cause of dysosmia and dysgeusia was COVID-19 due to the typical symptoms of fever, dysosmia, and dysgeusia. However, since the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was negative and a metastatic tumor from the primary lung tumor was found, we diagnosed the cause of these symptoms as metastatic lung tumors infiltrating the gustatory cortex or the taste conduction pathway. Early hospital observations and early studies considered the development of dysosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19 due to olfactory cleft syndrome (rarely), direct damage to the olfactory receptor neurons, and disorders of the olfactory perception centers of the brain.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this. In addition, dysosmia and dysgeusia demonstrate dramatic damage to the olfactory cortical region of the brain, given that it is often detected very early in COVID-19, including in mild cases and even asymptomatic patients. However, there is no evidence to support this. Therefore, it is unlikely that excessive systemic inflammatory responses or rapid cytokine storms in the brain play a role in the development of dysosmia and dysgeusia. The most obvious cause of dysosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients may be direct damage to olfactory receptor neurons, as other human coronaviruses have previously been shown to directly bind to olfactory receptor neurons. However, dysosmia and dysgeusia are often associated with many human viruses that cause the common cold (e.g. influenza and coronaviruses); its exact cellular and molecular mechanisms have not yet been clearly established.\n\nDysgeusia has been reported to be associated with more than half of COVID-19 cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> In this case, we suspected COVID-19 due to fever and dysgeusia. But CT examination helped distinguish the real cause of his symptoms. Screening for COVID-19 in outpatients is common in the current scenario, and physicians tend to overlook other diseases when the clinical presentation is similar to COVID-19. Differentiation of other diseases, especially central diseases, such as brain tumor, brain metastasis, or cerebral vascular diseases, is considered to be very important in dysgeusia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> In general, given that the effects of the well-established influence of olfactory stimuli on the sensory perception of taste, dysgeusia and dysosmia are often present in various pathological conditions. In COVID-19, dysgeusia may also represent an early symptom suggestive of COVID-19, but this symptom does not appear to have been less robustly studied. However, it remains unknown whether dysosmia and dysgeusia represent a distinct clinical manifestation of the virus or if this occurs secondary to olfactory dysfunction. Particularly among patients with mild disease severity and few symptoms, the presence of dysosmia and/or dysgeusia may be important for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, it is advisable to add these symptoms to the list of COVID-19 primary screening symptoms to prevent the premature spread of the virus. However, other tests for diseases other than COVID-19 should be performed for a definitive diagnosis, because there are many other causes of dysosmia, and/or dysgeusia.\n\nIn the global COVID-19 pandemic, hearing the word dysgeusia and dysosmia with fever and respiratory symptoms makes us think of COVID-19 diagnosis. Since there are various causes of dysgeusia and dysosmia, it is important to make an appropriate differential diagnosis based on clinical findings and investigations.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThe authors thank other colleagues in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Yokosuka Kyosai Hospital for their kind assistance.

Thus, the current literature is divergent regarding the management of these patients and does not give clear recommendations. We report a rare case of AMI complicated by septic coronary embolism caused by IE treated with manual aspiration thrombectomy.\n\n### 1.1 Consent\n\nThe patient signed informed consent for the publication of this case report and any accompanying images. This report was granted approval by the ethics committee of the Instituto do Coração (InCor), Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 19-year-old man with subvalvular aortic stenosis who underwent subsequent surgical resection in 2001, metal prosthetic aortic valve replacement in 2010, and double mitral lesion (predominance of insufficiency) was admitted to the emergency department with fever and dyspnea of 2 days. On examination, he had heart sounds with a metallic click and aortic focus systolic murmur ++/6 and systolic murmur +++/6 in the mitral focus. His body temperature was 38°C, blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, and heart rate was 89 beats/min. Respiratory rate was 18 per minute with oxygen saturation of 95% breathing ambient air. Skin examination revealed no changes. No other physical or neurological abnormalities were found. Laboratory results were notable for a white blood cell count of 14,950 cells/μL with 82% segmented neutrophil, a creatinine level of 1.35 mg/dL, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate 49 mm/h, and a C-reactive protein of 212 mg/dL. The diagnostic hypothesis of IE was made and after obtaining 3 sets of blood samples, intravenous administration of oxacillin and ceftriaxone was begun. Blood cultures identified _Aggregatibacter aphrophilus._ The course of intravenous antibiotic with ceftriaxone alone was continued for 6 weeks. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction of 68% with an anterior mitral valve leaflet discontinuity measuring 0.7 cm with color Doppler flow, suggestive of perforation , severe mitral regurgitation, and a round area of reduced echodensity at the mitro-aortic junction, with no color Doppler flow, consistent with abscess , without aortic valve prosthesis dysfunction. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm, normal PR interval and absence of ischemia . Cardiac markers were elevated. There was no lesion suggestive of septic emboli in abdominal ultrasound and brain tomography. After 24 hours of antibiotic therapy, the patient developed central chest pain radiating to the neck; the ECG showed significant ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V5 . Noradrenaline and dobutamine were initiated due to hemodynamic instability. Coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (TIMI flow grade 0) with no other angiographic evidence of atherosclerotic disease . Manual aspiration thrombectomy (Export XT Aspiration Catheter (Medtronic, Inc. Minneapolis) without stent implantation was performed  with restoration of coronary blood flow (TIMI 3 flow); antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy) was not needed during and post-procedure. The embolic material was sent for culture. The procedure was well tolerated, successfully performed , and the patient's evolution was favorable, with weaning from vasoactive drugs.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nTEE in mid-oesophageal view revealing (A) anterior leaflet discontinuity of the mitral valve; (B) flow on discontinuity of anterior mitral valve leaflet; (C) cavity on the aortic valve; (D) cavity at the mitro-aortic junction compatible with an abscess .</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\n(A) Electrocardiogram on admission showed the absence of ischemia; (B) Twenty-four hours later, a new electrocardiogram showed ST-elevation in anterior leads (V1-V5).</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\n(A) Coronary angiography showing total occlusion of the middle left anterior descending artery; (B) Guide wire crossing with the support of thrombo-aspiration catheter into the distal left ascending coronary artery; (C) Coronary aspiration with a thrombectomy catheter; (D) The vessel following partial aspiration thrombectomy; (E) The vessel following final aspiration thrombectomy.</u>\n\nAfter 10 days of stay in the hospital, the patient underwent cardiac surgery with mitral valve orifice correction, reconstruction of the mitro-aortic junction with a bovine pericardium patch, and implantation of an aortic mechanical prosthesis.\n\nThe material aspirated from the coronary artery showed fibrin thrombi containing gram-negative cocci .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 4:\n\nHistological sections of the material aspirated from the coronary artery.

After 1 month of follow-up, the patient remained stable.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThis report describes a rare case of _Aggregatibacter aphrophilus_ IE complicated by AMI. Moreover, this report illustrates the feasibility of performing manual aspiration thrombectomy without stenting and the use of antithrombin therapy in this context.\n\nThe incidence of systemic embolism is known to be 22% to 50% of patients with IE, the majority (up to 65%) in the central nervous system, but other major arterial beds may be involved, including the coronary arteries.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> However, AMI is an early and uncommon complication of IE.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Most coronary embolisms occur in the left descending coronary artery because of the downward course of the left ascending coronary artery compared with the right coronary artery or left circumflex artery, which originate at 90° to the aortic cusp.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Septic emboli are more frequent with mitral valve infection (25%) than with aortic valve infection (10%),<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> but study by Manzano and colleagues suggest aortic valve involvement increases the risk of septic coronary emboli.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe treatment of AMI caused by septic coronary embolism is challenging and controversial, with no consensus in the literature. The content of septic emboli differs from other emboli and requires a different treatment strategy than conventional AMI.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> In addition to infectious control with antibiotics, surgical treatment of the affected valve is usually indicated. Many of these patients have systemic embolization, are at high risk for bleeding complications, and fatal outcomes with any strategy used, especially if antiplatelets, anticoagulants, and thrombolytics are required.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup>\n\nFibrinolytic therapy is generally contraindicated in these settings due to the higher risk of intracerebral hemorrhage due to mycotic aneurysms and cerebral infarcts (common sequelae of IE) militates against the use of such agents.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Also, septic conditions can increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage leading to hemostasis disorders. Balloon angioplasty alone showed mixed results due to the greater likelihood of distal and no-reflow embolization, mycotic aneurysm formation, and reocclusion by mobile embolic material.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Stenting may prevent some of these complications, but it carries the theoretical risk of continuous infection by entrapment of septic material between the stent and the vessel wall.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Also, in these cases, localized mycotic aneurysm can originate from the stent implanted area.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> The use of drug eluting stents predisposes to a higher risk of reinfection compared to bare metal stents due to their immunomodulatory properties.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> In contrast, aspiration thrombectomy in AMI caused by coronary embolism from IE is an alternative approach to thrombolysis and percutaneous angioplasty and may avoid the complications mentioned above.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn this case, coronary angiography was performed because of hemodynamic instability after AMI. The decision to perform aspiration thrombectomy was due to total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery without apparent atherosclerotic disease. Surgical treatment was performed after the coronary event, when the patient was clinically stable.\n\nIn conclusion, this current case report has shown that Manual aspiration thrombectomy can be successfully performed without the need for thrombotic agents in patients with AMI caused by septic embolism\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Methodology:** Luhanda Leonora Cardoso Monti Sousa.\n\n**Resources:** Luhanda Leonora Cardoso Monti Sousa, Tatiana de Carvalho Andreucci Torres Leal, Alexandre de Matos Soeiro, Paulo Rogério Soares.\n\n**Supervision:** Thiago Luis Scudeler.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Thiago Luis Scudeler.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Thiago Luis Scudeler.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:51:29", "endTime": "2024/09/19 15:06:30", "cost": 900.54}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 23:06:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:51:29"}

He had no history of coronary artery disease, allergy, atopic disorder and any anaphylactic reactions. On arrival, his blood pressure was 148/95 mm Hg and his heart rate was 91 beats/min with no evidence of organ failure. Laboratory tests revealed elevations in serum amylase (2210 U/L, normal range, 44 to 132 U/L) and serum lipase (5469 U/L, normal range, 13 to 55 U/L). Contrast enhanced computed tomography showed inflammatory changes in the pancreas and peripancreatic fat, without objective signs of necrosis. Consequently, he was diagnosed with recurrent mild acute pancreatitis. For the initial treatment, we started intravenous feeding, fluid resuscitation with fasting, and prophylactic antibiotics. However, at 10 min after the intravenous administration of 1 g of cefoperazone-sulbactam, a sudden cardiac arrest occurred. Immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and the electrocardiac monitor indicated ventricular fibrillation . After 150 J shock therapy with a defibrillator, spontaneous circulation returned but his blood pressure was low (58/36 mmHg) and his heart rate was unstable (46–100 beats/min). The 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed ST segment elevation in the inferior leads . Next, an anaphylactic skin rash extended over the entire body, and we injected 100 mg hydrocortisone intravenously. Then, we performed emergency coronary angiography (CAG). CAG showed significant stenosis in the middle segment of the right coronary artery . During the procedure, hypotension persisted, and we frequently observed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and intermittent complete atrioventricular block. Therefore, in addition to fluid therapy and glucocorticoids, a temporary pacemaker lead was inserted, and noradrenaline was administered to stabilize the hemodynamics. After confirming that the blood pressure and heart rate were satisfactory, 0.5 mg nitroglycerin was infused into the right coronary artery. Soon, the ST-segment elevation resolved  and the significant stenosis regressed to a mild degree . These responses indicated that the severe coronary spasm was relieved by nitroglycerin. There was no significant stenosis in the left coronary artery. From the onset of cardiac arrest, coronary spasm seemed to have persisted for 40 minutes. After the CAG, the skin rash rapidly disappeared, and hemodynamic stability was maintained without a vasopressor. Creatine kinase-MB was only slightly elevated (27 U/L). The temporary pacing lead was removed, and extubation was performed on the same day. The patient recovered from acute pancreatitis without complication and discharged, uneventfully 11 days after the CAG. Immediately after the cardiac arrest, serum tryptase was elevated to 53.4 pg/mL, but it reverted to a normal level (3.1 pg/mL) after 10 days. This result implied that an allergic reaction, probably induced by cefoperazone-sulbactam, was associated with his coronary spasm (type 1 Kounis syndrome).\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nVentricular fibrillation occurred soon after cefoperazone-sulbactam administration.

In type 1, the coronary artery spasm occurs in normal or near-normal coronary segments. The type 2 variant is characterized by the erosion or rupture of a plaque at pre-existing coronary atherosclerotic lesions. The type 3 variant includes coronary artery stent thrombosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Although the detailed mechanisms of Kounis syndrome have remained uncertain, it is believed that during hypersensitivity, inflammatory mediators released by mast cells and lymphocytes can induce coronary vasoconstriction, atheromatous erosion, or rupture and platelet aggregation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe diagnosis of Kounis syndrome is based on clinical symptoms and signs, electrocardiographic findings, angiographic findings, and/or laboratory data. In particular, acute elevation of serum tryptase, indicates mast cell degranulation and is reported to be a useful marker for diagnosing anaphylaxis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u></a></sup> In our case, ventricular fibrillation and ST-segment elevation indicated a right coronary spasm that occurred concomitant with an allergic skin rash. Furthermore, an acute increase in serum tryptase supported the diagnosis of type 1 Kounis syndrome. Among the causes of Kounis syndrome, the most common etiology was reported to be the use of medications.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> In this case, the sudden cardiac arrest and skin rash developed soon after the infusion of cefoperazone-sulbactam. Therefore, we presumed that the antibiotic induced Kounis syndrome in this patient. Hypersensitivity reactions associated with cefoperazone-sulbactam including anaphylaxis have been reported as the common side effects.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup>\n\nTreatments for type 1 Kounis syndrome should focus on both the coronary artery spasm and the anaphylactic reaction. Coronary vasodilators, such as calcium channel blockers and nitrates, are needed to relieve the vasospasm. However, vasodilators should be used carefully, to avoid exacerbating hypotension. Allergic reactions can be effectively treated with corticosteroids and antihistamine agents. Epinephrine is the treatment of choice for anaphylactic shock,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> but it is difficult to administer in type 1 Kounis syndrome, due to the possibility that epinephrine might exaggerate myocardial ischemia, induce alpha-receptor mediated coronary spasms, and cause arrhythmias. Therefore, in a complex case, like for example, a type 1 Kounis syndrome complicated by hemodynamically unstable arrhythmia and hypotension, it would be challenging to determine an adequate therapeutic strategy. In our case, after stabilizing the patient's hemodynamic status with temporary pacing, a large fluid infusion, and vasopressors, we administered intracoronary nitroglycerin, which successfully relieved the coronary artery spasm without inducing hypotension.\n\nTo our knowledge, this study was the first to describe type 1 Kounis syndrome induced by cefoperazone-sulbactam in a patient with acute pancreatitis. Cefoperazone-sulbactam is an antibiotic commonly administered for necrotic pancreatitis. Moreover, Kounis syndrome can rapidly cause hemodynamic collapse under the hypovolemic conditions associated with acute pancreatitis. Although not rare, Kounis syndrome is infrequently diagnosed in daily clinical practice. Therefore, when changes in vital signs occur after drug administration, physicians should consider Kounis syndrome as a differential diagnosis, and appropriate management should be performed according to the patient's pathophysiology.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization**: Yoshihiro Seo, Nobuhyuki Ohte.\n\n**Data curation**: Ken Ito, Tsuyoshi Ito, Kazuki Hayashi.\n\n**Visualization**: Ken Ito.\n\n**Supervision**: Hiroshi Fujita, Tomonori Sugiura.\n\n**Writing – original draft**: Ken Ito.\n\n**Writing – review & editing**: Tsuyoshi Ito.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:47:17", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:48:42", "cost": 84.904}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:48:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:47:17"}

He suffered from diarrhea before the onset. After admission, the patient became confused quickly, often asking the same question. Regarding medical history, the patient reported no history of fever or infection, no hemiplegia or numbness, nor dysphagia. Moreover, the patient did not have a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis or tuberculosis, exposure to radioactive materials or chemical poisons. However, he had a history of alcohol consumption (500 g/d) for over 20 years. Cardiovascular and respiratory system examinations were negative, and the patient had only mild cognitive impairment and parthypoesthesia.\n\nComputed tomography showed brain atrophy and hypodensity in the corpus callosum . Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperintensity on the T2-weighted imaging of the corpus callosum and hyperintense FLAIR sequence . There was mild enhancement zone in the corpus callosum under enhanced scanning . His electroencephalogram was in accordance with normal cerebral cortical function without detectable epileptogenicity. Eye opening and closing test showed that when the eyes blinked, the alpha wave was completely suppressed, and while the eyes closed, the alpha wave activity resumed. Hyperventilation test and multiple frequency intermittent flash stimuli test results were negative, simultaneously. Peripheral nerve conduction velocity indicated decreased motor conduction velocity of the left ulnar nerve. When the bilateral median nerve was slowed down, the bilateral ulnar nerve distal sensory conduction velocity was slowed down. Event related potential revealed P300 absolute latency as 382ms, suggesting mild cognitive decline. Abdominal ultrasound was normal. Chest computed tomography displayed bilateral emphysema. Blood routine, liver function, renal function, electrolytes, blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, procalcitonin, creatase, C-reactive protein, blood lipids, syphilis, HIV, stool routine, and urine routine were all normal. Routine biochemical of cerebrospinal fluid was normal, and at the same time, Indian ink staining, acid-fast staining, and gram staining of cerebrospinal fluid were all negative.

There was no fever, dysphagia, hemiplegia or numbness throughout the course of the disease. In addition, the patient had no symptoms of infections such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Cerebrospinal fluid examination did not suggest biogenic infection. There was no typical skull base change in the cranial MRI, and tuberculosis (TB) infection was not evidenced. Infectious etiology was ruled out. Usually patients with long-term heavy drinking, cognitive decline and peripheral neuropathy are usually considered to have Wernicke's encephalopathy that generally involves the midbrain periaqueductal nucleus, which was however inconsistent with this patient. There was no evidence of hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, ketoacidosis, uremia. Metabolic diseases were therefore ruled out. Multiple sclerosis generally requires much time and space, and there were no relevant risk factors in the patient. Specifically, in multiple sclerosis, the lesions are mostly located in the interface between the corpus callosum and the transparent septum, and they are round or oval, connected to the lateral ventricle, and protrude radially from the subependymal septum into the corpus callosum. This was not observed in the patient's imaging study.\n\nThe patient had abnormal mental behavior. MRI displayed symmetrical hypodensity on T1-weighted imaging, hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging in the splenius and corpus callosum. The lesion was located in the mid corpus callosum, not affecting the ventral and dorsal parts. After excluding infections, poisoning, metabolic diseases, the final diagnosis was MBD.\n\nThe patient was asked to stop alcohol consumption, and was prescribed B-vitamins (thiamine, B6, B12) to improve his symptoms. After one week of treatment, the patient could communicate with others fluently. Unfortunately, he remained in a state of mild memory loss. But there was no complaint of any side effects of thiamine administration. Unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow-up and further brain MRIs could not be arranged for the evaluation of the therapeutic effects and clinical outcomes.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nMarchaiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) is a rare, severe, even lethal demyelinating disease. Its contributing factors mainly include chronic alcoholism and severe malnutrition.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Previously, it could only be diagnosed by autopsy. Nowadays, with the progress of medical imaging, the diagnosis of MBD can be made through medical history review and typical MRI examination.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> The lesions are localized in or spread throughout the corpus callosum. The trunk is most often involved.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> Histopathologic examinations of the diseased corpus callosum revealed necrosis, hemorrhage, demyelination, and absence of oligodendrocyte in the mid-body of the corpus callosum, followed by the formation of softening foci with reactive gliosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> The symptomatology is diverse, including altered mental status, ataxia, dysarthria, mutism, epileptic seizures and dementia. Some scholars classify the degeneration of the corpus callosum into two subtypes, A and B. Obviously, type-A patients have convulsions and hemiplegia. The lesions have a wide range of imaging and involve the cortical white matter at the distant sites. The prognosis is poor. Inversely, type-B patients have mild disturbance of consciousness, and the prognosis is good.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe pathogenesis of MBD is still unclear. MBD is often accompanied by Wernicke's encephalopathy and central pontine myelinolysis,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> suggesting a possible common mechanism. Brain MRI is essential for a prompt and correct diagnosis of MBD. The typical presentations of MBD on brain MRI are hypodensity on T1-weighted imaging, hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery located at the corpus callosum. The treatment of MBD is still a challenge in clinical practice. The efficacy of high-dose vitamins in MBD has been fully demonstrated. Some researchers find that patients can fully recover with appropriate thiamine therapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can significantly improve the clinical outcome and prognosis of MBD patients. However, the outcomes of MBD may vary. Different predictors of poor prognosis have been proposed, including overall involvement of corpus callosum, severe disturbance of consciousness. Shen et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> suggested that the lesions in the entire corpus callosum did not correlate with bad outcome. On the contrary, extra-callosal lesions may be associated with poor prognosis.\n\nTo conclude, detailed medical history review and typical MRI examination are crucially important for the diagnosis of MBD.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nNone.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Lirong Wu, Jie Wang.\n\n**Investigation:** Jie Wang, Li Lu.\n\n**Methodology:** Lirong Wu.\n\n**Resources:** Lirong Wu, Li Lu.\n\n**Supervision:** Lirong Wu, Jie Wang, Li Lu.\n\n**Writing – editing:** Lirong Wu, Jie Wang.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Lirong Wu, Jie Wang.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:49:44", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:50:20", "cost": 36.812}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:50:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:49:43"}

Only articles published in the English language will be included.\n\n### 2.2 Study design\n\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) and single-arm trials will be included. Retrospective studies will not be included.\n\n### 2.3 Selection criteria\n\nInclusion criteria for this meta-analysis included:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> included patients with HFpEF;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> RCTs or single-arm trials;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> used transcatheter IASD; and\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> assessed exercise capacity, HF symptoms, quality of life, morbidity, or mortality.\n\n### 2.4 Outcomes\n\nThe primary outcome will be exercise capacity (6-minute walking distance). The secondary outcomes will be HF symptoms, health-related quality of life, and mortality and hospitalization rates.\n\n### 2.5 Data extraction\n\nInformation on the study and patient characteristics, methodological quality, intervention strategies, and clinical outcomes will be systematically extracted separately by 2 reviewers. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus.\n\n### 2.6 Quality assessment\n\nThe Cochrane Risk of Bias tool will be used to assess quality of RCTs included.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> The quality of evidence for the outcomes will be evaluated by use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> The quality of evidence will be evaluated across the domains of risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and publication bias.\n\n### 2.7 Statistical analysis\n\nFor continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences and corresponding 95% confidence interval will be calculated. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risks with 95% confidence interval will be calculated. For each outcome, heterogeneity will be assessed using the Cochran _Q_ and _I_<sup>2</sup> statistic; for the Cochran _Q_ and _I_<sup>2</sup> statistic, a _P_ value of <.1 and _I_<sup>2</sup>\\>50%, will be considered significant, respectively. When there is significant heterogeneity, the data will be pooled using a random-effects model, otherwise a fixed-effects model will be used. Publication bias will be assessed graphically using a funnel plot and mathematically using Egger test. For these analyses, Comprehensive Meta Analysis Software version 2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ) and STATA 16 software (Stata Corp LP, TX) will be used.\n\n### 2.8 Sensitivity analysis\n\nMeta-analyses will be performed separately for RCTs and single-arm trials. Meta-regression will be used to determine whether the effect of transcatheter IASD will be confounded by baseline clinical characteristics.\n\n### 2.9 Ethical issues\n\nThis meta-analysis is a literature study. Ethical approval is not required because this meta-analysis will not involve any subject directly.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis protocol about the effect of transcatheter IASD on exercise capacity in HFpEF patients. To consider the potential benefit of transcatheter IASD, it may be useful to look over the pathophysiological background of exercise intolerance in HFpEF patients. During exercise, the oxygen consumption in the metabolizing tissues increases dramatically. Normally, this is accomplished by 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> an increase in cardiac output (a product of heart rate and stroke volume) and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> increased utilization of oxygen by the metabolizing tissues.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> Earlier studies have reported that, in HFpEF patients, stroke volume during exercise increases or maintains at the expense of increased LA pressure, resulting in exertional dyspnea.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13,23,24]</u></a></sup> However, emerging data suggest that a limited increase in heart rate (chronotropic incompetence) as well as impaired oxygen utilization by active muscles during exercise may play a relatively greater role in limiting exercise performance in HFpEF patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> Although small feasibility studies reported that transcatheter IASD reduced LA pressure,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,17]</u></a></sup> there is insufficient evidence regarding whether decreased LA pressure due to transcatheter IASD will translate into improved clinical outcomes in HFpEF patients. The results of our meta-analysis will evaluate whether transcatheter IASD is beneficial for HFpEF patients, providing evidence regarding the clinical use of transcatheter IASD in these patients.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nAll authors critically revised the manuscript.\n\n**Conceptualization:** Hidekatsu Fukuta, Toshihiko Goto.\n\n**Drafted manuscript:** Hidekatsu Fukuta.\n\n**Literature retrieval:** Toshihiko Goto, Takeshi Kamiya.\n\n**Methodology:** Hidekatsu Fukuta, Takeshi Kamiya.\n\n**Supervision:** Takeshi Kamiya.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:04:55", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:05:57", "cost": 62.635}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:19", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:05:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:04:54"}

Therefore, the occupational disease monitoring system is established and operated to find and prevent missing occupational diseases, and thus far, the most exposed substances in lung cancer and hematopoietic cancers have been reported to be pesticides.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup>\n\nPesticides are chemical substances used to kill harmful insects, small animals, wild plants, and other unwanted organisms. They are applied in agriculture, industrial, commercial, and residential community settings, and their widespread use around the world has raised concerns about their health effects. Several studies have suggested that pesticide exposure may increase cancer risk, including hematological malignancies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u></a></sup> However, while their findings show the effect of pesticide exposure on the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, it has not been clearly demonstrated in myeloid malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup>\n\nTherefore, in this paper, we report a case of AML in a farmer exposed to pesticides for 20 years in Korea, along with a review of the literature, to suggest the relevance of occupational pesticide exposure to AML.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 46-year-old male patient visited the hospital with chief complaints of multiple purpuric macules on the left upper chest to both leg areas in April 2020. The patient was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 10 years prior and had been taking levothyroxine. He had no other past medical history, and no abnormal hematological findings were reported in previous general health examinations. He had never smoked and was a social drinker who drank once a week. He had a family history of gallbladder and thyroid cancer.\n\nWhen he first visited a dermatologist, a skin biopsy and laboratory tests were performed to determine the cause of the symptoms. The results of the blood tests were as follows. White blood cell count was increased (83.34 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL), differential count: increased blast count (55%), increased monocyte count (24%), decreased neutrophil count (2%), decreased lymphocyte count (7%), decreased hemoglobin (10.7 g/dL), and decreased platelet count (14.00 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL). A skin punch biopsy revealed perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltration, extravasated erythrocytes, and purpuric dermatosis. The patient was transferred to the Department of Hematology and Oncology. Subsequent bone marrow biopsy and immunohistochemistry tests were performed. The patient's specimen showed hypercellular marrow (cellularity: 80%) with increased monotonous immature hematopoietic cells. In special staining, myeloperoxidase, non-specific esterase, and sodium fluoride inhibition were positive, and periodic acid Schiff stain was negative. In Next generation sequencing, biallelic mutation of CCAAT(Cytosine-Cytosine-Adenosine-Adenosine-Thymidine) Enhancer Binding Protein Alpha was detected. Based on this result, the patient was diagnosed as AML with biallelic mutations of the CEBPA gene. While the patient was in the hospital for chemotherapy, the medical doctor referred to the Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine for investigation of an association between AML and the patient's occupation.\n\nThe patient was a farmer, had no other job in the past, and had been farming lotus roots for 20 years without stopping. He cultivated lotus roots in a 165,000 m<sup>2</sup> field in Daegu, which is Korea's largest producer of lotus root. He planted and raised lotus root seeds every spring and harvested lotus roots with eight workers in the fall. The patient sprayed compound fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides in the field in spring. Components of the compound fertilizers are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are used annually at 6000 kg. He sprayed compound fertilizers with two other workers. On the other hand, the patient was the only one doing the pesticides work, and he sprayed pesticides two to three hours a day from March to May every year. The insecticide was a granule form of terbufos and was used in approximately 300 kg each year. He sprayed the insecticide with his hands and sprayers. The herbicide was made up of glufosinate ammonium and was used at approximately 60 liters per year. Glufosinate ammonium was in liquid form, diluted in water, and sprinkled enough on the stems and leaves of weeds. He also sprayed the aphid drug once a year in June. The patient wore personal protective equipment, such as a raincoat while working. He did not wear protective glasses or a mask because he sweated easily. Although he wore the raincoat, the direction of the wind changed frequently, and the patient was often exposed to pesticides through his respiratory tract and skin.\n\nHe was diagnosed with AML and received induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine. As 20% of the blasts remained in the bone marrow test conducted two weeks later, additional chemotherapy was administered. The bone marrow test conducted two weeks after additional chemotherapy showed less than 5% blasts, and he was discharged. Since then, the patient has undergone consolidation chemotherapy two more times, and had complaints neutropenic fever, but he is currently doing well without any symptoms. There has been no abnormality in blood tests since the consolidation therapy, and it has been well maintained in remission.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThis is a case report of a farmer diagnosed with AML that was considered to have been caused by pesticide exposure. To date, well-known risk factors of AML include aging, male, smoking, chemotherapy, radiation exposure, infection, history of hematologic diseases, genetic disorders, family history of AML, and chemical exposure.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> In this case, the patient is a 46-year-old male, is a non-smoker, has no past medical history other than hypothyroidism, has no family history of AML, and has been engaged in agriculture for 20 years. AML is generally a disease in the elderly and is not common before the age of 45. The prevalence of AML in Koreans increases noticeably at the age of 60, and the average onset age is known to be in the mid-60s.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6–8]</u></a></sup> However, since this patient is relatively young and a non-smoker, risk factor such as old age and smoking are unlikely to be the causes of this disease. In addition, all other well-known risk factors for AML, such as chemotherapy, radiation exposure, infection, hematopoietic disorder, genetic disorder, and family history of AML, are not applicable in this patient, and was excluded.\n\nExposure chemicals that may cause AML include benzene, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, chemotherapeutic drugs, dioxin, 1,3-butadiene, and pesticides.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Since the patient has not been exposed to anything other than pesticides for 20 years, it is suggested that pesticides might have caused the disease. However, since previous measurements of pesticides used on the farm do not exist and measuring the patient's working environment is impossible as he was no longer working in the farm, we could not obtain an exact pesticide exposure value. Therefore, we estimated and compared the approximate levels of pesticide exposure based on a review of the literature.\n\nFirst, in the 2017 Korean Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs Statistics Yearbook, the agricultural area and pesticide use in Korea were identified and compared with the patient's case. The average pesticide use in Korea is 9.3 kg/ha, and the average surface area per person in the agricultural population is 0.66 ha.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> In this case, the most used insecticide, terbufos, is estimated to have been used 55 times the average pesticide use in Korea, as the usage of terbufos is 20 kg per hectare, and the farming scale is 16.5 ha. However, this approach has limitations in that it uses the statistics aggregated based on the amount of production or shipment, not on the actual amount of pesticide used by farmers, and the statistics represent the total amount of pesticides, not the specific pesticide classified by the purpose.\n\nSecond, through a literature review using the pesticide exposure index, we identified the actual state of pesticide use. Many domestic studies that have been previously published have investigated the health effects and exposure risks of pesticides using indirect pesticide exposure index calculated through pesticide spraying years, annual pesticide spraying days, pesticide spraying times per once, and annual pesticide spraying times.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10–14]</u></a></sup> Most commonly used overseas is the method of calculating exposure index developed by Agricultural Health Study,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> which calculates the cumulative exposure using the following equation:\n\n*   Cumulative exposure index = Intensity level × Duration × Frequency\n\nHere, the intensity level is calculated by adding each weight according to the mixing states of pesticides, how to apply pesticides, and whether to repair pesticide spreaders and multiplying it by the type of personal protective equipment and the number of combinations. Eventually, the exposure is largely determined by the intensity level, duration, and frequency. We assumed that the intensity level of the patient and that of general farmers were the same and compared the exposure index by using only the duration and frequency. First, the data on the items required to calculate the intensity level were insufficient. No data were available to determine the mixing state and the repair state, and for personal protective equipment, only the number of farmers wearing each protective equipment in the statistics office data could be known, making it difficult to calculate the score for each personal protective equipment type and combination. Second, in the aforementioned domestic papers, the method of calculating only the duration and frequency as a surrogate of the exposure index has been widely used in previous studies. Hence, the duration was set as the pesticide spraying time per once, the frequency was set as the number of annual pesticide spraying times, and the exposure index was defined as the annual pesticide spraying time and compared. Table 1 summarizes the information related to the exposure index in studies that investigated the use of pesticides in general household farms. The patient sprays pesticides for 2.5 h per year and for 92 days per year, it can be said that the patient sprays pesticides for approximately 232 hours per year. When this is applied to each paper, the exposure exceeds the average of the annual pesticide spraying time plus 1.96 standard deviation, so it can be evaluated as the level of exposure within the top 1%.\n\nTable 1 - Status of pesticide use by general farmers in Korea.\n\n| Author | Number of subjects | Years of pesticide use | Hours of pesticide use for once | Days of pesticide use per year | Hours of pesticide use per year |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lee et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> | 104 (male) | 24.17 ± 9.57 |  | 10.46 ± 6.68 |  |\n| Kwon et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> | 285 (total) | 22.7 ± 13.7 | 3.7 ± 3.1 | 13.2 ± 10.7 | 54.0 ± 55.8 |\n|  | 123 (dry field) | 24.5 ± 15.6 | 3.5 ± 3.0 | 11.9 ± 10.4 | 41.1 ± 49.9 |\n|  | 22 (husbandry) | 15.1 ± 9.1 | 1.9 ± 1.5 | 15.3 ± 13.5 | 25.8 ± 27.7 |\n|  | 140 (orchard) | 22.4 ± 11.7 | 5.0 ± 3.2 | 15.4 ± 10.4 | 69.6 ± 59.3 |\n| Choi et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> | 7130 (male) |  | 2.16 ± 0.02 | 10.62 ± 0.13 | 21.73 ± 0.41 |\n|  | 3879 (female) |  | 2.01 ± 0.03 | 10.97 ± 0.18 | 21.21 ± 0.54 |\n| Song et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> | 257 (total) | 25.5 ± 15.2 | 3.4 ± 2.8 | 17.7 ± 27.0 |  |\n|  | 229 (general) | 25.2 ± 15.8 | 2.8 ± 2.4 | 14.4 ± 24.2 |  |\n|  | 28 (high land) | 27.5 ± 11.5 | 6.7 ± 2.2 | 35.9 ± 34.4 |  |\n| Lee et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> | 755 (dry field) |  | 2.4 ± 3.4 | 7.3 ± 9.4 | 8.8 ± 13.4 |\n\nData are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the cause of AML may be hypothyroidism. Some studies have suggested an association between autoimmune diseases, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and the development of AML and myelodysplastic syndrome.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u></a></sup> However, the exposure assessment results, in which the patient's pesticide exposure level was 55 times higher than the average pesticide use in Korea and pesticide exposure time in the top 1% of domestic farmers’ annual pesticide use hours, suggest that the former explanation is more likely.\n\nPesticides are chemical substances used in agriculture to kill pests that harm crops and have been produced since the 1930s. Because pesticides have a relatively short history of exposure, given that harmful environmental substances typically require a long latent period of several years to several decades for chronic health effects, it is rather difficult to determine their chronic effects on the human body. Nevertheless, several studies have been conducted on the chronic effects of pesticides on the human body, especially cancer, and demonstrated that pesticides are related not only to an increase in the overall incidence of cancer but also to an increase in the individual incidence of certain cancers, including hematologic malignancies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u></a></sup>\n\nAlthough there is growing evidence for an association between hematological malignancies and pesticides, there are discrepancies in the types of hematological malignancies. Numerous studies have shown the effect of occupational pesticide exposure on the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but relatively inconsistent results for AML.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20–22]</u></a></sup> Two recent meta-analyses have investigated the association between pesticide exposure and AML. Van Maele-Fabry et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> reported a significantly increased AML risk related to occupational pesticide exposure in cohort studies, although no significant association was found in case-control studies, and Foucault et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> showed an association between occupational pesticide exposure and AML in highly selected case-control studies. Although this case report has a limitation in terms of the level of evidence inherent in the study design, it is thought to be meaningful in that it suggests an association between occupational pesticide exposure and AML, consistent with the results of the recent studies mentioned above.\n\nThis case report has several limitations. First, we could not measure the patient's working environment as he was no longer able to farm, so we could not present objective exposure levels. Second, pesticides contain inert ingredients, such as organic solvents and surfactants, in addition to the active ingredients. Therefore, the possibility that cancer may have occurred because of the inert ingredients should also be considered. Third, agriculture can be exposed to a number of harmful factors. In addition to pesticides, there may be interactions such as fertilizers, organic solvents, dust, and microbial toxins. Future studies should evaluate these points.\n\nAssessing the health effects of pesticide exposure is important for farmers, other occupations such as gardeners and pesticide manufacturers, and the general population exposed to pesticide residues.

By end of February 2021, there have been more than 115 million confirmed cases with COVID-19 and nearly 2.5 million deaths around the world.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> The outcome and the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in transplant patients are still not clear. Some early reports suggested that immunosuppression can have a protective role in patients with COVID-19,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u></a></sup> but others reported a severe course and a high early mortality among patients with solid organ transplants.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5–8]</u></a></sup> However, a more recent study in Spain performed a propensity score matching and showed that solid organ transplant recipients did not experience worse outcomes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Thus, more data is clearly needed for a more precise prognostic assessment. Moreover, the specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 in immunosuppressed patients are also unclear at this point.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 46-year-old female patient received an ABO-incompatible living donor kidney transplant in December 2018 and was on maintenance triple immunosuppressive therapy (tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisone). She was not obese (Body mass index 22 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), had a known history of hypertension and Hashimoto's thyroiditis but no diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Her other medications included cholecalciferol, levothyroxine, erythropoietin, omeprazole and candesartan. Until March 2020, she suffered from several infectious complications (including chronic norovirus shedding and salmonella infections), indicating an immunocompromised state. On March 14, 2020, she developed a dry cough without fever or shortness of breath. SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab was performed in an outpatient setting on March 16, 2020 with a negative result. With worsening dry cough, new onset of fever and neck pain she presented in the Emergency Department on March 21, 2020. Again, SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR via nasopharyngeal swab was done and a negative result was obtained for the second time. The inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin and leukocytes) were all within the normal range. The computed tomography (CT) of the chest demonstrated mild ground glass opacity affecting all lobes of both lungs . Based on the patient's request, she was not admitted. Mycophenolate was discontinued and moxifloxacin was prescribed to treat presumed bacterial superinfection. The general condition of the patient was deteriorating slowly. On March 28, 2020, two weeks from the onset of the symptoms, the patient was admitted to our hospital . In addition to the ongoing symptoms of upper respiratory infection, she now developed drowsiness, nausea, headache and neck pain as well as vomiting and diarrhea. The patient was clinically dehydrated. She did not need oxygen supply (oxygen saturation 95%–98% on room air, respiratory rate 18/min). The laboratory results showed hyponatremia and lymphopenia as well as mild elevation of creatinine and CRP levels. A second computed tomography scan showed a progress of the ground glass opacities, typical for COVID-19 pneumonia .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nComputed tomography of the chest in different stages of the illness showing progression of the radiological finding.

The gargle sample was negative as were respiratory syncytial virus - and Influenza-PCR. To reach a diagnosis we performed a bronchoalveolar lavage on March 31, 2020. On April 1, 2020, we received the lab report, showing SARS-CoV-2-RNA positive results (RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) in bronchoalveolar lavage as well as in the stool sample  with Ct values of 38.5 for the E-gene and 36.7 for the S-gene. Prior to the bronchoscopy, we treated the patient with fluids, antipyretics und antiemetics. The patient did not need oxygen supply. After the bronchoscopy, the patient developed a respiratory insufficiency and had to be admitted to the intensive care unit  where she was treated with non-invasive ventilation.\n\nOn the following day however, the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated. The inflammatory markers increased dramatically after the bronchoscopy . Therefore, the patient received antibiotics and supportive treatment. Tacrolimus was stopped and prednisone dose was increased. Additionally, the patient received 30 g intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The patient developed a moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome and she required vasopressor therapy for the first 4 days after admission in the intensive care unit. After 11 days in the intensive care unit we noticed a new surge of the CRP and procalcitonin levels . A chest CT  was done and showed worsening of the of the ground glass opacities. Another course of antibiotics was prescribed. Serial blood cultures as well as cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative. Renal transplant function deteriorated slightly at the beginning, however without the need of renal replacement therapy. Within 2 weeks the patient showed marked clinical improvement after antibiotic treatment of her presumed superinfection, and she was extubated after seventeen days. Furthermore, the initially elevated creatinine levels returned to within normal range. After being temporarily stopped for 3 weeks, tacrolimus was reintroduced 10 days after the transfer to the medical word . The steroids were gradually tapered to the maintenance dose of 5 mg. Mycophenolate was started in reduced doses (250 mg bid) prior to discharge from the hospital. The serologic, in vitro diagnostic and European conformity labeled test (moeLAB/Biozol, Langenfeld, Germany) revealed a strong IgM and a moderate IgG response, while 2 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests from gargle samples revealed negative results. Another stool PCR analysis for SARS-CoV-2 was not performed. 60 days from the onset of symptoms the patient was discharged into a rehabilitation facility. Three and a half months after discharge from the hospital the patient was seen in follow-up visit. The patient still had exertional dyspnea and was still fatigued, but follow-up chest CT showed marked improvement and the ground glass opacity subsided .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nLevels of CRP, Procalcitonin, and creatinine during the course of the disease. CRP = C-reactive protein.</u>\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nIt is well documented that COVID-19 can be detected in various types of specimens such as throat swabs, nasal swabs, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and stool. The recently published studies have shown comparable results indicating that the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is the most sensitive followed by sputum and nasal swabs.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u></a></sup> However, whether these findings apply to immunosuppressed patients is still unclear. Some studies, from both China and Japan, reported high sensitivity of the chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19-associated parenchymatous lung changes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12–14]</u></a></sup> However, the current recommendation of the American College Of Radiology and the German Radiological Society discourages using the CT as a screening tool for COVID-19.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u></a></sup> In their view the CT lacks the specificity as many other chest infections share similar CT findings. Atypical pneumonia, Cytomegalovirus-pneumonia and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia can present with identical radiologic findings compared to COVID-19. In addition, the fact that those infections are not uncommon among transplant recipients makes the diagnosis even more challenging. In this case, the patient presented with a dry cough; hence, a sputum sample was not done. Three upper respiratory specimens (two nasopharyngeal swabs and one throat wash), collected at different times (2 days, 7 days, and 14 days after symptoms started) were all negative. The initial chest CT demonstrated findings of interstitial pneumonia, which is not specific enough. The second CT scan was highly suggestive for COVID-19. It was at the same time, when both stool PCR and PCR from Bronchoalveolar lavage were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and the diagnosis was confirmed. Since her condition worsened after the bronchoscopy, potentially due to superinfection, it has to be discussed whether this procedure was really needed to establish the diagnosis – especially after the stool also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, although with relatively high Ct values. In light of the pandemic affecting more and more countries with reduced imaging capacities, stool testing might be of additional value for detection of COVID-19 patients with the potential of isolating such patients in order to stop the spread. The usage of stool samples may also be required if swabs are limited due to delivery chain problems, a scenario we experienced early in the pandemics, which to date has not fully been solved, and which forced us to make use of gargle samples or washing.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\nTaken together, this case highlights the importance of different diagnostic approaches when dealing with transplant patients to reach a proper diagnosis of COVID-19. Invasive procedures bear the potential of worsening the clinical course. Non-invasive stool testing might be an interesting supplemental diagnostic method, with the focus on highly sensitive assays rather than quantification methods that lack a proper reference value. Whether this also holds true in patients without immunosuppression has to be tested in larger studies.\n\nManaging the immunosuppression in a way to control the infection and at the same time prevent acute graft rejection is still a big challenge. The Developing Education Science and Care for Renal Transplantation in European States working group formulated suggestions for COVID-19-infected kidney transplant recipients who are beyond 3 to 6 months after kidney transplantation in which the immunosuppression would be adjusted according to the severity of the illness and the kind of immunosuppression therapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> Numerous case-reports describing the effectiveness of IVIG against SARS-CoV-2 are available in the literature. However, several randomized and nonrandomized clinical studies suggest that IVIG treatment for patients with severe or critical COVID-19 illness does not decrease hospital mortality.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Our case shows that reduced immunosuppression and IVIG-therapy was sufficient for a complete recovery with functioning graft. No additional antiviral approach with for example, remdesivir was necessary. However, our findings are clearly observational and more data is certainly needed to be able to determine the best approach for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in transplant patients.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Amin Elfanish, Katharina Tuschen, Johanna Anders, Alexander Weidemann.\n\n**Investigation:** Andreas F.

But, many patients eventually fail therapy and die of AIPC.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> To date, there is no effective cure for prostate cancer. Hormone therapy for androgen-independent prostate cancer is intractable and the therapeutic effect is not satisfactory due to hormone-refractory prostate cancer which prostate cancer no longer responds to any hormonal treatment. Calcitriol has a wide action in some specific cancers such as colon cancer, breast and prostate cancer, which resulting calcitriol-mediated antitumor actions such as cyclin-dependent kinase, (CDK), cyclooxygenase 2, (COX2), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, (HIF1α).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> The calcitriol and analogs’ wide range use of anti-tumor effects are mostly based on mechanism action of cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness inhibition, differentiation and apoptosis induction, and angiogenesis promotion.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Preclinical and clinical data indicate that Calcitriol acts synergistically with carboplatin in preclinical models of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u></a></sup> Many authors sought to test high-dose oral calcitriol in combination with carboplatin in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u></a></sup> Thus, high-dose pulse calcitriol and docetaxel for AIPC may be an effective treatment.

The findings of the systematic review will provide scientific evidence and an important reference for clinical decision-making for AIPC.\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\n### 2.1 Study registration\n\nThis protocol was registered with the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 通用删除1(英):<u>(INPLASY no 202170028, https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2021–7–0028/)</u>. Also, it will be reported under Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P).\n\n### 2.2 Ethics\n\nEthical approval is not necessary because this is a protocol, and the data included in our study are searched from published literature.\n\n### 2.3 Inclusion criteria for study selection\n\n#### 2.3.1 Type of studies\n\nRandomized controlled trials involving the safety and efficacy of high-dose pulse calcitriol and docetaxel for AIPC will be included. The language will be limited to Chinese and English. Observational studies, duplicated publications, narrative publications, case reports, editorials, and animal studies will be excluded.\n\n#### 2.3.2 Type of participants\n\nWe will include the participants who conformed to the Guidelines for diagnosis of AIPC. The participants have no restrictions regardless of gender, age, educational background, and race.\n\n#### 2.3.3 Type of interventions\n\nThe control group was treated with docetaxel alone, and the treatment group was treated with the high-dose oral formulation of calcitriol and docetaxel.\n\n#### 2.3.4 Type of outcome measures\n\nThe main outcomes were the proportion of patients achieving prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, tumor, and clinical progression-free survival, tumor response rate, skeletal morbidity-free survival, as well as safety and tolerability of the study treatment. The clinical efficacy was evaluated according to overall response rate, overall survival, and median survival. Additional outcomes included common grade 3/4 toxicities and neutropenia, fatigue, infection, and hyperglycemia.\n\n### 2.4 Data source\n\nSeven databases included PubMed, PubMed Central, EMbase, Medline, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WAN FANG Database, and Web of Science will be systematically retrieved from January 1st, 2010 to May 30<sup>th</sup>, 2021. All the English and Chinese publications are searched without any restriction.\n\n### 2.5 Search strategy and study selection\n\n#### 2.5.1 Search strategy\n\nRandomized controlled trials of the safety and efficacy of high dose pulse calcitriol and docetaxel for AIPC will be retrieved according to the requirements of the following databases: PubMed, PubMed Central, EMbase, Medline, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wang Fang Database (WF), and Web of Science. The exemplary search strategy of PubMed was shown in supplemental Table 1, https://links.lww.com/MD-CASES/A14. Similarly, the search strategy will also be applied to other electronic databases. Furthermore, all eligible trials and relevant reviews will be searched.\n\n#### 2.5.2 Studies selection\n\nTwo independent authors (XG and YD) will scanning titles, abstracts to eliminate relatively unrelated literature. References will be managed by EndNote X9 software (Clarivate Analytics, Boston, MA) and duplicate articles will be removed. When there is a dispute, the full text of the potentially eligible studies will be retrieved and independently assessed for eligibility by two reviewers (XG and YD). Any disagreements arising from this process will be resolved by consensus or adjudicated by a third investigator (TQ). According to the search strategy, the search and screening of the literature screening will be performed according to the developed inclusion and exclusion criteria and the eligible included kinds of literature will be identified, which the selection process will be shown in Figure 1.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nFlow schematic diagram of study selection process.</u>\n\n### 2.6 Data extraction and analysis\n\n#### 2.6.1 Data extraction\n\nAfter identifying the included literature, two independent reviews (XG and YD) will independently extract information based on the following three characteristics: general information (author, county, sample size, age, gender, diagnostic criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria), interventions (interventions in treatment and control groups, duration, follow-up time), and outcomes (type of indicators and methods of determination). If studies were missing some relevant information included, they will contact for further information. Any disagreements arising from this process will be resolved by consensus or adjudicated by a third investigator (TQ).\n\n#### 2.6.2 Strategy for data synthesis\n\nThe meta-analysis analysis and data synthesis will be conducted by RevMan V.5.3.0 software (The Nordic Cochrane Center, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014, Copenhagen, Denmark). When outcome measures do not correspond among studies, the standardized mean difference will be used. Dichotomous data will be analyzed using relative risks with 95% confidence intervals, or standardized mean differences (95%) confidence interval will be used to analyze the continuous data.\n\n#### 2.6.3 Risk of bias assessment\n\nThe methodological quality of randomized controlled trials will be assessed by two independent reviews (XG and YD) via the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The characteristic items included random sequence generation, participant blinding, outcome assessor blinding, incomplete outcome data, other bias, and exclusions. The risk of bias items will include low, high, or unclear risk of bias.\n\n#### 2.6.4 Subgroup analysis\n\nIf there are a sufficient number of kinds of literature, we will perform subgroup analysis to seek a possible cause of heterogeneity.\n\n#### 2.6.5 Sensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis will be done to eliminate the impact of low-quality kinds of literature after validation of inputted data to make sure the results are reliable. However, if the included studies are at high risk of bias, sensitivity analysis will not be done.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nAIPC is a challenge to treat by the clinician in cancer management. Currently, treatment for newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer includes surgical castration or androgen deprivation therapy such as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Calcitriol is the active form of vitamin D.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> It is a hormone that binds to and activates the vitamin D receptor.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> To achieve higher serum concentrations and maximum antitumor effects, clinical studies have used 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub>) plus other anticancer drugs.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> Some of the studies reported promising antitumor activity. Beer et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> reported that the application of high doses (20 IU /kg) of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub> combined with docetaxel and carboplatin was safe and well-tolerated. A phase II study, combined therapy with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub> weekly (DN-101, 1800 IU) and daily naproxen recurrent for prostate cancer, declared that the encouraging benefits with doubling the duration of PSA.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> On the contrary, another study of phase II trial 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub> intravenously applied at a dose of 2960 IU in combination with dexamethasone for castration-resistant prostate cancer reported no positive results of producing a clinical or PSA response in men, but acquired well tolerated toxically.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> High dose pulse calcitriol, docetaxel and estramustine for androgen independent prostate cancer was conducted in a phase I/II study,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> which its results showed that a total of 24 patients, 11 who were chemotherapy naïve and 13 who were evaluable for toxicity, and 22 for PSA decrease data and the regimen was generally well tolerated.\n\nVitamin D<sub>3</sub> might benefit prostate cancer patients because prostate cells can locally synthesize the active hormone calcitriol.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u></a></sup> Dennis Wagner and colleages<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial at surgical oncology clinics in Toronto, Canada to determine the effects of oral vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on vitamin D metabolites and prostate cancer proliferative activity in prostate tissue. They concluded that oral vitamin D<sub>3</sub> raised prostate calcitriol levels (level 1 evidence) and modestly lowered both PSA and PTH.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22,23]</u></a></sup> Although there was limited clinical use of vitamin D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub> for administering high doses and consequently of the hypercalcemia induced by them, they rely on fewer calcium analogs of vitamin D treatments combined with other anticancer drugs,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24–26]</u></a></sup> thus, more thorough epidemiological studies on vitamin D and prostate cancer risk may be needed to verify this. In summary, our study will be comprehensive to evaluate the safety and efficacy of high-dose pulse calcitriol and docetaxel for AIPC, which may provide the direction treatment for AIPC patients.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Data curation:** Xiaoyong Guan Yanling Ding.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Yanling Ding, Xiaoyong Guan.\n\n**Funding acquisition:** Tao Qi, Yanling Ding.\n\n**Investigation:** Yanling Ding, Tao Qi.\n\n**Methodology:** Xiaoyong, Yanling Ding.\n\n**Project administration:** Tao Qi.\n\n**Resources:** Tao Qi, Xiaoyong Guan.\n\n**Software:** Xiaoyong Guan, Yanling Ding.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Tao Qi, Yanling Ding.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Tao Qi, Xiaoyong Guan.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:08:33", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:10:27", "cost": 114.952}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:10:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:08:31"}

Thus, scaphoid nonunions where malperfusion plays a role can more likely occur on the proximal scaphoid pole. Treatment options for scaphoid nonunion mainly focus on surgery with open reduction and internal fixation aided by either vascularized or non-vascularized bone grafting, however there is no consensus on the most appropriate treatment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u></a></sup>\n\nNon-surgical therapeutic options include low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) as well as extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT). LIPUS with intensities of 0.5 to 50 mW /cm<sup>2</sup> is considered to stimulate bone healing. A recent study<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> of 66 patients with non-healing fractures reported a 67% LIPUS overall success rate. However, in post-surgical scaphoid fractures LIPUS treatment is not effective.\n\nESWT has been reported in scaphoid nonunion as early as 2000 by an Italian group. They treated 153 scaphoid fractures with 4 sessions of focused electromagnetic ESWT with 4000 shots per session and 0.5mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> every third day.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Seven weeks later, 48% were completely healed, and 37% were partially healed. At 16 weeks, the total healing rate was 53% and partial healing rate was 31%.\n\nThe novel Magnetolith therapy follows the principle of extracorporeal magnetotransduction therapy (EMTT), which is a noninvasive therapeutic option. EMTT is a promising new technology of treatment based on pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) with magnetic field strength between 10 and 80 mT and oscillating frequencies of 100 to 300 k Hertz. EMTT is characterized by high-frequency oscillating magnetic fields with an effective transduction performance of >60 kiloTesla/second (kT/s). This is in contrast to pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy, where effective transduction performance is <60kT/s with the commercially available PEMF machines. Impulses are emitted by a high-speed generator that is released in nanoseconds with an impulse release frequency of up to 8 Hertz. The very short duration of each impulse ensures full electrophysical reaction without any temperature rise in the tissue.\n\nThis case report highlights the combination of high-energy focused electromagnetic ESWT with novel EMTT with Magnetolith for bone stimulation after 2 previous failed hand surgeries. The case is reported according to the CARE guidelines for case reports.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup>\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 31-year old consultant suffered a scaphoid fracture in 2005 on his left wrist when he was 16 years old, as a result of handball playing. However, this was neglected and an appropriate diagnosis of scaphoid nonunion was made only in 2011. In March 2012, he underwent the first surgery in his hand with a non-vascularized bone graft from the iliac crest and a Herbert screw.\n\nDue to prolonged wrist pain, a second surgery in his hand (revision surgery) was performed in December 2019 with a non-vascularized iliac bone graft and a Herbert screw. In March 2020, 4 months after the revision surgery, he was admitted to my practice due to prolonged bony healing (16 weeks) visualized by a CT scan and chief complaint of wrist pain. Risk factor analysis revealed he was a nonsmoker and non-diabetic. Physical examination in March 2020 revealed wrist pain on the radial aspect of the wrist. Pain was aggravated on dorsal extension of the wrist under load. The timeline is highlighted in Figure 1.

The scaphoid nonunion line was visualized by high-resolution ultrasound both from the palmar and dorsal aspect of the wrist. Focused high-energy ESWT was then performed with 2000 impulses from the palmar aspect and 2000 impulses from the dorsal aspect to the scaphoid.\n\nExtracorporeal magnetotransduction therapy (EMTT) was performed immediately after the high-energy focused ESWT with Magnetolith (Storz Medical, Tägerwilen, Switzerland) with energy level 8, 8 Hertz and 6000 impulses per session. No complications of either ESWT or EMTT treatment were evident, and there was no bleeding or hematoma.\n\nA customized plaster was worn until May 14, 2020.\n\nAfter the therapeutic intervention with 3 sessions of combined focused ESWT and EMTT, a cone beam CT scan of the wrist was performed with the MedSeries H22 system on May 14, 2020, which was performed 5 weeks after the last bone stimulation therapy .

The patient was very satisfied with the bone stimulation treatment. The wrist cast was removed after the CBCT and the patient started gradually with strengthening exercises using the TheraBand FlexBar with supination and pronation with straight elbows with 3 x 15 repetitions twice a day for 3 months to strengthen the forearm and hand muscles.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThis is the first report on the combination of high-energy focused electromagnetic ESWT and novel Magnetolith EMTT treatment for bone stimulation therapy after a failed scaphoid revision surgery. Accelerated bony consolidation could be visualized by cone beam CT with the Sophisticated computer system MedSeries H22 system allowing metallic-artefact-suppression sequences after failed revision scaphoid surgery.\n\nThe beneficial use of focused high-energy ESWT alone has been reported as early as 2000<sup>6</sup>. Scaphoid perfusion is improved by high-energy-focused ESWT, as reported recently by Laser-Doppler flowmetry after piezoelectric-focused ESWT (0.3mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, 8 Hertz, 1000 impulses).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> A single piezoelectric focused ESWT session increased the scaphoid blood flow by 39% within 30 minutes. Scaphoid bony healing in nonunion situations with focused high-energy ESWT alone has reported a success rate of 70% to 80%<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u></a></sup> in a 6-month follow-up period. Success factors in scaphoid nonunion ESWT involve timing of initiation of focused high-energy ESWT; the sooner, the better as well as a simultaneous scaphoid cast during the treatment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup>\n\nThis aforementioned benefit of focused high-energy ESWT is based on the high and focused energy transmitted to the bony nonunion, which is mediated by mechanotransduction.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u></a></sup> High-energy energy is defined as an energy flux density >0.25mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, which is only achieved by focused ESWT and not by radial pressure waves.\n\nThe novel EMTT with Magnetolith can add clinically beneficial effects to the focused ESWT. In a randomized trial<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> on nonspecific LBP comparing standard therapy (physiotherapy with core stabilization plus non-opiate analgesics) with or without additional EMTT therapy with 88 patients randomized 1:1, the combination group was superior in terms of pain reduction on the visual analog scale with an improvement in the Oswestry disability index score. In rotator cuff tendinopathy, an RCT underpins this observation with superior results when combining focused high-energy ESWT and EMTT.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup>\n\nTo date, no data have been published on the combination of focused ESWT and novel EMTT for bone stimulation, which is why this case report is unique. EMTT is characterized by high-frequency oscillating magnetic fields with an effective transduction performance of >60kTesla/second (kT/s), which is physically different from pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy machine with effective transduction performance significantly lower than 60kT/s.\n\nPEMF has been reported to inhibit cellular apoptosis and modulate cytoskeletal distribution in osteocytes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> Clinically, a recent review<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> of 22 studies (1468 participants) reported that PEMF increases the healing rate in fractures and accelerates the healing time. However, larger scale randomized controlled trials are mandatory in this regard, especially in terms of optimal timing, amplitude, and duration of the PEMF effects.\n\nThis case highlights the potential of the combination of focused high-energy electromagnetic ESWT and novel EMTT. Future prospective trials are warranted to elucidate its role in the field of sports medicine in stress fractures as well as an adjunct after surgery for rapid rehabilitation in high-level athletes after fractures.\n\nTo conclude, the combination of novel noninvasive Magnetolith extracorporeal magnetotransduction therapy (EMTT) with focused high-energy electromagnetic ESWT for 3 sessions on a weekly interval can significantly accelerate bony healing in scaphoid nonunion. This is the first report to apply novel EMTT and high-energy focused ESWT for scaphoid nonunion after 2 scaphoid surgeries with substantial acceleration of scaphoid bone healing.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nKK did the entire case report.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:46:40", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:47:18", "cost": 37.845}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:47:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:46:39"}

The impact on quality of life and economic implications are considerable. The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders ranges between 20%–33% and also varies by age and diagnosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> The Global Burden of Disease estimated that from 1999–2017, low back pain is the single leading cause of disability globally.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> The neck pain and low back prevalence have increased by 19%, and Years Lived with Disabilities due to these conditions increased 19% over the last ten years.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> In India, low back and neck pain are important leading contributors to the disability burden among both genders. There is 66% increase in the mean percentage of change of number of Disability Adjusted Life Years from 1990 to 2016 for low back and neck pain at the National level.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> In Tamil Nadu, these conditions remain the third leading cause among the top 15 causes of Years Lived with Disabilities for both genders in 2016. Infact, low back and neck pain has moved from 18th to 9th position in the leading causes of death and disability from 1990 to 2016.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup>\n\nTraditional medicine is defined as “the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement, or treatment of physical and mental illness”.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> In India, traditional and alternative systems of medicine are widespread across the country as people connect them as more natural, of low cost, and presumably with fewer/no side effects. Indian traditional medicine collectively called as Ayurveda, Yoga and naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Sowa-rigpa and Homeopathy (AYUSH) and is defined as “Traditional & Non-Conventional Systems of Health Care and Healing Which Include Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy etc,” The AYUSH systems are based on definite medical philosophies and provide a way of healthy living with concepts on prevention of diseases and promotion of health.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> As mentioned by India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, there are 1.2 million registered allopathy doctors and 0.78 million AYUSH doctors in the country.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup>\n\nUse of AYUSH medicines for neck and back pain are common due to its availability and accessibility. The studies have documented that patients with either lumbar or cervical spondylosis consult Complementary and alternative medicine/ Traditional medicine.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Traditionally, the AYUSH medicines are considered as safe and have little or no known adverse side effects if they follow the procedures as mentioned in the literature. Several pharmacological (drugs) and non-pharmacological interventions such as Yoga are used for treatment of these conditions in AYUSH. So, it is necessary to document adverse events and adverse drug events of such interventions. It may be important to define what is an Adverse Drug Event (ADE) and Adverse Event (AE) and its relevance to AYUSH systems of medicine. An ADE is defined as “_Any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with a pharmaceutical product but that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment_.”<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Under this definition, the term ADE includes harm caused by the medicine (adverse drug reactions and overdoses) and harm from medicine use (including dose reductions and discontinuations of drug therapy). The AE is defined as “_Medical occurrence temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, but not necessarily causally related”_.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Basically, the adverse event is a broader term which covers the medical problems both from the drug or therapy. Adverse events and adverse drug events detection, documentation, and reporting of adverse events are fundamental to Pharmacovigilance activities which is the science of assessing and monitoring the risk/benefit profiles of medications throughout their lifecycle.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u></a></sup>\n\nSystematic reviews are available for surgical procedures, drug interventional, and manipulative therapy in the conventional systems of medicine for spondylosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> AYUSH medicines largely use plants as raw materials to manufacture drugs, though the materials of marine and animal origin, metals, and minerals are also used as raw materials. However, the quality issues and safety concerns of Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and Homoeopathy (ASU&H) drugs have been raised from various sources.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15–17]</u></a></sup> There are certain challenges to conduct literature review in AYUSH system as majority of the articles are published in non-indexed journals and there is no dedicated database for AYUSH system. AYUSH research portal and digital helpline for ayurveda research articles (DHARA) \\[First comprehensive online indexing exclusively for research articles published in the field of Ayurveda\\] were created by the government of India. These two are major databases and have more than 30,000 AYUSH research articles. Since these databases do not have any controlled search strategy and the Boolean operators will not function.Hence we need to follow a separate search strategy to search and retrieve all the AYUSH related articles.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18–21]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe Ministry of AYUSH felt it is necessary to oversee the impact of ASU&H drugs consumed by the people from their safety profile. Hence, it has been promoting the pharmacovigilance of ASU&H drugs to document adverse effects and undertake safety monitoring of ASU&H. Under this scheme, a three-tier network pharmacovigilance centres at the National Pharmacovigilance Centres, Intermediary pharmacovigilance centres (IPvCC) \\[five centres\\] and at the peripheral pharmacovigilance centres (PPvCC) \\[42 centres\\] levels to take up the reporting, compilation and analysis and assessment of ADEs associated with ASU&H.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> Overall, this initiative is meant to detect potentially unsafe ASU&H medicines for taking regulatory action against them. Currently there is no systematic review on AE on the use of AYUSH interventions is available. This study aimed to synthesize evidence from the adverse events attributable to pharmacological and non-pharmacological AYUSH interventions for lumbar and cervical spondylosis.\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\nThe protocol was prepared using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> statement. The protocol also registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO). The PROSPERO number is CRD42020167433.\n\n### 2.1 Criteria for including studies in this review\n\nSelection criteria of the study protocol followed the Participants, Interventions, Comparisons, Outcome and Study design (PICOS) approach.\n\n### 2.2 Language\n\nWe will include the research studies in English language.\n\n### 2.3 Time settings\n\nWe will include all the studies published until April 2021 for the current review.\n\n### 2.4 Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n\nThe inclusion and exclusion of the study using PICOS method are presented in Table 1\n\nTable 1 - Inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\n| PICOS strategy | Inclusion criteria | Exclusion criteria |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| P-Population | Cervical and lumbar spondylosis patients of any age, irrespective of gender and geographical region. | Musculoskeletal disorders other than cervical and lumbar spondylosis |\n| I-Intervention | AYUSH interventions (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa, and Homeopathy) including both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions | Other than AYUSH system of medicine such as Chinsese, Conventional, massage, physiotheraphy etc. |\n| C-Comparator | Not Applicable | Not Applicable |\n| O-Outcome | The primary outcome of the study will be frequency and types Adverse Events (AE) attributable to AYUSH medications and procedures. | AYUSH studies those don’t have AE data |\n| S- Study design | Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, open clinical trials, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, quasi experimental studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case series, and case studies, qualitative studies and pilot studies, dissertation and Thesis. | Systematic review and meta analysis, animal studies, books, protocols, studies with incomplete information. |\n\nPICOS = Participants, Interventions, Comparisons, Outcome and Study designs.\n\n### 2.5 Information sources\n\nWe will search the databases such as PubMed , Embase , Scopus , Google Scholar , ProQuest , AYUSH research portal , DHARA  and Shodhganga . In addition, we will search reports and published documents of National Pharmacovigilance Centres, IPvCCs and PPvCC of AYUSH.\n\n### 2.6 Search strategy\n\nWe will perform the search strategy to augment methodological efficiency and to improve the reproducibility of the results. As a first step we formulated the research question using the PICOS strategy<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> and the question of the systematic review was elaborated to facilitate the data abstraction: What is the occurrence of adverse events in cervical/lumbar spondylosis patients taking pharmacological/non-pharmacological AYUSH interventions?\n\nResearch articles will be retrieved from biomedical databases, Indian traditional medical data bases and portals up to April 2021. Only the articles in English language will be considered for the review. We verified and compiled the medical subject headings terms and the synonyms as per PICOS in selected databases with Boolean operators such as “OR” and “AND”.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> We collected different terminologies of cervical and lumbar spondylosis in the AYUSH system of medicine. For this purpose, we have referred the National AYUSH Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies Electronic portal portal and obtained experts opinion from the specific traditional medical system. These free text-words or field terms were combined to decide the ‘field terms’ and to build search strategy as presented in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 - Standardised diagnostic classification and codes for cervical and lumbar spondylosis in Allopathy and AYUSH systems of medicine.\n\n|  | Standardized terminologies and morbidity codes† |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | \n* * *\n\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic classification and standard code∗ | Ayurveda | Unani | Siddha |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cervical spondylosis (M47.812) | Greevastampha (AAB-33) | Waja‘ al-Mafāil (L-4) | Saganavatham (Z27) |\n| Lumbar spondylosis (M43.16) | Kati shoola | Waja‘ al Khāira (L 2) | Tandagavatham (Z34) |\n|  |  | Waja‘ al-Mafāil, (L-4) |  |\n\n<sup>∗</sup>International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD 10).\n\n<sup>†</sup>National AYUSH Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies Electronic Portal (NAMASTE - Portal).\n\n#### 2.6.1 Biomedical databases\n\nThe search strategy in biomedical databases will aim to locate both the published and unpublished studies. We will identify the search terms by literature review, published articles and discussion with experts. A three-step search strategy will be followed in this review. An initial search of PubMed/MEDLINE will be undertaken, followed by analysis of the text words in the title and abstract search. All identified index terms and keywords will then be undertaken across all included databases for second search. For additional studies, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched. The search terms will be constructed based on the domains of Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome and Study design. Then these search terms combined using Boolean operator “OR” within the same domain, and “AND” Boolean operator between the domains of PICOS 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[Tables 2 and 3\\]</u>.

have any specific search strategy to search and retrieve the articles except the simple search with key words. So, we will have to develop our own search strategy to retrieve the articles from these databases. The retrieved articles will be stored in excel and will be uploaded in Rayyan for store, organize and screening. We will use simple key words to search in these databases to retrieve the articles. We will search the articles using Title, Abstract, Author, Journal and year of the articles in Search option available in the databases. We will use these limited facilities to retrieve the articles and will be stored in Rayyan for screening. Shodhganga, an Indian database for postgraduate thesis in India and the thesis, is stored in digital forms in the Shodhganga. There is a Title and Keywords search option in Shodhganga. We will use these options to retrieve the documents and store for screening and analysis.\n\n### 2.7 Selection of studies\n\nWe will screen the titles and abstracts of the selected articles using two independent reviewers. Potentially relevant studies will be included for full text review. The full text of selected articles will be reviewed by the two independent reviewers. The reasons for exclusion of the articles during of full text screening will be recorded and reported. A third reviewer will be involved if any disagreement arises during the selection process from the reviewers and these disagreements will be resolved through discussion. The final results of this search will be reported in full in the final systematic review and presented as mentioned in the PRISMA- P updated 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u> flow diagram.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 2.8 Data extraction process\n\nEligible studies will be critically assessed by two independent reviewers. We will use standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute for experimental and quasi-experimental studies, descriptive studies and comparable/ cohort studies. The study reviewers will contact the corresponding authors of selected articles to obtain additional information on poorly reported items if needed. We will try maximum three times through mail. If still not responded, we will exclude the incomplete studies from the study. A third reviewer will resolve if any disagreements arise from the reviewers through t discussion. If we come across the articles of the authors conducting the review, the articles will be critically appraised by the independent reviewer. We will report the results of critical appraisal in form and in a table.\n\n### 2.9 Data management\n\nAll the citations will be uploaded in the Rayyan  software for screening. The duplicates and irrelevant documents will be removed during the screening process.\n\n### 2.10 Data items\n\nWe will extract the data from the selected papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool by independent reviewers. A third reviewer will resolve if any disagreements arise between the reviewers during the process through discussion. The reviewers will contact of the authors of papers to request missing or additional data wherever required.\n\nThe data will be captured using data extraction form. We will collect the general article information such as corresponding author details, journal name, year of publication and country from the selected articles. The study characteristics such as objectives of the study, methods of randomization, blinding, sample size, analysis will also be captured. The participant's characteristics such as age, gender, regions (urban or rural or tribal) or state, health facility (private or public), condition of the patients, will also be captured. The intervention details such as types of system of medicine, type of study, types of medicine (internal/external), name of the medicine, dose of the medicine, route of the administration, adjuvant, duration of the treatment (days), any dietary recommendations will be collected. The outcome related information such as outcome of the treatment, signs and symptoms of AE, organs or systems affected, duration, treatments status will be captured in the data extraction form.\n\n### 2.11 Assessment of reporting of bias\n\nAssessing the methodological quality and general reporting quality of selected studies will be done separately as this will differentiate between quality of reporting and the quality of conduct of the study. Appropriateness of the study design to estimate the disease parameters with respect representative to the population, methodology used and completeness of the reported data will be recorded. Methodology of a study will be assessed based on how it is protecting the systematic bias and inferential error for the measured outcomes. Reporting quality of each included study will be done, such as appropriate usage of case definitions, adequacy of the sample size with respect to the reported estimates; that reporting of the denominator data and source of the data; that the usage of appropriate statistics; that the sources of potential bias are adequately controlled; and that the identified limitations which will influence the study outcome and interpretations. Suitable tools will be used to assess the risk of bias in the study. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scale will be used for non-randomized controlled studies to assess the risk of bias. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scale for non randomized controlled studies and the risk of bias-2 for randomised trials will be to assess the risk of bias. Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies risk of bias tool will be used for cross-sectional studies.\n\n### 2.12 Data synthesis\n\nQuantitative Synthesis or meta-analysis of AE will be considered only on the availability of the sufficient number of primary studies. Type and frequency of AE will be calculated for each system of medicine. AE will be expressed as frequency and proportion. To assess heterogeneity between the AYUSH systems of medicine, we will first attempt to recheck for data entry error or unit of analysis error. We will use _I_\\-square statistics to measure heterogeneity among the studies. If substantial heterogeneity exists (_I_ square > 50%), we will further explore the heterogeneity by sub group or sensitivity analysis. We will also do sub analysis for mixed treatment category.\n\nWe will summarize data on demographics, region of the study, patterns of commonly observed AE including length of hospital stay, type of drugs used for patient, types of methods used for treatment and type of AE developed during the treatment, etc using central tendency measures (ranges, medians or means) and the proportions as per availability of data and provide descriptive synthesis.\n\n### 2.13 Grading the quality of evidence\n\nWe will use “Grades of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation standard form to assess the quality of evidence for this study<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> and evidence will be graded at three levels as high, medium, and low.\n\n### 2.14 Ethics\n\nEthics committee review is exempted for conducting systematic reviews as per the guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research - National ethical guidelines for biomedical and health research involving human participants.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 2.15 Dissemination\n\nWe will present this systematic review study results in charts and tables. The selection process and results of this study will be presented in a flow chart .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nFlow chart of the study process. This flow chart is based on PRISMA- P checklist. This flowchart shows the process of this study including the literature review, databases included, inclusion, and exclusion of the studies and articles included in final analysis.</u>\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThis is the first systematic review documenting the reported AE in AYUSH systems of medicine. From this study, we will generate a report on the frequency and types of adverse drug events among patients with lumbar and cervical spondylosis treated with AYUSH system and characteristics of AE such as type and nature of medications (Single drug or compound drug; herbal, minerals, metals, animals). This study may help Indian AYUSH pharmacovigilance centres to develop methods to improve quality of data on AEs. The protocol will be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols statement and guidelines.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nPM- Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing- Original draft, review and editing; MS -Methodology, Supervision, Writing- Original draft, review and editing; ER- Methodology, Supervision, Writing- Original draft, review and editing; MP- Methodology, Writing- review and editing\n\nPG- Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing- review and editing; BSB- Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing- Original draft, review and editing; VSK- Methodology, Writing- review and editing; SS- Methodology, Writing -review and editing.\n\n**Conceptualization:** Manickam Ponnaiah.\n\n**Funding acquisition:** Manickam Ponnaiah.\n\n**Methodology:** Manickam Ponnaiah, Sendhilkumar Muthappan, Rajalakshmi Elumalai, Prakash Muthuperumal, Ganeshkumar Parasuraman, Bhavani Shankara Bagepally, Saravana V Kumar, Satish Sivaprakasam.\n\n**Project administration:** Manickam Ponnaiah, Ganeshkumar Parasuraman, Bhavani Shankara Bagepally.\n\n**Resources:** Manickam Ponnaiah.\n\n**Supervision:** Manickam Ponnaiah, Sendhilkumar Muthappan, Rajalakshmi Elumalai, Ganeshkumar Parasuraman, Bhavani Shankara Bagepally.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Manickam Ponnaiah, Sendhilkumar Muthappan, Rajalakshmi Elumalai, Prakash Muthuperumal, Bhavani Shankara Bagepally.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Manickam Ponnaiah, Sendhilkumar Muthappan, Rajalakshmi Elumalai, Prakash Muthuperumal, Ganeshkumar Parasuraman, Bhavani Shankara Bagepally, Saravana V Kumar, Satish Sivaprakasam.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:17:36", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:17:52", "cost": 16.854}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:17:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:17:35"}

In developed countries, approximately 5% to 10% of elderly people over the age of 65 suffer from dementia, while the incidence of VaD doubles every 5.3 years.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> The prevalence of dementia in China is slightly lower than that in the richer countries. There are about 5% of dementia patients in the elderly over 65 years old, of which the prevalence of VaD is 1.50%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> The incidence of VaD increases dramatically with age. The incidence of VaD is as high as 15% among the elderly aged 80 and above, while the rate is about 1.5% in 70-year-old.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Cognitive damage caused by VaD may involve multiple cognitive domains such as attention/executive function, memory, emotion, audio-visual, language, etc. It may also be accompanied by mental, behavioral, and personality abnormalities, which seriously disturb the daily living ability or socially occupational function. Clinical pathological studies suggest that vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular disease will increase the risk of AD. In clinical dementia patients, the prevalence of vascular form and Alzheimer's type is similar. Vascular lesions and neurodegenerative pathological processes may have an additive effect on cognitive impairment and increase the risk of clinical dementia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u></a></sup> VaD has caused critical social and economic implications in terms of direct medical, social care costs, and the costs of informal care.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup>\n\nCurrently, there is no effective treatment for VaD.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> The standard treatment plan mainly focuses on preventive intervention and symptom management. Preventive interventions include improving lifestyle, controlling vascular risk factors, and treating primary diseases. Symptom management medicine mainly include Cholinesterase inhibitor and NMDA receptor antagonists. Besides, some other medicines can be employed to prevent further brain damage, such as Butylphthalide, Cerebrolysin, deproteinized calf blood extract, and Nimodipine.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,3,11]</u></a></sup> Even though the drugs can slightly improve the cognitive function of VaD patients, these effects have not brought a significant improvement in daily life ability.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Also, the safety and long-term efficacy of these VAD treatment interventions have not been fully validated.\n\nChinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been widely used as the treatment of dementia for more than 2000years in China. Several meta-analyses<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13–15]</u></a></sup> suggested that CHM may be effective treatment option for VaD and is generally safer. However, most of the data included in the previous studies was only derived from the Chinese medical database, and the methodological quality of some studies was low. There is non-sufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of CHM for VaD. This systematic review intends to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM in the treatment of VaD by employing objective result measurements and indices on the inclusion of newly released Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\n### 2.1 Study registration\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis is aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses _(P_RISMA) statement.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> This systematic review protocol is registered in the INPLASY International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols, registration number: INPLASY202210098删除4：<u> Available from: https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2022-1-0098/.</u>\n\n### 2.2 Searching strategy\n\n#### 2.2.1 Data sources\n\nThe 2 researchers will independently collect data through computer retrieval. All RCTs of CHM for the treatment of VaD will be included from 6 English databases _(P_ubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Springer, CENTRAL and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) and 4 Chinese databases (Wan fang Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Database <VIP>, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database <CNKI> and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database <CBM>). Trials will be collected from the establishment of the database to July 1, 2020.\n\n#### 2.2.2 Searching strategy\n\nThe search strategy will be created based on the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> The 2 researchers will strictly follow the tactics for data collection. The search strategy for PubMed is given as an example . Other electronic databases will also be searched according to similar search strategies. Meanwhile, some related documents will also be supplemented by manual searches.\n\nTable 1 - The search strategy for PubMed.\n\n| No. | Search terms |\n| --- | --- |\n| #1 | vascular dementia \\[MeSH Terms\\] |\n| #2 | multi-infarct dementia \\[MeSH Terms\\] |\n| #3 | small-vessel dementia \\[MeSH Terms\\] |\n| #4 | strategic infarct dementia \\[MeSH Terms\\] |\n| #5 | hypoperfusion dementia \\[MeSH Terms\\] |\n| #6 | hemorrhagic dementia \\[MeSH Terms\\] |\n| #7 | hereditary vascular dementia \\[MeSH Terms\\] |\n| #8 | post-stroke dementia \\[MeSH Terms\\] |\n| #9 | VaD \\[MeSH Terms\\] |\n| #10 | or#1-#9 |\n| #11 | Chinese herbal medicine \\[title/abstract\\] |\n| #12 | traditional Chinese herbal \\[title/abstract\\] |\n| #13 | traditional Chinese herbal medicine \\[title/abstract\\] |\n| #14 | Alternative medicine \\[title/abstract\\] |\n| #15 | or#11-#14 |\n| #16 | RCT \\[Title/Abstract\\] |\n| #17 | Random \\[Title/Abstract\\] |\n| #18 | Controlled trial \\[Title/Abstract\\] |\n| #19 | or#16-#19 |\n| #20 | #10 and #15 and #19 |\n\nThis search strategy will be modified as required for other electronic databases.\n\n### 2.3 Inclusion criteria for study selection\n\n#### 2.3.1 Types of studies\n\nThe type of RCT that utilize CHM or combine CHM with conventional western medicine treatment will be eligible. Non-randomized controlled studies, quasirandomized controlled studies, observational studies, retrospective studies, cross-sectional studies, prospective studies numbered by medical records will be excluded. The language will be limited to English and Chinese.\n\n#### 2.3.2 Types of participants\n\nPatients diagnosed with VaD will be included in this study and the following eligibility diagnostic criteria were accepted: American Stroke Association/American Heart Association (ASA/AHA) 2011 standard,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 2013 standard,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> vascular behavioral and cognitive disorders (Vas-Cog) 2014 standard,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> and vascular injury recognition jointly developed by global experts Guidelines from the vascular impairment of cognition classification consensus study (VICCCS) 2018 standard,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Chinese vascular cognitive impairment 2019 standard.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> All patients who meet the diagnostic criteria will be included in this study, regardless of gender, age, race, nationality, education, and economic status. Patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, dementia but no cerebrovascular disease, evidence of other neuropathy causing dementia, drug abuse, alcoholism, drug dependence, and other clinical trials are excluded from this study.\n\n#### 2.3.3 Types of interventions\n\nStudies reporting all sorts of CHM in the intervention group can be included, regardless of whether the Chinese medicine is a single herb, a multi-herbs prescription, or Chinese herbal extracts. The control group can be Western medicine or placebo. This study does not involve the dosage form, administration method, and treatment course of the intervention. Other traditional Chinese medicine intervention methods (e.g. acupuncture, moxibustion, massage) will be excluded.\n\n### 2.4 Outcome measures evaluation\n\nThe outcome measures of this review evaluated efficacy through cognitive function, daily and social life abilities, and mental symptoms. Assess safety through safety indicators.\n\n#### 2.4.1 Primary outcome measures\n\nThe primary outcome indicators will be selected: Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS), Alzheimer disease assessment scale-cog (ADAS-cog), Vascular dementia assessment scale-cog (VaDAS- cog), Alzheimer disease cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Functional activities questionnaire (FAQ), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale of Lawton (LADL), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).\n\n#### 2.4.2 Secondary outcome measures\n\nThe secondary outcome measures will be chosen: clinical dmentia rating Scale(CDR), Wechsler Memory Scale 4th Edition(WMS-IV), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised (HVLT), Boston Naming Test-Second Edition (BNT-2), Trail Making Test-Part A (TMT-A), Trail Making Test-Part B (TMT-B), Clock drawing test (CDT), Progressive Deterioration scale _(P_DS), (disability assessment for dementia \\[DAD\\], Alzheimer's disease cooperative study-Activities of Daily Living- severe \\[ADCS-ADL-severe\\], Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale \\[CESD\\]).\n\n#### 2.4.3 Security Index.\n\n*   1\\. Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS).\n*   2\\. General physical examination (temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure).\n*   3\\. Routine examination of blood, urine and stool.\n*   4\\. Electrocardiogram.\n*   5\\. Liver and kidney function examination.\n\n### 2.5 Data collection and analysis\n\n#### 2.5.1 Selection of studies\n\nThe 2 reviewers will individually obtain data according to the search strategy and evaluate the qualification of the data. Endnote X8 and NoteExpress will be applied for data management of acquired documents. Through this process, duplicate data will be filtered out. The reasons for literature exclusion need to be recorded separately in a table. If 2 investigators have any disagreement during the study screening process, a third researcher will be required to assess and make a final decision. A schematic diagram of this process will be shown in Figure 1.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nThe PRISMA flow chart of the selection process. PRISMA = Systematic. Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol.</u>\n\n#### 2.5.2 Data extraction and management\n\nThe basic process, including the literature, will be conducted regarding the Cochrane Collaborative System Evaluation Procedure Manual 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Two researchers will separately extract the literature data. The 2 researchers will separately create a characteristic table of the data for follow-up work. The table will contain the following objects: title of the included literature, abstract, keywords, year of publication, country/region, characteristics of participants, intervention methods, outcome indicators.\n\n#### 2.5.3 Assessment of risk of bias\n\nThe Cochrane bias risk assessment tool (RevMan5.3<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup>) will be employed to evaluate the literature's quality by the risk of bias. The judgment of the risk of bias includes 7 domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias. According to the scores of bias assessment, every literature will be divided into high-grade, low-grade, and not clear. The two researchers will independently conduct the risk evaluation of bias, and the third reviewer will give a final decision if the researchers have any disagreement.\n\n#### 2.5.4 Statistical analysis methods and data synthesis\n\nThe process of statistical analysis and data synthesis will be conducted by Review Manager 5.3 software provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. Dichotomous data will be analyzed by using the risk ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). In comparison, continuous data will be analyzed by using the mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference with 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed by the Chi-Squared test and I<sup>2</sup> index. If the outcome of heterogeneity analysis shows that _P__\\>_ .10, _I_<sup>2</sup> < 50%, which means no statistical heterogeneity among trials, a fixed-effect model will be utilized. If there is statistical heterogeneity among studies _(P_ ≤ .10, I<sup>2</sup> ≥ 50%), the heterogeneity sources will be analyzed by meta-regression or sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis might be undertaken. If statistical heterogeneity exists among comprised studies, the subgroup analysis will be performed to detect the source of statistical heterogeneity. The sensitivity analysis for this research will be based on heterogeneity. When heterogeneity occurs, sensitivity analysis will be operated by changing the effect model and statistical methods. Certain low-quality studies or unblinded trials may be excluded, for instance. Publication bias would be evaluated only if the subgroup included more than ten studies. Asymmetric funnel arising from publication bias will be identified and corrected by the trim and fill method if necessary.\n\n### 2.6 Ethics and dissemination\n\nSince this article is a protocol that does not involve patients and personal information collection, ethical approval is therefore not required for this study. This systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at conferences, and will be shared on social media platforms. The review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal or conference presentation.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nVaD is a common disorder among the elderly, which brings an enormous negative impact on daily life ability and life expectancy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> CHM has been employed to treat dementia for thousands of years. CHM may improve cognitive function and improve patients’ daily and social life abilities. The results of pre- clinical and clinical studies indicate that CHM can improve cognitive impairment through a variety of mechanisms.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22–25]</u></a></sup> Meta-analysis<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13–15,26]</u></a></sup> also shows that Chinese medicine can improve patients’ MMSE, HDS, and ADL scores, and has safety. However, there is not enough evidence for CHM to be recommended as a routine treatment of VaD so far. It is still necessary to systematically analyze the effectuality and safety of CHM using. This study aims to analyze the RCTs of CHM treatment of VaD, including the latest literature, to prove the evidence of CHM's efficacy and safety. The conclusion of this meta-analysis is anticipated to assist clinicians regarding the treatments of VaD and benefits corresponding patients. These clues and conclusions are excepted to encourage researchers to conduct further research on the subject.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Aihua Tan, Simiao Ran, Ziyu Song.\n\n**Data curation:** Aihua Tan, Simiao Ran and Han Yan.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Zheng Zhang, Ziyu Song, Yan Hu.\n\n**Project administration:** Aihua Tan.\n\n**Supervision:** Simiao Ran.\n\n**Writing - original draft:** Aihua Tan.\n\n**Writing - review & editing:** Aihua Tan, Simiao Ran.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:19:07", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:19:47", "cost": 39.509}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:19:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:19:07"}

The main symptoms present as discomfort, foreign body sensation, burning and pain, usually accompanied by visual disturbances and blurred vision.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Prevalence in United States ranges from 5% to 34% in patients over 50 years old.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Among the most prevalent risk factors there are: age above 70 years old, female sex, Asian ethnicity, use of electronic devices, ophthalmologic procedures such as LASIK or cataract surgery, thyroid disease, depression, use of contact lenses, antihistamines and oral contraceptives.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup>\n\nAlteration in tears, are caused by both internal and external factors, which are responsible of triggering an inflammatory response, causing damage to the ocular surface epithelium and stimulation of the nerve branches that innervate the cornea.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup>\n\nDED is characterized by a progressive evaporation and chronic hyperosmolarity, which induces direct damage to the ocular surface and triggers an inflammatory response including IL-1, IL-17, NFK-B and MAPK-B. The ocular surface damage that results from DED is characterized by the destruction of goblet and epithelial cells, causing a punctuate epitheliopathy, instability of the tear film and a hyperosmolarity state.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup>\n\nOcular Surface Disease Index Score comprise 12 questions and it's objective is to help clinicians to make DED diagnosis simpler, faster, and reliable.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7–9]</u></a></sup> The tear film break-up time (TBUT) measurement is the ascending trace of the last blink until the breaking of the tear film of the formulation of a dry spot after two minutes of fluorescein placement.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> The osmolarity of the tear film indicates the balance between inputs and outputs of the tear. In order to make the diagnosis of DED is an osmolarity ≥ 308 mOsm/L in one or both eyes or, a difference between both eyes ≥ 8 mOsm/L.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,10]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 1.2 Description of the intervention\n\nTreatment its complex due to it's multifactorial etiology. The final objective is to restore homeostasis and diminish ocular surface damage. Due to advances in our understanding of etiology, pathophysiology and risk factors of DED, different management algorithms have been created in order to recommend a sequence of treatments according to the stage of the disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> According to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists, the use of artificial tears is the first line of treatment and autologous serum is suggested as part of the third line treatment for moderate-severe disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 1.3 How the intervention might work\n\nAutologous serum was described in 1975, it was first used as treatment of ocular alkali burns.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> The composition of autologous serum includes neuropeptides, vitamins, proteins, TGF-B, IGF-1, nerve growth factor, fibronectin, and other growth factors, which are similar to lacrimal components and contribute to a beneficial outcome on the corneal epithelium. In contrast with preservative artificial tears, autologous serum does not produce toxicity and has proven to be a successful treatment for both DED and neuropathic corneal pain.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12,14,15]</u></a></sup>\n\nLee et al, conducted a study where the long-term efficacy and safety of the use of autologous serum eye drops was evaluated. The results were as follows: of 23 patients, 73.9% showed a decrease in corneal staining with fluorescein, 69.6% decreased the use of lubricating eye drops, and 76.1% of the patients reported subjective improvement in dry eye sensation and photophobia. No complications were reported.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> A prospective, randomized, case-control study conducted by Kojima et al, 20 patients were evaluated and divided into two groups. Group 1 was assigned artificial tears without preservatives and group 2 to autologous serum eye drops. It was concluded that patients in group 2 obtained improvement in symptoms, TBUT, fluorescein test and rose bengal staining with the use of autologous serum for 2 weeks.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\nHowever, conclusive evidence on the safety and effectiveness of autologous serum is still undetermined due to a lack of controlled studies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 1.4 Why is it important to do this review?\n\nDED is a high prevalent worldwide ophthalmologic disease (5–50%).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> Meibomian gland dysfunction contribute to 60% of all cases of DED and 20% are due to aqueous deficiency.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> It's associated to multifactorial risk factors that causes a variety of signs and symptoms that cause a great negative impact in patient's quality of life.\n\nThere are various treatments for DED, however, in some cases when it is severe, or is related to other more complex diseases like metabolic diseases (thyroid disease and Diabetes Mellitus), cardiovascular diseases (ischemic heart disease, arrythmias, stroke and pulmonary circulation disorders), immunologic diseases (allergies, rosacea, Sjögren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus), conventional treatments are not enough.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18,20]</u></a></sup> First line treatment includes artificial tears; however, they lack of biologically active components that are needed for the homeostasis and maintenance of the tear film.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> Therefore, new proposals such as autologous serum have emerged to improve the symptoms and quality of life of patients with DED.\n\nIt's important to assess the current evidence to compare the use of autologous serum with artificial tears in DED, to settle the best effective and safety option.\n\n2 Objectives\n------------\n\nTo compare the effectiveness and safety of autologous serum versus artificial tears for dry eye disease\n\n**P →** Patients with dry eye diagnosis using Ocular Surface Disease Index test (OSDI), Schirmer test, osmolarity, TBUT, and fluorescein staining score.\n\n**I →** Autologous serum.\n\n**C →** Artificial tears.\n\n**O →** Ocular Surface Disease Index.\n\n3 Research question\n-------------------\n\nWhat is the effect on the Ocular Surface Disease Index of dry eye patients treated with autologous serum compared to the use of artificial tears?\n\n4 Methods\n---------\n\n### 4.1 Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n#### 4.1.1 Types of studies\n\nIn this systematic review, we will include randomized controlled trials. There will not be any exclusion on the basis of language or publication status.\n\n#### 4.1.2 Type of participants\n\nWe will comprise trials where the study population include people with 18 years old or older with dry eye disease diagnosis.\n\n#### 4.1.3 Types of interventions\n\nWe will include studies that compare use of autologous serum versus artificial tears for the treatment of dry eye disease.\n\n### 4.2 Types of outcome measures\n\n#### 4.2.1 Primary outcomes\n\nAsses the efficacy of the use of autologous serum for the treatment of dry eye disease using The Ocular Surface Disease Index.\n\n#### 4.2.2 Secondary outcomes\n\n*   Compare the osmolarity before and after application of autologous serum with the use of artificial tears.\n*   Compare the effect of autologous serum with Schirmer test.\n*   Compare the tear film breakdown time before and after application of autologous serum with the use of artificial tears.\n*   Compare the effect of autologous serum with fluorescein staining score.\n*   Compare the effect autologous serum with Vision-Related Quality of Life in patients with dry eye disease.\n\n#### 4.2.3 Adverse outcomes\n\nWe will compare adverse outcomes between both treatment groups. We will contemplate adverse outcomes as reported in studies. Specific adverse outcomes of interest will cover the following:\n\n*   Infection: conjunctivitis, blepharitis.\n*   Eye discharge.\n*   Eye pain, irritation or pruritus.\n*   Foreign body sensation.\n*   Allergic conjunctivitis.\n\n### 4.3 Search methods for identification of studies\n\n#### 4.3.1 Electronic searches\n\nWe will search in the following databases for randomized controlled trials 删除6：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(appendix 1, https://links.lww.com/MD-CASES/A19)</u></u>. We will not exclude any study by it's language or year of publication.\n\n*   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the CEV Trials Register) in the Cochrane Library (latest issue).\n*   PubMed (1948-present).\n*   Scopus (2004-present).\n*   Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (1982- present).\n*   US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov .\n*   World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform .\n\n#### 4.3.2 Searching in other resources\n\nTo spot additional relevant trials that may have not been identified during the electronic searches, we will search the reference list of eligible studies identified from the electronic searches.\n\n### 4.4 Data collection and analysis\n\n#### 4.4.1 Selection of studies\n\nPairs of review authors will assess the titles and abstracts of previously identified articles through the literature search against inclusion criteria and will independently classify these as either “definitely relevant“, “possibly relevant“ or “definitely not relevant“. We will use Covidence software to manage the screening process. If authors experience a disagreement, it will be resolved by a third review author. We will acquire the full-text copies of all the studies we classify as “definitely relevant“ or “possibly relevant“. Each review author will independently judge each study for inclusion and will designate it as “include“ or “exclude“. In case we need clarification about a study, we will approach the authors of the primary studies via email. If we don’t get a response in three weeks, we will assess the study based on the available data. We will document the motive of exclusion of each study excluded. To assess studies written in different languages than English or Spanish, we will utilize Google Translate. We will use a PRISMA diagram to illustrate the study selection progress.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup>\n\n#### 4.4.2 Data extraction & management\n\nBoth review authors will independently obtain data from the includes studies using a data extraction form 删除6：<u>通用删除1(英):<u>(Appendix 2, https://links.lww.com/MD-CASES/A20)</u></u> adapted from The Cochrane Eyes and Vision Data Extraction Form,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> developed by CEV and accessed via Covidence. If there's any disagreement, a third author will resolve it.\n\nTo obtain any missing information or to clarify data, we will contact authors of the primary studies via email. We will wait for a reply for 3 weeks, if we get no response, we will use the available data as provided in published reports. One review author will enter data into Review Manager 5<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> and a second review author will validate the data entered.\n\n#### 4.4.3 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\nPairs of review authors will evaluate the risk of selection (random sequence generation and allocation concealment before randomization), performance (masking of study participants and personnel), detection (masking of authors assessors), attrition (absent data and missing of an intention-to-treat analysis), reporting (selective outcome reporting) and other possible sources of bias using Cochrane “Risk of bias 2“ assessment tool.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u></a></sup>\n\nFor ranking the risk of bias, we will use “low “, “high“ or “unclear “. We will contact authors of the primary studies when the methods are ambiguous or when further information about a study design or methods is needed to risk of bias and we will wait 3 weeks for a response, if we don’t get any, we will assess the risk of bias on the basis of descriptions provided in published reports.\n\n#### 4.4.4 Measures of treatment effect\n\nWe will calculate mean difference with 95% confidence intervals for continuous measures (e.g. Schirmer test, OSDI score, TBUT) and risk ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes (e.g. adverse events, effective rate) to evaluate treatment effects.\n\nWe will choose a cut-off for ordinal outcomes and measurement scales to handle them as a binary data or manage them as continuous data, as suitable.\n\n#### 4.4.5 Unit of analysis issues\n\nThe participant will be the primary unit of analysis whenever:\n\n*   a. Only one eye per participant is enrolled in the trial.\n*   b. Two eyes of a person are treated as a single unit after being administered the same treatment (autologous serum).\n\nFor studies that enrolled both eyes an in which the eye was the unit of analysis, we will document whether the trial had a within-person (i.e. paired eye) design and inspect the data appropriately.\n\n#### 4.4.6 Dealing with missing data\n\nWe will contact study authors to acquire missing data or unclear data in the study reports. We will permit three weeks for study authors to respond, and we will utilize the available information whenever we got no answer. We will not impute missing participant information for analysis.\n\n#### 4.4.7 Assessment of heterogeneity\n\nWe will differentiate the participant characteristics, study interventions and outcomes across trials to appraise for clinical and methodological heterogeneity. We will use forest plots and Chi<sup>2</sup> to assess the statistical heterogeneity among estimates of effect size from the comprised studies. We will utilize the _I_<sup>2</sup> statistic, which will reckon the proportion of variation in observed effects not due to chance, to recognize inconsistency among trials; an _I_<sup>2</sup> statistic value greater than 50% to 90%, will indicate substantial heterogeneity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u></a></sup>\n\n#### 4.4.8 Assessment of reporting biases\n\nIf we conduct a meta-analysis with 10 or more studies, we will visually inspect funnel plots of the intervention results estimates for evidence of asymmetry. A symmetric funnel plot may indicate small study effects, which could be the result of reporting bias, heterogeneity, or dissimilarities in the methodological quality of studies. We will assess selective outcome reporting as part of the “Risk of bias “ assessment among individual studies.\n\n#### 4.4.9 Data synthesis\n\nWe will combine the effect estimates from individual studies using the fixed-effects model if no substantial heterogeneity (_I_<sup>2</sup> < 50%), clinical or methodological, is encountered; or a random effect model if we observe substantial heterogeneity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u></a></sup> If we consider a meta-analysis as inappropriate, we will report the reasons and register findings from the individual studies narratively.\n\n#### 4.4.10 Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\nIf sufficient data are available from included studies, we will examine findings by the degree of dry eye severity determined by Ocular Surface Disease Index Score.\n\n#### 4.4.11 Sensitivity analysis\n\nIf possible, we will execute sensitivity analyses for primary and secondary outcomes to investigate the effects of restricting our analyses to trials judged to have adequate allocation concealment, appropriate masking of outcome assessors and at least have an 80% follow up participants in each group.\n\n#### 4.4.12 Summary of findings\n\nWhen enough information is available, we will summarize the findings of the review using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to assess the strengths and restrictions of evidence for both primary and secondary outcomes. We will utilize Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation pro Guideline Development Tool Software.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u></a></sup>\n\n5 Discussion\n------------\n\nDED is a multifactorial global problem with a prevalence that ranges from 5%-50%<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> and 5%-34% in patients over 50 years old.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> It causes a negative impact on patient's life, causing a wide spectrum of symptoms that involve eye discomfort, pain, blurry vision and foreign body sensation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup>\n\nAt the moment, there's no registered protocols comparing autologous serum and serum eye drops for DED.\n\nSystematic reviews have been published evaluating autologous serum for the treatment of ocular surface diseases, however, there has been inconsistency in the possible benefits due to a lack of randomized controlled trials.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21,29–31]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe objective of this systematic review is to evaluate current evidence of the treatment of DED using autologous serum and determine it's the efficacy and safety.

The patient was found to have incidental eosinophilia in March 2019 in India and had received anthelminthic treatment and some herbal treatment with little improvement in the counts. Later patient had multiple visits to the Emergency Department with complaints of cough and shortness of breath. The patient was eventually diagnosed with eosinophilia and he was admitted in our hospital Emergency Department in December 2019 where labs showed rising levels of eosinophils. But the patient refused further workup including bone marrow. On later follow up in March 2020, the patient agreed for workup, given that he gave history of fatigue and generalized weakness, with unintentional weight loss around 4 to 5 kilograms during the past year, but no other complaints. complete blood count (CBC) showed WBC of 24.0 x10^3/μl normal value (4.0–10.0 x10<sup>3</sup>/μL), Hb: 14.0 gm/dL normal value (13.0–17.0 gm/dL), PLT: 81 x10<sup>3</sup>/μL normal value (150–400 x10<sup>3</sup>/μL), absolute neutrophil count: 7.7 x10<sup>3</sup>/μL normal values (2.0–7.0 x10<sup>3</sup>/μL), Eosinophil count:12.7 x10^3/μl normal values (0.0–0.5 x10<sup>3</sup>/μL).

CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed few sub centimeter mediastinal lymph nodes with bilateral axillary, inguinal and para-aortic small to borderline size lymph nodes, Spondylo-degenerative changes, osteopenia, degenerative disc lesions notably at the level of L4–5 and L5-S1 in addition to relatively mild suspected thickening at the pyloric antrum and proximal duodenum on endoscopic evaluation.\n\nBone marrow  was hypercellular with trilineage hematopoiesis, granulocytic hyperplasia, adequate megakaryopoiesis, relatively decreased erythropoiesis, markedly increased eosinophils and their precursors with dysplastic features and prominent mast cells, some showing dysplasia and hypogranulation. There was no increase in blasts. CD117 immunostain performed on bone marrow biopsy highlighted increased mast cells, scattered and in small loose aggregates which included some spindle-shaped forms. These mast cells were positive for mast cell tryptase and aberrantly positive for CD 25.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nBone marrow aspirate smears showing increased eosinophils and their precursors with dysplastic features (vacuolation, abnormal granule distribution, small granules, hypolobation and large size eosinophils (Wright's stain 100x).</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nHypercellular bone marrow trephine biopsy showing abundant eosinophils and eosinophil precursors (H/E stain, 40x).</u>\n\nFlow cytometry showed no immunophenotypic evidence of monotypic B-Cell Population.

The patient has been on regular follow up for 6 months since the initiation of the treatment with controlled counts and no new complaints.\n\nThe study was reviewed and approved by Medical research Center at Hamad Medical Corporation. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to allow the publication of case details and accompanying images.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nEosinophils are bone marrow originated cells of the granulocyte lineage. Their approximate half-life is of 8 to 18 hours in the bloodstream, and they usually settle in tissues where they can last for weeks.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Eosinophilia is identified as a rise in the counts of eosinophils in blood with an absolute eosinophil count of more than 500 eosinophils x10<sup>3</sup>/μL of venous blood.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u></a></sup> Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is defined as having counts of (=>1,500 eosinophils x10<sup>3</sup>/ μL) persisting for more than 6 months. However, on 2011, the Working Conference on Eosinophil Disorders and Syndromes proposed that at least 2 occasions of eosinophilia with a minimum interval of 4 weeks apart can also be considered persistent, given no identifiable etiology for eosinophilia, and patients must have signs and symptoms of organ involvement. Adding to that, other causes of eosinophilia, such as acquired or familial eosinophilia should be considered.\n\nEosinophilia is a major clue in multiple neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases, usually manifested in patients with multiple inflammatory, allergic conditions, and hematologic malignancies with Eosinophilia being persistent process, transient or episodic process depending on the ongoing condition.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> In myeloid neoplasms clonal eosinophils are originating from a malignant clone, while in other disorders, hyper-eosinophilia is labeled a non-neoplastic process triggered by eosinophil-poietic cytokines or by other so far unknown processes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Most of the eosinophilia cases are reactive or secondary, with infections being the most common cause in developing countries particularly tissue invasive parasites<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u></a></sup> while in western countries, the main causes of secondary eosinophilia are allergic or vasculitis diseases, medications, and non-myeloid malignancies, although parasite infections is also considered.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Around 20% of patients presenting with HES have features suggestive of a myeloproliferative neoplasm, and around 80% of those have a _PDGFRA_\\-associated neoplasm.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> In 2008, the classification of eosinophilia was reviewed by the WHO in regard to myeloid neoplasms, establishing a new category; myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of (_PDGFRA), (PDGFRB)_ or _(FGFR1_).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> If Eosinophilia was found and it was associated with non-specific clonal or molecular abnormalities and/or increased bone marrow blasts (5% - 20%), it's currently labeled as chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL-NOS), which should be differentiated from myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and rearrangement of _PDGFRA_, _PDGFRB_, or _FGFR1_ or with a _PCM1-JAK2_ fusion. If cases that do not show any evidence for clonal proliferation, then a diagnosis of idiopathic HES can be given, mainly as a diagnosis of exclusion.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Even though _FIP1L1-PDGFRA_–positive disease commonly presents as a chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), it can be diagnosed in the blastic phase of a myeloproliferative neoplasm, or same in eosinophilia-associated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or T lymphoblastic/leukemia lymphoma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> In a study done in Mayo Clinic on the prevalence and clinico-pathologic correlation, _FIP1L1-PDGFRA_ was discovered by FISH in around 14% of patients with primary eosinophilia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> It is noteworthy, with the exclusion of the rare instances, almost all cases of _FIP1L1-PDGFRA_ associated clonal eosinophilia are detected in male patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe _FIP1L1-PDGFRA_ rearrangement occurs as a result of the cryptic deletion of 800 kb on chromosome 4q12 and holds the _CHIC2_ gene, which is the origin for the FISH test that is used for the diagnoses of _FIP1L1- PDGFRA_ related diseases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> The Fusion of _FIP1L1_ with the _PDGFRA_ protein generates an active tyrosine kinase that drives the proliferation and facilitates the survival of the eosinophils in chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) patients, by activation of several signaling pathways which contains the phosphoinositol3-kinase, ERK 1/2 and STAT5.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15–18]</u></a></sup>_FIP1L1-PDGFRA_ is a clonal marker and it is associated with the myeloproliferative variant of hypereosinophilia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14,18]</u></a></sup> Those patients harboring the fusion gene usually present with hepatosplenomegaly, a hypercellular marrow, and raised mast cells with or without myelofibrosis, with raised serum tryptase levels.\n\nCurrently, the usage of low dose Imatinib (100–400 mg/d) produces a rapid and complete hematological remission with an improvement of peripheral blood and bone marrow eosinophilia back to normal, and the median time for the response is around 4 weeks.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Regarding molecular remission, the patients usually turn RT- PCR negative for _FIP1L1-PDGFRA_ following a median of 3 months period.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u></a></sup>\n\nData indicate that Imatinib can effectively suppress but does not eliminate the _FIP1L1-PDGFRA_ clone in many of the patients, though in some people and especially those with a longstanding complete molecular remission, it might be capable to achieve a cure after Imatinib Cessation. As in the recent guidelines in chronic myelogenous leukemia, the current treatment with Imatinib is recommended for _FIP1L1-PDGFRA_–positive disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21–24]</u></a></sup> Therefore, physicians need to be attentive for the presence _PDGFRA, PDGFRB_ or _FGFR1_ rearrangements in any eosinophilia patients with systemic symptoms, particularly those associated with cardiopulmonary or renal systems.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nPDGFRA-positive myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia is an uncommon disease and signifies the need to do the _PDGFRA_ assay in patients with HES. Proper diagnosis is crucial for the effective management of eosinophilia. It requires a high index of suspicion among physicians and cognizance of this condition which is crucial for swift initiation of therapy. At present, finding _FIP1L1-PDGFRA_ mutation indicates the initiation of low dose Imatinib which denotes a remarkable prognosis, with a primarily complete hematological response and resolution or prevention of organ damage caused by eosinophilic infiltration. However, long-term treatment is required.\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment\n--------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank Qatar National library for funding this article.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Aliaa Amer, Feryal Ibrahim: editing and approval of final manuscript.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hussam Alhasson: literature review.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mohamed A Yassin: Writing and Editing.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mohammad Abu-Tineh, Esra’a Aljaloudi: Writing the manuscript, literature review.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Wanis H.Ibrahim: Clinical Follow up.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:16:15", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:16:23", "cost": 7.348}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:16:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:16:15"}

She had mild pallor without jaundice, lymphadenopathy, wasting, finger clubbing, or cyanosis. She had tachycardia at 102 beats per minute, with normal blood pressure (98/66 mm Hg) and body temperature.\n\nOn palpation, the abdomen was not tender, but had a stretched transverse umbilicus. Fluid thrill and shifting dullness were present, suggesting ascites. No hepatosplenomegaly was observed, and bowel sounds were normal.\n\nThere was a dull percussion note and decreased vesicular sounds in the right lower lung field, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/ min. The rest of the respiratory examination results were normal.\n\nShe had a weak, rapid, but regular pulse. Upon auscultation, the apex beat was not displaced; however, the heart sounds were muffled. No murmurs were heard. She did not have a hyperactive precordium but had engorged neck veins.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2.:\n\nEchocardiography showing pericardial fluid.</u>\n\n### _2.2. Investigations_\n\n#### _2.2.1. Laboratory work-up._\n\nLaboratory workup indicated mild anemia (Hemoglobin: 10.7 g/dL) with normal total and differential leukocyte and platelet counts. Results of liver function tests, renal function tests, and serum electrolyte levels were normal. The total serum protein and albumin levels were normal at 50 and 28 g/dL, respectively. Notably, her CA-125 level was elevated at 109 U/mL, but her CEA and CA 19-9 were normal. Her C-reactive protein level was normal. Her plasma lactate dehydrogenase level was mildly elevated at 283 U/L (reference range, 109-245). She tested negative for HIV, HBsAg, HCV Ab, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor and Covid-19.\n\nAscitic fluid tapping was performed, yielding a strawcolored tap with thin, watery consistency. Smear examination revealed a hypocellular smear comprising dispersed lymphocytes. There was no evidence of malignancy or acid-fast bacilli infection. The serum ascites albumin gradient was calculated as 0.4 g/dL.\n\nPericardial fluid analysis revealed a high lactate dehydrogenase levels (2447U/L), slightly elevated ADA at 31.0 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(0-30)</u>, and normal total protein. Cytology revealed paucicellular smears consisting of histiocytes in a haemorrhagic background. Atypical or malignant cells were not observed. Ziehl-Neelsen staining was performed to test for acid-fast bacilli, which was negative. The pericardial fluid culture yielded no bacterial growth.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3.:\n\nComputed tomography scan: Sagittal plane of the lower thorax and abdomen showing pericardial effusion and ascites.</u>\n\nPleural fluid ADA was notably elevated at 46.30U/L (cutoff of 40 IU/L is useful for identifying significantly elevated ADA levels and favoring the diagnosis of TB in serous fluid).\n\nGeneXpert of the pleural fluid was performed at another facility, and the results were positive for TB. It is important to note that this result returned late after anti-TB treatment was initiated.\n\n#### _2.2.2. Electrocardiogram._\n\nNormal sinus rhythm with lowvoltage QRS complexes consistent with pericardial effusion .\n\n#### _2.2.3. Imaging._\n\nEchocardiography: Moderate-severe pericardial effusion with collapsed right atrium in diastole. Her left ventricular ejection fraction was 73%. No regional wall motion abnormalities were observed .\n\nComputed tomography revealed ascites, right pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. \n\n### _2.3. Interventions and outcome_\n\nThe patient underwent several pericardiocentesis procedures and ascitic taps. The initial pericardiocentesis drained 900 mL mildlyhemorrhagic serous fluid, with subsequent drain removal between 300 and 500mL of clear serous fluid. Despite multiple pericardiocentesis procedures, fluid continued to accumulate until the initiation of anti-TB drugs. Based on Kenyan TB guidelines, anti-TB medications were administered following a clinical diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 4.:\n\nComputed tomography scan: Transverse plane showing a right pleural effusion and pericardial effusion.</u>\n\nTo manage her symptoms, she was administered spironolactone 25g OD, prednisolone 20g TID, and paracetamol 1g TID.\n\nThe patient was treated with empiric anti-TB treatment with a 2-month intensive phase of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol followed by a 4-month continuation phase of rifampicin and isoniazid (RH). Pyridoxine was also administered to prevent the adverse effects of isoniazid. Three weeks after the initiation of TB treatment, ascites and pericardial and pleural effusions resolved. Two months after discharge, the patient showed marked improvement, with no residual fluid noted in the serous cavities on ultrasound imaging. Laboratory work-up showed normal results. The patient was followed-up for 1.5 years and there was no recurrence of symptoms or accumulation of fluid in the pericardial, pleural, or abdominal cavity after initiation and completion of anti-TB medication. The patient did not develop any adverse effects to medication given.\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nPS is characterized by inflammation of multiple serous membranes with effusion in the serous cavities.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> PS may be part of a wider syndromic presentation of an underlying disease (TB, systemic lupus erythematosus, familial Mediterranean fever, certain malignancies, asbestosis, silicosis), complications of chest surgery, radiation therapy, and certain drugs. Rarely, it is idiopathic.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>3,7</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Most reports of serositis in the literature describe cases involving one or 2 serous membranes, with the majority being cases of pleural effusion, ascites, or constrictive pericarditis secondary to TB or as sequelae of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, or familial Mediterranean fever.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7-12</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Here, we present a case of polyserositis with the simultaneous involvement of all 3 body cavities.\n\nOur patient, who initially presented with symptomatic pleural effusion 2 years prior that had resolved without any definitive treatment, presented once again, but this time with fluid accumulation in the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities. The 3 serosae were extensively involved, with no clear-cut underlying pathology. All investigations for a connective tissue disorder proved negative, as did Ziehl Neelsen staining for Mycobacterium. Based on Kenyan TB guidelines, anti-TB medications were administered following a clinical diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB.\n\nThe diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis is frequently based on histopathological investigations, but histological findings are often non-specific.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The gold standard for confirming the presence of Mycobacteria tuberculosis is gene Xpert/PCR testing, but this method is often unavailable in many resource-limited settings.

Estimation of ADA levels in serous fluid is an easy and reliable method to confirm the diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>14,15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> ADA levels in serous fluid above 40IU/L are diagnostic for tuberculous serositis, with 87% sensitivity and 89% specificity.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>16,17</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nIn the present case, the patient also had elevated serum CA-125 levels. CA-125 is a useful marker for epithelial ovarian cancer. It is secreted from mesothelial cells lining the pleura, pericardium, peritoneum, and areas of inflammation, including serositis secondary to TB.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>9,18,19</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Benign gynaecological pathologies, including endometriosis, leiomyomas, pelvic infections, and pregnancy, may result in elevated serum CA-125 levels.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>20,21</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Malignant causes of elevated CA-125 levels include acute leukaemia, especially in young children; non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma with serosal involvement; gastric carcinoma; and mesothelioma.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>22-24</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Our case report aligns with those of previous studies that showed an association between elevated serum CA 125 levels and peritoneal tuberculosis.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>9,25,26</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Serous fluid CA-125 levels have been observed to return to normal within a few months after the commencement of specific anti-TB therapy.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>27,28</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nAlthough the initial workup for TB was negative (i.e. microscopy for acid-fast bacilli), the patient’s symptoms, together with her elevated ADA levels and residency in an endemic area for TB (Kenya), started empirical anti-TB treatment. The response to treatment, including the resolution of her polyserous effusions and the late positive gene Xpert for TB, confirmed this diagnosis.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Jeremiah Munguti, Victor Mutua.\n\n**Investigation:** Victor Mutua.\n\n**Writing** - **original draft:** Jeremiah Munguti, Victor Mutua, Isaac Cheruiyot.\n\n**Writing** - **review & editing:** Jeremiah Munguti, Victor Mutua, Isaac Cheruiyot, Chris von Csefalvay, Paul Opare-Addo, Nduku Kiko, Rosemary Wanjiru.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:16:41", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:17:24", "cost": 42.783}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:17:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:16:40"}

Introduction\n----------------\n\nTumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an oncologic emergency that occurs due to diffuse tumor cell destruction with the massive release of intracellular potassium, phosphate, and nucleic acids into the blood circulation, leading to seizures, cardiac conduction abnormalities, acute kidney injury, or even death.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> TLS is a relatively common and preventable complication of hematological malignancies.

In a retrospective study of patients with diagnosed hematologic malignancy and acute kidney injury, the rate of STLS was approximately 1%.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Notably, there is no reported cases of STLS in the chronic or accelerated phase of CML. Herein, we report the first case of STLS during the accelerated phase of CML that was successfully treated with rasburicase.\n\n2\\. Case presentation\n---------------------\n\nA 37-year-old woman of Arabic ethnicity with a medical history of CML presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of nausea and diffuse abdominal pain. She denied a history of fever, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits. She was diagnosed with CML in the chronic phase in 2019. At that time, she was started on 400 mg of imatinib as upfront therapy; however, she failed imatinib and shifted to 100 mg of dasatinib as second-line therapy. In 2021, CML progressed to the accelerated phase, the dose of dasatinib was adjusted to 140 mg daily, and the search for a matching donor was initiated. However, the patient had not been taking dasatinib regularly since the date of prescription for an unknown reason. Upon presentation, her vital signs were as follows: afebrile, pulse rate of 110 beats/min, blood pressure of 100/72 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On physical examination, the abdomen was soft with left upper quadrant tenderness and splenomegaly. The results of cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.\n\nHer laboratory results were significant for white blood cells of 223.0 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL (the baseline was 2.8 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL 1 month before presentation), a hemoglobin level of 4.9 g/dL (the baseline was 9 g/dL 1 month before presentation), creatinine level of 160 µmol/L (the baseline was 70 µmol/L), adjusted calcium of 2.05 mmol/L, phosphorus of 1.89 mmol/L, potassium of 3.7, and uric acid of 704.0 µmol/L . A peripheral blood smear confirmed the presence of CML in the accelerated phase. Abdominal ultrasonography showed hepatosplenomegaly with no evidence of obstructive uropathy, and urine microscopy revealed uric acid crystals. Accordingly, to the Cairo and Bishop criteria for TLS, our patient was clinically diagnosed with TLS. On the day of admission, the patient developed severe tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 40 breaths/min, requiring a high-flow oxygen supplement. Chest radiography revealed a bilateral increase in bronchovascular markings . The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for further treatment.\n\nTable 1 - Relevant laboratory results during the hospital course.\n\n| Parameter | Reference range | Upon admission | After starting TLS management | Before discharge (day 8) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White blood cells | 4–10 × 103/µL | 233.0 | 158.7 | 16.2 |\n| Hemoglobin | 12–15 g/dL | 4.6 | 7.3 | 7 |\n| Platelet | 15–400 × 103/µL | 192 | 220 | 98 |\n| Creatinine | 44–80 µmol/L | 163 | 86 | 66 |\n| Urea | 2.5–8 mmol/L | 7.0 | 6.5 | 6.3 |\n| Potassium | 3.5–5.2 mmol/L | 4.5 | 4.1 | 3.9 |\n| Sodium | 135–145 mmol/L | 135 | 138 | 137 |\n| Adjusted calcium | 2.2–2.6 mmol/L | 2.05 | 2.31 | 2.25 |\n| Uric acid | 140–360 µmol/L | 704.0 | \\- | 508 |\n| C-reactive protein | <5 mg/L | 181.1 | \\- | 18.3 |\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nChest X-ray showing bilateral increase in the bronchovascular markings.</u>\n\nRegarding the management of TLS, our patient was administered intravenous normal saline (200 mL/h) and rasburicase (6 mg, intravenous, single dose). She also received 2 units of packed red blood cells. In addition, hydroxyurea, as cytoreductive therapy, was started at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily. Given the possibility of sepsis, piperacillin-tazobactam was started. Regarding anemia, the patient was found to have high lactate dehydrogenase levels, with a strongly positive direct antiglobulin test for IgG and C3d. Hence, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) was diagnosed, and dexamethasone was initiated. The creatinine level normalized within 48 hours of starting intravenous fluid and rasburicase . The medical intensive care unit course passed smoothly without any significant events. The patient was discharged on day 9 of hospitalization. Dasatinib (100 mg daily) and prednisolone (40 mg for 4 weeks as treatment for AIHA) were prescribed to the patient. All relevant laboratory results during the hospital stay are presented in Table 1. Unfortunately, at the 6-month follow-up, the patient progressed to blast-phase CML and was admitted to the hospital for further management.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2.:\n\nDramatic improvement in serum creatinine after starting therapy.</u>\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nTLS is a metabolic syndrome that can occur either spontaneously or after the initiation of chemotherapy. It is characterized by the presence of biochemical abnormalities, including hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperkalemia, in addition to the related specific organ damage. The Cairo-Bishop diagnostic criteria are widely used to diagnose TLS and include 2 criteria categories. First, laboratory criteria that include uric acid ≥ 476 µmol/mL or a 25% increase from baseline, phosphorus ≥1.45 mmol/L or a 25% increase from baseline, potassium ≥6.0 mmol/L or a 25% increase from baseline, and corrected calcium ≤1.75 mmol/L or a 25% decrease from baseline. Second, clinical criteria include creatinine ≥1.5 times the upper limit of normal, cardiac arrhythmia/sudden death, or seizure. For the diagnosis of laboratory TLS, the presence of 2 or more of the above-mentioned laboratory criteria occurs within 3 days before or 7 days after starting chemotherapy in the setting of adequate hydration and the use of a hypouricemic agent. On the other hand, clinical TLS is defined as laboratory TLS plus one or more of the above-mentioned clinical criteria.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common clinical complication of TLS. AKI in TLS is multifactorial and is linked to both uric acid and calcium phosphate deposition in renal tubules.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nTLS is more commonly encountered in hematological malignancies than in solid tumors. Patients with lymphoproliferative disorders with high proliferation and high sensitivity to chemotherapy, such as B-cell ALL and Burkitt lymphoma, are at the highest risk of developing TLS.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Serum lactate dehydrogenase level, white blood cells, tumor size, and extent of bone marrow involvement, which reflect the tumor burden, are the primary predictors for the development of TLS in hematological malignancies.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Of note, when assessing the risk of TLS in any patient with hematological malignancy, patients, tumors, and therapy-specific factors should be considered.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> STLS has been rarely reported in both hematological and solid malignancies. In hematological malignancies, most STLS cases occur with NHLs, especially Burkitt lymphoma and acute leukemia.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The exact mechanism of STLS is uncertain to date. It is hypothesized that the tumor’s blood supply will be compromised by progressive enlargement of the tumor, leading to subsequent necrosis and lysis of tumor cells. However, this hypothesis fits more with solid tumors than with hematological malignancies.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nPrevention is the primary treatment of TLS. The management of TLS includes the use of hypouricemic medications (mainly rasburicase and allopurinol) and adequate hydration before and after chemotherapy. Patients at low risk of TLS should receive allopurinol with hydration. Patients at high risk should receive rasburicase instead of allopurinol.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase that converts pre-existing uric acid to allantoin, which is soluble and readily removed by the kidneys.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The 6 mg single dose is the most widely used regimen for TLS, and it is as effective as weight-based daily dosing (0.15–0.2 mg/kg/d) in controlling plasma uric acid and is also much cheaper.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> A systematic review of rasburicase for prophylaxis or treatment of TLS in adults concluded that rasburicase is effective and more rapid (acting within 4 hours of administration) than allopurinol in reducing serum uric acid levels in patients with or at risk of TLS. However, the evidence is lacking regarding the improvement of clinical outcomes compared with other hypouricemic alternatives.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Also, in a study of TLS involving pediatric patients, it was found that only 3% of patients who received rasburicase for TLS required dialysis, in comparison with 15% who received allopurinol.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Rasburicase might cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, severe hemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and methemoglobinemia.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Our patient responded dramatically to rasburicase with AKI resolving within 48 hours of administration, and he did not require dialysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of TLS in a CML patient treated with rasburicase.\n\nRegarding the acute drop in hemoglobin levels, our patient was found to have warm AIHA (based on strongly positive direct antiglobulin test for IgG and C3). In a recent review of AIHA in CML, 54 cases were reviewed, and the exact mechanism of hemolysis was not clear.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> We believe that AIHA was just a coincidence with TLS. Our group is addressing the unmet clinical needs and unanswered questions in CML, such as the association of tuberculosis with CML,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> the reactivation of hepatitis B with CML,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> ophthalmic manifestations as initial presentation in patients with CML,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>17</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> bariatric surgeries in patients with CML,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> and the effects of intermittent fasting on CML.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\n4\\. Conclusion\n--------------\n\nAll patients with hematological malignancies should be monitored for TLS even before the initiation of chemotherapy. The clinical manifestations of TLS are nonspecific, and diagnosis is mainly based on laboratory tests. The exact mechanism of spontaneous TLS is unknown, and further research is required to explain this condition. Prompt initiation of rasburicase, in addition to vigorous hydration, is effective in the treatment of AKI associated with TLS.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nConceptualization, data curation, writing – review & editing: Abdulrahman Al-Mashdali, Mohamed Yassin.\n\nWriting – original draft: Abdulrahman Al-Mashdali.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:55:38", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:56:19", "cost": 40.472}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:56:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:55:37"}

Introduction\n----------------\n\nSpinal epidural abscess is a rare but potentially devastating condition with an estimated incidence rate of 0.20–2.0/10,000 per hospital admission with peak incidence at the 5th to 6th decade of life.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> It usually spans only 3 to 4 spinal levels and is usually seen in immunocompromised patients, patients with spinal abnormalities and interventions, or patients with a potential local or systemic source of infection.\n\nThe most common causative agent is _Staphylococcus aureus_, which is present in two-thirds of the reported cases. Cases caused by methicillin-resistant _S aureus_ have risen from 15% to 40% and were observed more in patients with implantable spinal or vascular devices.\n\nDespite its rarity, it is nevertheless an important condition to consider in patients presenting with spinal cord injury as it can result in severe disability with permanent neurological deficits and long-term spinal instability. Spinal infection can lead to sepsis and be potentially life-threatening if it evolves into septic shock.\n\nWe report a case of a 21-year-old Filipino female who presented with high-grade fever, nuchal and back pain, progressive lower extremity weakness and numbness, and bowel and bladder disturbances.\n\n2\\. Case report\n---------------\n\nA previously healthy 21-year-old female has been admitted due to progressive numbness and weakness of the lower extremities accompanied by high-grade fever. History started 3 weeks prior when she experienced severe transient bilateral radicular pain in the chest. Consultation then showed a furuncle on the right elbow. She was prescribed antibiotics and analgesics which provided relief from the pain. One week before admission, she started to experience severe nuchal and upper back pain associated with cervical myospasm. These were later associated with high-grade fever, ascending weakness and numbness, urinary retention, and constipation.\n\nPhysical examination on admission revealed the following pertinent findings: a pustular lesion at the right elbow; febrile (_T_<sub>max</sub>: 38.9<sup>o</sup>C); and cervical and thoracic spine tenderness. Neurological evaluation revealed flaccid paraplegia with a sensory level at T3, hyporeflexia on both lower extremities, bilateral Babinski sign, and absent bulbocavernosus reflex. Cognitive function and cranial nerve examination were unremarkable.\n\nBlood cell count showed leukocytosis (26.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L<sup>−1</sup>) with the predominance of neutrophils. Chest radiograph revealed semi-circumscribed opacity at the right upper paratracheal region which may represent an enlarged lymph node. Contrast-enhanced cervicothoracic MRI scan showed peripherally enhancing fluid collections with perilesional edema in the paraspinal region, extending from C3 to T6, with insinuation into the neural foramina and spinal canal . An impression of an extensive spinal epidural abscess was given. Nasal swabs and blood cultures showed growth of Methicillin-resistant _S aureus._ Western blot for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) was negative.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nAxial and sagittal view of T2 weighted image (T2WI) in the cervical and thoracic area showing a collection of fluid compresses and displaces the thecal sac and spinal cord (yellow arrow).</u>\n\nUpon admission, she was started on high-dose steroids and started on vancomycin, and imipenem. She underwent T1-T3 and T5 laminectomy for the evacuation of the epidural abscess; paravertebral tissue culture also revealed Methicillin-resistant _S aureus_.\n\nAfter laminectomy and an 8-week antibiotic regimen, she reduced the hypesthesia with some movement on both lower extremities.

Discussion\n--------------\n\nSpinal epidural abscess is a rare but life-threatening condition that mostly results from the hematogenous spread of bacteria, usually from a cutaneous or mucosal source.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The most common sources of bacteremia include furuncles/carbuncles, pharyngitis, and dental abscesses that usually spread to the posterior aspect of the spinal canal.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Hematogenous spinal epidural abscesses are primarily located in the posterior aspect of the spinal canal.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Spinal epidural abscess is usually located in the lumbar area (49%) followed by the lumbar (31%) and cervical area (24%).删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Because abscesses are more likely to develop in larger epidural spaces containing infection-prone fat, they are more common in posterior than anterior areas and in thoracolumbar than cervical areas, particularly in patients with other, more common reasons for such symptoms. A spinal epidural abscess usually extends over 3 to 4 vertebrae but there are rare cases in which it affects involves the whole spine called panspinal infection which is the case of our patient.\n\nIt is usually associated with different risk factors and co-morbid illnesses; the most common risk factor was intravenous drug use which occurred in 22% and the most reported co-morbid illnesses are diabetes (27%) and hepatic disease (14%).删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Because of these co-morbid illnesses, the most common causative agent is the normal skin flora, _S aureus_ which is found in two-thirds of the cases reported (63.6%).删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Although the proportion of spinal epidural abscesses caused by Methicillin-resistant _S aureus_ is escalated rapidly during the past decades from 15% to 40% in some institutions with a mean percent of 19.9%.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The risk of methicillin-resistant _S aureus_ infection is particularly high in patients with implantable spinal or vascular devices.\n\nThe most common symptoms presented by patients were back pain (67%), motor weakness (52%), fever (44%), sensory abnormalities (40%), and bladder/bowel incontinence (27%).删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> An established staging system outlines the progression of symptoms and physical findings: stage 1, back pain at the level of the affected spine; stage 2, nerve-root pain radiating from the involved spinal area; stage 3, motor weakness, sensory deficit, and bladder and bowel dysfunction; and stage 4, paralysis.\n\nMost of the studies support the consensus that surgical decompression of the abscess with systemic antibiotics is the treatment of choice. Empirical antibiotics should provide coverage against staphylococci (usually with vancomycin to cover methicillin-resistant _S aureus_) and gram-negative bacilli (potentially with a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftazidime or cefepime, respectively), particularly in the presence of documented or suspected gram-negative bacterial infection of other sites, such as the urinary tract. In some reports, a patient who had only spinal back pain without other neurological sequelae only received medical management.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe timing of surgical decompression of spinal epidural abscess is categorized as early and late. It is categorized as early if performed within or less than 24 hours and late if performed after 24 hours. Early surgery usually provides better outcomes for a patient with spinal epidural abscess while those treated non-surgically continue to exhibit unacceptably high failure (41–42.5%) accompanied by increased morbidity (up to 22% permanent paralysis) and mortality (from 1.5% to 25%).删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Joselito B.

Various drugs targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway have recently been introduced for clinical treatment of advanced NSCLC. Pembrolizumab, a human immune checkpoint antibody that inhibits the PD-1 receptor, is associated with significantly longer progression-free and overall survival, and has been established as the front-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC and programmed death ligand (PD-L1) expression of 50% or higher without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Despite pembrolizumab's clinical benefits, some patients develop associated immune-related adverse events. In the phase II KEYNOTE-024 trial, pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis occurred in 5.8% (9/154) of patients with cancer of all grades and 2.6% (4/154) of patients with cancer of grade 3 or 4.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Meanwhile, radiation pneumonitis usually develops 1 to 3 months after irradiation, and pneumonitis rarely develops after low-dose mild radiation therapy to the lung. However, the role of pembrolizumab in conjunction with low-dose radiotherapy to the lung in the development of severe pneumonitis is not yet understood. We report a rare case in which pneumonitis developed in a lung cancer patient treated with palliative radiation and immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nCase presentation\n-----------------\n\nA 78-year-old man was diagnosed with stage IVB adenocarcinoma of the right upper lung lobe with PD-L1 expression of 75% and cT3N3M1c (metastasis to the brain and left sixth rib). The patient was a current smoker and had a history of diabetes and stroke. His performance status was 1. He received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks as first-line therapy from April 19 to June 22, 2017.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Computed tomography (CT) after four cycles of pembrolizumab revealed a partial response of the primary lung lesion , but also showed increased metastasis to the left sixth rib . However, no pneumonitis was observed on the CT of the previous radiation therapy as shown in Figure 1A, B. After the patient began to experience severe back pain, radiotherapy was administered to the thoracic spine (Th6) and left sixth rib with a total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions as a palliative treatment  from July 14 to 28, 2017. The whole-course V20 and mean lung dose for the total lung were 2.6% and 1.5 Gy, respectively. A few days after completing radiation therapy, the patient developed dyspnea, and underwent a check-up after 7 days. On examination, his oxygen saturation on room air was 85%. Gas analysis of arterial blood indicated hypoxia with pH 7.482, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) of 59.3 mm Hg, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) of 28.6 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (SaO<sub>2</sub>) of 90.8%. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 8710/μL with 79.1% neutrophils and 9.3% lymphocytes, serum lactate dehydrogenase level of 242 IU/L (compared to a normal range of 119–229 IU/L), surfactant protein-D level of 280.2 ng/mL (compared to normal < 110 ng/mL), and KL-6 level of 1155 U/mL (compared to normal < 500 U/mL). In addition, blood culture examination showed no significant present of either bacteria or fungi, Anti-cytomegalovirus antibody and beta-glucan levels were below detection limits. A chest X-ray indicated bilateral reticular opacities with predominant lower distribution . CT revealed extensive reticular shadows in the radiation field and some reticular shadows outside the radiation field . These findings suggested radiation pneumonitis and/or immune-related interstitial lung disease (ILD). Accordingly, treatment with 60 mg prednisolone (1 mg/kg) was initiated. After steroid therapy, both the symptoms and the imaging findings gradually improved . The patient's condition did not worsen while the prednisolone dose was tapered for 3 months, after which prednisolone was stopped. At the end of prednisolone treatment, bilateral reticular opacities had almost disappeared. However, 1 week later, the patient complained of dyspnea and high fever, and chest CT revealed right pleural effusion. Cytopathologic examination of the pleural fluid proved negative and indicated only inflammation. Bacterial pleuritis was suspected, and antibiotic treatment (tazobactam/piperacillin) was initiated, albeit unsuccessfully. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with radiation or immune-related pleuritis induced by pembrolizumab. In addition, there was the possibility that pleuritis was a sequela of pneumonitis. Prednisolone treatment was resumed and found to be effective in alleviating the symptoms and reducing pleural effusion. The patient later complained of painful swelling of joints in both hands. After a detailed examination, he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis despite taking steroid medication. Therefore, we considered administering second-line therapy and tapered the prednisolone dose. Despite administration of pemetrexed as second-line therapy, the primary lesion enlarged and pleural effusion increased. The patient died 13 months after the primary diagnosis. No recurring of pneumonitis was observed during the course. The patient's informed consent for the publication of this report was obtained at the start of treatment.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nChest computed tomography images before and after treatment with 4 cycles of pembrolizumab.

Although the lung radiation dose was negligible, a wide range of ground-glass shadows were observed around the irradiated area, and a diagnosis of pneumonitis associated with both radiation and immune checkpoint inhibitors was made.\n\nThe association between pneumonitis and immune checkpoint inhibitors is well known and the incidence rate is generally 3% to 5%. Onset time varies widely and extends from immediately after administration to the long term.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u></a></sup> However, in most common cases, the onset time is 1 to 6 months after the cessation of radiotherapy to the lung.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Extensive radiation pneumonitis typically develops in cases in which a dose higher than 30 Gy is administered, with high V20. For example, the incidence rate of pneumonitis of grade 2 or higher was found to be 0% when the volume of the lung receiving 20 Gy or higher was less than 22%, as compared to a 42% risk if the volume receiving 20 Gy or higher is greater than 40% in lung cancer patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> In the present case, lung V20 and mean lung dose were 2.6% and 1.5 Gy, respectively . Therefore, we speculate that the pneumonitis was caused not only by radiation therapy but also immune checkpoint inhibitors, since the risk of radiation pneumonitis in this case would normally be very low. The effect of radiation therapy on the lung field when using immune checkpoint inhibitors has not yet been well characterized. A degree of overlap exists between toxicities associated with radiotherapy and those associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Receipt of a radiotherapy dose higher than the median equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions is associated with an increased incidence of immune-related adverse events of any grade.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Furthermore, administration of radiotherapy within 14 days of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors is associated with a non-statistically significant higher rate of immune-related adverse events of any grade.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> The use of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) after palliative radiation therapy is associated with radiation recall pneumonitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Immune checkpoint inhibitors are also associated with radiation recall pneumonitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> However, there has been no report of severe pneumonitis caused by palliative radiation therapy performed after completion of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nLung cancer is known to be associated with bone metastases, and radiation therapy to the thoracic spine is part of the standard clinical treatment course. Typically, a small amount of radiation is delivered to the lung field, as in this case. However, even a small amount of supplemental radiation may be associated with a risk of pneumonitis when immunotherapy is also involved.\n\nThere is a possibility of increased risk of ILD induced by EGFR-TKIs after anti-PD-1 antibody therapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10–12]</u></a></sup> Enhancement of T-cell effector function by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors may increase the risk of osimertinib-induced ILD.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> In this case, ILD developed despite the small amount of radiation administered and after anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. As in the case of EGFR-TKIs, the synergistic effect of radiation therapy and anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors may contribute to the high incidence of ILD when the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors is followed by radiation therapy. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is used for the treatment of locally-advanced lung cancer when radiochemotherapy is performed, with a decreased radiation dose applied over a greater area of the lung.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> For intensity-modulated radiation therapy, we speculate that combination therapy (radiation therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors) might cause more widespread damage, including radiation-induced pneumonitis.\n\nThere are some limitations associated with this case report. We did not establish cause-effect correlation between pneumonitis, following radiation therapy, and immunotherapy due to the lack of cases, hence were unable to generalize our conclusions.\n\nIn conclusion, if a small amount of radiation therapy is associated with a risk of pneumonitis when an immune checkpoint inhibitor is involved, as occurred in this case, it may be necessary to expand the irradiation field.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe would like to thank Editage  for English language editing.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nConception and design: SN and KK; Manuscript writing: SN; final approval: TU, KY, HH, RO, and KK; image evaluation: RO; patient management: SN, TU, KY, HH, RO, KK.

INH is a bactericidal agent, able to enter the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria by diffusion and inhibits mycolic acid synthesis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Although INH is 1 of the most widely used anti-TB agent, this drug can be responsible for drug-induced hepatotoxicity due to the accumulation of its metabolic intermediates.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3–5]</u></a></sup> In fact, INH is subjected to hepatic metabolism where it is converted to acetylisoniazid _via_ phase II enzyme N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), and subsequently to acetylhydrazine through hydrolysis. The latter can be further oxidized by cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) to form hydroxylamines, which are intermediates in the formation of hepatotoxic metabolites.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> In this context, pharmacogenetics can provide important insights into the employment of INH as anti-TB agent by elucidating the role of genetic variants to the high variability in patients’ response during anti-TB therapy. _NAT2_ gene is located on chromosome 8, at p22 and is extremely polymorphic. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region can alter its enzymatic activity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> In fact, 3 main genetically phenotypes have been observed: rapid, intermediate and slow acetylators, which are inherited as co-dominant traits.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u></a></sup> Many studies have demonstrated that slow acetylators (SA) have higher plasma drug concentrations than rapid acetylators (RA), and have a higher risk of developing hepatic toxicity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u></a></sup> Nevertheless, rapid acetylation has also been classified as risk factor for anti-TB drug-induced hepatitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup>\n\nTo date, 27 drug-response haplotypes have been identified in the _NAT2_ gene, with a general agreement that NAT2∗4 should be considered as wild type. The proportion of slow and rapid metabolizers is known to differ between different ethnic populations. The slow metabolizer phenotype is most prevalent (>80%) in Northern Africans and Scandinavians, and lowest (5%) in Canadian Eskimos and Japanese. Intermediate frequencies are found in Chinese populations (around 20% slow metabolizers), whereas 40–60% of African-Americans and most non-Scandinavian Caucasians are slow metabolizers.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> In Caucasians, the predominant alleles code for the slow NAT2∗5B (40.9%) and NAT2∗6A (28.4%) and the rapid NAT2∗4 (23.4%) metabolizing enzymes. In the Italian population, some common allelic mutations of NAT2 including NAT2∗5, NAT2∗6, and NAT2∗7 have been already identified, showing a frequency of 51.8% in patients carrying NAT2∗5A, NAT2∗6A, and NAT2∗7A haplotypes, whereas slow acetylators carrying NAT2∗5, NAT2∗6, and NAT2∗7 haplotypes have a frequency of 58.9%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15]</u></a></sup>\n\nHere, we report a case of a pediatric patient affected by nodal tuberculosis and treated with INH, who developed hepatotoxicity during therapy. Analysis of INH plasma concentrations by LC-MS/MS confirmed the presence of drug toxic levels, and _NAT2_ gene sequencing analysis revealed the NAT2∗5C/∗6B slow metabolizer haplotype.\n\nCase presentation\n-----------------\n\nThe patient, a 14-year-old girl with no history for liver and kidney disease, was hospitalized for nodal tuberculosis at the Infectious Diseases Unit. She exhibited painful and mobile laterocervical and angle-mandibular lymphadenopathy (maximum diameter 2–3 cm). Quantiferon and Mantoux skin test were positive and treatment with Isoniazid, Rifampicin and Pyrazinamide was started. Mycobacterium tuberculosis test was negative on 3 sputum samples and urine specimens (PCR and culture tests). After 7 days of treatment, she exhibited vomiting (grade 3 according to WHO Toxicity Grades), nausea and hypertransaminasemia (GPT 184 IU/ml, GOT 165 IU/ml, grade 2 according to WHO Toxicity Grades), and both Isoniazid and Rifampicin dosages were reduced. Abdominal ultrasound was normal. Subsequently she showed further increase in liver enzymes Glutamate-Pyruvate Transaminase (GPT) and Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase (GOT) (403 GPT IU/ml, 295 GOT IU/ml) and uric acid. Rifampicin-Isoniazid therapy was suspended, Allopurinol treatment was started and, suspecting INH toxicity, plasma levels and PGx test were performed.\n\nNeck and chest CT-scan showed lymphadenomegaly in the angle-mandibular and jugular sites with colliquative necrosis compressing the internal jugular vein, multiple lymphadenomegaly in the paratracheal and subarenal areas and multiple centrilobular micronodules with a bud-like tree appearance at right upper pulmonary lobe. Because of the lymphadenopathy and the increased levels of hepatic enzymes, Ethambutol was administered due to its limited hepatic toxicity after 2 weeks from the first treatment (Isoniazid, Rifampicin and Pyrazinamide).After 10 days following the normalization of liver enzymes, she was again administrated Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol\n\nThe anti-TB treatment protocol was as follows: Isoniazid 7 to 15 mg/Kg/die, Rifampin 15 to 20 mg/Kg/die, Ethambutol 10 to 15 mg/Kg/die, Pyrazinamide 30 to 40 mg/Kg/die.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup>\n\nChest X-ray showed a hilar flare with some pulmonary micronodularity, while neck ultrasound revealed numerous conglomerated lymphadenopathies in the laterocervical and right angle-mandibular sites with colliquative necrosis (max diameter 39X9.5 mm). She was discharged with quadruple anti-tuberculosis therapy to be continued at home.\n\nAfter 1 month, the patient was admitted again for the onset of vomiting and abdominal pain during anti-tubercular therapy. Blood tests showed altered enzymes liver levels (417 GPT IU/mL, GOT 1390 IU/mL, GGT 91 IU/mL); the abdomen ultrasound showed liver within dimensions at the upper limits with slight inhomogeneous and hyperechoic echostructure.\n\nTherefore, she was started on intravenous rehydration and, in the suspicion of iatrogenic liver disease, anti-tuberculosis therapy was suspended. Due to the new increase in transaminases levels and the outcome of the genetic test that identified the patient as slow acetylator, only a triple anti-TB therapy that included ethambutol, pyrazinamide and rifampicin was administrated.\n\nClinical conditions and hematic parameters rapidly improved following the triple anti-tuberculosis drug therapy.\n\nMethods\n-------\n\n### Sequencing analysis\n\nAfter obtaining the informed consent from patients’ parents for genetic analysis and publication purpose, targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was performed on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. The NGS capture was performed using a customized panel including _NAT2_ and other genes potentially associated to Isoniazid metabolism, including: _GSTT1, GSTM1,GSTP1, ABCB1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9_ and _CYP2E1_. Library was prepared using the NimbleGene Sequencing Panel, according to the manufacturer's protocol, and sequenced on the NextSeq 550 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Reads were aligned to the hg19 human reference genome and the TGex software (LifeMap Sciences) was used for variant's annotation. Each variant has been evaluated for the coverage and the Qscore was analyzed in silico using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen-2) for the prediction of deleterious non-synonymous SNVs for human diseases. Clinical investigations and genetic analyses were approved by the institutional scientific board of the involved institutes and were conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration\n\n### Preparation of standard solutions\n\nAll chemicals were of analytical grade and were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (San Louis, MO, USA). Standard working solution was prepared by dissolving Isoniazide in water with 0.1% v/v of acetic acid. Standard curve calibrators were prepared by spiking the standard working solution to drug-free plasma at the concentrations of 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 ng/mL. Internal standard stock solution was prepared by dissolving Fenformin in water:acetonitrile (50:50).\n\n### Sample preparation\n\nMeasurement of INH plasma concentrations was performed by adding 100 μl of sample to 50 μl of fenformin solution used as internal standard (at concentration of 1000 ng/mL). This solution was mixed by vortexing for 30 seconds, thereafter proteins were precipitated with 350 μl of acetonitrile. Tubes were vortexed for 1 minute and then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 9 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to vials and then 1 μL was injected into the UHPLC-MS/MS system for analysis.\n\nMethod validation was performed based on the US Food and Drug Administration guideline for industry bioanalytical method validation. The validation was assessed included specificity, linearity, inter- and intra-precision and accuracy, extraction recovery, and matrix effect.\n\n### Liquid chromatography\n\nChromatographic analysis was performed by a UHPLC Agilent 1290 Infinity II (Agilent Technologies). The separation column was a Kinetex 1.7 μm HILIC 100 Å 100x2.1 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Mobile phase A was 2.5 mM ammonium acetate with 0.1% v/v acetic acid and mobile phase B was acetonitrile with 0.1% acetic acid. The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min according to the following gradient: 0–4.0 min 90% B; 4.1 to 4.9 min 70% B; 5.0 to 7.0 min 90% B. The injection volume was 1 μL.\n\n### Mass spectrometry\n\nSamples were analyzed with a 6470 mass spectrometry (Agilent Technologies) equipped with an ESI-JET-STREAM source operating in the positive ion (ESI+) mode. The software used for controlling this equipment and analyzing data was MassHunter (Agilent Technologies). Samples were detected in the multiple reaction monitor (MRM) mode. The mass transition of isoniazide were: m/z 138.07→ 121 for quantifier and 138.07 →79.1 for qualifier. The mass transitions of fenformin used as internal standard were m/z 206.14 → 105 for quantifier and 206.14 → 60.1 for qualifier.\n\nResults\n-------\n\n### Pharmacogenetic testing\n\nSequencing analysis revealed the heterozygous missense variants, NM\\_000015.2: c.341T>C; p.Ile114Thr (rs 1801280), c.803G>A; p.Arg268Lys (rs1208) and c.590G>A / p.Arg197Gln (rs1799930) in _NAT2_ gene compatible with NAT2∗5C/∗6B haplotype. The c.341T>C, which is in linkage disequilibrium with the c.803A>G variant, has an allele frequency of 0.3810 in GnomAD, is predicted to be damaging (scaled CADD score 15.33) and encodes for the NAT2 enzyme with the most altered activity as compared to the other NAT2 slow proteins. The c.590G>A, has an allele frequency of 0.2725 in GnomAD, is predicted to be damaging (scaled CADD score 23.8) and has been described in association with a slow-acetylator NAT2 profile.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\n### INH plasma concentration\n\nTherapeutic range for INH has been commonly estimated at 3 to 6 mg/L.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> However, in presence of slow acetylators plasma mean concentration of INH at 3 hours post-dose is 5.8 mg/L with a high risk of developing adverse drug reactions (ADRs).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> In our case, following patient hospitalization due to recurrence of hepatic damage symptoms, INH plasma levels have been measured in suspicion of ADR revealing a concentration of 12.73 mg/L. Thereafter, following therapy suspension, plasmatic levels have been analyzed after 3 days showing a clinically insignificant concentration of 0.01 mg/L.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\nHere we describe a 14-year-old girl hospitalized for nodal tuberculosis who, following anti-tuberculosis treatment with Isoniazid, showed ADRs including vomiting, nausea worsening of clinical conditions and hypertransaminasemia. Suspicion of INH-related adverse reaction was confirmed by measurement of plasma concentration showing presence of drug levels above the therapeutic range. Suspension of anti-tuberculosis treatment led to an improvement of the blood parameters and, more generally, of the clinical outcome suggesting a possible slow acetylator phenotype. This hypothesis was further confirmed by sequencing analysis of _NAT2_ gene by Next Generation Sequencing that identified a NAT2∗5C/ ∗6B haplotype.\n\nINH and Rifampicin are important first-line bactericidal drugs with INH having the most potent early bactericidal activity. WHO recommends a daily dose of 10 mg/Kg (range 7–15 mg/Kg)<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> and until date, specific guidelines for _NAT2_ genotype and INH dosing is not available yet. However, dose-finding studies independently carried out in Europe and Japan, suggest that genotype-based dosage could be determined as follows; half the standard INH dose for slow acetylators, 1.5 times the standard dose for rapid acetylators, and the standard dose for intermediate acetylators.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21,22]</u></a></sup> Pharmacological treatments, based on a combination of different anti-TB drugs to treat active disease, aim to eliminate actively replicating and dormant or near-dormant mycobacteria with different mechanisms of action, whilst preventing the occurrence of drug-resistant organisms and reducing the risk of toxicity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn the context of personalized medicine, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), involving the quantification of drug plasma concentrations at a specific time in a dosing window, has emerged as a strategy to adjust the dose regimens required to obtain an optimal effectiveness minimizing ADRs or toxicity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> To date, TDM for anti-TB drugs is considered as optional,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> however anti-TB drug concentrations monitoring can provide considerable information for the clinician in order to increase drug efficacy and reduce occurrence of ADRs.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> Significant functional changes and several polymorphic enzymes involved in drug metabolism have also been identified with an influence on drug systemic concentrations. Among them, the _NAT2_ polymorphism associated with the SA phenotype, affects therapeutic response and is suspected to be a risk factor for INH-induced hepatotoxicity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27–33]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe major INH ADRs are neurological and hepatic, both rare in children. INH plasma levels can be related to fast, intermediate or slow acetylator phenotype determined by _NAT2_ variants. Between the possible INH ADRs, hepatitis is the most severe scenario, in patients treated with less than 10 mg/Kg. In adults, up to 20% of the treated patients show increased alanine aminotransaminase levels and overt liver toxicity may occur in up to 2% of patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u></a></sup> In more serious cases, patients may also show liver failure that needs temporary use of artificial liver or liver transplantation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u></a></sup>\n\nCompared to adults, there is a lack of information about the optimal dose of INH that could be used in pediatric patients. In order to improve our knowledge in paediatric settings, TDM of parent compound Isoniazid and its main metabolites could help during the clinical practice to improve the therapeutic outcomes and to investigate the kinetics of these compounds, limiting the occurrence of adverse effects. Moreover, investigating the NAT2 acetylation activity and the INH liver toxicity is highly recommended. Published reports clearly suggest that determination of NAT2 genotype prior to Isoniazid administration is clinically useful for the prediction of pharmacokinetic variability and possible adjustment of INH dosing regimen .<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,36]</u></a></sup>.\n\nIn conclusion, combined strategy of TDM and pharmacogenetic analysis should be widely adopted during the routine clinical practice in order to optimize therapy improving therapeutic efficacy and limiting the appearance of ADRs.\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment\n--------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>We are grateful to the participating family and to Technogenetics for its support.

A. Mey, and Boswellia carterii Birdwood. It is the modified version of a herbal formula HAD-B (Panax notoginseng Radix, Cordyceps militaris, Cremastrae appendiculata Tuber, Panax ginseng Radix, Bovis calculus, Margarita, Boswellia carerii BIRDWOOD, Commiphora myrrha).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn previous research, anti-lung cancer effects on HAD-B1 human lung cancer cell A549 cells were identified in vivo and in vitro experiments, and cell proliferation tests showed that IC50 values of HAD-B1 were 108.27 ± 29.12 which is more effective than conventional HAD-B. This is similar to the effect of erlotinib (Tarceva) and more effective than cisplatin.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> In animal experiments, we compared distilled water administration as a control group with erlotinib (Tarceva) 50 mg/kg as an active control group and cisplatin 5 mg/kg as an experimental group with HAD-B1 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg administration group, and HAD-B1 showed more anti-pneumatic effects on A549. In addition to the anti-lung cancer effect, liver function and novel function were not affected, as opposed to side effects of cisplatin and erlotinib (Tarceva), and were also shown to be more effective than HAD-B. Preliminary research using proteo chip-based antibody microarray has shown that it inhibits STAT3, a part of apoptosis's mechanism.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Based on the results of the study on A549 cells, the study on the effect of HAD-B1 on cisplatin-resistant A549 lung cancer cells showed the anti-cancer effect of HAD-B1 against the A549CR, and the study of the molecular mechanism showed that apoptosis was controlled by inhibiting STAT3 and promoting Bax genes, as in A549 cells.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> HAD-B1 has also shown the anticancer effects on H1975 EGFR-L858R/T790M double mutation lung cancer cells with the molecular mechanism and solid tumor growth.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u></a></sup>\n\nResearches have also safety through toxicological evaluation tests. In an acute and subchronic toxicological evaluation of HAD-B1 in rats, no target organ was determined, and the no observed adverse effect level was >2000 mg/kg BW.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> In addition, the most effective dosage of HAD-B1 was determined through comparative experiments. Cell experiments (A549, A549/CR) and animal model experiments (lung cancer Xenograft model) determined the most effective composition and dosage.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> The in vivo and in vitro tests found that HAD-B1 can inhibit human lung cancer A549 cells proliferation, and it was proved to be safe as it did not affect normal cell activity. Xenograft model experiment also showed that HAD-B1 can inhibit tumor growth and did not affect levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. In addition, research on the mechanism of action using proteo chip-based antibody microarray has shown that STAT3, part of the mechanism of apoptosis, is inhibited.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup>\n\nThis clinical trial aims to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics by oral administration of HAD-B1 in healthy male volunteers.

Through the 3-D high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, 6 important compounds of HAD-B1 were found: Ginsenoside Rg1, Ginsenoside Rb1, Notoginsenoside R1, α-boswellic acid, β-boswellic acid, Cordycepin.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Major ginsenosides such as Rg1 and Rb1 from _Panax ginseng_ composed of BX-MG cause apoptosis in lung cancer cells through the extrinsic apoptotic pathways.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> Notoginsenoside R1 from _Panax notoginseng Radix_ exerts an inhibitory effect on metastasis through inhibiting migration, adhesion, and invasion by regulating the expression of metastasis-associated signaling molecules.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> Boswellic acids from _Boswellia carterii_ BIRDWOOD can cause apoptosis via increased Bax expression, caspase activation, NF-κB downregulation of NF-κB, and induction of poly Adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase cleavage.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Cordycepin from _Cordyceps militaris_ causes autophagy-mediated degradation of c-FLIPL and leads to apoptosis in NSCLC cells.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> Based on these previous studies, we decided on the final marker compounds of HAD-B1. It is known that some of the compounds are absorbed into the intestinal bacteria gun and metabolized, and metabolites are detected in the plasma, so we decided to analyze the metabolites as actual marker compounds.\n\nThis open-label, single-dosing study on healthy male volunteers will assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of herbal product HAD-B1. The previous study demonstrated the safety of HAD-B1 through the toxicological study of long-term and high-dosage use (13 weeks, higher than 2000 mg/kg).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> In vivo and in vitro studies also showed that HAD-B1 has a potential antitumor effect as a growth inhibitor of solid tumors induced by A549 lung cancer cells without remarkable side effects and inhibited the growth of A549 cisplatin-resistant cells in depends on the concentration.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> According to these results, the antitumor effect of HAD-B1 combined with afatinib on H1975 (L858R/T790M double mutation) lung cancer cells was conducted, and the combined treatment of HAD-B1 with afatinib inhibited the proliferation of H1975 cells in a dose-dependent manner without toxicity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup>\n\nBased on previous studies, this study investigates the safety and pharmacokinetics of orally administered HAD-B1 in healthy male volunteers. It is expected to provide strict and objective evidence of the efficacy and safety of HAD-B1 for patients with lung cancer.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nS.D. Kim and E.B.

He was diagnosed with left shoulder dystonia one month before. Owing to the gradually worsening shoulder discomfort for 1 month, he had undergone acupuncture at the sites of the SCJ and lower portion of the left neck. Two or three days after acupuncture, the patient had developed intermittent fever and chills. At presentation, the patient showed signs of toxicity with high fever (38.0°C), increased respiratory (20 breaths/min) and pulse (80/min) rates. A tender fluctuant 5x6 cm sized swelling was observed in the sternal notch and left lower portion of the neck. Warmth and redness of the external skin and cervical lymph node enlargement were observed. No carotid thrills or bruits were detected. On laboratory findings, the whole blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were as high as 12,900/mm<sup>3</sup>, 120 mm/h, and 20 mg/dL, respectively. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.0% and the diabetes and hypertension in this case was well controlled before and during the treatment. Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) was identified in the blood culture and was sensitive to vancomycin. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and neck revealed multiple gas-containing abscesses in the upper chest wall, retrosternum, anterior mediastinum, and lower portion of the neck abutting the left upper lung and causing destruction of the costosternal junction and proximal clavicle on the left side . The patient underwent surgical drainage of the abscesses and debridement of the infected and necrotic tissues around the left SCJ. MRSA was also detected in the cultures of these tissues. Microscopic examination of the specimen revealed chronic active inflammation with abscess formation in the SCJ and fibrosis in the proximal clavicular marrow and necrotizing inflammation without granulation in the left lower portion of the neck .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nContrast-enhanced computed tomography scan shows bone and articular destruction around the left sternoclavicular joint (arrow) and multiple abscesses in the neck and mediastinum.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nHistological analysis image shows infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the sternoclavicular joint and surrounding soft tissues (hematoxylin–eosin staining, original magnification 400 ×).</u>\n\nThe patient's symptoms and signs improved early after surgical drainage and vancomycin treatment. All laboratory findings were normalized within 2 weeks and the CRP levels decreased to 0.6 mg/dL. The patient was discharged without further sequelae and had no recurrences of SCJ arthritis or infection in the chest or neck at 6 months follow-up.\n\n### 2.2 Case 2\n\nA 68-year-old man with no medical comorbidities presented at our emergency department because of a 3x4 cm sized swelling on the right side of neck, pain during range of motion of the right shoulder and tenderness on SCJ area for 2 days. Skin redness and focal tenderness in the neck and SCJ area and cervical lymph node enlargement were observed. The underlying diseases that can cause immunocompromised state were excluded. He had history of an intra-articular injection in the right shoulder because of pain due to a traffic accident 1 month ago. At admission, the CRP level was 24.18 mg/dL, and body temperature was 37.7°C. Blood culture showed no bacterial growth. CT revealed multiloculated abscesses in the lateral portion of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle, the 1<sup>st</sup> right costosternal joint area, retrosternal mediastinum, and right anterior portion of the chest wall as well as both SCJs.  The patient underwent incision and drainage (I&D) on right lower neck area under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, SCJ dislocation due to inflammation and necrosis was observed. Methicillin-sensitive _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MSSA) was detected from the I&D specimen. During hospitalization, the patient continued using a shoulder immobilizer. Intravenous antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and metronidazole were administered. After two weeks of hospitalization, the CRP decreased to 0.2 mg/dL and the patient was discharged without any further complications. There was no recurrence during the 6-month follow-up.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nComputed tomography scan shows multiloculated abscesses in the lateral portion of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle, both sternoclavicular joints, the 1st right costosternal joint area, retrosternal mediastinum, and right anterior chest wall.</u>\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nClinical infections of SCJ are rare but, when present, result in abscess formation in 20% of the patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> As the joint capsule cannot be distended, infection quickly spreads beyond the joint, leading to fistula formation, cutaneous abscesses, or, rarely, mediastinitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u></a></sup> Because SCJ is close to the mediastinum, pleural cavity, and brachiocephalic structures, the head and neck surgeons should be familiar with the clinical manifestations of an infected SCJ. Septic arthritis accounts for approximately 0.5%–1% of all joint infections.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,5]</u></a></sup> However, for reasons not known, 17% of the infections develop in intravenous drug users.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Bacteria may enter the SCJ from the adjacent valves of the subclavian vein after injection of the contaminated drugs into the upper extremity or the joint may become infected after attempted drug injection between the heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,8]</u></a></sup> Common pathogen isolated in septic arthritis of joints is Staphylococcus aureus.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> We should consider the recent history of acupuncture and intra-articular injection (at the other joint site), as noted in our cases. Usually, immunocompromised state, diabetes, and hemodialysis are the risk factors for SCJ arthritis;<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u></a></sup> however, a few reports have discussed SCJ arthritis in healthy adults, as in our 2<sup>nd</sup> case, with SCJ septic arthritis accompanying a chest wall abscess.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18–20]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe symptoms and signs of SCJ septic arthritis, namely, pain and swelling localized to the SCJ and systemic infection, in our patients were the same as those reported in a previous study.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> A delayed diagnosis of SCJ may cause serious complications, including mediastinitis, retrosternal abscess, phlegmon formation in the chest wall, osteomyelitis, septic shock, and superior vena cava syndrome, leading to death.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,5]</u></a></sup> The patient in case 1 already had systemic bacteremia causing SCJ infection at the time of emergency room visit. Furthermore, in both patients, the destruction of the costosternal junction of the first rib and proximal clavicle was observed. The differential diagnosis for septic arthritis include bacteremia, tuberculosis, and, rarely, necrotizing malignancy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,21]</u></a></sup> Acupuncture and intra-articular injection have been considered a relatively safe procedures, however, we should not overlook septic arthritis of the SCJ following acupuncture<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> and peri-articular injection of steroids<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> despite its rarity. Empirical antibiotic treatment covering MSSA and MRSA is required for these patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Surgical intervention is necessary in case of phlegmon formation in the chest wall and retrosternal abscess.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn conclusion, SCJ septic arthritis should be considered in patients with a recent acupuncture and intra-articular injection history presenting with neck abscesses. If SCJ septic arthritis is not detected early, fatal complications are unavoidable. Therefore, awareness of such an atypical presentation is essential for prompt diagnosis and appropriate management.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Ji Won Kim.\n\n**Data curation:** Min Ji Kim.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Ji Won Kim.\n\n**Investigation:** Min Ji Kim.\n\n**Methodology:** Ji Won Kim.\n\n**Project administration:** Young-Mo Kim.\n\n**Supervision:** Young-Mo Kim.\n\n**Validation:** Young-Mo Kim.\n\n**Visualization:** Jeong-Seok Choi.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Min Ji Kim\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Ji Won Kim.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:25:29", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:28:41", "cost": 192.196}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:28:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:25:28"}

It usually occurs in the 4th to 5th decades, without obvious gender preference. About 80% of cases occur in the mandible, most of which are located in the posterior part. Ameloblastoma is considered to be a benign tumor with slow-growth, local aggressiveness and a high recurrence rate if the resection is incomplete.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Metastasis or cancerization can occur in rare cases. According to the latest WHO classification, metastatic ameloblastoma (MA) is defined as an ameloblastoma that metastasizes despite its benign histological appearance.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Sometimes, it is difficult to make an accurate diagnosis, especially the lung MA, as there is usually a long period latent before metastasis, and the morphology is not typical. Unlike primary lung cancer, MA has a relatively indolent behavior. Therefore, correct diagnosis is extremely important to avoid misdiagnosing MA as other highly malignant tumors.\n\nCase presentation\n-----------------\n\n### Clinical and imaging information\n\nA 39-year-old female was admitted to the hospital with chest tightness for half a year and cough for 1 month. X-ray and Chest computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed diffuse multiple nodules in bilateral lungs, varying from a few millimeters to a maximum of 4.7 cm in size . The nodules showed smooth boundary, some of which with low density areas or cavities in the center . Abdomen CT demonstrated a nodule measuring 1.2 cm in the left adrenal gland, which was considered as metastasis . Tumor markers in serum including SCC, NSE, CA125, CA153, AFP, CEA were normal except CA199, which was slightly higher than normal. A definite diagnosis could not be made due to limited tissue from the CT-guided biopsy of lung nodule in February 2018. After the Multidisciplinary Collaborative Diagnosis and Treatment Team discussion, it was brought to our knowledge that the patient underwent 2 surgeries for resection of the right mandible tumor in another hospital 23 years and 18 years ago (diagnoses were not clear). The patient was advised to borrow the histology slices of the original jaw tumor for consultation. Subsequently the patient was scheduled to undergo thoracoscopic surgery a week later for the lung mass.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nimaging examination. Digital radiography showed multiple nodules with variable sizes in bilateral lungs (A). Chest CT scan revealed areas of low density and cavity in the center of some nodules (B). Abdomen CT demonstrated a mass in the left adrenal gland (C, red arrow).</u>\n\n### Routine pathological examination and immunohistochemical staining\n\nThe tumor tissues obtained by CT-guided lung nodule biopsy and thoracoscopic resection were fixed with 10% neutral formalin overnight. After conventional dehydration and paraffin embedding, the blocks were cut into 4 μm of slices for hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical examination. The primary antibodies include PCK (dilution 1:300), CK7 (dilution 1:800), CK5/6 (dilution 1:300), TTF1 (dilution 1:100), NapsinA (dilution 1:200), and other ready-to-use reagents CK19, P40, Calretinin, WT-1, Vimentin, CD5, CD117, CD20, TG, β-catenin, CT, ER, PR, PAX8and Ki-67. These antibodies were purchased from Origene Technology (Rockville, MD) and Dako Corporation (Carpinteria, CA). CD5, CD20, CD117, ER, PR and Ki-67 staining were run on the Roche Ventana Benchmark XT autostainer, while the others were stained on the Dako Link48 autostainer. Negative and positive controls were provided on each slice.\n\n#### Gross and microscopic findings\n\nThe gross appearance of the first CT-guided lung nodule biopsy showed grayish and cord-like fragments, with a size of about 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.1 cm. Microscopically, the tumor was mainly composed of 2 cell components, 1 type of epithelium located on the surface of nests or glandules (we called it “surface cells”), most of which were well-differentiated columnar or cuboid cells, while a few were pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium. Some vacuoles were observed in the cytoplasm, and pink secretions in the glandular lumens . The other type of cells were abundant, located underneath the “surface cells” (we called it “inner cells”). The peripheral part of the “inner cells” was columnar cells with hyperchromatic nuclei arranged in a palisading pattern, and the central part was ovoid or polygonal cells showing a vortex or fluid-like arrangement. Squamous differentiation was observed focally . Myxoid degeneration of extracellular stroma could also be seen . There seemed to be an inconspicuous boundary between these 2 types of cells. All the cells were mild, without mitosis and necrosis.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nHistological morphology of the first biopsy of pulmonary nodules (HE, 400X). There were 2 main cell components as the surface columnar cells and the underlying cells, the latter included peripheral columnar cells arranged in a palisading pattern and central ovoid, polygonal cells formed vortex or fluid-like arrangement (A). Some surface cells were pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium, and several inner cells showed squamous differentiation (B). Cytoplasmic vacuoles were observed in some surface cells and pink secretions accumulated in the lumens (C). Myxoid degeneration of extracellular stroma could also be seen (D). Cytological atypia, mitosis, and necrosis were absent in all cells.</u>\n\nThe gross specimen of the second thoracoscopic wedge resection showed 3 well-defined nodules with pale and soft cut surface. Tumor sizes were 0.4 × 0.3 cm, 0.6 × 0.5 cm and 1.3 × 1 cm respectively, the latter had a cystic area of 0.4 cm in diameter in the center . At low magnification, the tumor nodules were circumscribed from the surrounding lung tissue with no capsule, and a cyst could be seen in the center . Under higher magnification, tumor cells formed a large number of glandular, papillary structures and mulberry-like oval cell nests, with pink secretions in the glandular lumens . Similar to the biopsy tissue, the tumor region was composed of 2 cell types mentioned above. Columnar or cubic epithelium with slightly hyperchromatic nuclei were lined on the surface of glandular, papillary structure and nests. In the center of the mulberry-like structure, oval cells were arranged in a vortex or fluid-like pattern with slightly stained nuclei . There was no obvious atypia, mitosis, and necrosis. In the peripheral area of the tumor, there were a few diagnostic structures, in which the inner ovoid cells were arranged loosely, resembling stellate reticulum, and the peripheral columnar cells arranged in a palisading pattern with hyperchromatic nuclei . This feature suggested the possibility of ameloblastoma. The 2 types of cells were hard to distinguish sometimes and required careful observation under high magnification. Such as in the mulberry-like nests, there was a clear boundary between the “surface cells” and the “inner cells” . But, in the papillary structures, there were at least 2-layer cells lining on the surface, some of which were ciliated columnar cells. The boundary between the top-layer and sublayer was not clear .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nGross examination of the lung wedge-resection specimen. There were 3 well-defined nodules, sizes ranged from 0.4 cm to 1.3 cm in diameter.

At low magnification, the lesion was well-defined with a cyst in the center (A, B, 20X). There were numerous glandular, papillary structures and nests with mulberry-like morphology, pink secretions can be seen in the lumens (C, D, 200X). Similar to the biopsy, the lesions showed a biphasic morphology. Cell pleomorphism, mitosis, and necrosis were not seen (E, 400X). A few structures resembling ameloblastoma were found in the periphery of the tumor (F, 400X). At high magnification, there was a clear demarcation between the “ surface cells ”and the columnar cells underneath in the mulberry-like nests (G, 400X, the insert picture on the top left is the magnification of the lower right corner). In the papillary structure, at least 2 layers of cells were lining the surface, some were ciliated columnar cells. The boundary between the top-layer and sublayer was not clear (H, 400X, the insert picture on the top left is the magnification of the lower right corner).</u>\n\nThe slices of the right mandibular tumor resection 18 years ago were reviewed. Microscopically, the tumor was cystic, lining with characteristic ameloblastomatous epithelial islands and fibrous interstitium.

The peripheral cells were arranged in palisade and the central stellate-reticulum like cells arranged loosely (B, 200X).</u>\n\n#### Immunohistochemical findings\n\nThe “surface cells” of the first CT-guided lung biopsy tissue expressed alveolar epithelial markers CK7, TTF1 and NapsinA , while the “inner cells” were positive for squamous epithelial markers CK5/6, P40 diffusely  and for calretinin focally. PCK , CK19 and β-catenin were expressed in both cell components, but the remaining markers vimentin, PAX8, TG, CT, CD5, CD117, CD20, WT-1, ER, and PR were negative. Ki-67 proliferation index was approximately 1%. In the wedge resection slices, immunohistochemical findings of CK19, CK7, TTF1, NapsinA, CK5/6, P40, calretinin, and Ki-67 were consistent with those in biopsy tissue. Moreover, TTF1 staining highlighted the “surface cells” of the papillary structures, and P40 demonstrated 1 to multilayer cells of “inner cells” underneath the former . Immunohistochemical results indicated the “surface cells” were proliferative alveolar epithelium, and the “inner cells” were true neoplastic epithelial cells.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 6:\n\nImmunohistochemical staining in the first biopsy tissue (200X). Both the “surface cells” and the inner cells expressed PCK, but CK7, TTF1 and NapsinA were positive in the “surface cells”, while CK5/6, P40 were exclusively positive in the inner cells including columnar cells and ovoid/polygonal cells.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 7:\n\nImmunohistochemical staining in papillary structures (200X). The surface cells of the papillary structure expressed TTF1, and the other cells underlying the former were positive for P40.</u>\n\nDiagnosis\n---------\n\nThe final diagnosis was lung MA, combined with the history of mandible ameloblastoma, the unique biphasic morphology of lung tumors and immunostaining results.\n\nTreatment and follow-up\n-----------------------\n\nDue to lack of specific treatment, the patient was treated with traditional Chinese medicine intermittently after surgery. CT examinations of the neck, chest and abdomen were performed every 3 to 6 months. During 32 months of follow-up periodically (the last telephone follow-up was on November 20 2020), the patient was in stable condition without abnormal changes in the weight, mental state, diet, and sleep, except for chest tightness after activities and slight pain in the left lower chest occasionally. CT images displayed no apparent changes of the tumors compared with before.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\nAlthough ameloblastoma is considered to be a benign tumor, its biological behavior is unpredictable and can recur and metastasize. The recurrence and metastasis may be related to the operation method and repeated surgical procedures of the primary site. Vorzimer et al. reported a case of a primary right maxillary ameloblastoma recurring 5 times after surgery and 5 more operations were done before metastasizing to the lungs.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> In the report of Lacin's, a 23-year-old patient with ameloblastoma of the right mandibular, relapsed locally and was operated 7 times during 11 years after primary surgery, followed by liver and lung metastasis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Based on an analysis of 27 MA cases, the authors found that the lesions in the primary site recurred 4 times on average before metastasis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Therefore, wide resection of the primary tumor is needed to reduce recurrence and avoid the risk of metastasis due to repeated surgeries.\n\nMA is very rare, accounting for only 2% of ameloblastoma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u></a></sup> The diagnostic criteria include benign histological characteristics and clinical metastasis. Ameloblastoma may metastasize to lymph nodes via lymphatic tract, or to the lung, pleura, bone, brain, kidney, liver and some other organs through hematogenous dissemination.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u></a></sup> Besides, aspiration spreading, a rare and new form of metastasis has been proposed by Vorzimer et al.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> In their case, the tumor grew only in the bronchi and bronchioles with infiltrating to the surrounding tissues, and no other metastases were found. In our case, the possibility of hematogenous metastasis is more likely due to the widespread metastases in bilateral lungs and possibly the left adrenal gland (not confirmed by histopathology).\n\nLung is the most common site of MA, occurring in more than 70% cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u></a></sup> However, few reports in the literature have described the histological features of lung MA in detail. Our case showed lesions forming a distinctive biphasic morphology, the “surface cells” were proliferative alveolar epithelium, and the “inner cells” infiltrating the alveolar septa were the real tumor cells. The nature of this biphasic structure was identified by immunostaining of CK7, TTF1, CK5/6 and P40. Bi Rui et al. observed many glandular/papillary structures in their 3 cases of lung MA, which were confirmed as alveolar epithelium by CK7 and TTF1.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Nevertheless, compared with their findings, we observed some differences. There were also double different cell populations in the papillary structures, although not as typical as other structures we mentioned above. One layer to multilayer tumor cells were identified by immunostaining of P40 beneath the alveolar epithelium.\n\nIn the biopsy of this case, the biphasic morphology confounded the initial diagnosis. The primary differential diagnosis of lung MA is sclerosing pneumocytoma (SP). As a benign lung adenoma with clear boundary, SP contains unique dual-cell population as cuboidal surface cells and interstitial round cells, and forms 4 patterns including papillary, solid, sclerosis and hemangioma-like area.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> So, there were many similarities between SP and the present case in morphology. Major differences are as follows:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> SP usually presents as a single nodule, occasionally multifocal or with lymph node metastasis, whereas in this case, there were widespread lesions in bilateral lungs and 1 metastatic nodule in the left adrenal gland, such behavior does not support SP;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the immunostaining profile show that both “surface cells” of MA and SP are positive for PCK, TTF1 and NapsinA. Nevertheless, the stromal round cells of SP are usually negative for PCK, CK5/6, and positive for TTF1 and vimentin, while the “inner cells” of this case expressed PCK and CK5/6, without TTF1 and vimentin expression;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> most importantly, the patient had a history of 2 ameloblastoma operations on the right mandible.\n\nOther differential diagnoses include ameloblast carcinoma (AC), adenosquamous carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma with intrapulmonary metastasis. It emphasizes the malignant features of cytology in these tumors, including pleomorphism, high nuclear to cytoplasm ratio, nuclear hyperchromatism, increased mitotic activity, abnormal mitoses, vascular or perineural invasion, and necrosis. Therefore, mild cell morphology and low proliferative activity of this case can rule out AC and primary lung cancer. In the report of Bi Rui<sup>'</sup>s, 2 consultation cases were initially misdiagnosed as benign lesions, and subsequently corrected by acquiring a history of ameloblastoma surgery 10 years ago and 14 years ago.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Another author reported a case that the initial biopsy was misdiagnosed as primary lung squamous cell carcinoma, and the final diagnosis was MA, based on the morphology and a history of odontogenic tumor 17 years ago.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> The critical diagnostic clue of our case is also the combination of morphology, immunohistochemistry characteristics and primary surgical information.\n\nMA presents a relatively indolent behavior, and most patients can survive for a long time without any treatment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,12]</u></a></sup> By analyzing 293 cases of malignant ameloblastoma (including MA and AC) in the SEER database, Rizzitelli et al. reported the median overall survival was 17.6 years, but they were unable to investigate MA and AC individually.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup>\n\nDue to the rarity, there is no standard treatment for MA currently, and surgery is regarded as the first choice when metastasis can be removed. The role of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is controversial, only a few reported cases have been shown to benefit from these treatments. Radiotherapy was sometimes used for patients with oligometastasis. It was reported that a case of ameloblastoma with bone metastasis obtained 28 months of progression-free survival (PFS) after radiotherapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Another patient with a single brain metastasis received stereotactic radiotherapy and got 24 months of PFS.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> Laughlin reported a case of ameloblastoma with multiple metastases, in which 2 of the 4 skin metastases were treated with radiotherapy. The efficacy observed was different. The axillary mass of 8 cm disappeared after radiotherapy, while the 4 cm gluteal mass remained the same size as before.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Chemotherapy may be attempted for palliative purposes when surgery and radiation are not feasible. In Li Danyang's report, the patient received combined chemotherapy of MAID (mesna, adriamycin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine) for 6 cycles, and the lung MAs shrank by more than 90%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> However, more work is needed to validate the role of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in this rare entity. Recent studies revealed that in up to 60% cases, the most common molecular event in ameloblastoma is BRAF V600E mutation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u></a></sup> BRAF mutation is more common in younger patients and mandibular lesions, while the wild type is more frequent in the maxilla with earlier recurrence of the tumor.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u></a></sup> Brown and Sweeney et al. found that ameloblastoma cells with BRAF V600E mutation were sensitive to BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) treatment in vitro.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16,18]</u></a></sup> Broudic-Guibert et al. reported a lung MA harboring BRAF V600E mutation that responded well to vemurafenib treatment. CT scan showed the tumor was reduced by 30% and lung function was significantly improved. The response was persistent during 26 months of follow-up.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Brunet et al. observed complete response after 30 weeks treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib in a patient with lung MA carrying BRAF V600E mutation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> These data suggested that BRAF inhibitors may be a new therapeutic option for ameloblastoma or MA.\n\nLong-term follow-up is as important as the treatment of ameloblastoma. Most cases of recurrence occur within 5 years after the initial operation, and some may occur 10 years later. The interval between the primary lesion and MA is much longer, usually 9 to 18 years, and even up to 45 years.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,7,21]</u></a></sup> In our case, the primary lesion was resected and thought to be cured, so regular follow-up was neglected, but local recurrence and metastasis occurred. Therefore, it was unfortunate to miss the optimal opportunity for early discovery and treatment of metastases.\n\nIn conclusion, MA usually occurs after a long period following the surgery of primary tumor, and lung is the most common site of metastasis. Hence long-term follow-up and regular CT monitoring is required. MA cells grow in the alveolar septum and mix with hyperplastic alveolar epithelium closely, which can be misdiagnosed as primary lung tumor, leading to improper treatment. Accurate diagnosis depends on a detailed medical history and observation of the unique biphasic morphology under microscopic examination. MAs present a relatively indolent clinical behavior, and the prognosis is mainly related to the involved site and whether it can be surgically removed. Targeted therapy of BRAF inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic strategy in the future.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nMW diagnosed the case, collected the follow-up information, wrote the manuscript, and decided to submit the manuscript for publication.

In the brain, the virus infects neuronal progenitor cells, decreasing their viability and growth, resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation as well as neuronal apoptosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> CZS was described in 2016 and includes microcephaly, agenesia/hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, parenchymal calcifications, brainstem hypoplasia, and ocular injury.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,9,11,13,14]</u></a></sup> Neonatal findings range from cognitive, sensory, and motor disabilities to macular scarring and focal pigmentary retinal mottling; marked early hypertonia and symptoms of extrapyramidal involvement may also be present.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,5]</u></a></sup>\n\nZIKV infection diagnosis is marked by unique challenges that affect accuracy. According to Center for disease control (CDC) guidelines, ZIKV RNA amplification by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction should be performed in serum, blood, and urine as early as possible and up to 12 weeks after symptom onset (CDC guidelines). Diagnosing ZIKV infection is complicated for several reasons: the mother is usually asymptomatic, and when symptoms are present, they are nonspecific.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> ZIKV has a narrow window of viremia and viruria, making reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction detection difficult, and diagnostic tests can show cross-reactivity between ZIKV and the dengue virus.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> A recent systematic review indicated that ZIKV RNA could be cleared from amniotic fluid during pregnancy. Therefore, negative ZIKV test results from amniotic fluid specimens did not provide adequate reassurance that the fetus was unaffected.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> The optimal timing for performing amniocentesis and the positive predictive value of amniocentesis for congenital ZIKV syndrome have not yet been established. There have been reports of cases where ZIKV RNA was initially detected in amniotic fluid using PCR, however in other reports ZIKV was subsequently not detected by amniocentesis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\n2 Prenatal image studies\n------------------------\n\nAdvances in imaging technology have led to tremendous improvements in fetal evaluation. Two technologies are predominantly used prenatally: ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> The CDC, Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists all recommend ultrasound as the preferred tool to evaluate the fetal brain and screen for other fetal anomalies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Ultrasound features of CZS may not be apparent initially but are most commonly observed in the third trimester.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Guidelines from the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology state that maternal-fetal medicine units or specialized centers should monitor patients with probable ZIKV infection.\n\nNeurosonology is a method proposed by the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology to evaluate the skull and fetal brain. Divided into basic and advanced approaches, according to the types of ultrasonographic planes required for diagnosis and by the findings or abnormalities observed in the images. The classic signs found in fetuses with CZS are a massive volume reduction in the brain's parenchyma associated with ventriculomegaly, corpus callosum abnormalities, and cortical migration. CZS also shows cerebral atrophy involving the frontal lobes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20–22]</u></a></sup> Similarly, frontal lobe hypoplasia in the second trimester and unilateral ventriculomegaly is present. Other studies have detected cerebellar hypoplasia and abnormalities in the size of cisterna magna. Intracranial calcifications are more common at the gray-white matter junction and may also involve the periventricular white matter, basal ganglia, and thalamus.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17–22]</u></a></sup> Anomalies may also be found in the patterns of the brain turns and grooves by observing polymicrogyria, lissencephaly, or pachygyria. Usually, the cerebellum is abnormal and may be absent, atrophic, or poorly developed. Craniofacial disproportion with flattening of the forehead due to hypoplasia of the frontal lobes, is a typical sign and may occur in the absence of microcephaly.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,21,23]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 2.1 MRI\n\nFetal MRI has increased the positive predictive value of fetal brain abnormalities. This increase was evident in the case of cytomegalovirus. However, fetal MRI has a low negative predictive value and is associated with a greater number of false positives. It is usually performed using lower-resolution MRI. Maternal sedation is not required.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> Proper interpretation of brain MRI requires a radiologist with experience and knowledge in embryology and brain anatomy and the ability to recognize developmental processes, such as neurulation, cortical formation, and myelination, among others.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21,23]</u></a></sup> The anomalies of ZIKV infection reported by MRI are as follows: ventriculomegaly, increased subarachnoid space, decreased brain volume, abnormalities in cortical development, simplified brain groove and turning patterns, corpus callosum hypoplasia, brainstem hypoplasia, cerebellar hypoplasia, augmented cisterna magna intracerebral calcifications (at the cortico-subcortical junction) in the basal and periventricular ganglia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19–21]</u></a></sup>\n\n### 2.2 Adverse perinatal outcomes\n\nIn a recent study investigating the rate of adverse outcomes in proven infected fetuses/newborns, 45% of the cases presented no signs of complications. 20% had mild/moderate signs potentially correlated with congenital ZIKV infection (cZIKV) infection, 21% had severe complications, and 14% resulted in fetal loss.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup>\n\n3 Demographic aspects\n---------------------\n\nThe real challenge is to understand the full spectrum of adverse outcomes associated with ZIKV infection. Before any formal clinical recommendations can be made regarding the applicability of prenatal imaging in fetuses exposed to maternal ZIKV infection, a systematic review and meta-analysis is prudent. Despite multiple studies, many questions should be addressed regarding the impact of ZIKV infection during pregnancy, newborns, and children.\n\nA preliminary search of PROSPERO, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and _JBI Evidence Synthesis_ was conducted, and no current or ongoing systematic reviews on the topic were identified.\n\n4 Methods\n---------\n\n### 4.1 Review question\n\n*   1) What is the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound biometry, neurosonography, and fetal MRI for the diagnosis of congenital ZIKV infection during pregnancy?\n*   2) What is the diagnostic accuracy of these tests in relation to the reference standard of neonatal outcomes or clinical follow-up?\n\n### 4.2 Primary objective\n\n*   1) To identify the diagnostic accuracy of prenatal imaging studies that predict perinatal outcomes of fetuses exposed to maternal ZIKV infection.\n\n### 4.3 Secondary objectives\n\n*   1) To identify abnormalities and the frequency with which they are detected by prenatal ultrasound and fetal MRI after ZIKV infection.\n*   2) To report the associations between cranial imaging abnormalities and clinical follow-up of congenital Zika syndrome.\n*   3) To determine the efficacy of ultrasound and fetal MRI in detecting cranial abnormalities.\n*   4) To assess the associations between cranial imaging abnormalities and congenital Zika syndrome.\n\n### 4.4 Inclusion criteria\n\n#### 4.4.1 Study selection process\n\nThis review will include observational cohort studies (retrospective and prospective) of pregnant women with ZIKV infection in any trimester of pregnancy whose fetuses developed congenital syndrome and underwent prenatal imaging studies (ultrasound and/or MRI) and clinical follow-up of the neonate. Detection of ZIKV infection through real-time PCR when possible, immunoglobulin M (IgM) serological tests, and plaque neutralization reduction test, following protocols similar to those of the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Exclusion criteria included a case series of fewer than four cases, pediatric series on newborns and children from which maternal and pregnancy information could not be retrieved, articles with insufficient information to calculate two by two tables, and no response from corresponding authors.\n\n#### 4.4.2 Index test\n\nThe current review considers original studies that evaluated prenatal images from ultrasound or fetal magnetic resonance, either alone or in combination.\n\n#### 4.4.3 Reference standard test\n\nThe lack of a gold standard reference test is an acknowledged problem in studies of congenital Zika syndrome. Reference tests for the diagnosis of CZV are flawed. Criteria for the clinical features of CZV include neurological abnormalities, Zika virus IgM and neutralizing antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid or fetal tissue, Zika virus, viral antigen or viral RNA detected in infant tissue, cerebrospinal fluid or blood collected after birth.\n\n*   1) Perinatal death, including stillbirth and neonatal death within the first 48 h after birth,\n*   2) neonatal intensive care unit (NCIU) admission,\n*   3) composite adverse perinatal outcomes according to the definition of each individual study, which commonly includes any adverse outcomes occurring in the studied population, and/or\n*   4) Abnormal clinical follow-up included seizures, eye abnormalities, hearing abnormalities, and abnormal neurological examinations.\n\n#### 4.4.4 Types of studies\n\nThis systematic review will consider observational studies, including prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and analytical cross-sectional studies. We will also consider studies in which both sensitivity and specificity and/or receiver operator characteristic curves were reported. The protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis was prospectively registered at the International Prospective Register PROSPERO 删除5：<u>(registration number: CRD42018097200)</u> on July 14, 2020, for quality control https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display\\_record.php?RecordID=162914.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup>\n\n#### 4.4.5 Information sources and search strategy\n\nA systematic electronic search will be performed using the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases to identify relevant studies in French, English, Spanish, and Italian . For the search strategy, we will use a combination of the relevant medical subject headings (MESH) terms, keywords, and word variants for “ZIKV” OR“ “congenital Zika syndrome\\[tiab\\]” OR ”ZIKV infection \\[tiab\\]” OR “ZIKV disease” OR “infection, ZI∗” OR “Zika fev∗” OR “Zika virus infection\\[tiab\\]” OR “Zika fever\\[tiab\\]” OR “Zika virus infection \\[Mesh\\]” AND “diagnostic image\\[tiab\\]” OR ”diagnostic imaging\\[tiab\\]” OR “prenatal ultrasound \\[tiab\\]” OR “obstetric ultrasound\\[tiab\\]”. We will adopt different vocabulary for other electronic databases, using Boolean and proximity operators, limits, and filters. See Table S1, supplemental digitally content which illustrates Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram and See Item 1, which illustrates Search strategy for Pub Med.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nPRISMA 2020 flow diagram for new systematic reviews which included searches and registers only.</u>\n\nA reference list of relevant articles and reviews will be reviewed for additional reports.\n\nThis systematic review protocol was built following the ”Synthetizing Evidence from Diagnostic Accuracy Test guidelines.”<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> This review will follow the ”Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (DTA statement guidelines).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup>\n\n#### 4.4.6 Assessment of methodological quality\n\nTwo reviewers independently (T.H. and A.G.) assessed the quality of the selected studies. We used the QUADAS 2 tool, which evaluates the risk of bias and applicability and consists of four domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, flow, and timing.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> Each domain had signaling questions that were categorized as low, high, or unclear risk of bias according to the reviewer's judgment.\n\n#### 4.4.7 Data extraction\n\nTwo independent investigators (T.H. and A.G.) extracted data from each eligible study using a modified extraction template from the Cochrane community with the following study characteristics: authors, year of publication, settings, country, study design, study period, original inclusion criteria, total number of cases included in the study, sample size, patient characteristics (inclusion and exclusion criteria, demographics), how the test was performed (gestational age at testing), and reference standard outcomes assessed. Data were cross-checked for duplicate articles, duplicate cases, or discrepancies. We piloted the screen strategy and extracted data using a subset of 12 identified studies. A third author (I.C.B.) validated the information extracted or resolved the conflict if any disagreement or uncertainty existed.\n\n#### 4.4.8 Data synthesis\n\nA template for 2 × 2 tables, describing the TP, FP, FN and TN results for each included study will be constructed. From this, we will calculate sensitivity and specificity, with 95% confidence intervals, at the individual study level. We will construct Forest Plots, and summary operating characteristics plots for individual studies.\n\nThe extracted results will be pooled in a meta-analysis, and a hierarchical summary receiver–operating characteristic curve was constructed. Quantitative data synthesis will be performed using random-effect models. Results will be presented using pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and hSROC curves for the primary and secondary outcomes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup>\n\nAdditional analysis will result from comparing the performance of diagnostic tests in the absence of a gold standard using latent class analysis. Applying Latent Class Analysis within a Bayesian framework enables straightforward assessment of the prevalence estimates from each test by comparing the distributions of estimated test and estimated infection prevalence.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u></a></sup>\n\n#### 4.4.9 Reporting bias and sensitivity analysis\n\nThe Cochrane ×2 test and I2 were used to quantitatively determine the heterogeneity (test level = 0.05). Significant heterogeneity was defined as _P_ < .05. If data are too heterogeneous to allow pooling of effect sizes in a meaningful or valid way, we will use a narrative approach to synthesize the data.\n\nPublication bias will be assessed using Deeks’ funnel plot asymmetry test for publication bias, provided that ten or more studies were included. The analysis will be performed using R software with the packages mada, meta, metaphor, and Review Manager version 5.3.\n\n#### 4.4.10 Assessing certainty in the findings\n\nThe GRADE approach for grading the certainty of evidence will be followed, and a summary of findings will be created using GRADEpro GDT (McMaster University, ON, Canada).\n\n#### 4.4.11 Data access statement\n\nAll relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe thank Gabrielle Britton and Colleen Goodridge for their critical review of the protocol and valuable suggestions.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Tania Herrera.\n\n**Data curation**: Tania Herrera, Idalina Cubilla-Batista, Amador Goodridge.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Tania Herrera, Idalina Cubilla-Batista.\n\n**Investigation:** Tania Herrera, Amador Goodridge, Idalina Cubilla-Batista.\n\n**Methodology:** Tania Herrera.\n\n**Software:** Tania Herrera, Idalina Cubilla, Amador Goodridge.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Tania Herrera.\n\n**Writing – review & editing**: Amador Goodridge and Idalina Cubilla-Batista.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:58:34", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:59:47", "cost": 72.658}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:59:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:58:33"}

Its clinical presentation depends on the histological nature of the tumor itself; in this way, it is usually classified according to its secretory component as a functional or non-functional tumor.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Most of these tumors are relatively small in diameter. Surgical intervention must consider the size and characteristics of the tumor. If the diameter is <2 cm and the tumor is non-functional, consensus does not recommend surgical intervention.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> However, a diameter >2 cm is a strong indicator of pancreaticoduodenectomy. In the case of the laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy, the average size of these tumors is usually 2.5 cm with a range of 0.7 cm to 3.5 cm.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup>\n\nWe report the case of a 26-year-old male patient with a functional pancreatic neuroendocrine co-secretor tumor which measured 4.5 x 3.8 x 6.0 and was operated by laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy. This study was conducted in accordance with the SCARE criteria.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup>\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 26-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with a 2-day illness period characterized by diffuse abdominal pain of moderate intensity, associated with vomiting, diaphoresis, and acral paresthesia. He reported an unintentional weight loss of 4 kg in the previous month and decreased concentration in his academic activities over the previous year. The patient denied any personal or family medical history.\n\nPhysical examination revealed a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 breaths/min, temperature of 37 °C and body mass index of 25. The patient appeared chronically ill with an acromegalic appearance with prognathism, flared nose, diastema, and prominent superciliary arches . Goiter was absent. The lungs and heart were normal, and the abdomen was flat, with diffuse tenderness and a superior defense reaction. A palpable mass measuring 3 cm × 2 cm was found in the right upper quadrant. The neurological examination results were normal.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nPatient looked chronically ill with an acromegalic appearance with prognathism, flared nose, diastema, and prominent superciliary arches.</u>\n\nAuxiliary tests revealed hypoglycemia (59 mg/dL), which reverted after intravenous infusion of 25 g dextrose. 25 hours after the start of a 72-hour fasting test, hypoglycemia (55 mg / dL), ensued with hyperinsulinemia (13.7 uU / mL), increased proinsulin (10.42 uU / mL) and elevated C-peptide (1.09 nmol / L). Chromogranin A (47.1 ng / mL) was within the normal range, and IGF-1 levels were elevated according to age and sex (510 ng/mL). The prolactin, parathyroid hormone, and luteinizing hormone levels were normal. Furthermore, cortisol was found to be decreased (3.6 ugs / dL). Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed no tumor, but discrete pituitary enlargement.\n\nComputed tomography of the abdomen revealed an expansive lesion measuring 4.5 × 3.8 × 6 cm in the head of the pancreas, and the body and tail showed mild atrophy with a 2.5 mm dilation of the Wirsung duct with a normal uncinate portion. This lesion was heterogeneously enhanced in contrast to persistent central hypodense areas due to apparent small necrosis; it did not produce extrahepatic bile duct dilation . In the venous phase, it displaced and compressed the mesenteric and portal veins, without infiltrating them. No evidence of metastasis or lymphadenopathy was found. A diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor was made.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nAxial (A), coronal (B) and sagital (C) abdominal tomography with contrast. Unifocal tumor in the head of the pancreas, 6 cm in diameter, body and tail of the pancreas with slight atrophy.</u>\n\nLaparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) was performed with an estimated blood loss of only 200 mL. A standard placement of the trocars (T) was made through five abdominal wall incisions: T1, 12 mm at the umbilical level; T2 and T3, 10 mm at the right and left paraumbilical levels, respectively; T4 and T5, 5 mm at the level of the anterior axillary line and just below the right and left costal margins, respectively. During surgery, a 5 x 4 cm soft, regular, and well-defined edge tumor was found in the head of the pancreas . In addition, the peripancreatic lymph nodes and hepatoduodenal ligament were found without vascular compromise. The surgery lasted 600 min, and the greatest challenge was the dissection and resection of the tumor located in the head of the pancreas owing to its large size . Reconstruction of the pancreatic-jejunal anastomosis was performed in soft pancreas tissue with a small Wirsung duct of approximately 4 mm, a 3 mm feeding was used for cannulation , using the Blungart-type surgical technique. The immediate postoperative period and the following five days were managed in the intensive care unit due to a refractory hypertensive crisis. During the postoperative period, the amylase levels at 24, 48, and 72 hours by both closed drains (Jackson-Pratt) did not exceed the limit of normal serum values. The value of IGF-1 decreased to normal levels (272 ng/ml), as did the glucose values. Enteral nutrition was started on the third day without delay in gastric emptying, and there was no pancreatic leak. At 7 days, the drain was removed, and clinical evaluation showed no abnormalities, and correct dietary progress was evidenced. At 15 days, the persistence of mild abdominal pain at the mesogastrium level was evaluated, and paracetamol, conditional on the pain, was indicated, which was stopped at 3 months. The patient was discharged after 17 days, with no incidence of infection at the operative site, and with an optimal response to analgesic management.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nDuring surgery, a 5 × 4 cm tumor (black arrow) was found in the head of the pancreas, soft, regular, and with defined edges.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 4:\n\nPathology Image: Layers of tumor cells of intermediate size, cohesive, with vesicular nuclei and a regular amount of cytoplasm (arrow) are observed, with very little presence of mitosis figures in a fibrovascular stroma.

The resection margin was free of neoplastic lesions and the lymph nodes did not show any involvement. The findings suggested a well-differentiated grade 1 encapsulated neuroendocrine tumor. The immunohistochemical analysis was positive for synaptophysin and negative for chromogranin A staining. Taking into consideration the clinical and laboratory characteristics, it was concluded with high probability that the tumor produces insulin and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). Immunostaining for GHRH was not available. According to the pathology report, our case was a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, histological grade G1 (PanNET G1), according to the 2018 WHO classification.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe patient was followed up for 6 months. During this period, glucose values were monitored weekly, which showed normal values. Simultaneously, IGF-1 levels returned to the normal range. During the 3rd and 6th months, the patient did not present with pain and performed daily activities without limitations.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nPancreatic NETs (pNETs) are still considered rare neoplasms despite the increase in their frequency in recent years. While gastroenteropancreatic NETs represent 2% of all reported neoplasms, pancreatic NETs represent only approximately 3% of the reported cases of pancreatic neoplasms.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> The clinical classification of pNETs recognizes two types that must be distinguished: functional and non-functional tumors. This classification allows them to be distinguished according to their ability to produce hormones.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> In general, functional pNETs are usually smaller than nonfunctional pNETs. In addition, functional pNETs have the ability to secrete insulin, gastrin, somatostatin, or other peptides in such a sufficient proportion that when they reach the bloodstream, they cause a hormonal imbalance with an earlier symptomatic expression favoring its prompt detection. In our case, the tumor size was found to be larger than the average functional pNET, and this tumor was co-secretory in nature, which makes it an important case to consider because of its uncommon presentation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn Peru, it is not possible to perform immunohistochemical studies to determine tumor secretion. However, we observed a symptomatic component in addition to laboratory values with fasting hyperinsulinemia, elevated C-peptide levels, and elevated IGF-1 levels. These clinical and laboratory characteristics suggest a functional pNET with the co-secretion of GHRH and insulin. The diagnosis of NETs generally involves immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry techniques. The most widely used markers are chromogranin and synaptophysin.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u></a></sup> However, the absence of this marker in our patient may be a false negative because of the low proliferative index.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Access to tumor immunostaining was not obtained to confirm the diagnosis; however, our patient had several somatic features of acromegaly. The absence of a pituitary tumor but pituitary hyperplasia on magnetic resonance imaging suggested ectopic GHRH production, which is consistent with elevated serum IGF-1 levels that returned to normal values after tumor removal.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u></a></sup>\n\nWhen proposing the surgical plan as a treatment, we must differentiate possible options such as open pancreaticoduodenectomy, commonly called Whipple, from innovative LPD, which has evolved in recent years. The current literature describes several benefits of minimally invasive surgeries, including lower morbidity, shorter hospital stay and quick recovery. It also reduces the rate of complications because it implements more careful dissection techniques and involves less blood loss.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14]</u></a></sup> However, the laparoscopic approach to pancreatic head tumors requires a high degree of experience in open surgery, coupled with specialized training in advanced laparoscopy. The main disadvantage of LPD is prolonged operative time, which varies according to the skill of the surgeon and the size of the tumor. Different publications have reported means between 361 and 480 min for tumors of 2.5 cm and 3.1 cm, respectively.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u></a></sup> This is the main reason why some surgeons prefer LPD in cases of small tumors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Each surgical team must balance the potential benefits of the surgery and their own experiences to ensure the success of the surgery. In our case, the surgical team encountered an abnormally large 4.5 × 3.8 × 6.0 cm tumor in a young patient without any comorbidities. The surgical team, which had vast experience with 12 successful LPDs, performed the laparoscopic approach considering that the patient had no comorbidities that represented a surgical risk and sought to reduce postoperative complications for the patient and guarantee a shorter recovery time. The surgery lasted 600 minutes, and the greatest challenge was the dissection and resection of the tumor located in the head of the pancreas owing to its large size.\n\nReconstruction of the pancreatic-jejunal anastomosis was performed in soft pancreas tissue with a small Wirsung duct of approximately 4 mm, a 3 mm feeding was used for cannulation, using the Blungart-type surgical technique.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> This technique with a laparoscopic approach has reported an early recovery associated with less pain; however, it has a similar incidence rate in terms of complications when compared to its equivalent open approach.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> Most patients who require pancreatoduodenectomy can be considered for a laparoscopic approach, except for certain contraindications such as the size of the tumor, vascular compromise of the mesenteric and portal vessels, or in patients with greater associated comorbidity, as in the case of high cardiorespiratory risk.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u></a></sup>\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nCo-secreting neuroendocrine tumors are extremely rare. Despite the limitations of access to immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry techniques, recognition of the clinical features of acromegaly with elevated serum IGF-I without a pituitary tumor can help clinicians in the diagnosis of this rare clinical condition to plan the approach.\n\nOn the other hand, we must consider the importance of teaching and practicing minimally invasive surgeries, such as LPD, which could allow increasingly complex approaches. In this case, a large co-secretory tumor (4.5 x 3.8 x 6.0 cm) could be removed by LPD with only 200 cc of estimated blood loss, this in part due to the skill of the surgical team. Furthermore, we must consider that successful LPD leads to lower transfusion and complication rates.\n\n删除3：<u>### 4.1 Informed consent\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

She visited our hospital because of abdominal distension, pain and fever. At the time of admission, her systemic status was as follows; blood pressure of 140/ 72 mm Hg, heart rate of 74 beats/min, respiratory rate of 13 breaths/min, body temperature of 37.8. Physical examination revealed a mild distended abdomen with no fluid wave. No tenderness or rebound tenderness was observed on abdominal palpitation, and no specific symptoms were manifested excluding cervical motion tenderness on pelvic examination. Plain computed tomography (CT) and transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a cystic mass of 16 cm in diameter in the right pelvic cavity, and right ovarian tumor was suspected . We found no ascites, no solid components in the pelvic mass, no abnormal findings of peritoneum, and there was no sign of rupture of the tumor. The tumor marker levels were as follows; carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); 81.8 ng /mL (reference range: <5.0 ng/ mL), CA19-9; 56580 U/ mL (reference range: <37 U/ mL), CA125; 569 U/ mL (reference range: <35 U/ mL). White blood cell was 5,500 /μl (reference range: 3,300-5,500 /μL), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 17.58 mg/dL (reference range: 0.00-0.14 mg/dL).\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nComputed tomography (CT) images of the case.

Many tumor markers such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)-antigen, CEA, CA125, CA19–9, alpha fetoprotein may be useful in diagnosis,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u></a></sup> and in our case, elevated CEA, CA125 and CA19-9 were found. CT, magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography are usually examined for preoperative diagnosis, but distinguishing malignant transformation from MCT is very difficult.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> Some studies reported that solid component with contrast enhancement, transmural extension, irregular invasion through the septa to the peritoneal area and tumor size more than 10 cm are associated with increased risk of malignancy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Our case also showed similar findings. The most malignant transformation of MCT is SCC (75-83%), followed by adenocarcinoma, melanoma, neuroendocrine tumor including small cell carcinoma, malignant lymphoma, and sarcoma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,4]</u></a></sup> However, undifferentiated carcinoma arising in MCT is extremely rare, and there are few reports of this rare malignancy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u></a></sup> Histologically, undifferentiated carcinoma is composed predominantly of diffuse solid areas lacking a specific pattern, and usually shows immunoreactivity for both epithelial and mesenchymal markers such as cytokeratin, EMA and vimentin.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> In our case, the histological and immunohistochemical profiles were consistent with these characteristics. In addition, recent studies reported loss of mismatch repair protein including MLH1 or PMS2 in ovarian cancer with undifferentiated component,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> which could be useful to diagnose undifferentiated component in ovarian tumor.\n\nMany studies reported that malignant transformation of MCT has poor prognosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,5]</u></a></sup> Advanced stage, tumor grade, cyst-wall invasion or tumor dissemination have been suggested as poor prognostic factors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2]</u></a></sup> On the other hand, early stage and optimal cytoreductive surgery are reported to be good prognosis factors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,5]</u></a></sup> Recently, cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy and/ or radiation therapy has been recommended.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Although optimal adjuvant chemotherapy for malignant transformation has not been established, there are previous reports supporting combination chemotherapy of paclitaxel and carboplatin in malignant transformation of MCT, which showed overall response rate around 60%, and better progression-free survival.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,3,9]</u></a></sup> We also administered chemotherapy of paclitaxel and carboplatin in our case. However, our case showed extremely rapid progression despite surgery and chemotherapy. Rupture of tumor was not considered as the cause of rapid progression, because there were no malignant findings in ascites or other organs. Previous reports showed that inflammation plays a key role in ovarian cancer progression and metastasis,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> but there are no reports showing extremely rapid progression like our case. Undifferentiated component is reported to be associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6–8]</u></a></sup> and there are some reports of rapid progression in cases with undifferentiated carcinoma arising in MCT.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u></a></sup> So, there is a possibility of association between histology of undifferentiated carcinoma and rapid progression.\n\nIn conclusion, malignant transformation of MCT into undifferentiated carcinoma can be rapid, despite treatment with surgery or chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to evaluate this aggressive malignancy.\n删除1：<u>Author contribution\n-------------------\n\n**Conceptualization**: Kazuki Takasaki, Kazuya Kudoh\n\n**Formal analysis**: Sayaka Ikeda\n\n**Investigation**: Jin Suminokura, Naohisa Kishimoto\n\n**Methodology**: Kazuya Kudoh\n\n**Supervision**: Masashi Takano\n\n**Visualization**: Yuji Ito\n\n**Writing – original draft**: Kazuki Takasaki\n\n**Writing – review & editing**: Yuji Ito, Kazuya Kudoh</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:28:43", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:28:58", "cost": 14.909}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:28:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:28:43"}

While its origin is in ancient China, _Kampo_ has been developed under the influence of Japanese nature and culture. _Kampo_ prescriptions are covered under the National Health Insurance Plan of Japan and are easily available to clinicians. Recently, the application of _Kampo_ to LM has been reported, but there are no reports of its effects in neonates with LMs. We herein report a case of a neonatal huge cervical LM successfully treated using eppikajutsuto and ogikenchuto without tracheostomy or sclerotherapy.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA baby boy was delivered by Caesarean section at 41weeks of gestation without any prenatal diagnosis. A huge cyst in his right neck of 5 cm diameter, was found at birth. A diagnosis of macrocystic LM was made by ultrasonography.\n\nComputed tomography (CT) on the 7th day after birth showed a huge cyst of 7 cm diameter, extending from his right ear to the posterior wall of the pharynx, and the cyst slightly compressed the trachea . His respiratory condition was stable without stridor . Although we planned sclerotherapy using OK-432 followed by tracheostomy, his parents refused tracheostomy. Therefore, we administered eppikajutsuto (0.5 g/kg/d; Tsumura, Tokyo, Japan) on the 26th day after birth instead of sclerotherapy. Both the formulas are registered in the supplement II of the Japanese Pharmacopeia 16th edition. The manufacturing processes and quality are standardized based on the Good Manufacturing Practices defined by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan. They have been approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan as prescriptions covered under the National Health Insurance plan. The same active ingredients derived from the herbal medicines in extract powders have also been detected in the standard decoction.\n\n删除2：<u>FIGURE 1:\n\nCT scan of the head and neck on day 7 after birth. The estimated volume measured by volumetry was 47.6 ± 0.57 cm<sup>3</sup>.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>FIGURE 2:\n\nAppearance of the cyst on day 18.</u>\n\nThe patient's parents agreed for treatment with _Kampo_ therapy. At the beginning of the treatment, he was able to take eppikajutsuto orally, but initially there was a slight increase in the size of the cyst . Two months later, he developed a fever of 38°C with swelling of the neck cyst. A culture of the aspirate was negative for microbes. Two weeks later, we increased the dose of eppikajutsuto up to 0.75 g/kg/d and added ogikenchuto (0.4 g/kg/d; Tsumura) expecting greater regression of the lesion than with the initial regimen. After a few days’ treatment, the cyst had diminished in size to some extent. The lesion volume was estimated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a volumetric software program using the threshold and region growing method (Aquarius iNtuition Edition ver. 4.4.11; TeraRecon, Inc. Tokyo, Japan). The volume was extracted 3 times for each case, and the estimated lesion volumes were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Six months later, MRI and volumetry of the images showed remarkable regression of the LM without compression of the trachea  from 47.6 ± 0.57  to 12.7 ± 0.20 cm<sup>3</sup> . Since then the neck mass has almost disappeared under continuous _Kampo_ treatment, and the blood test showed no adverse events of the treatment such as hepatic and renal dysfunction or pancytopenia . After we tried to stop treatment, the LM tended to regain the volume. Hence, we are continuing the _Kampo_ medicine till date.\n\n删除2：<u>FIGURE 3:\n\nCT scan of the head and neck on day 40 after birth (2 weeks after administration).

Approximately 75% of LMs appear in the head and neck region.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> LMs usually grow slowly, but a rapid increase can occur due to infection or internal bleeding after trauma. In addition, huge LMs in the head and neck can result in significant compression of the trachea and esophagus and interfere with breathing, swallowing and speaking.\n\nHistorically, surgery has served as the initial intervention for a majority of LM patients. However, complete resection of huge cystic LMs is often difficult because of the massive involvement of important structures, such as nerves, arteries and veins. Therefore, other nonsurgical treatment options, including sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), interferon-α and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser, have been considered.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> In addition, promising new medications such as sirolimus<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> and sildenafil<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> have been used to treat LMs. In Japan, sclerotherapy with OK-432 (Picibanil) for LMs, which was first introduced by Ogita et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> has been the first-line treatment for LMs because of its insurance coverage and relatively low risk of adverse events. However, edema or inflammation around the trachea due to sclerotherapy can cause serious airway obstruction.\n\nBecause the parents of the present patient refused tracheostomy, we proposed _Kampo_ as an alternative therapy. Eppikajutsuto  is indicated for insufficient circulation and stasis, such as edema,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> as it reduces and eliminates excessive fluid. Ephedra herbs, which are a principal component of eppikajutsuto, have a significant inhibitory effect on acute inflammation,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> primarily via the anti-inflammatory effects of pseudoephedrine. In addition, D-pseudoephedrine and L-norephedrine exert inhibitory effects on fibroblast proliferation induced by eppikajutsuto. Gypsum fibrosum, a component of eppikajutsuto, also has anti-inflammatory effects.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup>\n\nTable 2 - The composition of eppikajutsuto\n\n| Constituents | weight (g) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Gypsum fibrosum | 8 |\n| Ephedrae herba | 6 |\n| Atractylodis lanceae | 4 |\n| Zizyphi fructus | 3 |\n| Glycyrrhizae radix | 2 |\n| Zingiberis rhizoma | 1 |\n\nOgikenchuto  has been considered beneficial in relatively weak patients who complain of symptoms such as exhaustion, night sweats, and loss of appetite.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> The principal crude drug contained in ogikenchuto is Radix Astragali. It stimulates macrophages to produce interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor and modulates the phagocytic function of macrophages.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> These findings suggest that Radix Astragali has immunomodulating activity _in vitro_, and this activity may be clinically applicable. In addition, Astratragalus saponins down-regulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and matrix metalloproteinase 2, which antagonize the angiogenesis and invasion of tumor cells.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> According to the report of Sidle et al,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> children with LMs had higher plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels than control subjects, suggesting that ogikenchuto may be effective in treating LMs via the inhibition of the development and growth of the vascular endothelial system. In addition, ogikenchuto tastes sweet, which helps ensure drug compliance.\n\nTable 3 - The composition of ogikenchuto\n\n| Constituents | weight (g) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Paeoniae radix | 6 |\n| Astragali radix | 4 |\n| Cinnamomi cortex | 4 |\n| Zizyphi fructus | 4 |\n| Glycyrrhizae radix | 2 |\n| Zingiberis rhizoma | 1 |\n\nSeveral studies have reported on the treatment of LMs with _Kampo_; for example, Ogawa-Ochiai et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> reported for the first time the treatment of mediastinal LM with eppikajutsuto and ogikenchuto without sclerotherapy, and Hashizume et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> reported a reduction in the size of LMs in 6 of 8 children without sclerotherapy. They also used the similar dosage without any adverse events. In the current case, we started the prescription of eppikajutsuto in the neonatal period, and shrinkage of a huge cyst was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first case to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of _Kampo_ using eppikajutsuto and ogikenchuto as a primary treatment in a neonatal patient. In addition, escalating the dose of eppikajutsuto was effective in achieving regression of the mass without severe adverse effects.\n\nThere are several limitations associated with our case report. First, we cannot conclude whether eppikajutsuto/ogikenchuto combination therapy was more effective than monotherapy. Second, the duration of _Kampo_ treatment in children with LMs and whether such medicines are safe for long-term administration is not clear. Third, the safety of eppikajutsuto and ogikenchuto and the escalation dose of both formulas have not been established. Resolving these issues will require a prospective multicenter study.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nWe reported a case of a huge cervical LM successfully and safely treated with eppikajutsuto and ogikenchuto without tracheostomy in a male neonate. The dose-escalation of eppikajutsuto may therefore be effective without severe adverse effects even in neonates.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nKN and KOO examined the patient and collected and analyzed the data.

Clinically, decompensation of pre-existing chronic liver disease, bile duct obstruction due to gallstones, or malignancy in the pancreato-biliary system is the major cause of jaundice. However, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is also responsible for 3% to 5% cases of jaundice.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe updated Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) is widely used as the diagnostic criteria of DILI.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> But this criteria tends to underestimate the patients without the previous use or unintentional re-exposure of the drugs. In Japan, the criteria for DILI from the DDW-J 2004 is well known and widely used. In addition to the framework of the RUCAM, it contains the results of lymphocyte stimulation tests and testing for eosinophilia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup>\n\nDILI is classified as either intrinsic or idiosyncratic. Intrinsic DILI is predictable and reproducible in preclinical models, and much insight has been gained into the underlying mechanisms. On the other hand, idiosyncratic DILI is very rare but is hardly predictable.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Various agents induce idiosyncratic DILI. Among them, antibiotics are the most common cause.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u></a></sup> Idiosyncratic DILI can be further classified into 3 biochemical patterns of liver injury using the R-ratio which is defined as the ratio of serum ALT to ALP values, both expressed as multiples of ULN, obtained at the onset of the injury. An R-ratio of >5 indicates the hepatocellular type, <2 indicates the cholestatic type, and 2 to 5 indicates the mixed type.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup>\n\nHere we present a case of a patient with sustained hyperbilirubinemia after administration of clarithromycin. Following cessation of the drug and bilirubin absorption therapy, the hyperbilirubinemia resolved and there was normalisation of Indocyanine Green (ICG) retention rate at 15 minutes (ICG(R15)), serum bile acid level, and urinary coproporphyrin level. Additionally, the liver was normally enhanced in the hepatocellular phase of Gadolinium Ethoxybenzyl Diethylenetriamine Pentaacetic Acid - Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI). Taken together, these findings indicated impaired function of transporter protein as the reason for patient's sustained hyperbilirubinemia.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 52-year-old male complained of a slight fever and mild epigastric pain. On the second day of illness, he visited a local clinic and received acetaminophen, famotidine, and clarithromycin. Two days later, his fever and epigastric pain disappeared. However, he noticed the yellowing of his skin and eyes.\n\nBlood examination showed serum albumin (Alb) of 4.4 g/dL (reference range, 3.7–5.2 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 102 U/L (reference range, 10–40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 253 U/L (reference range, 4–45 U/L), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) of 266 U/L (reference range, 119–229 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 354 U/L (reference range, 110–370 U/L), γ-GTP of 663 U/L (reference range, 9–70 U/L), total bilirubin of 14.1 mg/dL (reference range, 0.2–1.3 mg/dL), and direct bilirubin of 8.5 mg/dL (reference range, 0.0–0.2 mg/dL). Based on the criteria for DILI from the Digestive Disease Week Japan (DDW-J) 2004,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> the patient's score was 6, which meant that the patient was “highly suspectable” for DILI with the hepatocellular type (R-ratio of 5.88). The attending physician at the previous hospital diagnosed the patient with DILI and advised cessation of all the three drugs. The patient also started per-oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). His transaminase levels decreased >50% within 8 days, but his hyperbilirubinemia did not improve. The patient was admitted to our hospital for further investigation.\n\nThe patient had no history of liver disease. There was no family history of liver diseases, gastrointestinal cancers, and autoimmune diseases. He was an ex-smoker and drank socially. He had no known allergy to medications.\n\nThe temperature at the time of admission was 36.5°C, the pulse rate was 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 123/50mmHg. Physical examination revealed conjunctival icterus, soft abdomen without tenderness, and no hepatosplenomegaly.\n\nThe laboratory data on admission showed white blood cell (WBC) count of 5,300/μL (reference range, 3,300–8,600/μL), Hemoglobin (Hb) of 14.5 g/dL (reference range, 13.7–16.8 g/dL), platelet (Plt) count of 259 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL (reference range, 158–348 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL), total bilirubin of 24.7 mg/dL (reference range, 0.2–1.2 mg/dL), direct bilirubin of 16.4 mg/dL (reference range, 0.0–0.3 mg/dL), Alb of 4.1 g/dL (reference range, 3.7–5.2 g/dL), AST of 63 U/L (reference range, 11–39 U/L), ALT of 56 U/L (reference range, 5–40 U/L), LDH of 295 U/L (reference range, 119–229 U/L), ALP of 561 U/L (reference range, 110–370 U/L), γ-GTP of 79 U/L (reference range, 9–70 U/L), choline esterase (ChE) of 299 U/L (reference range, 185–414 U/L) and prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) of 0.90 (reference range, 0.85–1.15). Serologies were negative for acute viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis.\n\nBoth contrast-enhanced computed tomography and Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not reveal any abnormality . However, his liver was not enhanced in the hepatocellular phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI . ICG(R15) was 58%, urinary coproporphyrin was 324 μg/g Cr (reference range, 0–170 μg/g Cr), and serum bile acid was 283 nmol/mL (reference range, 0–10 nmol/mL). Technetium-99m galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) liver scintigram revealed that his liver function was normal (blood clearance ratio (HH15), 0.572; and hepatic uptake ratio (LHL15), 0.948). He continued oral UDCA, but his liver enzyme levels did not improve. He underwent a random liver biopsy on the 13th hospital day. Histological findings indicated only mild fatty liver and no accumulation of brown pigment in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes . Bilirubin absorption therapy was performed twice, and his hyperbilirubinemia improved and the bilirubin levels became normal . With the decrease of serum bilirubin, the liver was normally enhanced on Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI . ICG(R15), urinary coproporphyrin, and bile acid returned to normal range (ICG(R15) of 9.2%, urinary coproporphyrin of 58 μg/g Cr, and bile acid of 13.5 nmol/mL). Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) for clarithromycin was positive, which raised the DILI score up to 8 and improved the diagnostic accuracy. After discontinuation of UDCA, his liver function remained normal and there was no relapse of jaundice for about 2 years.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nImaging examinations on admission.

Liver was normally enhanced in the hepatocellular phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI (White arrowhead).</u>\n\nLaboratory data and imaging findings mentioned above indicated that the cause of hyperbilirubinemia in this case was the impaired function of human organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and 1B 3.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nWe herein report a patient who had DILI with sustained hyperbilirubinemia, and the conceivable cause is clarithromycin administration. In this case, the impairment of Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake in the liver and the elevation of ICG(R15), urinary coproporphyrin, and serum bile acid levels were observed despite the normal liver function on GSA liver scintigram and laboratory data including Alb, ChE, and PT-INR. Also, the drastic change of Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI imaging with the improvement of hyperbilirubinemia was observed following treatment and cessation of clarithromycin. Finally, we diagnosed the patient with clarithromycin-related DILI with hyperbilirubinemia due to impaired OATP activity.\n\nDILI is an adverse drug reaction that results in acute liver injury. The incidence of DILI is estimated to be 14 to 19 cases per 100,000 persons, with jaundice accompanying 30% of cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u></a></sup> In this case, the patient received acetaminophen, famotidine, and clarithromycin before the onset of his liver injury. Acetaminophen is well known to induce direct hepatotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. A previous study demonstrated that alcohol abuse (consumption of >40 g alcohol per day in men and >20 g alcohol per day in women) could lead to acetaminophen-related liver failure with a lower dose.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> However, the patient took only 0.8 g/day of acetaminophen for 2 days before the onset of jaundice, and he had no history of alcohol abuse. Famotidine-induced hepatocellular jaundice has been previously reported, however, the mechanism of liver injury is unclear.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> An observational study including more than 100,000 patients who received anti-peptic drugs did not show famotidine-induced acute liver injury.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Meanwhile, the frequency of DILI related to clarithromycin, the most conceivable drug, in this case, is 1% to 3%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> DILI-associated hyperbilirubinemia is mainly due to cholestatic liver injury, but direct inhibition of transporter protein by drugs is considered to be an alternative mechanism of causing hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nOATP1B1 (encoded by _SLCO1B1_) and OATP1B3 (encoded by _SLCO1B3_) are expressed on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and are responsible for the hepatic uptake of bilirubin, various drugs, and endogenous compounds.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15]</u></a></sup> It is well known that mutations of both _SLCO1B1_ and _SLCO1B3_ are involved in Rotor syndrome, whose clinical characteristic is severe hyperbilirubinemia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16,17]</u></a></sup> Therefore, the impaired function of OATP1B1 and 1B3 can lead to hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nIn this case, laboratory data showed an elevation of urinary coproporphyrin, which has been reported as the marker of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 activity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u></a></sup> Also, bile acid, ICG, and Gd-EOB-DTPA have been reported as the substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u></a></sup> Therefore, we consider that the impaired function of OATP1B1 and 1B3 contributed to hyperbilirubinemia in the present case. Moreover, the histopathological result of liver biopsy showing no accumulation of brown pigment in hepatocytes suggesting the impairment of bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes.\n\nGenerally, several reports demonstrated that cyclosporin A (CyA), rifampicin, and rifamycin SV could induce hyperbilirubinemia via direct inhibition of OATP1B1 and 1B3.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19,22–24]</u></a></sup> Among the drugs prescribed before the onset of jaundice, clarithromycin is the only reported drug to reduce OATP1B1 and 1B3 transporter activity _in vitro_ using OATP1B1 and 1B3 expressing-HEK293 cells.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25]</u></a></sup>\n\nHyperbilirubinemia accompanying hepatitis with any etiology can inhibit hepatic uptake of bilirubin, serum bile acid, and coproporphyrin by direct competition for OATP1B1. However, the patient manifested impaired ICG retention test and impaired Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake into the liver, which strongly suggested the impaired function of their predominant transporter, OATP1B3.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u></a></sup>\n\nThere is a possibility that DILI itself affects the OATP transporter activity regardless of the effect of clarithromycin. A previous report demonstrated that mRNA levels of hepatic transporter proteins significantly decreased in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in rats.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> However, in the present case, the hyperbilirubinemia was sustained even after the improvement of elevated transaminase. Additionally, there was no evidence of inflammation on the liver biopsy specimens.\n\nOATP1B1 and 1B3 transporter proteins can be regulated\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> at the plasma membrane competitive inhibition;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> by transcriptional factors that can repress or activate transcription;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> post-transcriptional modification by phosphorylation or ubiquitination; and\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> by alteration of protein degradation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u></a></sup>\n\nA previous report demonstrated that macrolides function as non-competitive inhibitors for OATP transporter, but the exact mechanism has not been established.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe highlight of this case was that the patient had sustained hyperbilirubinemia even though he took clarithromycin for only 2 days before the onset of jaundice. There is no data about the relationship between the duration of clarithromycin administration and the continuation of hyperbilirubinemia via inhibition for OATP transporter. However, previous reports showed that clarithromycin increased area under the serum concentration-time curve of statins, 1 of the major substrates of OATP1B1. As a result, clarithromycin promoted toxicity of statins even in cases with 3 days of administration.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[29,30]</u></a></sup> These data suggest that clarithromycin could inhibit OATP transporter and induce hyperbilirubinemia in short duration. Regarding the continuation of the inhibitory effect, previous reports demonstrated that inhibitors against OATP1B1 and 1B3 like CyA and rifampicin reduced transporter activity even after washing out these inhibitors _in vitro_.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[31–33]</u></a></sup> Based on these data, we consider that clarithromycin is the most conceivable drug associated with liver injury in our patient.\n\nThere are some limitations in the present case. Firstly, we did not measure the OATP1B1/1B3 transporter activity directly. But the impaired uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA into the liver and the elevation of the markers (the serum bile acid, ICG, and urinary coproporphyrin) strongly suggest the presence of impaired OATP1B1/1B3 activity. Secondly, the liver function test was not performed when the patient started taking clarithromycin. But the patient did not have underlying liver diseases, and his liver enzyme improved after stopping clarithromycin.\n\nIn conclusion, this case report describes a patient with sustained hyperbilirubinemia after the administration of clarithromycin. The present case indicates that the liver uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA, ICG combined with measurement of urinary coproporphyrin and serum bile acid levels can serve as markers of OATP transporter activity and can be useful for differential diagnosis of sustained hyperbilirubinemia.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Keisuke Ishigami, Noriyuki Akutsu.\n\n**Data curation:** Tomoka Yamamoto, Keisuke Ishigami.\n\n**Investigation:** Akari Ueno, Yasunao Numata, Kohei Wagatsuma, Shigeru Sasaki.\n\n**Supervision:** Hiroshi Nakase.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Tomoka Yamamoto, Keisuke Ishigami.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Hiroshi Nakase.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:35:39", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:36:13", "cost": 33.61}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:36:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:35:38"}

This tumor occurs in adults with a median age of 67 years at presentation (range, 13–85 years) with no gender predilection. <sup> 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></sup> The patient's geographical origin, either from the West or the Far East, being of Asian descent, demarcates the stark contrast in frequency and clinical presentation. The initial description of this entity was first chronicled in 1986 as a Western variant. <sup> 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></sup> Being a lymphomatous entity, the involvement of lymph nodes is astonishingly spared in both. To date, only a few cases and larger case series have been reported. The diagnosis of IVLBCL poses a significant risk of delay in diagnosis mainly due to the wide range of clinical presentations, non-specific laboratory results, and imaging studies. It is a rare subtype of large cell lymphoma, characterized by the discerning growth of lymphoma cells within the lumina of small blood vessels, without an obvious extravascular tumor mass or presence of circulating lymphoma cells in the peripheral blood. Clinical signs and symptoms at presentation are non-specific and are usually related to the main organ involved. Bone marrow involvement is reported to be uncommon in patients with IVLBCL.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Here, we describe a patient with IVLBCL who presented with fever of unknown origin, abdominal pain, and bone marrow involvement.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 68-year-old woman was referred to our center for further investigation and management of myelodysplastic syndrome. She initially presented with a prolonged fever of three months duration associated with constitutional symptoms. The patient had temperature spikes of 39.0°C on and off since admission. Other than mild pallor, clinical examination was rather unremarkable, and no neurological symptoms or skin lesions were noted. A complete blood count showed hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL, total white blood cells 9.8 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L (absolute neutrophil count; 4.1 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and absolute lymphocyte count; 2.4 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and platelet 366 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L while a peripheral blood film examination showed normochromic normocytic anemia and a few atypical and reactive lymphocytes which indicatied inflammatory process. Liver function test showed mildly elevated total bilirubin (22.63 μmol/L) and alkaline phosphatase (151 U/L), while other liver function parameters were within the normal range. The lactate dehydrogenase level was also elevated (311 U/L), and serum ferritin level was markedly elevated (2096 μg/L). A full panel of infectious disease screening including hepatitis B surface antigen, treponema IgM and IgG; dengue IgM, IgG, and NS1; melioidosis; blood film for malaria parasite; _Salmonella typhi_ IgM and IgG; and HIV 1 and 2 IgG were negative. Serial blood cultures were negative for growth. However, inflammatory markers were elevated, including C-reactive protein (14.7 mg/L) and procalcitonin (0.11 μg/L). Because of prolonged fever, she was screened for autoimmune disorder using complement levels C3 (1.07 mg/L) C4 (0.17 mg/L) and tumor markers including α-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and several cancer antigen (CA) markers (CA 125, CA 15-3 and CA 19-9), and the results were unremarkable. Further investigation to find the inflammatory or infective source included an echocardiogram that was normal with no vegetation. The skeletal survey did not reveal any lytic lesions. Chest radiography revealed clear lung fields. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and thorax did not reveal any significant abnormalities. Upper and lower endoscopy studies to further investigate the cause of persistent fever were also unremarkable. She was given a trial of antibiotics and prednisolone at tapering doses and was discharged.\n\nHowever, she was readmitted 2 months later to another hospital as she became increasingly unwell and presented with persistent fever and lethargy associated with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed pallor with neither lymphadenopathy nor hepatosplenomegaly. A repeat upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy examination revealed only mild antral gastritis and colitis. Tissue biopsies of multiple sites including the cecum, ascending and descending colon, sigmoid, and rectum showed non-specific moderate colitis and adenomatous polyps. Stool examination was positive for occult blood. The Spot test result for tuberculosis was negative. Subsequent通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>18</sup></u>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/CT (PET CT) scan showed diffuse marrow uptake, which was attributed to a reactive response to anemia with no evidence of increased FDG uptake elsewhere. Thus, it was concluded that the scan did not reveal any FDG-avid tumor lesions or pathology.\n\nGiven the patient's clinical deterioration, a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy examination was performed. Her hemoglobin level during this presentation was lower at 8.8 g/dL. Bone marrow examination was initially reported to have features of myelodysplastic syndrome. A re-examination of the BMAT at our center revealed a hypercellular marrow with abnormally large cells with evenly dispersed chromatin, some with prominent nucleoli, basophilic cytoplasm, and cytoplasmic vacuolation. Hemophagocytic activity was increased with macrophages containing red cells, granulocytes, and mononuclear cells within the cytoplasm . Trephine biopsy showed hypercellular bone marrow for age (approximately 90%) accompanied by focal areas of fibrosis. Trilineage hematopoietic activity was observed. However, the abnormal lymphoid cells were arranged in small wavy clusters. These neoplastic cells were medium to large in size with dispersed chromatin and prominent nucleoli in some of the cells . The cells were arranged within the blood vessel lumen in a sinusoidal distribution pattern . This pattern was apparent with CD34 staining, which highlighted the thin vascular walls containing the neoplastic cells . The neoplastic cells expressed B-cell lineage markers with strong CD20  and CD79a and PAX5 positivity. The cells were also positive for MUM-1 with the presence of the anti-apoptotic factor BCL2overexpression. CD30 was expressed in some of the larger neoplastic cells but was negative for CD15. The cells were also positive for OCT2 and BOB1. Ki67 immunostaining showed a very high proliferation fraction (> 80%) in neoplastic cells. _In situ_ hybridization for the detection of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA was negative. Histiocytes stained strongly for CD163 within hematopoietic spaces . No clonal chromosomal abnormalities were detected using conventional cytogenetics. She was diagnosed with IVLBCL of the marrow and was started on a combination of rituximab and CHOP (R-CHOP) regimen. Over the course of the first cycle of chemotherapy, her clinical symptoms quickly improved. Her fever resolved, and her blood counts recovered. She completed 6 cycles of R-CHOP (five months after diagnosis) without significant therapy-related complications. At two-year follow-up, a repeat bone marrow surveillance examination showed that the patient remained in complete remission.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nA) Large atypical cells in bone marrow aspirate with irregular nucleus, basophilic cytoplasm, and vacuolation (May-Grunwald-Giemsa, 40X).

It is often associated with cytopenias, prolonged fever, neurological symptoms, and skin lesions, and involves widely disseminated extranodal sites including the spleen, bone marrow, liver, adrenal gland, brain, lung bone, and uterus.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u></a></sup> The lymph nodes are usually spared. This entity was first described in 1986 and has since been studied as case report, some large case series, and literature reviews.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u></a></sup> It has two major patterns of clinical presentations. First, the so-called classic form, which is mostly present in Western countries, characterized by predominantly neurological and cutaneous symptoms. The second is the Asian variant, which is associated with a hemophagocytic syndrome or hemophagocytic syndrome-associated form. The latter seems to be more uncommon than the former, where patients deteriorate rather quickly with multi-organ failure.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is also a rare entity that is potentially life-threatening. This disorder is characterized by the presence of at least five of the following features for diagnosis: fever, cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, hemophagocytosis, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, low natural killer cell activity, and elevated soluble CD25.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> In this case, only diffuse expression of CD163 on bone marrow histiocytes was observed, while other criteria were not assessed.\n\nTumor lymphocytes are mainly located in the lumen of small-or medium-sized blood vessels in many organs. In some cases, fibrin, thrombosis, bleeding, and necrosis may occur. The tumor cells are large with obvious nucleoli, and frequent mitosis is observed. In rare cases, the cells may be small or anaplastic.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Tumor cells positioned in the interstitium of the involved tissues are usually minimal. In the central nervous system type, recurrence of the tumor may be related to extravascular brain masses.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Thin venous sinusoidal involvement is observed in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Circulating malignant cells may occasionally be found in peripheral blood, although this does not occur in the majority of cases observed.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> The same patient may exhibit several different patterns of tumor distribution. Neoplastic cells located in the central part of the blood vessel lumen exhibit a free-floating appearance, while in the more ‘cohesive or sticky’ mode, the tumor cells almost completely fill the lumen, and it is often difficult to assess the vascular structure. A marginating pattern is discerned when tumor cells have an affinity to adhere and skirt along the sides of endothelial cells, where the central part of the lumen appears void.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn most cases, tumor cells are large and have a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio with very little cytoplasm. The nuclear outline is usually smooth, whereas irregular contours are less commonly reported. Neoplastic cells characterized by smaller cells with irregular nuclear contours have been reported in isolated cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> The nucleolus may be single, conspicuous, or multiple nucleoli, but is easily identified. Therefore, IVLBCL shows a morphological spectrum involving centroblasts to more atypical features of immunoblasts or plasmablasts<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10,12]</u></a></sup> including rare forms with anaplastic morphology.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Except for major blood vessels, almost all other blood vessels may be affected in IVLBCL.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> In this case, the presence of mitotic figures and high proliferation fraction of cells highlighted by Ki67 immunostaining confirmed active replication within the vascular space.\n\nCases associated with the Asian variant of hemophagocytic syndrome are accompanied by non-neoplastic histiocytes containing red blood cells or mononuclear cells. Cells displaying phagocytic activity may also be easily observed in peripheral blood smears. In a small number of cases, IVLBCL is diagnosed following the identification of a preceding lymphoma involving indolent types such as small lymphocytic lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, and the more aggressive type diffuse large cell lymphoma not otherwise specified.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> A clear clonal origin has recently been reported in a patient with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and subsequent IVLBCL.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> In this case, the diagnosis was made only after the examination of the trephine biopsy with extensive immunostaining. Tumor cells express antigens associated with mature B cells. Co-expression of CD5 and CD10 was observed in 38% and 13% of the cases, respectively. Almost all CD10 negative cases arre positive for IRF4/MUM1 in favor of a non-germinal center B subtype. More EBV-positive tumor cells are seen in intravascular NK/T cell lymphomas, and a very small number of ALK-negative intralymphatic large cell lymphomas have been reported, but separating these entities must be considered.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> It has been hypothesized that the intravascular growth pattern is secondary to defects in the localization of receptors on tumor cells, such as the lack of adhesion β molecules CD29 (integrin β1) and CD54 (ICAM1). Further studies are needed to better understand the evolution of this rare lymphoma. New and emerging evidence indicates the utility of PET/CT in the diagnosis of lymphoma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> However, its role in IVLBCL is still largely unknown due to its rarity and non-specific findings on clinical and other supporting diagnostic tools. A characteristic pattern of FDG capture has been proposed, mainly involving diffuse accumulation in organs that are rich in small blood vessels, such as the lungs, kidneys, and bone marrow.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> This is because autopsies revealed a high frequency of involvement in these organs.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> Cytogenetic abnormalities and molecular changes have not been well characterized under these conditions.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup>\n\nOnly one other case of IVLBCL has been reported in Malaysia, where the patient presented with neurological symptoms and was initially diagnosed with acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> After the symptoms worsened a month later, a biopsy of the brain was performed, which showed B-lymphoid cells within the vascular lumina.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Our patient presented with fever of unknown origin and was later diagnosed with IVLBCL. Unfortunately, there is no fever pattern pathognomonic of cancer. Classically, cancer fever may be less associated with rigors, tachycardia, and hypotensive episodes than other causes. The patient did not respond to intensive and prolonged antibiotic therapy, which tended to exclude any involvement of bacteriologic etiology. Antipyretic agents such as aspirin and paracetamol usually have no effect on cancer fever, unlike fever caused by infection.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u></a></sup> The mechanisms underlying cancer-induced fever are not fully understood.

FMF can present with varying symptoms that can lead to difficult diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> However, clinical features and disease severity may vary among individuals and different ethnic groups.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> FMF-related peritonitis may sometimes be associated with massive ascites,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> but the condition rarely lasts for more than one week. We report the case of a male Japanese patient who presented with protracted FMF-related severe abdominal pain and peritonitis that lasted > 1 week, even under colchicine treatment.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nOur patient was a 46-year-old Japanese man who was hospitalized in our department because of severe abdominal pain, which began three days before admission. His medical history included bi-monthly episodes of acute abdominal pain and high fever beginning at the age of 41 years. The episodes lasted > 1 week, and FMF was eventually clinically suspected at age 44 years. According to the criteria by Livneh et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> he met one major criterion, including peritonitis (generalized), and one minor criterion, including incomplete febrile attack longer than the specified duration (lasting 12 and 72 hours). Therefore, in spite of the typical peritoneal attack, he was diagnosed as having incomplete FMF. Colchicine treatment was prescribed (1.5 mg/d), but this did not control the recurrent attacks of abdominal pain. The patient's family history was negative for FMF.\n\nAt admission, he was acutely febrile with a body temperature of 38.5°C and hypotension (67/40 mm Hg). After hospitalization, his fever of 38.5°C persisted, and he had severe abdominal pain. His blood pressure fluctuated, sometimes decreasing to as low as 60 mm Hg due to severe abdominal pain. Findings from a physical examination of the head, neck, lungs, and heart were normal. However, diffuse abdominal pain, rebound tenderness, abdominal rigidity, the sign of persistent peritonitis, and decreased peristalsis were observed during abdominal examination.\n\nIn the laboratory tests , his blood count results showed an increased white blood cell count of 12,000/mL with 80% neutrophils and a markedly elevated C-reactive protein level of 14.3 mg/dL. His cytomegalovirus antigenemia test result was negative, and blood culture indicated no infectious pathogens. Abdominal radiography revealed air-fluid accumulation in the small intestines . Abdominal computed tomography revealed thickening of the intestinal walls, with diffusely increased density of the mesenteric peritoneum and enlarged intra-abdominal lymph nodes . Negative result for blood culture and plasma procalcitonin did not support the infective peritonitis. The patient was put on a 7-day fast, with the administration of intravenous electrolytes and acetaminophen and pentazocine. After seven days, the patient gradually improved and resumed oral food consumption .\n\nTable 1 - Laboratory findings and cytokine profile on admission.\n\n| Peripheral blood |  | Immunoserological tests |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Red blood cells | 476 × 104/μL |  C-reactive protein | 14.39 mg/dL (<0.30) |\n|  Hemoglobin | 15.0 g/dL |  Serum amyloid A | 588 μg/mL (<8.0) |\n|  Hematocrit | 42.9% |  sIL-2R | 352 U/ml 通用删除7(英):<u>(121–613)</u> |\n|  Plt | 19.6 × 104/μL |  IgG | 1,170 mg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(861–1,747)</u> |\n|  White blood cells | 12,000 /μL |  IgA | 138 mg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(93–393)</u> |\n|   Neutriphil | 83% |  IgM | 60 mg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(50–269)</u> |\n|   Eosinophil | 0% |  IgE | 358 IU/mL 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–169)</u> |\n|   Monocyte | 8% |  Complement 3 | 99 mg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(73–138)</u> |\n|   Lymphocyte | 9% |  Complement 4 | 19 mg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(11–31)</u> |\n|   Baso | 0% |  ANA | <×80 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–159)</u> |\n| Blood chemistry |  |  MPO-ANCA | 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> (<3.5 U/mL) |\n|  Total protein | 7.5 g/dL (6.6–8.1) |  HBs Ag | 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> |\n|  Total bilirubin | 1.5 mg/dL (0.4–1.5) |  Anti-HCV Ab | 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> |\n|  Albumin | 4.1 g/dL (4.1–5.1) |  PVB19 IgM Ab | 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> |\n|  Glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase | 34 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(13–30)</u> |  β-D glucan | <6.0 (0–11.0) |\n|  Glutamic-pyruvic transaminase | 60 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(7–23)</u> |  Procalcitonin | <0.02 ng/mL (<0.05) |\n|  Lactate dehydrogenase | 174 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(124–222)</u> |  Cytomegarovirus antigenemia | 通用删除7(英):<u>(0, 0)</u> |\n|  Alkaline phosphatase | 314 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(106–322)</u> | Coagulation |  |\n|  Amylase | 44 U/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(44–132)</u> |  PT | 96% |\n|  Creatine Kinase | 200 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(59–248)</u> |  PT-INR | 1.03 |\n|  Blood urea nitrogen | 15 mg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(8–20)</u> |  APTT | 28.5 sec |\n|  Cr | 0.82 mg/dL (0.65–1.07) |  Fibrinogen | 507 mg/dL |\n|  Na | 138 mEq/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(138–145)</u> |  FDP | 9.8 μg/mL |\n|  K | 3.7 mEq/L (3.6–4.8) |  D-dimer | 6.5 μg/mL |\n|  Cl | 103 mEq/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(101–108)</u> | Urinalysis | normal |\n|  Ferritin | 53 ng/mL 通用删除7(英):<u>(50–200)</u> | Blood culture | 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> |\n\nANA = anti-nuclear antibody, APTT = activated partial thromboplastin time, FDP = fiburin/fibrinogen degradation products, HBsAg = hepatitis B virus surface antigen, HCV = hepatitis C virus, MPO-ANCA = myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, PT = prothrombin time, PVB 19 IgM Ab = Parvovirus B19 IgM antibody, sIL-2R = soluble interleukin-2 receptor.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nAbdominal plane X-ray.

BT = body temperature, CRP = C-reactive protein.</u>\n\nOwing to the recurrent nature of the febrile abdominal attack and the improvement of symptoms without antibiotics, the protracted peritonitis was presumed to be caused by FMF-mediated peritonitis. Our patient was diagnosed as having incomplete FMF because he did not have the mutations of the _MEFV_ exons that are genetic hallmarks of the disease. Treatment with canakinumab, a specific interleukin-1β monoclonal antibody (Iralis 150 mg, subcutaneous injection every four weeks), was initiated, and the recurrent and prolonged peritoneal attacks ceased immediately after the start of canakinumab. The patient was continuously treated with canakinumab (150 mg, every four weeks) without any adverse effects for 13 months and there was no FMF attack during this period.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nIn this case report, we present an unusual 7-day course of protracted peritonitis in a Japanese patient with FMF who was previously treated with colchicine therapy. His recurrent and protracted peritoneal attacks were eradicated by canakinumab treatment. FMF is an autoinflammatory disorder, common in Mediterranean populations, that is characterized by recurrent polyserositis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> In the present case, clinical, laboratory, and imaging modalities were useful in establishing the diagnosis of FMF-related peritonitis, which is aseptic, self-limiting, and usually resolves within 24 to 72 hours.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Although FMF symptoms can resemble acute abdomen or perforated viscus, surgery is contraindicated.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Only a few cases of protracted peritonitis lasting > 1 week have been reported.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> FMF usually presents as a recurrent fever-like attack associated with serosal inflammation involving the peritoneum or pleura. A nationwide FMF survey in Japan showed that 60% of patients with FMF presented with peritonitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup>\n\nFMF should be suspected in individuals with recurrent attacks of acute abdominal pain.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> FMF attacks are most often caused by peritoneal inflammation, and the severity of the presentation resembles symptoms of visceral perforation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Therefore, FMF should be considered in the differential diagnosis during emergency admission for acute abdomen.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> FMF can be confused with acute surgical abdomen resulting in inappropriate emergency exploratory surgical operations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Lidar et al reported that the frequencies of appendectomy were higher in patients with FMF than in the general population (40% vs. 12%–25%), and the rate of non-inflamed appendectomies was extremely high (80% vs. 20%).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> Other abdominal complications include peritoneal adhesions, recurrent peritonitis, peritoneal fibrosis, and encapsulating peritonitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u></a></sup> However, only a few cases of long-standing (protracted) peritoneal attacks have been reported in patients with FMF.\n\nThe severity of peritonitis attacks may differ among patients and among attacks in individual patients. FMF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, but recent studies suggest that some heterozygotes can manifest a spectrum of FMF symptoms from mild to severe.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Genotypes, including two mutations located on _MEFV_ exon 10, have been associated with a severe clinical phenotype.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> In an Arabian population, homozygosity for _MEFV_ M694 V was associated with a more severe disease phenotype of FMF.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> However, the correlation between the FMF phenotype and severity could be obscured by modifier genes and epigenetic factors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn Japan, a relatively large FMF population has no _MEFV_ exon 10 mutations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> Therefore, controversies remain, such as the role of additional genes and environmental factors in the definition of the FMF phenotype or the pathophysiology of FMF patients with _MEFV_ polymorphisms or without _MEFV_ mutations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> Indeed, no _MEFV_ mutation was found in the present case of colchicine-refractory FMF. The unexplored inflammatory pathway involved in the FMF phenotype or severity should be identified.\n\nColchicine, which can prevent recurrent fever and peritoneal inflammation, is the first-line treatment for FMF, but approximately 10% of Japanese patients with FMF are colchicine-resistant.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> In these cases, interleukin-1-inhibiting biological drugs that act on the inflammasome activation cascade could prevent the fever and long-standing recurrent peritoneal inflammation in patients with FMF.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> Canakinumab has been shown to be effective in controlling and preventing flares in patients with colchicine-resistant FMF in randomized clinical trial<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> Moreover, the effectiveness and safety of canakinumab in colchicine-resistant FMF-associated amyloid A amyloidosis was demonstrated in case series study.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> The goal of FMF treatment is the prevention of acute attacks, and second-line drugs such as canakinumab are recommended for patients with FMF who have colchicine-resistant protracted peritonitis.\n\n4 Conclusions\n-------------\n\nClinical recognition of protracted FMF-related peritonitis could prevent unnecessary interventions. A precise diagnosis and initiation of canakinumab therapy may prevent the life-threatening complications of colchicine-resistant FMF, including amyloid A amyloidosis. Awareness of unusual FMF manifestations, including protracted peritonitis, may reduce diagnostic delay and promote therapeutic interventions that can prevent long-term morbidity.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe are grateful to Ms Sachiyo Kanno for her technical assistance in this study.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Haruki Matsumoto, Tomoyuki Asano, Shuzo Sato, Makiko Yashiro-Furuya, Jumpei Temmoku, Yuya Fujita, Naoki Matsuoka, Hiroshi Watanabe, Eiji Suzuki.\n\n**Supervision:** Kiyoshi Migita.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Haruki Matsumoto, Kiyoshi Migita.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Haruki Matsumoto, Kiyoshi Migita.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:50:35", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:50:44", "cost": 9.12}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:50:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:50:34"}

He had fever and dyspnea 2 days prior to hospitalization. One day prior to admission, his dyspnea worsened. His throat swab sample for the SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was positive. His medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. His body mass index was 47.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Upon arrival at the hospital, his blood pressure was 150/107 mm Hg, heart rate was 95 bpm, and respiratory rate was 37 breaths/min with an O<sub>2</sub> saturation of 92% and a resultant oxygen requirement of 7 L using a non-rebreather mask. On admission, coagulation test results revealed high fibrinogen (758 mg/dL) and slightly elevated plasma D-dimer (1.1 μg/mL). Other coagulation test results were normal (prothrombin time: international normalized ratio, 1.03; activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 25.7 s; plasma fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, 4.6 μg/mL; plasma antithrombin (AT) III, 86%; and the AT III levels did not drop below 80% during this intensive care period without supplementation). The platelet count on admission was 184000/μL (minimum count was 172000/μL during this intensive care period without supplemental platelet transfusions). His viral load in the nasopharyngeal swab sample as determined using quantitative RT-PCR was high (5.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> copies). The clinical course during the intensive care period is shown in Figure 1.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nClinical course during the intensive care period.

The plateau pressure was 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio was 102. On the day of admission, the patient had a high serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL despite no history of renal failure and was thus suspected with acute kidney injury (AKI). Continuous renal replacement therapy was started accordingly. He was also administered nafamostat mesylate (NM), a serine protease inhibitor, at 40 mg/h to prevent clotting . NM has been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells _in vivo_<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> and has attracted attention as a treatment option for COVID-19 patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn addition to NM (40–60 mg/h), intermittent pneumatic compression boots and continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) (5000 U/day) were administered for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. The dosages of UFH and NM were adjusted while monitoring the aPTT value daily. The initial target aPTT value was to exceed at least 40 s. However, on day 4 of admission, despite the aPTT remaining in the normal range (36.7 s) with UFH 10000 U/day and NM 60 mg/h, the patient had persistent hemoptysis through the endotracheal tube. As NM has a shorter half-life, which allows adjustment of coagulation levels more frequently than UFH, we discontinued UFH and reduced NM to 40 mg/h. On day 4 in addition to NM, UFH was restarted because there was no bleeding tendency observed. On day 10, the plasma D-dimer level started to increase, suggesting early signs of embolus formation. Therefore, we carefully increased the dose of NM and UFH. Although the platelet count was maintained at 227000/μL, the use of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scoring system<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> met the criteria of 4 points (systemic inflammatory response syndrome score ≥ 3; 1 point, plasma fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products level ≥ 25 μg/mL; 3 points); thus, leading to a diagnosis of DIC on day 12. Additionally, we started recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (25600 U/d) to treat DIC. The plasma D-dimer levels decreased after initiation of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin. However, UFH had to be discontinued because of the development of anemia and subcutaneous hemorrhage on the left abdominal flank on day 16 despite the aPTT remaining in the normal rage (37.2 s). On day 17, the area of subcutaneous bleeding further expanded . Hemoglobin levels decreased from 15.2 g/dL (day 15) to 11.8 g/dL (day 18).\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nSubcutaneous bleeding on the left flank on the day 16.

On day 16, his renal function recovered and continuous renal replacement therapy was discontinued. On day 21, NM infusion was discontinued as his rehabilitation progressed and he was able to exercise his lower extremities. NM was replaced with edoxaban (60 mg), a direct oral anticoagulant, on day 22. The subcutaneous hemorrhage resolved. On day 23, he developed atrial fibrillation. His dyspnea and hypoxemia acutely worsened, and his left lower leg was swollen. Chest computed tomography showed PTE in each lung lobe branch from the bilateral main pulmonary arteries . We replaced edoxaban with rivaroxaban because the initial dose could be adjusted to be comparable to the doses recommended in Europe and the United States. The full dose of rivaroxaban (15 mg twice daily) was continued for 20 days and then tapered (20 mg once daily) because of his PTE symptoms.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nPulmonary thromboembolism.

On day 49, a follow-up computed tomography examination showed that PTE almost completely resolved except for in the right upper lobe branch. The patient was discharged on day 69 and has currently recovered without signs of coagulopathy, respiratory distress, renal failure, or heart failure. He was prescribed daily doses of 20 mg rivaroxaban, 5 mg bisoprolol, and 20 mg atorvastatin after he was discharged from the hospital.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nWe report a case of a severe COVID-19 patient who developed hemorrhagic complications during anticoagulant therapy and had PTE despite strict dose adjustments of anticoagulant. Although anticoagulant therapy is necessary in COVID-19, management with anticoagulants, especially in patients with hemorrhagic complications, can be challenging.\n\nCoagulopathy in patients with severe COVID-19 is associated with high mortality.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> The incidence of thromboembolic complications in severe COVID-19 patients is markedly higher than in non-COVID-19 patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> A recent study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to intensive care unit found a 49% cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Another study reported that despite anticoagulant therapy, COVID-19 ARDS patients had a 6.2 times higher risk of PTE than non-COVID-19 ARDS patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Although thromboembolism is common in COVID-19, hemorrhagic complications can occur at any time during the clinical course owing to thrombocytopenia, a hyperfibrinolytic state, consumption of coagulation factors, and thromboprophylactic administration of anticoagulants.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> However, bleeding complications with subsequent thromboembolic complications during anticoagulation are quite rare.\n\nThe cause of high incidence of thrombotic complications is unclear, but it may be multifactorial. Triggering factors can include excessive inflammation, cytokine storm, hypoxia, prolonged immobilization, and DIC.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> At the molecular level, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears to play a role in coagulopathy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> ACE2 is expressed in endothelial cells and protects against inflammation in non-COVID-19 subjects.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> However, ACE2 can also promote thrombosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> ACE2 is a SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor; therefore, the direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 through ACE2 may induce endothelial cell damage, which increases the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 cases. AKI occurs frequently in COVID-19<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> and increases the risk of VTE and PTE.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> However, the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related AKI remains poorly understood,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> although this may increase the risk of thrombogenesis. In contrast to the high occurrence of thrombotic events, hemorrhagic events in COVID-19 patients have only been reported in 3 retrospective studies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,19,20]</u></a></sup> In our case, the patient had complications of both thrombosis and bleeding. A COVID-19 case of spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding coinciding with massive acute deep vein thrombosis of the left iliofemoral and femoral veins has been recently reported. In that case, no anticoagulant was administered when the patient was first admitted to the hospital, but the patient required surgery owing to compartment syndrome of the left lower extremity and died postoperatively because of septic shock.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> This case and our case highlight the difficulty of administering anticoagulant treatment for hemorrhage in COVID-19.\n\nSystematic anticoagulation is recommended for hospitalized COVID-19 patients because it prevents thrombotic events and improves outcomes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> A few studies on the treatment of VTE in non-COVID-19 patients defined the target value of aPTT as 1.5 to 2.5 times (equivalent to 45–100 s).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> Meanwhile, the target value of aPTT for VTE prophylaxis in COVID-19 is yet to be established. However, considering the high rate of thromboembolic complications, anticoagulation would have to be more intensive than that used in non-COVID-19 VTE prophylaxis. In the present case, the aPTT value did not reach 40 s.\n\nUFH is the most frequently used conventional anticoagulant, as it allows clinicians to monitor clotting function and adjust the dosage easily. However, it is challenging to adjust the dose of UFH for preventing VTE in cases complicated with hemorrhage.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> According to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated for patients with active bleeding.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> In contrast, a recent report showed that major bleeding in COVID-19 is associated with therapeutic anticoagulation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> We initially administered UFH but immediately changed it to NM. NM has a shorter half-life (heparin, 3–4 h vs NM, 8 min), allowing more frequent adjustments to coagulation levels.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> In our case, however, PTE was complicated despite continuing anticoagulation after the bleeding complications occurred. Further knowledge of anticoagulation after hemorrhagic complications in COVID-19 patients is needed.\n\nThe current case report has limitations. Although we tested for coagulation function daily and adjusted the anticoagulant dosage, it is possible that the patient had an abnormality that could not be detected on the usual coagulation tests. A detailed bedside coagulation test is desirable for earlier recognition of the relevant signs and symptoms. Administering point-of-care testing of coagulation, such as thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry may also be useful in assessing coagulation abnormalities.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nWe present a case of COVID-19 with hemorrhage and PTE, which occurred during the careful use of several anticoagulant agents. This case illustrates difficulties of managing critically ill patient with COVID-19, who have a higher frequency of occurrence of thromboembolism and higher risk of hemorrhage. Anticoagulant therapy is crucial in such cases, but its management is challenging. More specific and precise anticoagulation guidance for COVID-19 cases should be developed. Point-of-care testing of coagulation may also be useful in improving the monitoring of fluctuating coagulation abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic complications.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe would like to thank www.editage.jp for English language editing.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Araki Hiroshi, Motohiro Sekino, Shogo Akabame, Hirotomo Yamanashi, Takashi Egashira, Rintaro Yano, Sojiro Matsumoto, Ayumi Fujita, Masato Tashiro, Takeshi Tanaka.\n\n**Supervision:** Koichi Izumikawa, Katsunori Yanagihara, Koya Ariyoshi, Tetsuya Hara.\n\n**Visualization:** Hiroshi Araki, Motohiro Sekino.\n\n**Writing - original draft:** Hiroshi Araki, Motohiro Sekino.\n\n**Writing – review & Editing:** Araki Hiroshi, Motohiro Sekino, Shogo Akabame, Hirotomo Yamanashi, Takashi Egashira, Rintaro Yano, Sojiro Matsumoto, Ayumi Fujita, Masato Tashiro, Takeshi Tanaka, Koichi Izumikawa, Katsunori Yanagihara, Koya Ariyoshi, Tetsuya Hara.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:18:45", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:18:56", "cost": 11.365}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:18:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:18:44"}

He was initially diagnosed with unspecified functional bowel disorder, but further analysis at follow-up revealed collagenous colitis.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 51-year-old man with no known underlying disease visited our clinic for treatment of diarrhea that had been ongoing for 2 months. The stool was light brown and watery, and bowel movement occurred 4 to 5 times per day. Diarrhea was exacerbated especially after meals. The patient did not report abdominal pain, or bloody or tarry stools. He also did not report any history of relevant travel, occupational risks, contact with other individuals, or any allergy to medication or food that may have explained his symptoms. Prior to these symptoms, he had regular stool movements once to twice per day with normal stool shape and characteristics. The patient did not report alcohol or betel nut consumption but had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years up until 3 months prior. He also took Chinese herbal medicines to maintain liver function. Family history revealed no malignancies or significant gastrointestinal tract disorders.\n\nInitially, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. We observed reflux esophagitis, chronic gastritis with _Helicobacter pylori_ infection, terminal ileum ulcers, and patchy dark blue pigmentation of the colonic mucosa  with non-specific chronic inflammatory infiltration and bacterial clump identified by histologic examination. We first treated the _Helicobacter pylori_ infection and subsequently the unspecified functional bowel disorder by medication, diet education, and lifestyle modification. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled after this initial treatment. After the 6-month follow-up visit, the patient responded poorly to our treatment. He reported the persistence of diarrhea, leading to disturbed sleep quality. Blood tests, including infection parameters and autoimmune profiles, revealed nearly normal results, except for slightly elevated serum immunoglobulin A levels. Stool examination showed no specific findings and was negative for parasitic infections. Abdominal computed tomography revealed no significant abnormalities. Therefore, we suggested that the patient stop the consumption of the Chinese herbal medicine. A second colonoscopy was performed after 10 months of treatment.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nFindings of colonoscopy (A) Round ulcerations with regular margins and peripheral erythema over the terminal ileum. (B) Uneven distribution of dark blue pigmentation over all the colon segments.</u>\n\nIn this follow-up colonoscopy, terminal ileum ulcers and patchy pigmentation of the colonic mucosa were still present. Eleven random mucosal specimens were collected from the terminal ileum and all colon segments in this colonoscopy examination. Pathological examination of the colonic biopsy revealed that the colonic mucosa had preserved crypt architecture, lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltration in the lamina propria and a thickened layer of subepithelial collagen, which was positive for Masson's trichrome staining, leading to the diagnosis of collagenous colitis . Based on this diagnosis, we not only discontinued all anti-diarrheal medicines and administered mesalamine 1600 mg twice daily, but also encouraged him to quit smoking. The patient recovered to normal bowel movements after two weeks of treatment adjustment, and no more recurrent diarrhea was noted under mesalamine use in one-year outpatient follow-up.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nHistopathological and immunohistochemical findings of colonic biopsy (A) Histopathology: Preserved pattern of crypt architecture and thickened subepithelial collagen band.

Generally, the colonic mucosa appears normal or almost normal in the colonoscopy examination of patients with collagenous colitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> The first colonic biopsy did not identify the subepithelial collagen deposition lesions. This could be attributed to the patchy distribution of histological changes associated with the lesions,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> and the differences in clinical judgement between pathologists. Moreover, the clinical manifestations of unspecified functional bowel disorders and collagenous colitis can be easily confused. Both conditions can present with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating. Therefore, tissue examination is exceptionally important for identification. However, the challenge facing endoscopists in the diagnosis of collagenous colitis is the absence of macroscopic features on colonoscopy. To improve diagnostic sensitivity, we took multiple random biopsies throughout the colon to obtain more specimen in the follow-up colonoscopy. This method is proven to be able to enhance diagnostic accuracy according to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommendations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Some autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, and Sjögren's syndrome, could also be concomitant with collagenous colitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> In our patient, no parenteral symptoms, such as fatigue, itchy rashes, ataxia, arthralgia, tachycardia and perspiration which might be seen in collagenous colitis patients,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> were observed, other than abnormal levels of serum immunoglobulin A, which has no diagnostic relevance to autoimmune diseases and collagenous colitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> It is worth noting that cigarette smoking is a well-known contributing factor for the pathogenesis of the disease, which can exacerbate watery diarrhea, and decrease the likelihood of achieving clinical remission.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u></a></sup> Therefore, the cessation of cigarette smoking accompanied with lifestyle modifications can be extremely beneficial for the clinical course of disease.\n\nFinally, in patients with symptomatic microscopic colitis, the American Gastroenterological Association recommends treatment with budesonide over mesalamine to induce clinical remission.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> We chose mesalamine instead of budesonide as the first-line treatment because the payment policy of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration regulates budesonide use only after mesalamine failure.\n\nIn conclusion, collagenous colitis is a rare etiology of chronic diarrhea, which can only be diagnosed by pathology of colonic mucosa. Consequently, repeat colonoscopy with multiple stepwise random colonic biopsies at suspicious lesion sites or even normal-appearing mucosa should be considered in refractory chronic diarrhea patients without established diagnoses.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThe authors thank the patient described for allowing us to share his details, and also thank Department of Pathology of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital to provide the pathology images of the patient.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nJiunn-Wei Wang was involved with patient assessment, examination, medication prescription, and follow-up.

Patients with a CRAO have a poor visual prognosis and 80% of patients have a visual acuity of 20/400 or worse.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Embolism is the most common cause of CRAO, the major source of this being carotid artery disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Here we report a case of CRAO, accompanied by aphasia, which was caused secondary to internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD). The patient's vision rapidly improved with anterior chamber paracentesis and antithrombotic therapy.\n\n### 1.1 Consent\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 41-year-old man noted sudden painless loss of vision in his left eye and visited the emergency ophthalmology clinic at midnight, 1 hour after symptom onset. He was a smoker, but denied any medical history. He also denied any history of trauma. His vision was 20/20 in the right eye and no light perception in the left eye. His intraocular pressure was 10 mm Hg in both eyes. The light reflex was absent in his left eye. Slit lamp examination showed no abnormal findings in the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber or lens in either eye. No cherry-red spot (ie, opacification of the retina, except in the region of the fovea, owing to retinal artery ischemia) was apparent in the left eye on dilated fundus examination. However, the superficial retina was slightly edematous and an embolus was located at the lower disc margin. During the ocular evaluation, the patient suddenly became unable to speak out loud, but he could respond to the physician's questions with nodding or shaking of his head. After 1 minute, this aphasic condition spontaneously resolved. Computed tomography of the patient's head, performed to evaluate possible intracranial diseases, revealed no evidence of cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Although fundus fluorescent angiography could not be performed at midnight in the emergency clinic, the patient was diagnosed with CRAO on the basis of the clinical manifestation and fundus image. Anterior chamber paracentesis, to decrease intraocular pressure, was conducted with a 27-gauge needle, 2 hours after disease onset. Intraocular pressure in the left eye was decreased to 2 mmHg from 10 mm Hg after the paracentesis, and the left-eye visual acuity immediately improved from no light perception to 20/200. He received 60000 units of urokinase infusion 4 hours after onset.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nColor fundus photograph of the patient's left eye at the first consultation showed a white embolus indicated by arrow in the artery below the optic disc.</u>\n\nThe next day, the visual acuity in the patient's left eye had improved to 20/20 and the arterial embolus had disappeared . Fundus fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography did not show any ischemic findings. The patient did, however, notice transient extremity weakness and abnormal sensation afterward. The patient was then referred to cardiologists and neurologists, to test for cardiogenic thrombosis or carotid artery stenosis. Echocardiography showed no obvious abnormality, such as atrial thrombus or valvular diseases. Conversely, carotid ultrasound showed a flap suggestive of ICAD and severe stenosis of the proximal left carotid artery, which suggested ICAD. Magnetic resonance imaging was then performed, the sagittal image showed a flap in the left internal carotid artery that represented crescent sign by the transverse image . The patient was then diagnosed with ICAD. He was hospitalized and treated intravenously with 10000 units of heparin for 1 week to minimize the thrombosis at the dissection site and to reduce ICAD-induced neuronal damage.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> He underwent angiography after 6 days of anticoagulation therapy, and contrast-dificient areas observed in the left internal carotid artery, which was consistent with ICAD as well . The cause of the ICAD was explored, but there was no history of trauma, and connective tissue diseases such as Ehler-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome were also negative. After 7 days of heparin treatment, carotid ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) both showed improved blood flow. Finally, the patient was started on antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel bisulfate. Neither retinal artery occlusion (RAO) nor transient ischemic attack (TIA) recurred for 1 year after onset.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nColor fundus photograph of the left eye the day after treatment of the central retinal artery occlusion began.

The prompt diagnosis and initial therapy led to a good visual acuity outcome, without severe systemic sequelae, which shows the importance of immediate systemic evaluation once a patient with CRAO is encountered.\n\nICAD is 1 of the most common causes of stroke among young adults.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> The classic triad of ICAD consists of pain in the ipsilateral neck, head and orbital regions, Horner syndrome, and cerebral or retinal ischemia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Two-thirds of patients with ICAD show ophthalmological symptoms or signs, which are frequently the first manifestations of this clinical condition.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u></a></sup> The most common visual symptom caused by ICAD is transient monocular visual loss (TMVL), and RAO is a rare manifestation of ICAD.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,6]</u></a></sup> To the best of our knowledge, there have been few case reports of CRAO associated with ICAD.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,7–14]</u></a></sup> There is no generally accepted, evidence-based therapy for CRAO,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> and most of the patients reportedly had a poor visual outcome. There have been only 2 cases with a good visual prognosis; 1 patient was treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> and the other was diagnosed ICAD just before the onset of CRAO and underwent anticoagulation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> In the present case, the embolus was dislodged by paracentesis immediately after the diagnosis of CRAO was made, so the patient is considered to have a good prognosis.\n\nRAO secondary to ICAD is usually thought to be caused by hypoperfusion in the ophthalmic artery.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4–6]</u></a></sup> However, this patient developed aphasia, seemingly because of a TIA, and fundus examination showed an obvious embolus, indicating that clot formation induced by ICAD was the causative agent in this case. However it is unlikely to have no light perception as a result of only the embolus below the optic disc, as seen on fundus examination. Although there is no obvious evidence by MRI or carotid ultrasound, 2 possible hypotheses may explain the phenomenon;\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the ocular artery proximal to the lamina cribrosa may have been clogged,\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the dissection may have spread to the origin of the ophthalmic artery that resulted in unstable blood flow to the ophthalmic artery.\n\nRetinal ischemia including TMLV, branch retinal artery occlusion and CRAO come under a spectrum of serious conditions,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> all of which need urgent systemic care. Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular morbidity is high in patients with acute retinal arterial ischemia. A 2019 report from the NASCET study showed that all the patients with TMVL had ipsilateral atheromatous internal carotid stenosis and had a high risk for recurrent TIAs or stroke, after a first presumed retinal TIA, with up to 24.2% of retinal TIA patients having a stroke within 3 years.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> The risk of recurrent stroke is particularly high within a few days after the appearance of retinal ischemic symptoms.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> These results indicate the importance of urgent systemic evaluation. Retinal ischemia is thought to be of less concern than is cerebral ischemia, and, therefore, appropriate systemic care of patients with retinal ischemia is too-often delayed.\n\nIn conclusion, when ophthalmologists encounter a patient with retinal ischemia, it is necessary not only to proceed with ophthalmological treatment, but also to perform a complete review of systems and consult with specialists, to determine the cause of the retinal ischemia and prevent recurrent stroke.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgements\n----------------\n\nWe thank the patient for granting permission to publish this information.

Here, we describe two cases of tuberculous meningitis that was diagnosed and treated early, but LETM was diagnosed late during the disease course.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\n### 2.1 Case 1\n\nA 23-year-old male patient presented two years before at an another hospital with symptoms of mild fever progressing to a high fever, accompanied by quadriplegia and difficulty in urination. Subsequently, the patient experienced an altered mental status, severe headache and vomiting. There was no past history of tuberculosis. Cytological and biochemical tests of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cultured Koch's Bacillus in liquid environment, acid-fast bacilli test (AFB) test, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Xpert MTB/RIF assay for tuberculosis in CSF specimen tested positive for tuberculosis. The sputum AFB test was negative. The patient was diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis, and treatment according to the IIIA regimen 2RHZE/10RHE (Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Streptomycin, Ethambutol) of the Vietnam Ministry of Health (Isoniazid, 2RHZE/10RHE) was started. The 2-month intensive phase included RHZE in combination with injections of Streptomycin and corticosteroids at a dose of 2 mg/kg, gradually decreasing in the first month; maintenance phase of RHE drugs lasted 10 months. The total duration of the tuberculous treatment was 12 months. The mental status of the patient turned normal, the fever alleviated, and the physical condition improved. The patient recovered from tuberculosis and the follow-up tests for tuberculosis showed negative results. However, even after 12 months following the treatment for tuberculosis, the neurological symptoms did not show recovery. The patient had complete paralysis of the lower limbs with muscle power Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 0/5 and muscle power in the upper limbs was grade 2/5. There was loss of shallow sensation and deep sensation in the spinal segment below C3 level. Upper body showed excessive sweating several times a day, and the patient also experienced constipation and urinary incontinence. He was incapable of being able to move by himself, could not sit up, take a bath, brush his teeth, eat or drink by himself.\n\nHe came to our hospital after 18 months from the onset of disease and was thoroughly examined. The patient was clinically diagnosed as quadriplegic following tuberculous meningitis. Hematological and biochemical blood tests were within normal limits. A straight-tilted chest X-ray showed normal lung parenchyma; X-ray of the spine showed normal shape of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, without vertebral collapse or spinal shrinkage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed heterogeneous signal on T2-weighted (T2W) hyperintensity and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (Flair) images, heterogeneous signal intensity in the spinal cord, unclear medullary border and an increase in D10 - D11 diameter with clear signal in the spinal edges. The MRI features were suggestive of tuberculous LETM.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nMRI images of patient 1. **A)** Diffuse sclerosis along the thoracic medulla. **B)** Fibrosis in the cerebellum and cervical medulla.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\n**A)** Hypointense T1W image, diffuse spread along cervical medulla to lumbar bulge medulla (arrow). **B)** hyperintense on T2W and FLAIR (arrow). **C)** Segment D10 - D11 with a clear hyperintensity, size 28 × 34 mm infused with contrast enhancement (arrow).</u>\n\nThe patient was examined as the Rehabilitation Department and was found to have a completely paralyzed lower limbs, severe paralysis of the upper limbs (MRC muscle scale grade 2/5) with excessive sweating disorder and sphincter disorder. He had serious issues with day-to-day functioning like he could not move by himself, could not take care of himself and had to rely completely on others for help. His therapy was focused on exercise, improving the function of both hands and sitting postures and electrical impulses to correct neurological disorders.\n\nAfter two months of rehabilitation, the muscle power of the hands improved significantly (grade 4/5) and the hand function improved. The patient could control the wheelchair, was able to sit up by himself and sit firmly on wheelchair, was able to perform daily life and personal hygiene activities. At the same time, he had no sweat disorders, improved sphincter function and better physical and mental status, but had persistent difficulty in urination. We followed him up for 2 years after the treatment. The patient tested negative for tuberculosis, the muscle power of the limbs became stable (MRC muscle power grade 4/5), and there was no recurrence of sweat disorders.\n\n### 2.2 Case 2\n\nA 20-year-old male patient presented with severe headache for a few days followed by fever, vomiting, paraplegia, altered mental status accompanied by urinary and fecal incontinence. The patient had no previous history of tuberculosis. The patient was clinically diagnosed with meningeal syndrome, paralysis of lower limbs (MRC muscle scale grade 0/5), paralysis of upper limbs (MRC muscle scale grade 2/5), sphincter disorders, sensory disorders. Cytological and biochemical tests of CSF, culture Koch's Bacillus in liquid environment, testing for AFB, PCR and Xpert MTB/ RIF tuberculosis in CSF and AFB in the sputum were positive for tuberculosis. Brain MRI image showed scattered hyperintense lesions among cerebellar peduncle and left temporal lobe. The chest computed tomography (CT) images showed the presence of numerous small nodular opacities measuring 1 to 3 mm in diameter scattered throughout both the lungs. He was diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis meningitis, was treated with IIIA regimen including 2RHZE/10RHE according to the Vietnam Ministry of Health guidelines. The 2-month intensive phase included RHZE in combination with Streptomycin injection and corticosteroids at a dose of 2 mg/kg that was gradually decreased during the first month. The patient was actively treated according to the anti-tuberculous regimen for tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis, and the acute phase was stabilized. After 3 months of anti-tuberculous therapy, the patient was admitted to Department of Rehabilitation. At this time, the patient still had urinary and fecal incontinence, generalized hyperhidrosis and physical debilitation. MRC muscle power grading of upper and lower limbs was 0/5. The patient showed decreased shallow sensation and deep sensation in hands, decreased shallow sensation and deep sensation in the spinal segment below D7- D8 level, decreased muscle tone. The patient had affected mobility and movement function and could not sit up independently and move from the bed to the wheelchair. He could not do personal hygiene activities such as washing, brushing, eating and taking care of himself. He was unable to do housework and could not take part in normal activities with family members. Rating scale on KATZ index was 3 points. We did a clinical neurological examination, identified the patient with thoracic injury in D7-D8 segment and performed thoracic spine MRI scans. The MRI displayed hyperintensities on T2W and FLAIR images, a slight increase in the spinal diameter and unclear heterogeneous signal along the medullary border . The clinical and imaging features were suggestive of tuberculous LETM.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\n**A)** CT scan image showing miliary tuberculosis of lung parenchyma. **B)** MRI image of the thoracic spine showing diffuse inflammatory changes along the medulla.</u>\n\nExercises focusing on the lower limbs, hand therapy activities, electric pulse to correct neurological disorders were performed for 3 months. During this period, the patient was still on anti-tuberculosis drugs, enhanced nourishment and body support drugs. The anti-tuberculous regimen for the patient was stopped after 12 months of treatment according to the Vietnam Ministry of Health guidelines.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> The patient was under continuous rehabilitation therapy at his house for almost 15 months. At the end of 15 months, the patient tested negative for tuberculosis, muscle power of the upper limbs was grade 3/5 (MRC muscle scale) and the lower limbs was grade 0/5 (MRC muscle scale).\n\n### 2.3 Discussion\n\nIn the present study, we reported two cases with LETM combined with tuberculous meningitis in Vietnam. Both cases showed positive TB-PCR in the CSF and one patient had co-existing miliary TB. Furthermore, they also showed some degree of clinical response to anti-tuberculous drugs and corticosteroid therapy. Hence, we hypothesize a tubercular etiology for LETM in our cases. However, LETM can be caused by demyelinating disorders, autoimmune and connective tissue disorders, vascular, neoplastic or paraneoplastic etiologies,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> which should also be considered.\n\nThere are 8.7 million cases of tuberculosis estimated annually worldwide and CNS tuberculosis accounts for 1%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Spinal injuries caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ presents as various lesions with tuberculous spondylitis being the most common (60%), followed by arachnoiditis (20%), meningitis (12%) and spinal cord injury (8%).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Tuberculosis meningitis is reported to be the most common form of intracranial manifestation. The clinical features of spinal cord tuberculosis are similar to those of the spinal cord tumor. Dastur and Wadia have described the mechanisms of spinal parenchymatous involvement in tuberculous: bone marrow edema might be caused by venous obstruction due to the development of increased intracranial pressure; ischemia occurs due to post-thrombotic occlusion of the meningeal vessels; infarction in the spinal cord is associated with embolism; formation of intramedullary tuberculomas with pericentral necrosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,9]</u></a></sup> Occurrence of spinal cord tuberculosis is relatively rare.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe two cases reported here have similar characteristics including a history of good health, presentation of acute symptoms such as fever, headache, altered mental status, complete paralysis of the legs and partial paralysis of the hands. However, the second case showed miliary tuberculosis with more acute and severe symptoms. The main symptom in the first case was paralysis, which first affected the legs and slightly affected the hands, then became more severe after 8 months (an increase from grade 4/5 to 2/5 on the MRC scale). Both cases were correctly diagnosed and treated for tuberculous meningitis using a combination of 5 antituberculous drugs and corticosteroids. The maintenance phase included 3 drugs with the total therapy lasting up to 10 months. However, both the patients were diagnosed with meningitis early, but LETM was diagnosed late. After 18 months of treatment (in the first case) and 5 months (in the second case) of follow-up, both patients were stable and tested negative for tuberculosis. However, both patients showed no signs of recovering from lower-limb paralysis (degree of paralysis 0/5), but upper limbs showed better recovery.\n\nIn a previous study, a 16-year-old- Indian male patient was diagnosed as PTB associated with LETM and paraplegia (MRC muscle scale grade 3/5). MRI of spine showed slight lesions in the form of inflammation, mild spinal cord edema from C7 to D7. Treatment of tuberculosis followed 4 drug regimen - isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol; Solu-Medrol combination intravenous infusion 1gm/day for 3 days; oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks. After 1 month of therapy, neurological deficits improved significantly, and complete recovery was observed after 3 months on MRI of spine.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> In China, Zhang et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u> reported two cases with LETM with pulmonary tuberculosis. The first case was a 20-year-old woman with a history of PTB, paralysis of lower limbs (MRC muscle scale grade 3/5), numbness and pain in the limbs. MRI images of the spinal cord of the cervical and thoracic segment showed hyperintensity on T2W and FLAIR images extending from C3 to D8 and was diagnosed as tuberculous myelitis. Treatment included methylprednisolone 500 mg/ 3days with half-dose maintenance for the next 3 days, in addition to gamma globulin and anti-tuberculous drugs. Good clinical results including improvement in muscle strength, improvement in the Expanded Disability Status Scale from 6.5 to 0 points were observed; MRI of the spinal cord showed recovery after 12 months of follow-up. The second patient was a 21-year-old female with a history of untreated PTB, numbness from chest to lower limbs, and quadriplegia (MRC muscle scale grade 4/5). MRI images of the cervical and thoracic spines showed diffuse hyperintensity extending from C3 to D11 on T2W, FLAIR and hypointense on T1W images. After 3 months of combined anti-tuberculous drug treatment with corticosteroid therapy, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score decreased from 0 to 4.5.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Our two cases are similar to the described cases from China and India – afflicting young adults (<30 years), presenting with paraplegia, and LEMT findings on MRI spine images. However, both our cases included paralysis of upper limbs with meningitis also. Thus, our two cases had more severe clinical features, with diffuse lesions of the CNS from the meninges to the spinal cord. Treatment for tuberculosis showed improvement in resolving symptoms of meningitis but neurological symptoms (quadriplegia) showed little improvement, especially in the lower limbs with complete paralysis and persistence of autonomic nervous disorders and sphincter disorders. Cases reported worldwide had better neurological recovery which is possibly due to the absence of associated meningitis. Also some reported cases showed that the dose of corticosteroids (Solu-medrol) used was very high, from 500 mg to 1000 mg in the first 3 days.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,5,9,10,12]</u></a></sup> The two cases in our study were treated according to the guidelines for tuberculous meningitis from Vietnam Ministry of Health which recommends using a much lower dose (2 mg/kg, specifically Solu-medrol 100 mg) in the first 5 days.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> This may be one of the main causes for the poor recovery of paralysis of the lower limbs. It is challenging to diagnose tuberculous spinal sord injury in patients with tuberculous meningitis, as these patients present with early-stage altered mental status.\n\nIn a 2013 study, Tuli et al. summarized the published data of spinal tuberculosis from 1959 to 2011. It was reported that if the diagnosis was made at an early stage prior to bone destruction and was treated with standard drugs, the infection would resolve in about 95% patients. However despite standard treatment, approximately 8% of tuberculous paraplegics do not recover functionally, which might be due to immunodeficient status and drug resistance.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Furthermore, the bacilli in spinal tuberculosis is suggested to be in a dormant stage and replicate slowly when compared to the large number of the bacillary population in pulmonary tuberculosis which shows rapid multiplication. Since antitubercular drugs are most effective against the rapidly multiplying bacterial population and dormant bacilli have a tendency to be viable despite chemotherapy, skeletal and spinal tuberculosis require a longer duration of drug therapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> On the other hand, in Vietnam, the detection of paralysis due to destruction of spinal cord tuberculosis is observed as compression of the medulla. This may be the reason why pulmonary specialists neglect local neurological lesions such as transverse myelitis.\n\nThere are some limitations in our study. There is lack of information about the physical examination and imaging findings at the onset of the disease for the first case because the patient underwent treatment at a different hospital. Therefore, we could not compare the pre-treatment and post-treatment outcomes. Furthermore, due to non-availability of MRI equipment in our hospital, we could not observe the post-treatment changes on MRI. We did not perform additional tests to exclude the other etiologies for LETM such as autoimmune infections or demyelinating disorders. However, both our cases showed positive TB-PCR in the CSF and good clinical response to anti-tuberculous drugs and corticosteroid therapy suggesting a tubercular etiology for LETM in our cases.\n\n3 Conclusion\n------------\n\nSpinal inflammation associated with tuberculous meningitis due to _M tuberculosis_ is very rare and presents with severe clinical features. Based on our experience with the two cases, and literature review, we suggest that if a patient with a history of/ or active tuberculosis has clinical manifestations of lower limb paralysis or quadriplegic paralysis, it is necessary to perform an MRI of the spine to determine co-existing transverse myelitis lesions. In terms of treatment, the anti-tuberculosis regimen must be followed, and consideration should be given to the early treatment with high dose corticosteroid therapy to help in CNS recovery.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nNVT discover patients’ unique clinical characteristics, found correct diagnosis, designed the study, drafted and revised the manuscript.

Introduction\n----------------\n\nBy the end of 2019, a coronavirus outbreak was observed first in Wuhan City, rapidly spreading to almost all the metropolises of China and most cities in the world. As of late August 2021, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has affected 216 million people and caused 3.9 million deaths worldwide.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Although real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is usually used as the “golden standard” to diagnose COVID-19, chest computed tomography (CT), with its advantages of sensitivity, cannot be ignored when early diagnosis, disease extent evaluation and follow-up monitoring is needed.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup>\n\nPatients with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) generally present with emphysema lesions in the upper zone and fibrosis in the lower zone, displaying a syndrome of dyspnea, cough, and recurrent exacerbations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Thick-walled cystic lesions are considered a significant pathological feature of CPFE and are associated with emphysematous impairment, membranous enlargement, and fibrotic respiratory bron-chioles.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Clinically, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, and lung cancer are typical complications of this disease, triggering an inefficient prognosis. In addition, CPFE occurs predominantly in male smokers, with an impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide identified by pulmonary function testing.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> To our knowledge, preexistent CPFE is rarely reported in patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia, and typical radiological findings have not yet been reported. This paper reports the clinical data of a patient with preexisting CPFE, affected by COVID-19, who presented with unusual radiological findings on a CT scan.\n\n2\\. Case report\n---------------\n\nA 44-year-old Chinese man with a medical history of CPFE was admitted to the emergency room due to headache, fever, dyspnea, and dull chest pain. The patient was a heavy smoker (>2 packs per day) with 15 years history of smoking. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with CPFE and had stopped smoking. On clinical examination, he reported dyspnea on exertion and cough combined with basal crackles and finger clubbing. Although pulmonary function tests were limited because of the coronavirus pandemic, CT imaging revealed upper lobe emphysema and lower lobe interstitial fibrosis, which is a typical radiological appearance of CPFE. The patient was recognized as having been in close contact with a COVID-19 patient on a family journey. He presented with fever (up to 37.8°C). After physical cooling, his body temperature dropped to the average level, without dizziness, cough, expectoration, night sweats, convulsions, palpitation, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or other discomfort. Blood tests revealed elevated white blood cell counts, elevated lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (10.40%), reduced lymphocyte counts (0.92\\*10^9/L), and elevated C-reactive protein (9.56 mg/L). Serum gamma-glutamyl transferase levels raised to 127.50 U/L, with abnormal urinary protein. Four reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, pulmonary fibrosis tests for COVID-19 were positive. The patient’s chest CT scan showed typical characteristics of COVID-19 infection, with scattered mixed ground-glass nodules and small ground-glass opacities in the lower and posterior parts of the posterior segment of the left upper lobes . We infer that CPFE leads to changes in the lung structure, including alveoli, respiratory membrane, and microcirculation, as well as changes in the distribution of airflow, thus resulting in different virus concentrations in the thoracic cavity and leading to atypical CT features compared to normal COVID-19 infection. After treatment with antiviral therapy (ritonavir tablets twice daily, Xiyanping injection, and oral delivery of Keke capsule), we observed that nodules near the hilar side of the lung shrank at 7th day and nearly disappeared after 15 days. The patient was discharged on the 28th day. At 10th day after discharge, no infectious lesions were found in the left upper lobe on CT scan .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nChest CT scan showed the changes in the lesions of the patient with COVID-19 infection. The lesion was located at the lower and posterior part of the posterior segment of the left upper lobe, with scattered mixed ground-glass nodules and small ground glass lesions (arrow) (A). After 7 days of treatment, only 5 × 5 mm small nodules near the hilar side of the lung were seen (arrow) (B). After 15 days of treatment, the lesions disappeared (C). At the 10th day after discharge, no infectious lesion was found in the left upper lobe.</u>\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nChest CT plays an essential role in improving the diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 pneumonia as a conventional, noninvasive imaging modality with high accuracy and speed. Based on available data published in the recent literature, CT features of ground-glass opacities, vascular enlargement, inter-lobular septal thickening, and subpleural bands were the most common findings in the lung, where the lesions presented with peripheral distribution in the lower lobes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> The disease may progress rapidly and even result in death when patients with preexisting pulmonary diseases, including emphysema, pulmonary sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and COPD, were exposed to COVID-19. Chest CT findings presented unusual characteristics in these conditions, providing important clues for prognosis and medical management.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup>\n\nCPFE has seldom been reported in COVID-19 patients. CPFE, first described by Cottin , is a rare condition recognized as a separate disease that has attracted attention due to worsening respiratory symptoms, declining lung function, and high mortality. The accurate diagnosis of CPFE is overwhelmed by its similar presentations to other respiratory diseases. There are several explanations for this pathogenesis. Cottin et al argued that fibrosis in the basal lobe places pressure on the uppe lobes, triggering the development of emphysema. Thus, emphysema appears before fibrotic changes occur in the lungs due to increased gastropharyngeal reflux.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup><sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\nPreexistent illnesses have been reported to impact the outcome of COVID-19. In this case, we found that the imaging manifestations were inconsistent with the symptoms, where the absorption of lesions was delayed and pulmonary function was more likely to be damaged. Although the patient’s symptoms were relieved after the standard treatment, the length of hospital stay (28 days) was prolonged compared to that in normal infected patients (14 ddays)<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> Mazzolini et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> described a case of preexistent emphysema in a COVID-19 patient with chest high-resolution computed tomography showing increasing basal nonspecific ground glass opacities with a sign of loss of volume and traction bronchiectasis. The impact of comorbidity factors on the prognosis of COVID-19 was also explored in a meta-analysis, which showed that COPD and respiratory system diseases were significantly associated with disease severity.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Chest CT scans have the advantage of identifying CPFE and its complications, usually presenting as linear air collections contiguous to the bronchovascular sheaths.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> However, to date, few cases of CPFE patients infected by COVID-19 have been reported.\n\n4\\. Conclusions\n---------------\n\nIn this paper, we present the clinical characteristics and CT image findings of a patient with preexisting CPFE infected by COVID-19, revealing atypical radiological features during disease progression with changes in lung structure and function. This case report sheds light on how COVID-19 affects outcomes in terms of length of hospital stay and potential response to the standard treatment in a patient with preexisting CPFE.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Yong Chen.\n\n**Data curation:** Wei Zhang, Yonghui Li, Xiong Wei.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Yonghui Li.\n\n**Funding acquisition:** Yong Chen.\n\n**Methodology:** Wei Zhang.\n\n**Project administration:** Xiong Wei.\n\n**Supervision:** Xiong Wei.\n\n**Visualization:** Xiong Wei.\n\n**Writing - original draft:** Wei Zhang, Yonghui Li.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:39:13", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:43:48", "cost": 274.343}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:43:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:39:12"}

The treatment of hemobilia depends on the source and severity of the bleeding and mainly includes supportive treatment, endoscopy, interventional therapy, or surgical intervention.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nReports on rupture and hemorrhage of saccular artery pseudoaneurysms caused by long-term inflammatory infection are rare, and the corresponding clinical manifestations and disease progression are poorly understood; hence, nursing measures need to be taken. Therefore, it is important for nurses to closely observe the patient’s condition and communicate with doctors in a timely manner to ensure accurate treatment. Vital signs such as blood pressure and body temperature should be closely monitored because of the potential risk of shock due to infection and bleeding. Exercise care of the extremities is necessary for bedridden patients at risk for thrombosis, and psychological care is necessary because of the patient’s fear of the disease and uncertainty about the prognosis.\n\nThis article reports a rare case of cystic artery pseudoaneurysm with rupture and bleeding caused by a long-term infection, emphasizing the importance of nursing measures.\n\n2\\. Case Presentation\n---------------------\n\nA 50-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department because of intermittent pain in the right upper abdomen lasting for a month that became worse for one day. Physical examination revealed signs of peritoneal irritation (tenderness, rebound tenderness, abdominal muscle tension) and unstable vital signs (body temperature, 38.0°C, blood pressure, 144/92 mm Hg; heart rate of 68/min, respiratory rate, 17/min). Computerized tomography (CT) with enhancement showed hematoma in and around the duodenum, intestines, and the surrounding areas (ruptured cystic artery pseudoaneurysm could not be ruled out), enlarged gallbladder with thick walls, and suppurative cholecystitis without cholelithiasis. The patient’s pain had progressively worsened. The peri-duodenal hematoma suggested hemorrhage, the elevated temperature suggested infection, and serum cholinesterase value of 4338 U/L (normal range: 4620–11,500 U/L) indicated liver dysfunction. The patient was admitted to the Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery with a diagnosis of a ruptured bleeding cystic artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient had a history of hypertension for 3 years, smoking for 30 years, alcohol consumption for 20 years, and artificial blood vessel replacement because of bilateral thigh trauma.\n\nWhen the patient was 20 years old, he had conflicts with his family and had not been in contact with them for many years. At the time of symptom onset, he had no relatives, friends, or financial support. After being informed of the diagnosis and treatment plan, celiac angiography  and arterial embolization were performed. The main and left branches of the cystic artery were embolized for hemostasis with a spring coil and gelatin sponge under local anesthesia. No obvious blood flow was observed, indicating successful embolization. Whole abdominal CT showed changes in the duodenum and inferior curvature with limited anterior effusion and partial small bowel dilatation, including liquid and gas. After the procedure, the catheter was removed, and the puncture port was compressed locally for 15 minutes to stop bleeding. The patient returned to the ward with a compression bandage. There was no bleeding at the puncture point 8 hours after the right femoral artery compression hemostatic device was removed.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nCeliac angiography. (A) Celiac angiography before surgery shows cystic artery and its branch vessels with several protrusions at a diameter of 0.3–0.4 cm. (B) Celiac angiography after cholecystectomy shows a blocked cystic artery.</u>\n\nConsidering that the patient had a history of artificial blood vessel replacement and smoking, which are risk factors for thrombosis, color Doppler ultrasound examination for both lower extremity venous and right femoral arteries was performed to clarify whether there was any lower limb thrombosis. Although no obvious thrombosis was found, considering that the patient had undergone artificial blood vessel replacement, the Autar deep vein thrombosis scale was used to evaluate the patient’s risk of thrombosis, with a score of 12 points indicating moderate risk. Therefore, he was instructed to perform intermittent ankle dorsiflexion to prevent thrombosis. Because of the possibility of necrosis and perforation after gall bladder artery embolization, changes in the condition were closely observed, and symptomatic treatments were provided in time.\n\nOn the 2nd day of admission, the patient had a hemorrhage in the gall bladder cavity and pain and distension of the right upper abdomen. A whole abdominal plain scan and enhanced CT showed that the gallbladder was enlarged and thickened, the gallbladder wall was seen in the arterial phase with multiple arterial shadows, 2 localized small protruding shadows, and patchy high-density shadows in the gall bladder cavity, suggesting bleeding. There was no enhancement, and rupture of the pseudoaneurysm of the gallbladder artery was suspected. Ultrasound-guided gall bladder puncture and drainage were performed and 90 mL dark red hemorrhage was drained within 1 hour of puncture, which turned into brown bile. Bacterial culture of the drainage fluid was positive for _Escherichia coli_ and _Enterococcus faecium_.\n\nOn the 3rd day of admission, 350 mL brown gallbladder puncture was drained. The patient complained of abdominal distension without bowel movements in the early morning, and bowel sounds were reduced on auscultation. Emergency CT examination of the abdomen showed limited fluid accumulation in the duodenum and in front of the lower curvature, and partial small intestine dilation, fluid accumulation, and gas accumulation . Based on the opinions of gastrointestinal medicine and surgery, water fasting, acid suppression, fluid replacement, anti-inflammatory treatment, laxative enema, and gastrointestinal decompression were performed.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2.:\n\n(A) Enhanced CT of the abdomen shows intestine obstruction (white arrow: gas accumulation and liquid-gas plane, suggesting intestinal obstruction; red arrow: peripheral exudation, suggesting inflammation); (B) head CT shows cerebral infarction (red arrow: infarct site). CT = computerized tomography.</u>\n\nOn the 4th day of admission, 250 mL dark brown gallbladder puncture drainage fluid and 1800 mL gastric drainage fluid were drained. The patient reported bowel movement, and abdominal distension was partly relieved. The body temperature increased to 38.0°C, and bowel sounds were weak on auscultation. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen showed partial intestinal flatulence and fluid accumulation. Simethicone was administered via gastric injection to relieve the intestinal obstruction.\n\nLaboratory examination showed C-reactive protein 409.11 mg/L, procalcitonin 3.64 ng/mL, neutrophil percentage 83%, and lymphocyte percentage 6%, which indicated severe infection. After consultation with the Department of Clinical Pharmacy, 1 g meropenem was administered intravenously (IV) every 8 hours; routine blood tests, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein levels were monitored. Water fasting, fluid replacement, anti-inflammatory, and acid suppression treatments were continued.\n\nOn the 7th day of admission, the patient complained of dyspnea and suspected that someone wanted to harm him. Risperidone 1 mg was administered orally once daily to control the delirium. The conditions were closely monitored, and protective restraints, electrolyte balance maintenance, nutritional support, and medication administration were performed. In terms of dietary care, the patient was encouraged to eat more high-protein, easily digestible, low-fat foods and abide by the principle of small, frequent meals. The main concerns at this time included: ① CT showed severe cholecystitis and surrounding hematoma; ② gall bladder blood drainage indicating rupture and bleeding of the cystic artery pseudoaneurysm; ③ CT showed small intestinal dilation and fluid and gas accumulation, indicating intestinal obstruction; ④ CT showed sporadic inflammation in both lungs, bilateral pleural effusion, and passive atelectasis in the lower lobes of both lungs. The patient experienced the after-effects of prolonged bed rest, lack of activity, and weak cough due to abdominal pain, which made it difficult to expel sputum, resulting in pneumonia. Anti-infection treatment, phlegm suppression, and breath training were performed to enhance lung function.\n\nTo prevent the infection from worsening, cholecystectomy was performed and 3 indwelling abdominal drainage tubes were placed. Then the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with body temperature 36.5°C, heart rate 118/min, blood pressure 145/85 mm Hg, respiratory 22/min, peripheral blood oxygen saturation 99%. A small amount of light red abdominal drainage fluid was drained, the drainage tube was kept unobstructed, the nature and quantity of drainage fluid were observed, and active anti-infective treatment was maintained. Abdominal CT suggested that a part of the small intestine had local adhesions, causing abdominal symptoms and signs. Urine volume decreased; hence, fluid replacement and creatinine monitoring were performed for acute kidney injury.\n\nOn the 8th day of admission, the patient’s general condition was poor, and the highest body temperature was up to 39.4°C. The abdomen was swollen and tender to touch with rebound pain. The abdominal drainage tube resulted in a small amount of cloudy yellow fluid. The patient was diagnosed with lung pneumonia, urinary tract infection, abdominal infection, hypoproteinemia, left median elbow vein thrombosis, and right cephalic vein thrombosis. Anti-infection, albumin supplementation, nutritional support, organ function protection, anticoagulation therapy, and support symptomatic treatment were administered, and changes in the condition were closely monitored.\n\nOn the 10th day of admission, abdominal distension and rebound pain persisted, high skin temperature around the drainage tube was noted, a small amount of turbid yellow abdominal drainage fluid was drained, and weak bowel sounds were heard, suggesting that the infection was still present. CT examination showed scattered inflammation in the left lingual lobe and lower lobes of the lung, accompanied by passive atelectasis in the lower lobes of the lung. Water fasting, fluid replacement, anti-infection treatment, phlegm, and acid suppression treatments were continued. Changes in abdominal signs were closely observed.\n\nOn the 16th day of admission, the abdominal distension improved. Intermittent laxative enema was performed, the drainage tube was kept unobstructed, the amount and nature of drainage were observed, IV nutrition and antibiotics were administered, and a stable internal environment was maintained.\n\nOn the 18th day of admission, a small amount of yellow abdominal fluid was drained. The patient was transferred from the intensive care unit to the general ward and turned over every 2 hours. Skin care was strictly performed to keep the dressing clean.\n\nOn the 20th day of admission, he was discharged on foot because his vital signs were stable. The patient expresses his gratitude to the medical staff. He recovered well and took care of himself when followed-up by telephone once a month for half a year.\n\n3\\. Nursing Care\n----------------\n\n### 3\\. 1. For patient’s psychological care\n\nOur nurses 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> communicated and comforted the patient, met his needs as much as possible, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> kept the ward environment relatively quiet, avoided unnecessary walking, reduced the stay time in the ward, and did not explain the contents of the delusion to him; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> did not talk in a low voice in front of the patient, so as not to cause the patient’s suspicion; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> listened to the patient’s opinions patiently when he was in a stable mood; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> put all the food together and let him choose first to reduce his worries.\n\n### 3\\. 2. Care for patient’s lung infection\n\nThe sputum culture results were positive for _E coli_, so a pulmonary care program was implemented, including: ① close monitoring of vital signs to observe changes in the condition; ② instructing rest to reduce oxygen consumption; ③ providing food with sufficient calories, protein, and vitamins; encouraging drinking of more water to dilute sputum; ④ encouraging rinsing of mouths after meals, providing oral care twice a day to prevent oral infection; ⑤ maintaining continuous low-flow oxygen through nasal cannula, flow 1 to 2 mL/min; ⑥ instructing breathing training such as pursed-lip breathing and abdominal breathing to enhance the muscle strength and endurance of the ventilator and improve respiratory function.\n\n### 3\\. 3. Care for patient’s bleeding\n\nBleeding is a common complication in hepatobiliary surgery. To prevent and control bleeding, ① dynamically observed the changes in the patient’s vital signs, especially body temperature; ② kept the drainage tube unobstructed and properly fixed; ③ closely observed the amount, character, and color of the drainage fluid; ④ instructed the patient to lie in a semi-recumbent position, avoid severe coughing and sneezing to prevent postoperative bleeding, and ⑤ provided strengthened nutritional support and antibiotics.\n\n### 3\\. 4. Care for patient’s nutrition\n\nDuring fasting and gastrointestinal decompression, energy, amino acids, vitamins, water, and electrolytes were supplemented with parenteral nutrition to maintain the nutritional status of the patient. When the patient could eat independently, high-protein, easily digestible, low-fat food was provided under the guidance of a professional nutritionist, following the principle of eating less frequently. High-quality foods are mainly derived from chicken, fish, lean meat, milk, soy products, fresh fruits, and vegetables.\n\n### 3\\. 5. Care for patient’s thrombus\n\nDuring nursing, nurses closely observed the skin color, swelling, temperature, arterial pulsation, and sensory movement. Anticoagulation therapy was administered under the guidance of a doctor. The patient was instructed to stay in bed, raise the affected limb, and actively perform rehabilitation training, such as joint activities.\n\n### 3\\. 6. Care for patient’s liver dysfunction\n\nFor liver dysfunction, doctors’ instructions were followed, such as administering liver-protective medicine, limiting the intake of high-fat foods and fatty emulsions in IV fluids, using antibiotics, and avoiding medicines that can cause liver injury.\n\n### 3\\. 7. Care for patient’s paralytic intestinal obstruction\n\nFor paralytic intestinal obstruction, a low semi-recumbent position was followed to reduce abdominal muscle tension and help breathing. Gastrointestinal decompression and osmotic laxatives were administered to relieve pain and abdominal distension, and nutritional support and anti-inflammatory treatment combined with traditional Chinese medicine treatment were provided to enhance treatment confidence. Additionally, the patient’s condition and comfort were closely monitored during care.\n\n### 3\\. 8. Care for patient’s septic shock\n\nNursing care for shock includes the establishment of venous access, replenishment of blood volume, and close monitoring of blood pressure. Anti-infection and vasoactive drugs were administered according to the patient’s condition, and arterial blood gas monitoring was performed. The changes in the patient’s body temperature and blood pressure are shown in Figure 3.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3.:\n\nPatient’s general condition measured in morning.

Discussion\n--------------\n\nThis article reports a case of ruptured and bleeding cystic artery pseudoaneurysm caused by a long-term inflammatory infection, and there is limited knowledge about the treatment and nursing measures. Owing to the lack of specific clinical manifestations, it is difficult to deeply understand the clinical care of cystic artery pseudoaneurysms. The rupture of a cystic artery pseudoaneurysm can induce fatal bleeding and other serious complications; therefore, it is important to take care of the patient accurately, carefully, and in a timely manner. The patient reported here, recovered, and was discharged from the hospital after close monitoring, treatment, and nursing care by a multidisciplinary team. The development of the disease process is shown in Figure 5.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 5.:\n\nDiagram of the development mechanism of the patient’s disease process (bold font denotes the focus of care).</u>\n\n### 4\\. 1. Psychological care\n\nDelusions of persecution occurred during hospitalization. The possible reasons included: ① septic shock due to severe infection caused ischemia and hypoxia of the microcirculation in brain, inducing psychoneurological symptoms; ② the developing cerebral infarction  would leave some sequelae, such as anxiety, depression, emotional restlessness, auditory hallucinations, irritability, suspiciousness, sensitivity, selfishness, pessimistic disappointment, paranoia and stubbornness and sleep disturbance; ③ the patient had left home for more than 20 years without family members and friends around him and lived on odd jobs in different place without a fixed income, which made him a weird personality; ④ the patient had been drinking for 20 years, the occasional visual and auditory hallucinations (that there was the Monkey King on the wall of the ward, a cat rushed out from under the bed, and someone was secretly talking about him behind his back) were considered symptoms of alcohol withdrawal; ⑤ the patient was administered central venous catheterization due to thrombosis in the left median cubital vein and right cephalic vein, after comprehensive consideration; the inferior venous catheter was closer to the patient’s body, which aggravated the patient’s delusion of persecution.\n\nCoupled with the cause of the primary disease, psychological care of the patient after admission is particularly important. During the patient’s hospitalization, the primary disease was actively treated first, and care was provided according to the symptoms and signs of the disease. At the same time, psychological care was considered very important. All medical staff in the department took care of him, helped him adapt to the hospital environment, made him fully trust the medical staff, reduced his sense of helplessness, and enhanced his confidence in overcoming his disease. Rodin et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> reported that psychosocial intervention can alleviate and prevent death-related depression, anxiety, and pain, and enhance the meaning of the end of life and the effectiveness of preparations. Xiao et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> reported that continuous psychological care can effectively reduce anxiety and depression in patients with brain tumors and their families. Effective psychological care could improve the confidence of patients and their families in the medical staff and ensure the smooth development of nursing work.\n\n### 4\\. 2. Nursing for paralytic intestinal obstruction\n\nParalytic intestinal obstruction, a common complication of surgical trauma, prolongs the length of stay and increases the cost of hospitalization.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In the United States, the impact of paralytic intestinal obstruction is estimated to be between 750 million and 1 billion US dollars.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> For example, for colorectal surgery and small bowel resection, reducing the length of hospital stay by 1 or 2 days can save a lot of money.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> It can also affect the patient’s quality of life.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\n### 4\\. 3. Nursing care for septic shock\n\nSeptic shock, a common type of shock in clinical practice, refers to a shock caused by pathogenic microorganisms (such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi). Shock is attributed to problems with the nervous system response to damage, changes in the vasomotor system of the circulation, or lack of blood.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe patient’s cystic artery pseudoaneurysm ruptured and hemorrhaged due to long-term inflammation and infection, bacterial toxins, and inflammatory factors caused vasodilation,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> and further resulted in septic shock. Although systolic blood pressure was within the normal range, the pulse pressure difference increased, which is a feature of septic shock.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nWith the development of shock, the brain tissue can be severely damaged due to ischemia, hypoxia, insufficient energy supply, and accumulation of acidic metabolites删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> and can induce apathy, coma, and other brain dysfunction.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> After the symptoms of septic shock occurred in this patient, he developed persecution delusions, attacked medical staff, did not cooperate with treatment, and exhibited other neuropsychiatric symptoms.\n\n### 4\\. 4. Nursing care for thrombus\n\nThe patient developed a thrombus in the left median cubital vein and right forearm cephalic vein owing to long-term immobilization. Patients with venous thromboembolism are at risk for serious long-term sequelae, including post-thrombotic syndrome, recurrent deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary hypertension.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> During nursing, clinical nurses closely observed color, swelling, temperature, arterial pulsation, and sensory movement. The assessment was used to develop a daily care plan, and blood vessel color ultrasound was reviewed every 2 days. The patient was instructed to stay in bed, raise the affected limb, and actively cooperate with the functional rehabilitation training. Considering that the patient was undergoing a relatively serious major surgery, no anticoagulants or elastic stockings were used.\n\n### 4\\. 5. Nursing care for pulmonary status\n\nProlonged immobilization and bed rest can affect the respiratory system.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>17</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Respiratory complications included decreased ventilation, atelectasis, and pneumonia. Timely collection and proper handling of sputum specimens can facilitate the identification of pathogens. In this case, the sputum culture results were positive for _E coli_. For respiratory infections, the leading causes of death include respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and sepsis删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>; therefore, monitoring patients’ respiratory status changes and organ system dysfunction is an important aspect of care.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Regular, progressive, and out-of-bed activities result in enhanced recovery and reduced length of stay. This results in a reduced hospitalization time compared to that in usual care patients and is not associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Twice-weekly pulmonary rehabilitation under medical supervision can enhance exercise capacity and improve health-related quality of life.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>21</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\n### 4\\. 6. Nursing for nutritional care\n\nNutritional care is an important aspect of nursing. In this field, eating and drinking are traditionally perceived as physical need.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>22</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Strengthening the nutritional care of patients can reduce the occurrence of postoperative infection and other complications, improve immunity, and be conducive to the recovery of patients. Evaluation of the nutritional index was performed using nutritional risk screening (NRS2002). Medicines are mainly used for acid suppression, gastric mucosal protection, promotion of gastrointestinal motility, and increased gastric motility.\n\n### 4\\. 7. Nursing for liver injury\n\nThe most important step for liver injury is to identify and treat the underlying cause. Routine assessment includes measuring and recording daily weight, abdominal girth, and intake and output; monitoring serum glucose and electrolytes, as well as serum albumin, transferrin, and prealbumin levels; and monitoring the patient for possible occult bleeding.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>23</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Nursing care of patients with liver injury includes vital sign monitoring, particularly supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate, insertion of a peripheral IV line, and monitoring of mental status, skin color and temperature, and stool characteristics.\n\n### 4\\. 8. Nursing quality supervision and feedback\n\nFor critical and difficult issues in patient care, each shift was systematically assessed and handed over. The development of the patient’s condition was regularly checked and shared in real time, and feedback about the implementation of nursing measures and the patient were provided to promote continuous improvement of nursing quality. A disease report meeting around the patient was held once a week to introduce the disease report and progress assessment of the disease and to discuss any problems encountered by the nurse in charge and solutions. A nursing brainstorming meeting was conducted to help nurses master their ability to discuss and analyze difficult nursing problems and independently learn and deal with practical clinical problems.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\n5\\. Limitation\n--------------\n\nRupture and bleeding of cystic artery pseudoaneurysms caused by long-term infection are relatively rare in clinical practice, and nursing articles for such diseases are rarely reported. This article presents a rare case study. The existing nursing measures require further evidence-based support. In future, more samples and literature reports are needed to further improve the treatment and care of the disease and to guide the development of unified standard treatment and nursing care measures that have potential benefits for patient care.\n\nThrough the joint efforts of doctors and nurses, the patient with rupture and bleeding of a cystic artery pseudoaneurysm was successfully treated and discharged. During the nursing process, attention should be paid to observing the patient’s condition and implementing personalized care to improve their quality of life.\n\nFor cystic artery pseudoaneurysm, in the process of treatment and nursing, it is necessary to focus on the patient’s abdominal pain, bleeding, high fever, and infection; enhance the patient’s nutrition and body’s resistance; closely monitor postoperative bleeding and drainage tubes; and prevent postoperative complications such as thrombosis, septic shock, and paralytic ileus.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nChangshuai Wang and Dan Yi made substantial contributions to the conception and design, acquisition of data, and analysis and interpretation of the data.

Introduction\n----------------\n\nFood bolus impaction and foreign body ingestion are common problems encountered by gastroenterologists. However, small bowel obstruction is uncommon. In particular, the duodenum is a rare site of gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Most foreign bodies and food boluses tend to affect the upper GI tract, especially in anatomically narrow sites of the GI tract, such as the upper esophageal sphincter, lower esophageal sphincter, and pylorus. Cases of obstruction have been reported in the ileocecal valve, an anatomic narrowing site of the lower GI tract.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>2–4</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nSurgical intervention to remove the obstruction is indicated. Herein, we present a rare case of duodenal obstruction caused by an ingested mushroom that mimicked a tumor. The patient was successfully treated by removing the obstruction via endoscopy, rather than surgery.\n\n2\\. Case report\n---------------\n\nA 70-year-old man with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic constipation presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of postprandial vomiting. The patient also had decreased appetite and recent tarry stools. He also reported a 3 kg weight loss within the last fortnight. The patient denied undergoing abdominal surgery. The patient’s vital signs were stable. Physical examination of the abdomen revealed a soft and slightly distended contour without tenderness or a palpable mass. Bowel sounds were normal. Laboratory tests showed impaired renal function with a creatinine level of 1.56 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 44.22 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.\n\nNon-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a heterogeneous tumor-like lesion in the second portion of the duodenum, with prominent dilation of the stomach and proximal duodenum. The radiographic presentation was suggestive of duodenal obstruction, with a transitional zone in the third portion of the duodenum . Initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed multiple shallow gastric ulcers and severe erosive esophagitis; however, the duodenal lesion site could not be accessed because of residual food boluses in the stomach and duodenum. The patient underwent conservative treatment with nasogastric tube decompression, intravenous fluid supplementation, and proton pump inhibitor administration. The patient stopped vomiting, and the tarry stool resolved after medical treatment. However, the abdominal fullness with anorexia persisted.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nAxial view of the non-contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography. White star (\\*) shows a distended stomach. Red arrow shows an air- and fat-containing mass-like lesion in the second portion of the duodenum.</u>\n\nTo obtain more information on the obstructive lesion, contrast-enhanced CT was performed, which revealed resolution of the gastric distention, but a non-enhanced heterogeneous mass in the second and third portions of the duodenum persisted . The angle between the superior mesenteric artery and the abdominal aorta appeared normal . Hence, superior mesenteric artery syndrome is considered less likely. Repeated EGD on day 8 of hospitalization showed a slightly movable, round, yellowish mass obstructed in the distal part of the second portion of the duodenum . Therefore, food bolus impaction was suspected. Access to deep locations is challenging. Push enteroscopy was performed the following day. The impacted food bolus was successfully removed using a snare . The food bolus was composed of fragmented shiitake mushrooms and vegetables stained with bile. There were no tumors or other structural lesions (e.g. diverticulum, web, stenosis) in the duodenum. Following the removal of the obstruction, the patient’s abdominal fullness subsided, and his appetite returned. The patient was discharged on the following day.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2.:\n\n(A and B) Axial and coronal views of contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography after conservative treatment.

Such cases are rare, with delayed onset of symptoms, and the obstruction is usually radiotransparent on plain film.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> A CT scan is indicated for defining the impaction site and the causes. In our case, contrast-enhanced CT revealed an irregular mosaic low-attenuation mass lesion impacted in the second to third portion of the duodenum, which resembled mushrooms, and easily absorbed consumed oils, gas, and intestinal contents.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Hence, the possibility of malignancy was excluded.\n\nThe risk factors for food bolus impaction include high fiber intake, absent or inefficient mastication, anatomical alterations or structural lesions (e.g. history of abdominal surgery, peptic ulcers, and tumors), and GI motility disorders (e.g. diabetic neuropathy, gastroparesis, hypothyroidism, and drug-induced).删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Our patient had poor oral hygiene and dental problems, so he swallowed food without adequate chewing. The shiitake mushroom (xiang-gu in Chinese) he consumed were fiber-rich and difficult to ingest without chewing.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The indigested mushroom pieces may have squeezed together into a bolus in the duodenum and block the lumen due to insufficient intestinal motility.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that surgical management is required in most patients with food bolus impaction related to small intestine obstruction, especially in those with severe obstructive symptoms, acute abdominal distension, or where the obstruction cannot be accessed endoscopy.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>5–9</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Only a few patients have undergone successful treatment via endoscopy.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In our patient, the duodenal food bolus was not accessible during the initial EGD. However, it was successfully retrieved via subsequent enteroscopy. With the development of new endoscopic techniques, extensive applications of enteroscopy, including transluminal endoscopic treatment, have become non-invasive treatment options for patients with food bolus impaction in the small bowel.\n\nIn conclusion, contrast-enhanced CT is a practical examination for differentiating intraluminal food bolus from intestinal malignancy in patients with obstruction of the small intestine. Enteroscopy is a suitable modality for duodenal food bolus retrieval owing to its accessibility, efficacy, and safety.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe thank the patient for consenting to the publication of this case report.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nJiunn-Wei Wang and Wen-Hung Hsu managed the patient, including the assessment, examination, medication prescription, and follow-up.

Introduction\n----------------\n\nDiarrheal disease or more commonly, diarrhea, is a major waterborne disease that creates a high burden of mortality and morbidity in populations worldwide,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1-3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> particularly in Lowand Middle-Income Countries. On a global level, the prevalence of diarrhea decreased by 4.45% between 1990 and 2017, and only 1.53% of new cases of diarrhea were reduced.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>4,5</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> According to a World Health Organization report, in 2017, diarrhea is the 9th leading cause of death, it is responsible for more than 1.6 million deaths,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>6,7</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> mostly in children under the age of 5 years.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Based on the pattern of causes of death among children, diarrhea is a third leading cause of death after pneumonia and preterm birth complications, responsible for 1 in 10 child deaths occurring around the world.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7-9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However, this global distribution of diarrhea-related mortality varies geographically, the majority of deaths attributable to diarrhea occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5-7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nDespite the presence of diarrhea in all regions and populations, the emergence of diarrhoeal diseases is associated with places that are less environmentally friendly and poor healthcare access.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>7,9,10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Due to this, diarrhea has continued to be a major public health problem in developing countries up till now. It has been estimated that 56% to 72% of all diarrhoeal deaths occurred in Low-and Middle-Income Countries could be attributed to environmental factors, such as inadequate drinking water, sanitation, and hand hygiene.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9,11-15</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> As a result, applying Geographic Information Systems (GIS)删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>16,17</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> and spatial analysis tools删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>16,17</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> can be used to enhance understanding in the distribution of diarrhea over space and time, geographic risk factors, promoted to support public health interventions and policymakers for strategic planning to control the prevalence of diarrhea and intensified use of existing diarrhea control tools. Also, to assess and understand the impact of interventions employed in diarrhea.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nFlowchart of study selection.</u>\n\nGIS and spatial evaluation tools have been used vastly in the investigation of diarrhoeal diseases,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>15,18-34</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> but it is unclear to what extent they have been applied to investigate the epidemiology of diarrhea. Furthermore, spatial evaluation tools depend upon the type of data available, the analysis methods employed, and the way of interpretation. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no review has collectively analyzed and summarized the application of GIS and spatial methodologies in diarrhea. Thus, this systematic review will summarize the range and depth of published spatial and GIS approaches in diarrhea-related research studies. This will inform and help program implementers in planning to reduce and control diarrhea diseases and also provide a road map to guide researchers.\n\n2\\. Methods\n-----------\n\n### _2.1. Study design_\n\nThe proposed study protocol conforms to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>35,36</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> (please see Guidelines checklist). The development and reporting of this systematic review will be based on the framework outlined in PRISMA guidelines.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>37</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In addition, Figure 1 shows the proposed framework of the record selection process as per the PRISMA guidelines. The systematic review protocol has been registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) \\[**CRD42021292523**\\].\n\n### _2.2. Research question_\n\nThis systematic review aims to answer the following question: as yet, what spatial methodologies and approaches are employed to investigate or evaluate the epidemiology of diarrhea?\n\n### _2.3. Inclusion criteria_\n\nPeer-reviewed studies will be selected according to the following criteria: study outcomes and study design and analysis employed on outcomes of interest.\n\n### _2.4. Outcomes_\n\nThe assessment of spatial methodologies and approaches in diarrhea studies is the focus of this review. Therefore, the exploration of spatial statistical analysis techniques employed in diarrhea studies is the broad outcome domain of interest. The exploration of spatial analysis techniques will include spatial data collection, presentation, and interpretation regards to diarrhea epidemiology. Furthermore, narratives that explore the current status of diarrhea research on the application of GIS and spatial analysis will be considered.\n\n### _2.5. Types of studies_\n\nPeer-reviewed articles investigating the epidemiology of diarrhea by incorporating spatial methodologies and approaches in the study design and analysis, which focused on any diarrhea-related topics, including diarrhea burden or epidemiology, diarrheaspecific mortality, diarrhea risk factors, and implementation of diarrhea prevention or treatment services, will be included. In this review, review articles (including literature reviews), editorials, expert’s opinions, letters, and conference papers, will be excluded. Our search will not be restricted to any date or geographical context of study but, it will only focus on studies published in the English language.\n\n### _2.6. Participants_\n\nThis review will not be restricted by any participant or population of a study.\n\n### _2.7. Information sources and search strategy_\n\nThe design, development, and implementation of the systematic search strategy will be conducted by the research team with the assistance of a librarian from Dilla University. The systematic search strategy is based on the following 3 concepts joined by the Boolean operators, diarrhea, spatial analysis, and geographic information systems. The example of search strategy, representing a complete search in PubMed, is presented in Table 1. The search strategy will be adjusted for each database as appropriate. Furthermore, the developed search strategy will be reviewed using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>38</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nTable 1 - Search strategy for PubMed.\n\n| **1**  | **Diarrhea**  | **“ diarrhea” \\[all fields\\] OR “diarrhoea” \\[all fields\\]**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2  | Geographic Information Systems  | “Geographic Information Systems” \\[all fields\\] OR “GIS” \\[all fields\\] OR “Geographic Information System” \\[all fields\\] OR “Global Positioning Systems”\\[all fields\\] OR “Global Positioning System”\\[all fields\\]  |\n| 3  | Spatial analysis  | “Spatial Analysis”\\[all fields\\] OR “Spatial Analyses”\\[all fields\\] OR “Spatial Dependency”\\[all fields\\] OR “Spatial Dependencies”\\[all fields\\] OR “Kriging”\\[all fields\\] OR “Spatial Autocorrelation”\\[all fields\\] OR “Geocoding”\\[all fields\\] OR “Georeferencing”\\[all fields\\] OR “Point Pattern”\\[all fields\\] OR “Geographic Mapping”\\[all fields\\] OR “Spatiotemporal Analysis”\\[all fields\\] OR “Spatio-temporal Analyses”\\[all fields\\] OR “Spatiotemporal Analysis”\\[all fields\\] OR “Spatiotemporal Analyses”\\[all fields\\] OR “spatial clustering”\\[all fields\\] OR “spatial clusterings”\\[all fields\\] OR “spatial cluster”\\[all fields\\] OR “spatial clusters”\\[all fields\\] OR “spatial modeling”\\[all fields\\] OR “spatial pattern”\\[all fields\\] OR “spatial statistics”\\[all fields\\] OR “space-time clusters”\\[all fields\\] OR “space-time clustering”\\[all fields\\] OR “spatial epidemiology”\\[all fields\\]  |\n|  | Final 1  | **AND 2 OR 3**  |\n\nThis systematic search of information will consist of 3 main parts and sources. At first, a web-based search will be conducted on electronic academic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Open Access Journals and Google Scholar. In the second part, additional published studies will be identified by screening the references list of the articles included in the review. Finally, grey literature will be searched to minimize publication bias within the systematic literature review. The databases to be searched for grey literature include OpenGrey and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (the UK and International).\n\n### _2.8. Screening and data collection_\n\n#### _2.8.1. Initial screening._\n\nThe title and abstracts retrieved from the search results will be imported into Endnote and results of the defined databases will be combined and screened for duplicates. Articles to be included will be screened by 2 independent reviewers, based on the inclusion criteria described. Any disagreements between the 2 reviewers will be resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer.\n\n#### _2.8.2. Second screening._\n\nThe selected articles will be retrieved in full text for further screening based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria to be included in the review. A standardized checklist of eligibility criteria will be used to decide on inclusion. Two reviewers will undertake the screening and any study which does not meet the inclusion criteria will be removed. Cohen’s kappa will be calculated to ensure inter-rater agreement and consistency in the selection of studies to be included. In case of disagreement, consensus will be reached through discussion with the third and fourth reviewers. Excluded studies and the reasons for their rejection will be documented. Furthermore, a PRISMA flow chart showing details of studies included and excluded at each stage of the study selection process will be provided.\n\n#### _2.8.3. Data extraction._\n\nData will be extracted from included studies in the review independently by the 2 reviewers, using a standardized extraction sheet to record the study characteristics of included articles. The information will include details of the study design, data source, study population, setting, period, spatial analysis techniques, software used, outcome measures, results, and quality appraisal. The content of the 2 summary tables will then be aggregated and checked for the equivalence of information extracted by both investigators.\n\n### _2.9. Data assessment and synthesis_\n\n#### _2.9.1. Quality assessment._\n\nThe overall quality of articles or risk of bias assessment will be undertaken by 2 reviewers working independently, discrepancies in the quality assessment will be resolved through discussion or third-party adjudication. The methodological quality of included primary articles will be assessed using standard critical appraisal instruments of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI-MAStARI) evaluation framework as appropriate.\n\n#### _2.9.2. Data synthesis._\n\nFindings will be synthesized by using narrative synthesis and tables of evidence for all studies included in this systematic review. A grounded and inductive thematic summary of spatial analysis approaches will be provided (e.g. visualization (mapping), exploration, or statistical modeling. Furthermore, a recommendation on future research scopes in the selected studies will be provided and elaborated if appropriate\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nThe proposed systematic review aims to map the evidence on applications of GIS and spatial analysis tools in diarrhea studies. We anticipate that this systematic review will provide an insight into the applications of spatial techniques in the geographic distribution of diarrhea, associated risk factors, and also prevention and treatment studies related to diarrhea. This may contribute to an evidence-based interventional process for policymakers and program implementers to enhance diarrhearelated interventions. Furthermore, it may provide a blueprint and also reveal further research areas into the application of GIS and spatial approaches to diarrhoeal diseases. In this regard, implications for future studies will be discussed.\n\nHowever, the proposed systematic review has some potential limitations. There may be a language bias as we will only include studies published in English, which means some relevant studies in other languages could be missed. Further strengths and limitations of our systematic review method on the credibility of the results will be detailed.\n\n删除3：<u>4\\.

Introduction\n----------------\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new viral infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was described in China Wuhan City, China, in December 2019 and spread rapidly to other regions around the world, forming an epidemic with unimaginable consequences. The first records of COVID-19 from the Wuhan area showed significant differences in outcomes between pediatric patients and adults. In children, the mortality rate is <1%, whereas in the elderly, it is more than 5%. Furthermore, several underlying diseases contributed to worse results.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> At the beginning of the epidemic, children were believed to be immune to COVID-19, while it is now known that children can be infected with the virus, and fewer children suffer from the consequences associated with the coronavirus than adults.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Children account for approximately 1 to 5% of all cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and 80% of them have mild infection or are asymptomatic删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> On March 11, 2020, in light of its rapid global spread, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified the disease as a pandemic.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Despite the fact that children suffer from milder forms of COVID-19, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been described as a probable complication of coronavirus infection.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In a study of adults in Wuhan, neurological features were found in 36.4% of coronavirus patients, including dizziness, stroke, headache, and seizures, and neurological manifestations were generally found in severe cases. Therefore, the presence of neurological features may indicate higher morbidity and viral load.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In a study of 171 children, no neurological features were recorded, while an Italian study found only headaches in 4–28% of affected patients.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>Furthermore, in a meta-analysis of 28 studies on 199 affected children with COVID-19, the neurological features were found in 9.2%, and were neurocognitive symptoms, including lethargy, asthenia, irritability, somnolence, headache, hypotonia, upward rolling of the eyes, muscle pain, leg pain.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Nevertheless, the incidence of neurological manifestations has increased to 34% in children with MIS-C.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nFinally, Schiff et al noted that 1 infant presented with a bulging anterior fontanelle without other symptoms or signs, with negative results in all investigations.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> So, We report a case of a COVID-19–positive 6-month-old girl who presented with bulging anterior fontanelle, without fever or other manifestations.\n\n2\\. Case report\n---------------\n\nA 6-month-old girl presented to the pediatric emergency center on January 28, 2022, with a 1-day history of excessive crying and irritability and maternal concerns of bulging anterior fontanel. She did not have any other symptoms such as fever, poor feeding, vomiting, cough, nasal congestion, rapid breathing, diarrhea, history of trauma, or skin rash. She had a history of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection 3 days prior, when screening was performed for contact tracing. The infant did not have any risk factors for COVID-19. The perinatal history was uneventful. Her weight, length, and head circumference were age-appropriate; she was on formula feeding.\n\nAt the time of presentation to the emergency center, the patient’s temperature was 37.4 °C rectally, heart rate was 138 beats per minute, blood pressure was 88/53 mm Hg, respiratory rate was 38 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air.\n\nPhysical examination revealed a fussy but consolable infant with pulsatile bulging of the anterior fontanelle. Pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, and abdominal examinations were normal, and there was no evidence of acute otitis media on otoscopic examination.\n\nLaboratory investigations were as follows: COVID-19 PCR was positive, cycle threshold was 15, complete blood count was normal at 10.1 × 10<sup>3</sup> white blood cells (wbcs)/μL (normal 6–16 × 10<sup>3</sup> WBC/μL) with 86.6% lymphocytes, and C-reactive protein level of 1 mg/dl (normal 0–5 mg/L). The respiratory virus PCR panel was negative. The urinalysis results were negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrite. Lumbar puncture was performed and the cerebral spinal fluid was clear, colorless with 1 RBC/uL (normal 0–2 RBC/uL), 2 WBC/uL (normal 0–5 WBC/uL), glucose of 3.8 mmol/L (serum glucose of 5.5 mmol/L), and protein of 0.24 gr/L (normal 0.15–0.45 gm/L), gram stain showed no organism.\n\nThe patient was treated empirically with intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone), which were discontinued after negative culture results of CSF, urine, and blood.\n\nBrain ultrasonography performed prior to lumbar puncture showed that the supratentorial ventricular system was compact. No intraparenchymal, intraventricular, caudothalamic, or subependymal hemorrhages were observed. Midline structures, including the corpus callosum, were unremarkable. The posterior fossa structures visualized were normal on gross examination. No intra- or extraaxial fluid collections were observed. Consequently, his impression of the neurosonogram was unremarkable.\n\nThe patient was discharged from the emergency center with outpatient follow-up. At the time of discharge, she had reassuring vital signs, normal physical examination, and no bulging fontanelle, with improvement in her fussiness.\n\nOn follow-up after 1 week, she underwent a normal physical examination, and no clinical symptoms were reported. 删除6：<u>(The full investigation results are provided in Appendix tab1)</u>.\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nCOVID-19 may spread to the central nervous system (CNS) through hematogenous or retrograde transmission and has neurotropic potency, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses and SARS-CoV, as well as other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, human herpes virus (HHV)-6 and -7, coxsackie, and echovirus. Autopsy reports have found edema in the medulla oblongata with microscopic proof of neuronal degeneration in this part of the brain stem, which may explain the respiratory depression observed in infected patients删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Indirect proof of neurotropism with consequent neuronal and astrocytic injury is through studies that demonstrated increased serum levels of biomarkers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament (nFL). nFL is indicative of neuronal injury, whereas GFAP is a marker of glial activation删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> More significantly, the replicability of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro was demonstrated in intestinal, pulmonary, hepatic, neuronal, and renal tissues.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Confirmation of hematogenous dissemination was obtained from electron microscopic studies that noted particles of the COVID-19 virus in the endothelial cells of capillaries in the brain.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Retrograde axonal dissemination mainly through the olfactory bulb has been suggested as another probable mechanism to expound the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to the CNS. Trials in mice have shown that intranasal infection with COVID-19 can cause disturbance of the nasal epithelium and subsequent neuroinvasion,删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> and anosmia in infected patients may also extend the belief to this notion of neuroinvasion through olfactory cells, the only part of the CNS not covered by the dura mater. Retrograde spread via the corneal and buccal epithelium via cranial nerve V or through other cranial nerves has also been suggested via the tongue through cranial nerves VII, IX, and X to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, thalamus, and cortex.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Furthermore, to the above suggested mechanisms, the neurologic effects of COVID-19 may also be linked to release of inflammatory factors that can result from systemic viremia. These inflammatory agents may cause a small breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and as a result, peripheral cytokines may reach the CNS, which can excite or increase neuroinflammation.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>17</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In children, this mechanism may be of special significance as a systemic inflammatory or autoinflammatory reaction with multi-organ dysfunction.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> So the neurological features of COVID-19 may result from endotheliopathy, either through the direct invasion of endothelial cells into the vasculature of the BBB or through an immune reaction that causes swelling or inflammation of these cells.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In the majority of reported cases in children, the CSF was acellular with a negative culture of covid-19. While RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF was positive in rare cases of encephalitis in adults, no such cases have been reported in pediatric patients.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>21</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe differential diagnosis for bulging anterior fontanelles is extensive. It includes meningitis, hydrocephalus, intracranial hemorrhage, masses, and trauma. In addition, several respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses, including Roseola infantum, otitis media, and postvaccination status.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>22</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nWe present an interesting narration of Covid-19 in infant, where few studies have been conducted. A bulging fontanelle in an infant with normal universal assessment is considered benign intracranial hypertension. However, to our knowledge, there has been 1 previously reported case of an infant with SARS-CoV-2 infection who presented with a bulging fontanelle. 删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> According to the fact that many cases of benign intracranial hypertension of infancy have been caused by viral etiology, we suspect SARS-CoV-2 to be the etiology in our patient. This case demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can have a novel presentation in infants. The rapid spread and severity of COVID-19 require the identification of all possible clinical features to help identify possible sources and prevent transmission. Therefore, we suggest considering the COVID-19 test as part of the assessment of infants who present to the emergency center with a bulging anterior fontanelle.\n\nTable 1 - Laboratory and Radiological findings.\n\n| Investigations | Value | Normal reference range |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Blood | Blood | Blood |\n|  WBC | 10.1 × 103 WBC/µL | 6–16 × 103 WBC/µL |\n|  Hb | 13.8 gm/dL | 11.1–14.1 gm/dL |\n|  Platelets | 380 × 103Plat/µL | 200–550 × 103 Plat/µL |\n|  CRP | 1 mg/L | 0–5 mg/L |\n|  Neutrophils | 800 WBC/µL | 1000–7000 WBC/µL |\n|  Lymphocytes | 8.7 × 103 WBC/µL | 3.5-11 × 103 WBC/µL |\n|  Blood culture | No growth | No growth |\n|  Blood glucose | 5.5 mmol/L | 3.5–5.5 mmol/L |\n| CSF | CSF | CSF |\n|  Color | Colorless | Colorless |\n|  Appearance | Clear | Clear |\n|  WBC | 2WBC/µL | 0–5 WBC/µL |\n|  RBC | 1RBC/µL | 0–2 RBC/µL |\n|  Glucose | 3.8 mmol/L | 60–80% of blood glucose |\n|  Protein | 0.24 gm/L | 0.15–0.45 gm/L |\n|  Gram stain | No organism seen | No organism seen |\n|  Culture | No growth | No growth |\n|  Virology studies | Negative | Negative |\n| Urine | Urine | Urine |\n|  WBC | 5–7WBC/µL | 0–9 WBC/µL |\n|  RBC | 1–3RBC/µL | 0–5 RBC/µL |\n|  Urine culture | No growth | No growth |\n| COVID-19 PCR | Positive | Negative |\n| CT Value | 15 |  |\n|  Respiratory viruses PCR | Negative | Negative |\n|  Brain ultrasound | Unremarkable neurosonogram | Unremarkable neurosonogram |\n\nCOVID-19 = Coronavirus disease 2019, CRP = C-reactive protein, CSF = cerebrospinal fluid, CT = cycle Threshold, Hb = Hemoglobin, PCR = polymerase chain reaction, RBC = red blood cells, WBC = White blood cells.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe acknowledge the Medical Research Center at Hamad Medical Corporation, Habeba Elemam, Weasm Eldib, and Jana Mahmoud Helal for their support.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nAll authors have approved the manuscript for publication.\n\nConceptualization: MA, MAOH.\n\nData curation: MAOH, SA, MA, FH, MB.\n\nDefinition of intellectual content: MAOH, MA, SA, MA.\n\nDesign: MA, MAOH.\n\nInvestigation & Methodology: MAOH, MA, SA, MA.\n\nLiterature search: MA, MAOH.\n\nManuscript preparation: MA, MAOH, MB.\n\nManuscript review and approval: MA, MAOH.\n\nProject administration: MAOH.\n\nResources, supervision, validation: MA, FH.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:34:25", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:34:37", "cost": 12.417}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:34:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:34:24"}

The frequency of patients undergoing TKA continues to increase with population aging and prolonged life expectancy. The various age groups of patients who underwent TKA were as follows: 60 to 69 years, 36.2%; 70 to 79 years, 48.6%, and ≥80 years, 8.7%.\n\nAs of 2016, the number of claims for health insurance benefits related to TKA was >56 billion in Korea.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Although the outcomes of TKA are usually good, not all patients gain complete relief from discomfort after surgery. TKA can cause severe postoperative pain, muscle weakness, articular reduction, and disability, which can last for a considerable duration.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup>\n\nChuna Manual Treatment (CMT) is a traditional Korean treatment for structural or functional problems by the application of effective stimulation to the patient's body using hands or body parts, or other assistive devices, such as weights or tables.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> The evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of CMT has been established, and a health insurance benefit policy has been already introduced. Although various conservative treatment modalities are practiced for degenerative knee arthritis in Korea,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6,7,8]</u></a></sup> the role of CMT in terms of systematic rehabilitation following TKA has not been explored. No clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of CMT in reducing pain after knee surgery. Therefore, we aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of CMT in terms of pain and functional improvements after TKA.\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\n### 2.1 Study design\n\nThis study will be conducted as an assessor-blinded, randomized, single-center, parallel-arm clinical trial. Fifty patients with knee pain who underwent TKA within the last 3 months will be recruited and randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive either the standard treatment (group A) or a combination of both the standard and CMT (group B) twice weekly for 4 weeks. There will be two follow-up visits at 8 and 12 weeks. A schematic flow of the study is presented in Figure 1. This research adheres to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nThe schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments.</u>\n\n### 2.2 Participants\n\n#### 2.2.1 Recruitment\n\nThis study will be conducted at a single center, Catholic Kwandong University International St. Mary's Hospital. Recruitment will be performed using on/offline bulletin boards. The protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Catholic Kwandong University International St. Mary's Hospital (IS18ENSI0064).\n\n#### 2.2.2 Eligibility criteria\n\n**Inclusion criteria**\n\n*   1) Patients who had undergone TKA within the last 3 months\n*   2) Patients who had knee pain \\[numeric rating scale (NRS) score of >4\\] after undergoing TKA (for patients with bilateral surgery, if at least one NRS score is ≥4)\n*   3) Patients aged ≥60 years with no cognitive impairment\n*   4) Patients who can express his/her own opinion and can provide consent\n\n**Exclusion criteria**\n\n*   1) Patients with certain serious diseases that can cause knee pain, such as malignant tumors, inflammatory diseases, infections, etc.\n*   2) Those who have taken analgesics for alleviating pain, fever, and inflammation within the last 7 days\n*   3) Those with progressive neurological deficiencies or severe neurological symptoms\n*   4) If the investigator identifies other chronic diseases that may interfere with the interpretation of the therapeutic effects of the interventions used in this trial\n*   5) If the investigator feels it is unsafe/inappropriate to administer CMT\n*   6) Patients participating in other clinical trials simultaneously or those who had participated in another clinical trial within a month\n*   7) Patients who are unwilling to provide consent\n*   8) If there is difficulty to participate in clinical trials as determined by the researcher\n\n#### 2.2.3 Randomization and masking\n\nFifty eligible participants will undergo a 7-day run-in period prior to randomization. The participants will be randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive either the standard treatment (group A) or a combination of both the standard and CMT (group B). Web-based block randomization will be facilitated by SongHeon R&D Co. Ltd. (a contract research organization). If the web-based allocation system does not work, the manual method will be followed according to the random code already generated and documented.\n\nSince it is impossible to blind the CMT practitioner and the patient, only the independent outcome assessor will be blinded. After completion of the treatment, outcome evaluation will be performed independently.\n\n### 2.3 Sample size\n\nThe sample size was calculated using G∗Power 3.1.9.2. Since there is no data on the effect of CMT on knee pain, a previous study that evaluated aroma massage in patients with knee osteoarthritis was referred to for the sample size calculation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe mean difference in the Korean version of The Western Ontario and McMaster Univer-sities Osteoarthritis Index (K-WOMAC) total score after aroma massage and general massage for 2 weeks was 6.34. We considered an effect size (mean difference in the K-WOMAC total score) of 3.60. Considering the significance level (two-sided α) of 5% and power (1−β) of 80%, the sample size was 22 in each arm. Considering a 10% drop-out, the final total sample size was 50 (25 in each arm).\n\n### 2.4 Interventions\n\n#### 2.4.1 CMT\n\nThe CMT physicians must be registered in Korean Medicine (specialist in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of Korean Medicine) with >1 year of clinical experience, should have completed the 126-h CMT workshop, and should have a thorough understanding of the study protocol. Through expert consensus, three mandatory and two selective CMT techniques are to be employed in this study Each physician will carefully examine the patients’ conditions and then select the appropriate treatment based on the manual of final selected CMT techniques .\n\nTable 1 - Description of the Chuna Manual Technique.\n\n| Mandatory Techniques |\n| --- |\n| _Iliopsoas fascial Chuna_ |\n| The patient lies in the supine position at the caudal end of the Chuna table with the proximal part of the thighs touching the Chuna table (finding and muscle tenderness points, flexing the patient's knees, grasping the knee, bending the hip joint, abduction, external rotation / or internal rotation, and finding a posture where tenderness is markedly reduced or disappeared). |\n| The physician extends the patient's ipsilateral leg to check the restriction barrier of the iliopsoas muscle/fascia and then backs up to the midrange. The patient is instructed to inhale and hold the breath, and implement isometric contraction in the direction of hip flexion using the iliopsoas muscle/fascia (with 20% of maximum force), while the physician applies resistance of the same force. The physician instructs the patient to exhale after 6−7 s of releasing the force, and then repeat three to four times. |\n| _Sidelying lumbar flexion dysfunction correction technique_ |\n| The patient lies on a side with the rotated side of the vertebra facing down. The physician stands in a fencing stance facing the patient. The main hand contacts the patient's ilium with the forearm of the caudal hand and corrects with a sudden short force directed anterio-superiorly. The supporting hand contacts the patient's axillary area with the forearm of the cephalad hand and maintains the patient's torso in a rotated position |\n| _Prone iliac posterior rotation/sacral sidebending dysfunction correction technique_ |\n| The patient lies relaxed in a straight prone position on the treatment table. The physician stands on the contralateral side. The main hand contacts the ipsilateral posterior superior iliac spine with the heel of the cephalad hand of the posterior rotation dysfunctional ilium (posterior inferior ilium). The supporting hand contacts the contralateral ischial tuberosity using the metacarpophalangeal joint of the second finger of the caudal hand. |\n| Selective techniques |\n| _Hamstring relaxation strengthen technique_ |\n| The patient lies relaxed in a straight prone position on the treatment table. The affected foot is lowered under the table and the knee is flexed, thereby making the hip joint extended and slightly abducted. The physician faces the side of the patient and finds the tenderness point. The physician reduces the sensitivity of the tenderness points by knee flexion and patellar adduction. |\n| _Hip joint mobilization technique_ |\n| The patient lies relaxed in a straight prone position on the treatment table. The physician stands on the side of the affected foot. The physician flexes the ankle and knee joint of the patient by 90 degrees, places the affected knee on the doctor's inner shoulder, and holds the anterior thigh with both hands. The physician then drops down the thigh for joint mobilization. The patient's knee is hung over the physician's neck, and the physician snaps the patient's inner thigh with both hands. The physician finally applies a lateral traction force to the thigh for joint mobilization. |\n\n#### 2.4.2 Standard care\n\nThe standard care includes physiotherapy, postoperative TKA care, pharmacotherapy, and patient education. Physiotherapy consists of meridian muscle interferential current electricity (or meridian transcutaneous electricity) and a hot pack (or infrared lamp). The following drugs will be administered for controlling pain and preventing gastrointestinal complications: celecoxib 200 mg (Celebrex capsule 200 mg, Pfizer Inc. NY), esomeprazole 20 mg (Esomezol capsule 20 mg, Hanmi Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea), and oxycodone hydrochloride 5 mg (Oxycodone tablet 5 mg, Hana Pharm, Seoul, Korea). Physicians will prescribe the drugs for 28 days. At the end of the last treatment visit (V10), patients will be provided with drugs for 8 weeks of follow-up.\n\n### 2.5 Withdrawal and dropouts\n\nSubjects may withdraw their consent to participate in this study for any reason without penalty. If the subject expresses an intention to withdraw consent, the site principal investigator may clarify the reason for disqualification and withdraw the patient from the study. The principal investigator may also terminate any patient for protocol violation(s). Any withdrawal/dropout should be documented in the case report form.\n\n### 2.6 Outcome\n\n#### 2.6.1 Primary outcome\n\nThe mean change in the K-WOMAC score between the two groups at 4 weeks.\n\n#### 2.6.2 Secondary outcomes\n\nThe mean changes in the NRS score, the risk of fall (alternative-step test, six-meter-walk test, sit-to-stand test, timed up, and go test), and the range of motion (flexion and extension) between the two groups at 8 weeks.\n\n#### 2.6.3 Safety outcomes\n\nGeneral physical examination (including vital signs) and laboratory investigations (urine routine, hematological, and biochemical) will be performed during screening and post-treatment. All adverse events will be assessed. Confirmed adverse events will be entered in the case report form. The investigator can withdraw patients experiencing any serious adverse event(s) (SAE), and such patients will be provided appropriate care. These cases will be reported to the IRB within 7 business days from withdrawal, according to the Korean Good Clinical Practice guidelines.\n\n#### 2.6.4 Economic evaluation\n\nQuality-adjusted life years measured by EQ-5D and cost per Quality-adjusted life years gained will be calculated as the primary economic outcome. Effectiveness indices, such as the cost per NRS, will be analyzed as a secondary economic outcome. The medical costs generated as a result of this trial will be also calculated.\n\n### 2.7 Statistical analyses\n\n#### 2.7.1 General principle for statistical analysis\n\nIntention-to-treat analysis will be used for participants who will receive treatment at least once. Per-protocol analysis, will be performed with patients who will successfully complete the trial, but not for drop-outs.\n\nIf the data are normally distributed, an independent _t_\\-test will be performed; if not, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be performed for within-group comparisons. For between-group comparisons, the paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be performed based on normality. An additional analysis of covariance will be performed with the initial baseline values and the covariant factors that statistically differ by treatment groups. For categorical data, the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test will be performed. In case of specific categorical data, such as urine test results, the McNemar test will be used.\n\nFor all statistical analyses, a two-sided test will be used at a significance level of 5%. Missing data will be dealt with using the last observation carried forward method. Finally, multiple imputation or regression analysis will be used to confirm the differences in the results.\n\n#### 2.7.2 Analysis of economic variables\n\n##### 2.7.2.1 Target of economic evaluation\n\nTo evaluate the economic feasibility, the subjects who will participate in the trial at least once, based on visit 2, will be evaluated as the target group for the analysis.\n\n##### 2.7.2.2 Economic evaluation\n\nTreatment costs incurred in connection with the clinical trial will be calculated according to the principle of cost data analysis for economic evaluation; and if necessary, a part of the unit cost can be used as representative values for health insurance and institutional costs. A sensitivity analysis will be performed in the future. The primary analysis will be performed in 12 weeks, and if it is necessary to estimate the cost after follow-up, data extrapolation will be performed through regression models, etc. or a secondary analysis will be performed by conducting a decision modeling analysis. The treatment cost incurred in connection with the clinical trial will be calculated by combining the number of treatments and the unit cost. The treatment cost incurred in the clinical trial institution will be recorded by investigating the computerized data after unblinding. If the total analysis period is >12 months, the cost unit will be unified in Korean currency units as of 2017, and a 5% discount rate will be applied based on the guidelines for economic evaluation by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. From a social point of view, the baseline analysis will be performed using representative parameters used in this study. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using the distribution and representative values of all possible estimated parameters. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis will also be performed.\n\n### 2.8 Data monitoring\n\nThe SongHeon R&D Co. Ltd. will be responsible for monitoring the collected data and research. All study sites will be monitored based on the standard of practice during the trial progress. There will be three pre-assigned monitoring visits, as follows: at first enrollment (when 50% of planned enrollment is achieved), on enrollment completion, and at the end of the trial. During monitoring, the clinical research associate will review the trial documentation and perform source document verification. After completing data collection, the independent statistician from SongHeon R&D Co. Ltd. will perform data validation and verification by range checks for data values and double data entry for ensuring data quality. The study investigators will have access to the final trial dataset. Any other trial quality assurance committee, such as a coordinating center, a steering committee, an endpoint adjudication committee, etc. will not apply to the current study. Due to restricted funding resources, no auditing will be performed.\n\n### 2.9 Ethics and dissemination\n\nThis trial has been designed in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki and the regulations of the Good Clinical Practice principles of the Korea Food and Drug Administration. The protocol has been approved by the IRB of the Catholic Kwandong University International St. Mary's Hospital (IS18ENSI0064).\n\nThe current version of the protocol is 2.0, which is based on the standard SPIRIT guideline, and consists of entries from the World Health Organization test registration dataset (Supplementary File 1). All participants will be provided a detailed explanation and sufficient time to decide to participate in the study. Written consent will be obtained from all participants before enrollment. All personal information will be stored in a locked cabinet in a secured space for confidentiality. Significant protocol changes will be subjected to IRB approval prior to implementation. The study results will be published in a scientific journal.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nTKA followed by conservative treatment is effective for the improvement of pain and musculoskeletal dysfunctions in patients with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Conventionally, the postoperative care following TKA includes supervised exercise, education, dietary management, use of insoles, analgesics, etc. Although the efficacy of TKA has been well established, the high frequency of patients aged >60 years undergoing TKA and long-term knee problems-induced pain or disability, could affect the outcomes of TKA, and subsequently, its postoperative management.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup>\n\nCMT is a manipulation treatment that balances the orthopedic structure and function of an individual's body. In Korea and China, several case reports have described the efficacy of CMT in patients undergoing TKA. Additionally, a substantial number of published randomized controlled trials have shown that CMT is effective in treating several diseases, such as musculoskeletal,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> neuropsychiatric,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> and cardiovascular diseases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> CMT can alleviate pain and improve joint functions in musculoskeletal disorders. However, CMT has not been evaluated as a post-operative treatment modality post-TKA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial to examine the efficacy and safety of CMT post-TKA.\n\nThe limitations of this study are the short-term treatment duration and the small sample size. Thus, a large, long-term trial is necessary to understand the impact of CMT on chronic pain and musculoskeletal dysfunction management more extensively.\n\nIn conclusion, this study will provide support for the methodology and determine the feasibility of a larger clinical trial with CMT in patients undergoing TKA. If CMT is proven effective and safe, it can be adjudicated by policymakers for the treatment of post-operative pain and musculoskeletal dysfunctions following TKA.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nHyun-ju Kim and Youme Ko contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

He proposed a pathophysiologic cycle of events leading to refractory bradycardia and renal dysfunction, which does not respond to the usual advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) resuscitation protocols.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Although a few cases of BRASH are reported in the literature, it is still not largely recognized as a distinct syndrome.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1–9]</u></a></sup> Many cases are often misdiagnosed and managed as isolated electrolyte abnormalities such as hyperkalemia, which may increase mortality.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> More knowledge on the syndrome is required to better understand the etiology, pathophysiology, and management.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 64-years-old gentleman presented to the hospital with generalized fatigue, non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and low oral intake for the past 5 days. He did not experience any fever or abdominal pain. The patient was a known case of coronary artery disease, stage 4 chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 230 mmol/L), heart failure with low ejection fraction (25%), New York Heart Association Functional Classification 2, stage 4 chronic kidney disease, type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. He was compliant with his medications, including bisoprolol 2.5 mg once daily (OD), sacubitril/valsartan 25 mg twice daily, Furosemide instead of lasix as lasix is brand name 40 mg OD, and spironolactone 12.5 mg OD. He took these medications for the past 3 years and had not started any new medicine in the recent past.\n\nUpon examination, he was dehydrated, bradycardic up to 28 beats per minute (BPM), and hypotensive (72/33 mm Hg). He was mildly drowsy but oriented to time, place, and person. His Glasgow Coma Scale upon presentation was 15/15. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) was remarkable for bradycardia with a junctional rhythm 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[Fig. 1\\]</u>. Biochemistry revealed hyperkalemia of 5.8 (normal range 3.5 – 5.1 mmol/L), pre-renal non-oliguric acute kidney injury on top of his chronic renal failure (creatinine 625 mmol/L, normal range 62 – 106 mmol/L), and a high anion gap (38, normal 6 – 12) severe metabolic acidosis (PH of 6.9). Lactic acid was elevated (9.4 mmol/L, normal range 0.5 - 2.2 mmol). The rest of the biochemistry was within the normal range. The patient was resuscitated with intravenous (IV) fluids, 2 doses of atropine 0.5 mg and received dextrose 50 percent with insulin regular 10 units, and salbutamol 5 mg for hyperkalemia.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nInitial ECG (junctional rhythm). ECG = electrocardiogram.</u>\n\nThe patient's medications were carefully reviewed for adverse effects. Beta-blockers, furosemide, and sacubitril/valsartan were withheld. His glucose was normal, and he was not taking Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors; hence diabetic ketoacidosis (euglycemic or hyperglycemic) was unlikely. A sepsis workup was negative for any infection; Therefore, renal injury and hypoperfusion secondary to infectious pathology was improbable. Due to a history of coronary artery disease and presentation with metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury, the possibility of a new cardiac insult causing decreased perfusion was considered, but the ECG, serial troponin levels, and echocardiogram did not reveal any evidence of a new myocardial infarction.\n\nThe patient was kept on maintenance IV fluids (including bicarbonate) with intake and output monitoring After initial resuscitation, his heart rate, and blood pressure improved, but potassium remained elevated (5.6 mmol/L). IV calcium gluconate (10 percent in 10 mL), dextrose 50 percent with insulin regular 10 units, and nebulized salbutamol 5 mg were administered again. However, a few hours later, patient's Glasgow Coma Scale dropped to 7/15, and he was intubated to protect the airways. Given the intractable hyperkalemia with hypoperfusion, acute kidney injury, bradycardia, and other possibilities ruled out, a diagnosis of BRASH syndrome was made.\n\nThe patient was transferred to the intensive care unit the next day. He was kept on phenylephrine infusion, and urgent dialysis was arranged due to refractory hyperkalemia (5.4 mmol/L). While undergoing dialysis, he became bradycardic again with a heart rate of 30 BPM, for which he received atropine. After atropine injection, ECG revealed a complete heart block that changed to junctional bradycardia shortly. However, there were no ECG signs of hyperkalemia 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[Fig. 2\\]</u>. Subsequently, the next day patient had a cardiac arrest with asystole, while the transcutaneous pacing pads were being attached. He was revived following the ACLS protocol. A transvenous pacemaker was inserted for persistent bradycardia. He was kept on IV phenylephrine, noradrenaline, vasopressin, and dobutamine. Nevertheless, the patient arrested again with asystole despite being on transvenous pacing. Resuscitation was attempted again, but the patient did not survive the second cardiac arrest.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nRepeated ECG (junctional rhythm). ECG = electrocardiogram.</u>\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nHyperkalemia and AV-nodal blocking agents can cause bradycardia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> However, in cases of underlying renal dysfunction, bradycardia itself can exacerbate hyperkalemia, triggering a vicious cycle of multiorgan dysfunction called BRASH syndrome (Bradycardia, Renal Failure, AV-nodal blockers, Shock, Hyperkalemia).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup>\n\nHypovolemia and antihypertensive medications are the most common triggering factors of the BRASH cycle.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Most of the cases described in the literature have a precipitating factor leading to a pre-renal acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia. This, coupled with AV blocking agents, leads to the BRASH cascade (specifically Beta-blockers, but it is reported with ranolazine as well).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,8]</u></a></sup> Additionally, renal failure causes a positive feedback loop of refractory hyperkalemia and AV blockade 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[Fig. 3\\]</u>. Bradycardia, as low as 28 BPM, is reported in the literature. The severity of bradycardia is disproportionate to the AV nodal blocking drug levels in the blood, which are paradoxically within the therapeutic range.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\nThe perpetual cycle of BRASH; adapted from Farkas J. et al.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup></u>\n\nThe ECG changes in the BRASH range from atypical changes such as junctional bradycardia (as in our case) to classic hyperkalemic changes, ie, tall/peaked T waves, absent P waves & QRS widening, even if the potassium elevation is relatively mild.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,5,7]</u></a></sup>\n\nDiagnosis of BRASH syndrome is mainly based on the clinical manifestations, ECG findings, and complete metabolic panel, once other possibilities are ruled out. The index of suspicion should be high while encountering patients with refractory bradycardia, elevated serum potassium, renal failure, and history of AV nodal blocking drugs.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe AV nodal blocking agents should be used with great caution, especially in elderly patients predisposed to pre-renal kidney failure secondary to dehydration, as this can trigger BRASH syndrome.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> In our case, dialysis, discontinuation of bisoprolol, correction of the electrolyte abnormalities, administration of calcium gluconate was unable to break the cycle of BRASH. Additionally, cardiac resuscitation following the ACLS protocols was unsuccessful after the second arrest. This gives the impression that beyond a certain point, this cycle may be irreversible and hence, fatal.\n\nPrompt identification of the syndrome can play a crucial role in mortality reduction. Initial management should be directed at membrane stabilization with calcium gluconate, correction of hyperkalemia with dextrose in insulin infusion, and salbutamol nebulization. Electrolyte correction and fluid replacement are some of the critical factors in the management of BRASH, even if classic ECG findings of hyperkalemia are absent.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Additionally, early hemodialysis should be considered to remove excess potassium from the body. Furthermore, timely transvenous pacing and judicious use of inotropes can be lifesaving in cases of refractory hemodynamic instability.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> As BRASH syndrome is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, understanding the pathophysiology and timely diagnosis of this recently recognized entity is of tremendous importance for prompt management and better patient outcomes.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nBRASH is a life-threatening yet largely underdiagnosed condition. Physicians should keep a high index of suspicion for BRASH while seeing patients with resistant and self-potentiating bradycardia, hyperkalemia, and renal failure, as a timely diagnosis is crucial in the management. Variable clinical presentations and limited literature create a diagnostic challenge. Further studies are warranted to understand the pathophysiology and develop better and accurate management algorithms. Patients’ risk of developing BRASH syndrome should be considered while prescribing causative medications (AV nodal blocking drugs such as beta-blockers) in hospitals and outpatient settings.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup>\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nAuthors would like to acknowledge Dr Joshua D.

Patients with PS usually present with sciatica, external tenderness around the greater sciatic notch, and pain aggravated by prolonged sitting.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Although 85% of the cases presenting with sciatica are related to a disc disorder,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> PS is an important differential diagnosis. The most common site of non-discogenic sciatic entrapment is around the piriformis muscle.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Moreover, PS is also estimated to account for 17.2% of all the cases of chronic low back pain in a prevalence study.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> However, an accurate diagnosis of true PS is still challenging and results in repetitive investigations and potentially misleading diagnosis. This case report highlights the complexity in diagnosis of sciatica and PS.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nThe patient, a thirty-six-year-old young woman with a past medical history of dyslipidemia, had suffered from progressive sciatica on and off for nine months, with radiating twitching and stinging sensation from the right buttock to leg, numbness and burning at the posterior thigh region, electrical shock-like sensation to right toes, and mild weakness over the right lower leg. The symptoms were relieved by activities but was aggregated by forward bending postures.\n\nShe visited Neurology and Neurosurgery outpatient clinic accordingly, and the initial physical examination demonstrated no muscle wasting, nor fasciculation on inspection. There was normal muscle power over bilateral lower legs (according to Medical Research Council grading), normal lumbar spine active range of motion, normal gait pattern, normal toe/heel walking test, and normal bilateral Patrick test. However, she had a positive straight leg raising test over the right side, local tenderness over the right buttock on palpation, and positive flexion, adduction, and internal rotation in the right side.\n\nSerial lumbar X-ray showed normal alignment of the lumbar spine without significant dynamic instability. An electrodiagnostic study revealed no electrophysiological lumbar radiculopathy, nor peripheral nerve lesion. She was treated with a pain killer and clonazepam (5 mg, every night). The patient continued to have right lower leg paresthesia and the symptom attacks sometimes occurred at night. It bothered her sleep and could only be relieved by some postural changes. The Neurologist considered a diagnosis of restless leg syndrome and PS.\n\nUnder the initial impression of right PS, physical therapy including muscle stretching and modalities application was prescribed. Ultrasound-guided injection of triamcinolone (10 mg) and 1% lidocaine (1 ml) into the right piriformis was also performed, however, the symptoms still progressed.\n\nFurther studies were arranged for differential diagnosis. Computed Tomography (CT) lumbar spine and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine and sacrum revealed a homogenous enhanced lesion of size 67x66x71 mm in the right L5-S1 intervertebral foramen extending along the right S1 nerve root to the presacral region, suspicious of neurogenic or osteogenic tumor . CT-guided biopsy was performed and the pathology was compatible with Ewing's sarcoma (microscopic finding revealed small foci of small round tumor cells in a solidly packed pattern in the fibromuscular tissue; the tumor cells were reactive for synaptophysin, CD99, and NKX2.2; no tumor osteoid was seen; positive for EWS gene translocation). The serum test of Neuron-specific enolase was 25.94 ng/ml. Following staging studies, including the chest CT, whole-body bone scan, and colonoscopy demonstrated no evidence of metastasis. The final diagnosis was Ewing's sarcoma of the sacrum with right S1 and S2 nerve root compression, T1N0M0, stage Ia. The timeline of the diagnostic investigation for presacral Ewing's sarcoma is presented in Figure 3.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nThe sagittal T1-weighted series of the MRI of lumbar spine.

She tolerated the neoadjuvant chemotherapy well with her main side effect being fatigue. The symptoms of sciatica improved gradually since 2<sup>nd</sup> cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pre-operative sacral MRI displayed tumor necrosis and regression in size to 37x20x32 mm. Tumor excision surgery was performed and then she was started on systemic adjuvant chemotherapy. However, for a suspected residual lesion in the S1–2 foramen, suspicious bony destruction, and right sacral nerve root involvement, she received post-operative adjuvant radiation with doses of 45 Gy to primary tumor surgical bed and 55 Gy to the residual lesion in the S1–2 foramen and other sites with suspicious residual tumors. She completed full 14 cycles of chemotherapy. At the most recent follow-up (15 months), she remains stable, with non-progression of the residual tumor over S2 foramen and has experienced complete resolution of sciatica. She has been successfully weaned off all analgesic medications\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nIn addition to the sciatic nerve, piriformis muscle may irritate pudendal, inferior gluteal, and posterior femoral cutaneous nerves which emerge from its undersurface.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u></a></sup> PS should be considered in patients presenting with buttock pain and sciatica.

Secondary PS has a precipitating cause, including trauma, ischemia to the piriformis muscle, or mass effect.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u></a></sup> In a retrospective epidemiological study, 143 cases of extra-spinal sciatica were tested by pelvic MRI and 5% cases had tumors, including lipomas, sarcoma, schwannoma, and osteochondroma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn this case, the tentative impression was PS and the final diagnosis was Ewing's sarcoma. The history, physical examination, and even electrophysical examination were oriented to the PS. MRI was not easily accessible due to its expensive cost and long waiting time. Nevertheless, the result of ultrasound-guided injection gave us valuable diagnostic information to rule out piriformis syndrome. The tumor was located at the right L5-S1 intervertebral foramen extending along the right S1 nerve root to the presacral region. This occupied lesion resulted in sciatica and mimicked PS. Systemic treatment has greatly improved survival rates of over 70% for patients with localized disease. However, once presenting with metastatic disease, 5-year survival reduces to less than 30%. Hence, it is crucial to speed up the diagnostic work-out of secondary piriformis syndrome.\n\nBecause other structures in the deep gluteal space may also be involved in entrapment or irritation while the sciatic nerve is coursing down, recently, another term “deep gluteal syndrome” is preferred, rather than the term “ piriformis syndrome “ for broadening the differential diagnosis beyond piriformis muscle, such as fibrous bands, gluteal muscles, hamstring, the gemelli-obturator internus complex, vascular abnormalities, and mass lesions.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> Nowadays, the PS is a well-known disease among the public.

We herein describe a BD patient with refractory mucocutaneous involvement in whom treatment with TNF inhibitors was ineffective but had good outcomes after treatment with apremilast.\n\nCase presentation\n-----------------\n\nA 44-year-old Japanese male with relapsing genital ulcers, oral ulcers, arthritis, and pustular skin lesions for unknown reasons for several years was transferred to our hospital presenting with generalised seizures. On physical examination, Glasgow coma score was E1V1M4 and he had upward deviation of eyes. Neck stiffness and Kernig's signs were negative. There were multiple oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and pustular skin lesions on the anterior chest and both upper extremities. Laboratory results revealed an elevated inflammatory response (CRP: 5.1 mg/dL (normal range, 0.0 to 0.2 mg/dL) and an increased white blood cell count of 17200 cells/μL (normal range, 4,000 to 9,000 cells/μL); neutrophils: 93%). Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed scattered high-intensity lesions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images in the bilateral medial temporal lobe and cerebral cortex. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed an increased protein level of 65 mg/dL (normal range, 15 to 40 mg/dL), cell count of 34 cells/μL (Mono 32 cells/μL, poly 2 cells/μL, normal range, 0 to 5 cells/μL), and markedly elevated interleukin (IL)-6 level of 200 pg/mL. The findings of relapsing genital ulcers, oral ulcers, arthritis, and pustular skin lesions, indicated the diagnosis of BD.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> The mucocutaneous ulcers were ruled out as herpes infection. In addition to the clinical manifestations of BD, the other findings such as seizures, a high inflammatory response, a high signal on MRI FLAIR, an increased cell count, and an increased IL-6 in CSF were consistent with the diagnosis of acute neuro-BD. The CSF culture results were negative and negative for herpes virus, which ruled out central nervous system infection. There was markedly elevated IL-6 in CSF. In addition, Anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies were also negative. Furthermore, no tumor and other specific findings were observed on MRI. Based on these results, the patient was diagnosed with meningoencephalitis due to acute neuro-BD. Encephalitis, genital ulcers, oral ulcers, and pustular skin lesions were ameliorated by the administration of prednisolone (PSL) at a dose of 60 mg/day with colchicine 1 mg and adalimumab 160 mg at week 0, followed by 80 mg at week 2, and then 40 mg once every 2 weeks. The inflammatory markers in blood and the CSF protein, cell count, and IL-6 improved to the normal range. MRI findings three weeks later showed improvement in the high-intensity lesions on FLAIR and seizures resolved without relapse. After 3 weeks, the dose of PSL was reduced to 50 mg. Subsequently, the dose was reduced by 5 mg/d every 1 to 2 weeks. However, after reducing the dose of PSL to 35 mg and less, the patient developed genital ulcers, oral ulcers, and pustular skin lesions, suggesting relapse of BD. There was no relapse of the neurological manifestations. Adalimumab was switched to another TNF inhibitor infliximab but it was discontinued due to an infusion reaction. Golimumab 100 mg once every month was not effective. Therefore, the patient was treated with colchicine 1.5 mg/d, methotrexate 12 mg/wk, azathioprine 75 mg/d, and certolizumab pegol 200 mg once every 2 weeks in addition to PSL 35 mg. Nevertheless, steroid-sparing effects were not achieved. In addition to these drugs, apremilast was then administered at the dose stated in the package insert for apremilast. First day, apremilast was started at 10 mg and the dose was gradually increased. From the sixth day, apremilast was administered at a dose of 30 mg twice a day. There was mild diarrhea as a side effect, but no treatment was required. Two oral ulcers present at the time of apremilast initiation were clearly improved after 2 weeks. The concomitant use of apremilast markedly attenuated genital ulcers, oral ulcers, and pustular skin lesions, which disappeared within one month . In addition, CRP improved from 0.9 mg/dL to normal range. Moreover, glucocorticoids were discontinued and have not been re-administered for more than a year while continuing apremilast. One year after onset, the MRI showed that the FLAIR high-intensity lesions remained resolved and there was no relapse.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nThe clinical course of the patient.

In addition, after medical or surgical treatment, the monitoring of anterior segment anatomical changes is important. In this case report, we describe a patient diagnosed with malignant glaucoma after she underwent Ahmed valve implantation. This patient was diagnosed with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEXG) before undergoing valve surgery. We monitored the anterior segment anatomical changes using swept source anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT, CASIA SS-1000, Nagoya, Japan) before and after the treatment of malignant glaucoma.\n\nCase report\n-----------\n\nAn 86-year-old woman with pseudophakic PEXG underwent Ahmed valve implantation at the superotemporal site of the left eye, due to the IOP not being controlled despite maximal medical treatment and worsening of the visual field. During preoperative examination, the axial length and anterior chamber depth (ACD) of the eye were 23.55 mm and 4.42 mm, respectively. At postoperative day 1, IOP successfully decreased from 36 mmHg to 16 mmHg, and the visual acuity (VA) increased from 20/100 to 20/40. The deep anterior chamber and open angle structure with well-positioned Ahmed valve tip was confirmed using AS-OCT . Five days later, the patient visited the emergency room with visual loss and left eye pain. The patient could only perceive light and had an IOP of 74 mm Hg. The anterior chamber was totally collapsed with conjunctival injection and edematous cornea . We eliminated a diagnosis of posterior segment pathology, such as suprachoroidal hemorrhage, using B-scan ultrasonography. Atropine 1% instillation, Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy and disruption of the anterior hyaloid face, and maximal medical therapy for IOP reduction, including anti-glaucoma eye drops and intravenous mannitolization, were implemented. However, the collapsed status of the anterior segment was not relieved, and the IOP was still high at 55 mm Hg. Under the diagnosis of malignant glaucoma, we performed pars plana vitrectomy with iridectomy on the same day. The IOP on postoperative day 1 was 12 mm Hg. The central chamber depth was slightly increased; however, the peripheral angle was still collapsed . Therefore, we injected VISCOAT (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, Tx) into the anterior chamber for chamber formation, and performed additional decompression through the previous vitrectomy site. One day later, anterior chamber formation could be confirmed by AS-OCT . However, the IOP increased again to 27 mm Hg. The next day, we performed surgical iridectomy at the superior iris, removal of inflammatory membrane anterior to intraocular lens, and anterior vitrectomy with VISCOAT injection at the anterior chamber. Immediately after surgery, the IOP was 10 mmHg. Deep chamber depth and open angle structure were noted . Low IOP was sustained until 2 months after surgery. The IOP and VA at the 2-month follow-up were 8 mmHg and 20/100, respectively, showing stable anterior segment anatomical structure with ACD of 4.12 mm . Until postoperative 4 months, this patient did not use anti-glaucoma medication. However, since IOP increased to 24 mm Hg, topical tafluprost was used. Deep anterior chamber was identified until 17 months after vitrectomy. After using topical tafluprost, IOP was also well-maintained (ranging from 10 to 15 mm Hg).

Swept source OCT uses a tunable light source with narrow band, and provides high image acquisition speed with wide and deep resolution. It is known that CASIA SS-1000 has the scanning speed of 30,000 A-scan/s and axial and axial resolution of 10 μm with 30 μm of transverse resolution. These features are important factors that enable more accurate images to be obtained. Conventionally, the anterior segment structure of malignant glaucoma was evaluated by ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). In a recently published malignant glaucoma case report, UBM was used as a method to assess the patient's anterior segment structure.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> UBM has an advantage in that it can analyze the structures behind the iris tissue, such as the sulcus and ciliary body, as the infrared light used in AS-OCT cannot penetrate the pigment epithelium of the iris.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> However, the high resolution of the image acquired by AS-OCT makes it easy for the ophthalmologist to distinguish and analyze the anterior segment structures.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,6]</u></a></sup> In addition, ease of operation and improved patient comfort by non-contact fashion are some of the reasons why this device has recently been widely used in glaucoma research. In this case report, although the cornea showed edematous change in malignant glaucoma status, edematous cornea, location of pupil, and position of Ahmed valve tip were certainly identified by AS-OCT. In addition, by using AS-OCT, we could confirm the specific change in the anterior segment structures in malignant glaucoma before surgery, and also clarify the process of normalization after surgery. Therefore, considering that our case report is the first to confirm the change in ocular structure of malignant glaucoma patient using AS-OCT, we believe this case report is sufficient to show the clinical efficacy of AS-OCT.\n\nPrevious studies reported malignant glaucoma following Baerveldt drainage device<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> or Ahmed valve implantation as a secondary operation after a failure of filtering surgery in chronic angle-closure glaucoma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Although our patient did not have shallow angle structure before developing malignant glaucoma, the IOP reduction by Ahmed valve implantation could lead to a reduction in the ACD. This phenomenon would make it easy for misdirection of aqueous humor flow to occur.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> In addition, our patient was diagnosed with PEXG, which is associated with a postoperative inflammatory reaction and zonular weakness resulting in intraocular dislocation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u></a></sup> Our surgical finding of inflamed anterior membrane of the intraocular lens indicated increased inflammation after Ahmed implantation and/or pas plana vitrectomy. Inflammatory materials and forward movement of the intraocular lens, as well as a zonule-anterior hyaloid caused by a weak zonule would be the main reasons for posterior misdirection of aqueous humor flow. A previous study showed a formation of inflammatory barrier between the capsule and zonular area, which blocked aqueous humor flow.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Dynamic change of anterior segment structure is associated with malignant glaucoma. As mentioned above, surgery for glaucoma or inflammatory reaction are factors that encourage greater change of anterior segment structure. Therefore, it is important to carefully check the anterior segment structure of patients who are likely to develop malignant glaucoma. This case report demonstrates that AS-OCT provides the image of anterior segment structure easily, and accurately; therefore, it is expected that the utilization of AS-OCT for glaucoma patients will grow in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, our case report suggests the usefulness of AS-OCT for the diagnosis and follow-up of malignant glaucoma. Furthermore, in terms of monitoring the alteration of anterior segment structure, the usefulness of AS-OCT in glaucoma patients is expected to increase.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conception and design:** Sang Yeop Lee, Chan Yun Kim\n\n**Data collection:** Sang Yeop Lee, Hyoung Won Bae\n\n**Overall responsibility:** Sang Yeop Lee.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:24:11", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:25:26", "cost": 75.084}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:25:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:24:11"}

Introduction\n----------------\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune connective tissue disorder, with a heterogeneous presentation. SLE often affects young and middle-aged people and is most prevalent in women.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In recent decades, the life expectancy of patients with SLE has increased due to improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic management. However, the risk of mortality remains high, linked to comorbidities including cancer.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe association between SLE and cancer has been studied several times in the literature. SLE represents a risk of malignancy, primarily non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Other cancers that have been reported include thyroid, laryngeal, oesophageal, lung, vaginal, and vulvar cancers as well as leukemia and multiple myeloma.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Some of the authors showed a significant reduction in the risk of breast, ovarian and prostate cancers in SLE patients. Among the reported cases of leukemia, the myeloid type is the most frequent.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe mechanism of carcinogenesis in SLE remains partially elucidated. Circumstantial evidence has been suggested such as immunological disturbances and exposure to certain immunosuppressive agents.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nTo provide new insights into the association between SLE and cancer, we report on a 30-year-old patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 20 months after the diagnosis of SLE.\n\n2\\. Case report\n---------------\n\nA 30-year-old female patient was followed in the department of nephrology since 2016 for a nephrotic syndrome. The first explorations did not find any cause. The disease was recurrent despite treatment with cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine and then progressing to end-stage renal disease in 2019. Since then, she had regular hemodialysis sessions 3 times a week. In 2020, she was seen in the department of dermatology for skin lesions suggestive of lupus erythematosus. Investigations revealed a positive autoimmune panel (anti-nuclear antibodies 320 IU/mL, anti-native DNA 380 IU/mL and anti-SSA 36 IU/mL) and anemia. The diagnosis of SLE was raised and she was treated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and corticosteroid tapering. During follow-up, anemia was persistent and leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred secondarily. In March 2021, Azathioprine (AZA) was started for 5 months, followed by methotrexate (MTX) due to persistent cytopenias. In September 2021, she was admitted for moderate hematemesis associated with retro-sternal pain that had been present for 1 day. One week before hospitalisation, she reported some spontaneous bleeding from the nose and mouth. She was not febrile and her general condition was altered.\n\nHer other history consisted of tuberculosis miliaria treated for 6 months and then declared cured, and active hepatitis B with a viral load of 654 million UI/mL in 2020. She was treated with tenofovir. She had no history of neoplasia or use of toxic products. Her usual treatment was: prednisone 10 mg/d, HCQ 200 mg/d, MTX 5 mg, and tenofovir 300 mg/wk.\n\nOn admission, hemodynamic parameters were stable. Physical examination revealed conjunctival pallor, erosive hemorrhagic lesions in the mouth and petechial purpura in the lower limbs. She had no other hemorrhagic signs. No abdominal mass or peripheral lymphadenopathy was found. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.\n\nThe blood count demonstrated pancytopenia involving hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, a white blood cell count of 2.2 G/L, a platelet count of 14 G/L and a lymphocyte count of 0.5 G/L. The reticulocyte count was 15 G/L and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 150 mm in 1 hour. The C-reactive protein was 12.2 mg/L. Serum ionogram and calcium level were normal. The liver function tests revealed cytolysis with a SGOT level of 359 UI and a bilirubin level of 27.8 mmol/L. Hepatitis B viral load was controlled at 1480 UI/mL. HIV and hepatitis C serologies were negative. The coagulation test was normal. Serum creatinine level was 506 µmol/L and proteinuria was 0.14 g/24H. Serum protein electrophoresis showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (36.4 g/L).\n\nCytological examination from bone marrow aspiration showed infiltration by 56% basophilic blasts with granulations and rare Auer bodies, suggestive of M3-type AML according to the French-American-British classification.\n\nThe diagnosis of AML in a patient known to have had SLE for 20 months was retained. SLE was characterised by hematological, immunological damage and end-stage renal disease. The hepatitis B viral load was regressing, not suggesting reactivation of virus. Liver test abnormalities were related to MTX toxicity. In addition, the esogastroduodenal fibroscopy performed in the context of the hematemesis showed erosive gastritis and erythematous bulbitis.\n\nAfter multidisciplinary discussion, the patient was not eligible for chemotherapy due to her comorbidities. She received a bolus of methylprednisolone followed by prednisone 1 mg/kg and omeprazole 80 mg daily. MTX was stopped. HCQ and tenofovir were continued. Transfusion support were provided.\n\nThe initial evolution was marked by the disappearance of hemorrhagic signs and hemodynamic stability. One month after hospitalisation, pancytopenia was still persistent and bone marrow aspiration showed 4% blasts. Three months after hospitalisation, the patient was re-hospitalized with severe sepsis, febrile neutropenia and unfortunately she had died.

Discussion\n--------------\n\nThe first case of association between SLE and AML was published by Lee et al in 1955.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Although demonstrated in several studies, this association remains rare and its incidence is unknown. In a cohort of 16,409 LES patients by Lu et al in 2013, only 7 cases developed AML.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In 2019, Bae et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> reported an incidence of 0.107 cases (per 1000 person-years) in a study of 21,016 LES patients.\n\nAML occurs during the follow-up of SLE patients. The period between the diagnosis of SLE and leukemia is variable, ranging from 1 to 17 years.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In our case, AML was diagnosed 20 months after the diagnosis of SLE. The majority of reported cases are female, reflecting the female predominance of SLE.\n\nAnemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are common manifestations of SLE and may also be encountered in AML. Leukopenia is the only known factor associated with the development of leukemia.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In previous cases, the bone marrow aspiration was performed in the setting of persistent cytopenia and found evidence of AML. In 25% of cases, AML is preceded by a myelodysplastic phase.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nAML is classified according to the appearance of the cells under microscopy. The French-American-British classification is often used. In a study by Ramadan et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> in 2012, 22 cases of AML were reported in LES patients among which 4 cases were M4-type, 3 cases M2-type, 2 cases M6-type, 2 cases M3-type, 1 case M5-type, and M7-type and 9 cases were undefined. In our case, acute promyelocytic leukemia or M3-type AML was suggested.\n\nThe pathophysiological mechanism of the association between SLE and AML is not clearly elucidated but there are many hypotheses. Inflammatory mediators promote cell growth and survival. The existence of an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome and certain mutations may be involved in leukemic transformation.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Some immunosuppressive drugs in SLE have a leukemogenic risk. AZA has been shown in several studies. AZA causes defective DNA repair, promoting the survival of a leukemic clone. Its cumulative dose ranges from 19 to 400 g and the time to leukemic transformation ranges from 2 to 12 years.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Cyclophosphamide was noted with non-significant results. Exposures to MTX, mercaptopurine and mycophenolate mofetil are not leukemogenic.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In contrast, synthetic antimalarials (quinine) are known to have antineoplastic properties. They prevent cell mutations and improve DNA repair.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Their frequent prescription during SLE could explain the rarity of the occurrence of leukemia. In the present case, it is difficult to define the factors involved in the occurrence of AML. The hemopathy is probably not related to AZA because the cytopenias were already observed before its introduction. Underlying myelodysplasia, which later develops into leukemia, is not ruled out. Tenofovir is not known to be mutagenic.\n\nThe therapeutic management of AML in the context of SLE is very difficult due to comorbidities and lack of consensus. The prognosis is very poor. Observations have shown an increased risk of infection and a lower tolerance to chemotherapy. The survival time after diagnosis of AML varies from 2 to 18 months.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The survival time of our patient was 3 months. Chemotherapy was not started because of her comorbidities.\n\nThrough this observation, regular monitoring of the blood count is therefore necessary in SLE patients. In case of persistent cytopenia, we suggest performing a bone marrow aspiration to look for associated myelodysplasia or hematological malignancy. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of mutations from immunosuppressive drugs, particularly AZA. The latency period between drug exposure and diagnosis of leukemia is variable. Synthetic antimalarials are not only a basic treatment for SLE but also reduce the risk of cancer.\n\nIn conclusion, SLE represents a risk of malignancy. The occurrence of AML in SLE is unusual. The mechanism of carcinogenesis is complex, often involving immunosuppressive drugs. The hematological abnormalities of SLE can be encountered in AML, making the diagnosis difficult. The prognosis of this association is very poor. Therapeutic management is limited due to the patients’ comorbidities.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThe authors thank all the staff of the dermatology and rhumatology department of the Joseph Raseta Befelatanana Hospital.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Data curation:** Samson Léophonte Ramily, Tsiory Iarintsoa Razafimaharo, Volatantely Ratovonjanahary.\n\n**Investigation:** Samson Léophonte Ramily.\n\n**Supervision:** Fahafahantsoa Rabenja Rapelanoro.\n\n**Validation:** Lala Soavina Ramarozatovo, Fahafahantsoa Rabenja Rapelanoro.\n\n**Visualization:** Lala Soavina Ramarozatovo.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Rova Malala Fandresena Randrianarisoa, Armel Mamihaja Andrianiaina.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Fandresena Arilala Sendrasoa.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:53:45", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:54:19", "cost": 34.362}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:18", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:54:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:53:44"}

Introduction\n----------------\n\nNoonan syndrome is a disorder characterized by several main characteristics, including facial traits, short height, and congenital cardiac abnormalities. This heterogeneity of clinical findings may delay the diagnosis, but in time, the associated suggestive findings will raise the suspicion of Noonan syndrome, which will be later confirmed by genetic testing. The incidence of Noonan syndrome has been reported to be 1/1000 - 1/2500 individuals in cases with severe phenotypes; however, for mild cases, the incidence can be as high as 1/100 individuals.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>1,2</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Women and men are equally affected; however, a clear diagnosis can be established earlier in cases of cryptorchidism in men, a particular clinical aspect that raises early suspicion of Noonan syndrome.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nNoonan syndrome can be transmitted through an autosomal dominant pattern; therefore, the affected individual has a 50% chance of transmitting the disorder to descendants. Interestingly, sporadic cases of this syndrome have also been reported. The most frequent gene was PTPN11 (50% of the tested patients), followed by SOS1, RAF1, RIT1, and KRAS.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> All of these mutant genes encode different components of the proteins involved in RAS/MAP-kinase signaling. Mutations involved in Noonan syndrome determine inadequate signaling of RAS/MAPK, affecting differentiation and cellular growth, in turn generating the varied clinical manifestations of the syndrome.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\n2\\. Case presentation\n---------------------\n\nA 3-month-old female infant was admitted to our hospital with suspected sepsis due to persistent leukocytosis since birth. The infant presented with a history of neonatal disorders characterized by premature birth at 37weeks, respiratory distress, generalized cyanosis that required oxygen therapy, and hematological abnormalities (leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia). The patient repeatedly received antibiotics for the persistent leukocytosis. The patient’s personal medical history was extracted through cesarean section surgery records. The patient was born with an Apgar score of 7, a weight of 2700g, and a height of 47cm. The mother was primiparous, and familial medical history showed no existence of genetic disorders among first-degree relatives.\n\nPhysical examination revealed height hypotrophy (third percentile for weight and height), dysmorphic face with tall and broad forehead, hypertelorism, descended lateral cantus, green iris, bilateral palpebral ptosis, narrow and sharp chin, thin lips, deepened philtrum, low ear insertion, constitutional hyperpigmented skin, excess neck skin, and increased transverse thoracic diameter. The patient had an oxygen saturation of 99% in atmospheric air, bilateral vesicular murmur, no added lung sounds, rhythmic cardiac sounds, grade IV/VI systolic murmur, audible in the entire precordial area, with maximum intensity in the left parasternal area, with rough, crescendo-decrescendo character, a heart rate of 140 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 95/45 mm Hg. The abdomen was supple, synchronous with breathing, did not exhibit pain spontaneously or \\\\\\\\ during touch, the lower border of the liver was palpable 2.5cm under the ribcage, the stool was normal, urinary output was normal, anterior fontanelle of 2/2 centimeters with normal pressure values.\n\nLaboratory reports revealed leukocytosis with monocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and cultures, including blood cultures, were negative. Thoracic radiography revealed normal heart dimensions, and abdominal ultrasonography revealed liver and spleen enlargement. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia and right ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography revealed severe pulmonary valve stenosis (maximum gradient, 96.9mm Hg), mild pulmonary regurgitation, ostium secundum type interatrial septal defect measuring 6.5mm with a moderate left-right shunt, and patent ductus arteriosus.\n\nGiven the clinical context, sepsis was excluded as a cause of height and weight hypotrophy given that an infectious site was not found. Therefore, emergency balloon valvuloplasty was performed for severe congenital pulmonary stenosis , with a significant decrease in the transvalvular pressure gradient (initial right ventricular pressure, 100mm Hg; postprocedural pressure, 58mm Hg) . Post-intervention follow-up echocardiography revealed a moderate residual pulmonary stenosis.\n\nThe association between height and weight hypotrophy, facial dysmorphia, and congenital pulmonary stenosis raised the suspicion of Noonan syndrome.\n\nHormone profile, karyotype, and molecular genetic testing led to the final diagnosis of Noonan syndrome (mutation in exon 13 of the PTPN 11 gene, present in both peripheral blood and oral buffer compatible with Noonan syndrome), thereby excluding the differential diagnosis, such as Turner syndrome, facialcardiac-cutaneous syndrome, Costello syndrome, Leopard syndrome, and type I neurofibromatosis.\n\nAfter genetic confirmation of the syndrome, the patient was evaluated according to existing guidelines. Neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, hematological, and ear-nose-throat audiological examinations were performed. Renal anomalies were screened. Growth curves were constantly tracked, and periodic cardiology evaluations were performed.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nAngiography - Pulmonary stenosis.</u>\n\nAt the age of 3 years old, the patient did not exhibit hearing impairment or ocular or renal anomalies, but presented mild delay of motor and cognitive development, which remitted over this period. She presented with speech delay and mild behavioral disorders such as irritability and stubbornness, but without intellectual disability or learning handicaps.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2.:\n\nPercutaneous pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty.</u>\n\nFrom a hematological point of view, thorough testing revealed factor VII deficit (factor VII activity was 30%, with normal laboratory ranges between 50%-150%) and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time of 42 second; spontaneous normalization of leukocyte and monocyte count occurred without any treatment.\n\nDuring the patient’s evolution, height and weight were maintained under the 10th percentile for age and sex. Teeth eruption occurred within normal timeframes but with profound demineralization, multiple dental cavities, and malocclusion. Hepatomegaly remitted, but with persistence of splenomegaly, without affecting organ function.\n\nAs far as cardiac anomalies are concerned, the residual pulmonary stenosis post-balloon valvuloplasty progressed from moderate to severe (maximum gradient being 96.9mm Hg)  and the patient developed non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (as revealed by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging examination), with a maximal septal thickness of 15.4mm. The atrial septal defect remained patent and measured 8/10mm with a moderate left-right shunt. The ductus arteriosus spontaneously closed. Electrical changes also occurred, including extreme right axial deviation of the QRS axis and signs of right ventricular hypertrophy. Ongoing treatment with propranolol (1 mg/kg/day) was continued.\n\nAt the age of 3 years, surgical intervention for the correction of cardiac abnormalities was performed: closure of the septal interatrial defect  and pulmonary valvuloplasty via median sternotomy. Upon entering the thoracic cavity, there was a rich network of abundant collateral lymphatic vessels (especially at the thymic level), which required extensive lymphatic maneuvers. Cardiopulmonary bypass was performed between 1 aortic and 2 caval cannulas, and asystole was obtained with aortic cross-clamping and antegrade cold cardioplegia. The atrial septal defect was closed using an autologous pericardial patch via right atriotomy. Longitudinal pulmonary arteriotomy was performed and extended down to the pulmonary annulus. The pulmonary valve was tricuspid and thickened, with fused commissures, which were incised to the level of the arterial wall. The pulmonary artery trunk was enlarged with a patch of bovine pericardium. The postoperative course was uneventful, with rapid extubation and weaning from inotropic support. Despite the coagulation disorders and rich mediastinal lymphatic network, the chest drain output was minimal, and the drains were removed on postoperative day 3. Postoperative echocardiography revealed a residual right ventricle - pulmonary artery gradient of 36mm Hg, moderate pulmonary regurgitation, good biventricular contractility, and no pleural or pericardial effusions.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3.:\n\nPercutaneous pulmonary valve balloon dilation.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 4.:\n\nEchocardiography, parasternal short axis view, color Doppler, pulmonary stenosis.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 5.:\n\nEchocardiography, continuous wave Doppler, severe pulmonary stenosis.</u>\n\nSix months after surgery, the patient was stable, and follow-up evaluations were performed. She still presented with mild residual pulmonary valve stenosis (right ventricle - pulmonary artery systolic pressure residual gradient=25mm Hg), as well as moderate pulmonary regurgitation, overall, with satisfactory biventricular function and no residual shunts. During the latest follow-up, the patient affirmed that no symptoms were present, without complaints during effort, and had a good quality of life with no restraints.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 6.:\n\nEchocardiography, parasternal long axis view, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</u>\n\n3\\. Discussions\n---------------\n\nThe clinical manifestations of Noonan syndrome are heterogeneous and vary with age. Facial traits include a broad and tall forehead, hypertelorism, downward and outward gaze, brightly colored iris, epicanthus, narrow and sharp chin, thin lips with deepened philtrum, low-set ears with anterior-to-posterior rotation, lower hair insertion on the nape, and short neck with excess skin; in time, the face becomes triangular with coarse traits.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6-8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Most cases are associated with heart anomalies, the most frequent being pulmonary valve stenosis with dysplastic valves (40%-50%), followed by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (20%), interatrial septal defects (6%-10%), and other cardiac malformations, which are not characteristic of Noonan syndrome.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>6,8,9</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In most of the cases, the severity of pulmonary valve stenosis is mild, with natural history similar to patients who do not have Noonan syndrome. On the other hand, among patients with Noonan syndrome and moderate or severe pulmonary valve stenosis, the rates of intervention are higher, and the standard intervention using percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is often not as successful as is typical for pulmonary valve stenosis.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The electrocardiogram of patients with Noonan syndrome can present a particular aspect with large QRS complexes, predominantly negative in the left leads, giant Q waves, and left axial deviation.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The height of patients with Noonan syndrome is short; at birth, weight and length are normal but decrease in the first months due to alimentation disorders. Pre-puberty growth follows the 3rd percentile for height and weight, and the onset of puberty is delayed by approximately 2 years, with absent or diminished puberty growth.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>8,10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The thorax has a characteristic appearance: the sternum is prominent in its superior area and deepened in the inferior area but can be broad with distanced areolas.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>6,8</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Seventy seven percent of boys with Noonan syndrome present with undescended testicles at birth, which affects fertility. However, female patients do not present infertility.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Bleeding tendency is frequent (up to 55% of cases), especially during childhood, due to thrombocyte function disorders, thrombocytopenia, or individual/combined factor deficits. Severe hemorrhages appeared in only 3% of the cases. Bleeding risk requires proper attention, especially because many patients with Noonan syndrome require surgical interventions.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>8,12,13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Some PTPN 11 gene mutations are associated with myelodysplastic conditions and acute leukemias (juvenile myelomonocyte leukemia). Transitory acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes that appear in the neonatal period are well-known phenomena, most often with spontaneous remission and rarely progressing towards myelomonocyte leukemia. Overall, patients with Noonan syndrome have a better prognosis than the general population. Affected children usually present with hepatosplenomegaly and enlarged lymph nodes, followed by different organ infiltrations, especially in the lungs and skin.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>6,14,15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Hepatosplenomegaly is present most often during childhood but does not alter organ function.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>8,14</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 7.:\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging - Dilated right ventricle.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 8.:\n\nEchocardiography, subcostal long axis view, interatrial septal defect.</u>\n\nLymphatic dysplasia is present in 20% of patients with Noonan syndrome.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>16,17</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> It is responsible for generalized edema, peripheral lymphedema, and pulmonary and intestinal lymphangiectasias. It can also be associated with new-born generalized edema and polyhydramnios; this association should raise suspicion of the syndrome from the fetal period. Fetal edema can explain some of the characteristic features of the syndrome. In addition, there is a possibility of spontaneous chylothorax, as well as pleural/pericardial effusions that may complicate cardiac surgery.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>16-18</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Ocular anomalies, such as strabismus, amblyopia, refractive errors, and hearing impairment, are frequent, and hearing loss may be caused by recurrent middle ear otitis.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>19-21</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Renal malformations were found in 10% of cases (hydronephrosis).删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> With regard to psychomotor development, children with Noonan syndrome present with mild motor development due to muscular hypotonia.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>6,8</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Sometimes mild intellectual disability is present with speech and learning difficulties, followed by behavioral issues such as stubbornness and irritability.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>1,4,6,22</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Noonan syndrome’s specific oral abnormalities are represented by arched, high palate, and malocclusion.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The skin can be rough and hyperelastic, with many pigmented nevi, curled, friable hair, and dystrophic nails.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>2,22</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe initial diagnosis of Noonan syndrome was initially made through clinical assessment and later reinforced by genetic molecular testing. Molecular genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis in 70% of cases and is important for genetic management and counseling.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>23</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> An early and precise diagnosis of Noonan syndrome is important because each patient requires a personalized evaluation and treatment protocol.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nAn evaluation system was created to diagnose patients with this condition. Noonan syndrome can therefore be diagnosed if a typical facial dysmorphic trait is present in addition to a major or 2 minor criteria. The major criteria were as follows:\n\n1.  pulmonary valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, typical electrophysiological abnormalities,\n2.  height under the 3rd percentile,\n3.  pectus carinatum/excavatum,\n4.  first-degree relative with such syndrome, and\n5.  mental retardation, cryptorchidism, and lymphatic dysplasia.\n\nThe minor criteria are:\n\n1.  cardiac malformations other than the major ones,\n2.  height under the 10th percentile,\n3.  first-degree relative with suggestive Noonan syndrome,\n4.  broad thorax or\n5.  1 of the following: mental retardation, cryptorchidism, and lymphatic dysplasia.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>23-25</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nIn the present case, the diagnosis was suggested by clinical and paraclinical characteristic elements: typical facial dysmorphic syndrome, in addition to 2 other major criteria and 1 minor criterion (short height, pulmonary stenosis, and broad thorax).\n\nThis case study presents some elements. First, early diagnosis was made at the age of 3 months in the presence of congenital pulmonary valve stenosis (although published cases usually present an average diagnosis age of 9years).删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>26</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Cardiac involvement required therapeutic measures from the first few months, in turn raising the suspicion of Noonan syndrome, which was later confirmed. Another unique feature of this case was the presence of hematological changes during the first month. In this case, persistent leukocytosis led to a misdiagnosis of neonatal sepsis, followed by multiple antibiotic administration. According to specialty literature, myelodysplastic disorders spontaneously recur. In the present case, leukocytosis did not progress and the patient remitted during the first 2 years without any treatment.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>14,15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Leukocytosis, however, requires monitoring with spontaneous favorable evolution. Despite the presence of a hemorrhage risk due to factor VII activity deficit, which did not require factor administration for correction, surgical intervention was decided. This was decided upon because of recurrent pulmonary stenosis with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as seen on echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging examinations.\n\nThe evolution of patients with Noonan syndrome is good, and their lifespan is comparable to that of the general population; however, they require frequent follow-up and close monitoring by multidisciplinary teams. Treatment is symptomatic, and the vital prognosis depends on the severity of cardiac disorders.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe patient presented is under observation by a multidisciplinary team and comes for periodic evaluation, with good evolution, as reflected by the efficient management of cardiac disorders.\n\nIn conclusion, Noonan syndrome presents large clinical variability, with emphasis on the importance of early diagnosis, especially in cases with early manifestations. A typical cardiovascular disorder, as expressed and diagnosed early in infants, must also raise suspicion of the pre-existence of this syndrome.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nAna-Maria Hodea, Carmen Cristina Olteanu and Cristian Bulescu have edited the text and images.

Introduction\n----------------\n\nNervous system toxicity is a rare complication of metronidazole, leading to neuropathy, ataxic gait, dysarthria, seizures, and encephalopathy. These symptoms may occur from short- or long-term metronidazole use. The mechanism of neurotoxicity induced by metronidazole is unclear, and neuroimaging is the foundation of diagnosis. Reaching the appropriate diagnosis is contingent upon a high clinical index of suspicion, prompt brain imaging to identify specific imaging abnormalities, and improvement after prompt withdrawal of metronidazole. Clinical improvements typically occur after discontinuing metronidazole, but in some cases, comprehensive rehabilitation is needed to optimize mobility and activities of daily living (ADLs). Herein, we describe the diagnosis and rehabilitation of a case of metronidazole toxicity.\n\n2\\. Case presentation\n---------------------\n\nA 58-year-old female with a past medical history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, alcohol and intravenous drug abuse, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation was brought to the emergency department for altered mental status secondary to drug overdose. She was unresponsive upon arrival and subsequently intubated for airway protection. Head computed tomography (CT) identified right temporal and left frontal lobe lesions with surrounding microhemorrhages, and head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multifocal, hypercellular, rim-enhancing lesions. The favored diagnosis was embolic versus hematogenous spread of bacteria resulting in multifocal abscess. Blood cultures, brain magnetic resonance angiography, CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis, lumbar puncture, and transthoracic echocardiogram were unremarkable. Given her history of coagulopathy and esophageal varices, a brain biopsy and transesophageal echocardiogram were deferred. The patient was treated empirically with metronidazole 500 mg by mouth every 6 hours, cefepime 2 g intravenously every 8 hours, and vancomycin 1 g by mouth twice daily for presumed microabscesses. She was also placed on levetiracetam 500 mg by mouth twice daily for seizure prophylaxis. Follow-up head MRI confirmed that the lesions were decreasing in size, and she was subsequently discharged with instructions to continue her seizure prophylaxis and the aforementioned antibiotic regimen orally for 7 weeks.\n\nTwo weeks after discharge, the patient returned to the emergency department with slurred speech, muscle aches, generalized weakness, inability to ambulate, and poor oral intake. Physical examination was significant for drowsiness, right upper extremity pronator drift, right-sided facial droop, and slightly diminished strength on the right. She was noted to have left greater than right-sided ataxia.\n\nThe list of differential diagnoses for a patient with new altered mental status, right-sided weakness, and right-sided facial droop includes intracranial hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, neurotoxicity secondary to metronidazole, seizure with associated Todd paralysis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Additionally, in a patient with a history of intracranial microabscesses such as this patient, the differential would also include worsening abscess, viral or bacterial meningitis, or infective endocarditis leading to new septic emboli. Non-contrast head CT should be ordered first, as it can identify intracranial hemorrhage and occasionally acute ischemic stroke. If findings are insignificant, head CT with angiography can be conducted to identify any vascular pathology that may have resulted in ischemic stroke. The patient is especially susceptible to an ischemic stroke because of her preexisting atrial fibrillation and intravenous drug abuse. Therefore, another transthoracic echocardiography should be ordered. Insignificant head CT with angiography findings can be followed by a head MRI, which can identify acute ischemic stroke, neurotoxicity secondary to metronidazole, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The patient’s history of liver failure places her at risk of developing metronidazole toxicity. Because hypo- and hyperglycemia and Todd paralysis can present with stroke-like symptoms, blood glucose levels and electroencephalogram should be conducted while waiting for imaging.\n\nWith the patient’s altered mentation and history of liver cirrhosis, electrolyte imbalance, hyperammonemia, and systemic infection must also be considered as potential etiologies. A complex metabolic panel, which assesses liver function and electrolyte levels, should be ordered. Additionally, vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature can be ordered to screen for systemic infections.\n\nLabs that were ordered revealed normal blood cultures, sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, erythrocyte segmentation rate, and C-reactive protein.\n\nHead MRI revealed ongoing improvement of the rim-enhancing lesions identified during her first admission. However, symmetric enhanced T2/FLAIR signaling in the dentate nuclei were also present bilaterally, a finding pathognomonic for metronidazole toxicity .删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Metronidazole was discontinued per the recommendation of infectious disease.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nBrain MRI with and without contrast with red arrows pointing to the development of symmetric increased T2/FLAIR signal in the bilateral dentate nuclei consistent with metronidazole toxicity. MRI = magnetic resonance imaging.</u>\n\nFollowing the discontinuation of metronidazole, the patient’s mentation gradually improved over 2 weeks. She was subsequently admitted to Acute Inpatient Rehabilitation, where her initial physical and occupational therapy evaluations were significant for marked decline in physical function and ability to perform ADLs. The patient progressed from requiring multiple people assisting to walk short distances to being able to walk independently with a walker. She also had notable improvement in her cognitive functioning, short-term memory, and complex problem solving after working with speech therapy using cognitive-communication therapy activities. The patient did not encounter any adverse events throughout her second admission. She began inpatient rehabilitation dependent for all ADLs, and requiring moderate assistance for transfers. She could walk 10 feet with a front-wheeled walker and with 2-person assist. The patient rapidly improved and due to these improvements, she was discharged after 5 days of inpatient rehabilitation. At the time of discharge she was independent with all ADLs and could walk 160 feet independently with a front-wheeled walker.\n\nBased on the patient’s pathognomonic MRI findings, ataxia, and drastic improvement of symptoms following metronidazole cessation and acute inpatient rehabilitation, the patient had metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity without associated peripheral neuropathy. The rehabilitation management of this patient included speech therapy to work on her impaired short-term memory and cognitive deficits as well as medication and money management, occupational therapy to improve her ability to dress and bathe herself along with other self-care tasks such as eating and oral care, and physical therapy to improve her walking ability, improve safety with turns and walking on uneven surfaces, and other tasks such as picking up objects, transferring to a commode or into a vehicle, and other instrumental ADLs. Together, these therapies improved our patient’s ability to live independently in her community.\n\n3\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nMetronidazole-induced neurotoxicity is a rare and unpredictable adverse effect that can cause cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, and peripheral neuropathy.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Previously believed to occur only after long-term use, cases of neurotoxicity after taking the antimicrobial for less than a week with doses as low as 5 g have been reported.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>2–7</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Therefore, patients’ susceptibility to developing neurotoxic symptoms cannot be reliably predicted based on the duration or dose of metronidazole therapy. Due to its rare occurrence, the incidence of neurotoxicity is unknown.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nCurrently, the pathophysiology of metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity is poorly understood. The antimicrobial is suspected to cause irreversible cell damage through deprivation of metabolic processes.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Interestingly, the cerebellum and brainstem—both of which have been shown to be affected by metronidazole on MRI—are particularly susceptible to energy deprivation.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However, other studies propose that metronidazole may have Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid-inhibitory and subclinical Monoamine oxidase-inhibitory properties.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Recent MRI studies also suggest that metronidazole may cause neurotoxicity via central nervous system vasoconstriction.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> While often a diagnosis of exclusion, metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity can be diagnosed using T2/FLAIR MRI to detect bilateral dentate nuclei lesions, which is seen in 90% to 93% of patients. Lesions located within splenium and corpus callosum have also been reported.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nMetronidazole should be discontinued upon suspicion of neurotoxicity. Over 90% of patients demonstrate complete or near complete resolution of their symptoms, typically within 14 days of drug cessation.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However, peripheral neuropathy secondary to metronidazole toxicity carries a worse prognosis with only one-third of patients making a complete recovery.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> As stated above, fortunately this patient did not have an associated peripheral neuropathy. There are numerous examples in the literature of patients with significant long-term morbidity and in some cases mortality secondary to metronidazole toxicity.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Prompt recognition and discontinuation of the offending agent remains the only known effective treatment.

Introduction\n----------------\n\nFructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) deficiency (OMIM:229700) is an autosomal recessive (AR) disease. The pathogenic gene is FBP1 (OMIM#611570), which is mainly expressed in liver tissues. FBP1 is 31 kb long and is located on chromosome 9q22.2-q22.3. It consists of 7 exons that encode 338 amino acids.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>1</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Mutations in this gene were first described in 1970删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> and can lead to deficiency or low activity of fructose-1,6-diphosphatase in the liver. These mutations can result in an inability to convert fructose-1,6-diphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and affect gluconeogenesis. Recurrent infections followed by episodes of hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketosis are the main clinical manifestations of the disease, and some patients can develop seizures and coma.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> FBP1 deficiency is generally believed to be very rare, with an estimated incidence between 1:350,000 and <1:900,000 in the Dutch and French populations, respectively.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>4</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However, no data are available for the Chinese population, and it may be more frequent in populations with a higher rate of consanguinity. Although the disease is fatal in the neonatal period, with early diagnosis and strict management, the long-term prognosis for FBPase deficiency is excellent, highlighting the importance of early molecular confirmation.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>6</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>7</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> In this report, we present 2 cases of fructose-1,6-diphosphatase deficiency diagnosed by related gene detection, and the literature was analyzed to further improve our understanding of this disease.\n\n2\\. Methods: genetic analysis\n-----------------------------\n\nThe test is divided into 3 major steps: mutation screening (using high-throughput sequencing technology), genetic data analysis (using bioinformatics and clinical information analysis technology), and verification of suspected pathogenic mutations (using Sanger sequencing technology). Whole-exome sequencing was performed using the IDT xGen Exome Research Panel v2.0 whole exome capture chip. The analysis and screening were performed using the genetic disease precision diagnosis cloud platform system, which integrates molecular biology annotation, biology, genetics, and clinical characteristics analyses. Hundreds of thousands of genetic variants were graded by combining the database of disease-causing mutations, the database of the normal human genome, the database of clinical characteristics of 4000 known genetic diseases and the genetic data analysis algorithm. The variant grading adopted the 3-element grading system and the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) gene variant grading system. After polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the target sequences, Sanger sequencing was verified by an ABI3730 sequencer, and the verification results were obtained by sequence analysis software.\n\n3\\.

Cerebrospinal fluid smear and culture were negative (−). Based on critical acidosis, metabolic testing was performed (blood and urinary organic acid analysis) using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS). Elevations in leucine (Leu) and 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine levels were found in the blood. Urinary organic acid analysis revealed remarkable elevations in urinary lactate and increased pyruvate-OX-2,3-hydroxybutyrate-2 and 2-hydroxyisovalerate-2, suggesting that ketonuria, acetoacetate-2, and glyceric acid were also increased. The above results need to be differentiated from glycerophosphatase deficiency and 3-hydroxybutanoylcarnitine A hydrolase deficiency; therefore, the diagnosis was unclear. Cranial computed tomography (CT) scan, abdominal ultrasound, and electrocardiography were not abnormal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed abnormal pediatric EEG with basic rhythmic slowing and intermittent issuance of irregular slow waves in the bilateral occipital region during sleep. After obtaining the parents’ consent, 2 mL of blood specimens from the parents and siblings were collected and sent for sequencing. The test results are described below and are consistent with those for case 2. Patient 1 received ventilator support, sodium bicarbonate infusion, and continuous intragastric pumping of a glucose solution to maintain blood glucose stability and anti-infective therapy. Her blood glucose level returned to normal 4 to 6 days after treatment, with no complications in 3-month follow-up.\n\n### 3\\. 2. Case 2\n\nThe male patient was the younger brother of case 1, and he had the same presentation as his sister. The brother was a newborn child presenting in the 3rd hour of life with respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, and acidosis in the third hour of life. Sepsis was excluded. He was admitted to the neonatal department of our hospital. Systemic examination results were unremarkable. Investigations revealed blood glucose of 1.3 mmol/L (3.3–8), lactate of 15 mmol/L (0.5–2.2), Ph of 7.16 (7.35–7.45), HCO<sub>3</sub> of 6.4 mmol/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(22–26)</u>. The BE was −23 mmol/L (−3 to 3), uric acid was 461.7 µmol/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(134–415)</u>, triglycerides were 3.59 mmol/L (0.38–1.7). Ammonia, creatine phosphokinase (CK), lipid profile, hepatic profile, and tandem MS were normal. After obtaining the parents’ consent, his blood specimen was sent for genetic sequencing, along with case 1, and the results are described below. Case 2 was given active treatment including glucose supplementation and correction of lactic acidosis. The arterial blood gas and serum glucose of the child returned to normal in 2 to 3 days. After 3 months of follow-up and observation, the patient is doing well.\n\n### 3\\. 3. Results of genetic analysis\n\nThe test results suggested the presence of a compound heterozygous variant of c.977(exon7)T>C/p. L326P (NM\\_000507), c.778(exon6)G>A/p.G260R (NM\\_000507) in the FBP1 gene in 2 patients. The locus c.977(exon7)T>C was inherited from the mother and was a new mutation that has not yet been reported. The c.778(exon6)G>A locus was inherited from her father. In the FBP1 gene on chromosome 9, base G at exon 6 position 778 was mutated to A, resulting in the substitution of glycine (Gly) with arginine (Arg) at position 260. In addition, base T at exon 7 position 977 was mutated to C, resulting in the substitution of Leu with proline (Pro) at position 326 . This missense mutation results in the accumulation of raw sugar amino acids in vivo. In contrast, both parents had this heterozygous mutation but did not have the disease, further indicating that the disease is AR.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1.:\n\nFBP1 gene test results of the children and their parents.</u>\n\n4\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\nFBPase is a key regulator of gluconeogenesis. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-biphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate. FBPase deficiency is an AR disorder that manifests as recurrent life-threatening episodes of hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis in children.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>8</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> FBP1 gene mutations cause deficiency of fructose-1,6-diphosphatase activity, which prevents gluconeogenesis in the liver and accumulation of gluconeogenic precursors, such as fructose, lactate, glycerol, alanine, and other gluconeogenic amino acids, in the body from dietary intake.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>9</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> The disease is characterized by severe hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis after fasting, with symptoms appearing on the first day of life, similar to case 2 in the present study.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>2</a></sup></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Clinical manifestations include pallor, cold extremities, cyanosis, and apnea accompanied by brain dysfunction, such as drowsiness, mental changes, convulsions, and coma. Serious brain injury leads to psychomotor retardation and even sudden death.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>. Because the disease lacks clinical specificity, it should be distinguished from glycogen storage disease (GSDs) and mitochondrial disease (MDs), which are also characterized by hypoglycemia and hyperlactate.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u>\n\nThe disease cannot be diagnosed clinically, and genetic testing alone can provide a definitive diagnosis. Globally, approximately 40 different pathogenic variants have been reported thus far in the FBP1 gene, including missense variants, indels, splice variants, single exon deletions, and complete gene deletions, with significant differences that vary by region and ethnicity.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup><sup><a>3</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><sup><a>5</a></sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> Our report detected c.977(exon7)T>C and c.778(exon6)G>A heterozygous variants, of which c.778(exon6)G>A was previously reported in 4 cases.删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u></sup><sup>,</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> However, c.977(exon7)T>C is a new mutation that has not been previously reported, and the detection of this variant enriches the spectrum of FBP1 gene variants. The results of the genealogical analysis of the children in this study suggest that the mutated locus originated from the parents who were carriers of each locus. This result was consistent with the AR mode of inheritance. AR is characterized by the presence of an autosomal gene with an equal chance of occurrence in both sexes (independent of sex). It is mostly disseminated, with multiple affected siblings and 2 parents who are usually unaffected and are carriers of the gene. The risk of recurrence is 1/4, and there is a 2/3 chance that a phenotypically normal child will be a carrier. Therefore, the parents in this study are still at a 1/4 risk of having another affected child and may opt for a preimplantation genetic diagnosis or prenatal diagnosis. We recommend that if a child is diagnosed, his or her siblings should be tested for gene mutations simultaneously to assist in early diagnosis and avoid critical illness.\n\nOnce the diagnosis is established, treatment is simple. During the acute attack period, hypoglycemia should be actively corrected and various metabolic disorders secondary to hypoglycemia should be suppressed. Intravenous glucose, sodium bicarbonate, and rehydration can be administered to maintain a blood glucose concentration of 4 to 5 mmol/L, and starvation should be avoided. In cases of fever, infection, and stress, the number of feedings should be increased, raw corn starch should be consumed, and continuous nasogastric tube feeding should be administered if blood glucose levels cannot be maintained. After the above treatment, most children can return to normal mental status and activity approximately 5 to 7 days after the onset of the disease. Pinto et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> studied international practices in the dietary management of patients with FBPase deficiency and concluded that they were managed on a fructose- and sucrose-free diet with added cornstarch and frequent feeding and glucose monitoring at home, with excellent prognosis. However, this is only possible if the diagnosis is timely and accurate. A prospective study by Bhai et al删除7：<u><sup>[</sup><sup>通用删除4(英):<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u></sup><sup>]</sup></u> found that among 15 diagnosed patients, only 1 death occurred after diagnosis and 3 deaths occurred prior to diagnosis. All surviving children are healthy and develop normally with an appropriate diet.\n\n5\\. Conclusion\n--------------\n\nFBPase deficiency was an overlooked cause of hypoglycemia and acidosis in our report because GSD and MD were initially suspected, which led to a delay in the diagnosis. It is important to consider this diagnosis as soon as possible for any child with recurrent hypoglycemia or acidosis. It is also important to increase the awareness of general pediatricians regarding this disease, as it is easy to treat with a good prognosis. Therefore, the development of early molecular diagnostics is important.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe thank all staff and nurses who were involved in the patients’ care.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nShanye Zou and Xing Wen: data collection.

Nausea and vomiting are 2 prevalent and troubling adverse effects of cancer patients during chemoradiotherapy, named Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV). Vomiting occurs in more than 90% of patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Approximately 30% to 90% of patients undergoing moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) will experience CINV.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Control of nausea and vomiting plays an important role in chemotherapy for malignant tumors. In a survey study, The main reason for antiemetic treatment failure was underestimating the emetogenicity of chemotherapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> It leads to poor compliance, increases anxiety and depression, and decreases the quality of life.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> Patients always putting off or completely refusing chemotherapy because of the afraid of CINV. Antiemetic drugs such as the 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and Olanzapine are commonly used in the treatment of CINV. Despite progress in antiemetic development, many patients still experience CINV.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Although it can relieve nausea and vomiting to a certain extent, other side effects such as constipation, elevations of serum aminotransferases and headache appeared. Such antiemetic treatment failure could be explained by genetic polymorphisms.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Uncontrolled CINV may increase unnecessary healthcare costs, aggravate burden on medical and nursing resources, and prolong hospitalizations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u></a></sup> So more treatments need to be found. The effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of CINV has been demonstrated in clinical studies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10–12]</u></a></sup> Traditional Chinese medicine treatments including acupuncture and moxibustion have been recognized by more and more countries.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14]</u></a></sup>\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\nThis systematic review protocol has been registered on PROSPERO . The registration number is CRD42021225872. This protocol was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol (PRISMA-P). Ethical approval is unnecessary because this is a literature-based study.\n\n### 2.1 Inclusion criteria for study selection\n\n#### 2.1.1 Types of studies\n\nAll randomised trials will be considered for inclusion, Because of the characteristics of acupuncture, blinding will not be considered. The languages were restricted to Chinese and English. Non-RCTs, quasi-randomized trials, reviews, case reports, secondary analysis, animal experiments, or trials without full texts were excluded.\n\n#### 2.1.2 Types of participants\n\nCancer patients who suffered from nausea and vomiting after receiving chemotherapy will be included in the study. There will be no limits for age, gender, ethnic origin, and educational or economic status among patients. Patients with nausea and vomiting caused by other reasons, will be excluded.\n\n#### 2.1.3 Types of intervention\n\nInterventions using all types of acupuncture includes electroacupuncture, ear acupuncture and so on for CINV. The control group was treated with commonly used western medicine (5HT3 antagonists, NK-1 antagonists and glucocorticoid etc), placebo or no intervention measures. If the experimental group and the control group used the same western medicine treatment drugs can also be included.\n\n#### 2.1.4 Types of outcome measures\n\n##### 2.1.4.1 Primary outcomes\n\nNausea and vomiting severity and frequency in 7 days after chemotherapy. Any valid scales will be put into use, such as National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events: N&V and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 etc.\n\n##### 2.1.4.2 Secondary outcomes\n\nThe secondary outcomes are defined as any adverse events and quality of life, which are measured by Arnofsky scale.\n\n### 2.2 Data sources\n\nOur systematic review will search all RCTs on acupuncture treatment for nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy. We will search the following electronic databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, EBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang (Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform), VIP (Chinese Scientific and Technological Journal Database and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database. The languages were restricted to Chinese and English. All sources to be searched from the earliest date until December 2020. Manually search for the grey literature, including conference proceedings.\n\n### 2.3 Search strategy\n\nTwo reviewers (CDD and HXB) will independently search the studies in electronic databases according to the systematic review protocol. According to intervention, patients, and study type, the following search terms are used: acupuncture, nausea, vomiting, chemotherapy, CINV, randomized, randomized controlled trial and so on. The search strategy will be adapted to different databases demands.\n\n### 2.4 Data collection and analysis\n\n#### 2.4.1 Data extraction and management\n\nA small number of trials without prominent divergence will be included in this systematic review, and all the records will be put into the EndNote X8 software after the electronic search stage. The data will be extracted by 2 researchers (CTF and WD) independently using a predefined data extraction form. Two researchers will screen titles and abstracts independently in order to determine which trials should be excluded. The full text will be examined if necessary. The following aspects will be considered: general information (year of publication, author's details etc.), participations, inventions, comparisons, outcomes, adverse events and other information. If there is any disagreement, 2 authors will resolve the issue by discussion, and if there is any further disagreement, a third author (XH)will arbitrate. The process of study selection is summarized in a PRISMA flow diagram .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nThe PRISMA flow diagram of study selection process.</u>\n\n#### 2.4.2 Assessment of risk of bias\n\nThis will be conducted using the Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias tool. Two authors (CBX and WYY) will estimate domain risk of bias as follows: sequence generation of randomized, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data and selective outcome report, and other sources of bias. If there are any disagreements, they will be resolved by the third author (CHZ).\n\n#### 2.4.3 Dealing with missing data\n\nWe will attempt to contact the author of the articles to obtain the missing data. We will explain the situation and use the available data to accomplish our analysis if it cannot be obtained.\n\n#### 2.4.4 2.4.4. Assessment of reporting bias\n\nWe will only use funnel plots to assess the presence of publication bias. Reporting bias could be also assessed by using Egger test<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> and Begger's analysis.\n\n#### 2.4.5 Sensitivity analysis\n\nWhen sufficient trials are available, sensitivity analysis will be performed by sequentially eliding each trial to check the robustness of the final results.\n\n#### 2.4.6 Strategy for data synthesis\n\nRevMan V.5.3 software will be used in data synthesis. We will express dichotomous data in relative risk and continuous data in mean difference or standardized mean difference. The fixed-effect model will be put into use if _I_<sup>2</sup> < 50% or _I_<sup>2</sup> > 75%, _I_<sup>2</sup> < 50% will be classified as having low heterogeneity, whereas those with _I_<sup>2</sup> > 75% will be classified as having high heterogeneity. When _I_<sup>2</sup> > 75%, we will then perform a subgroup analysis or a sensitivity analysis.\n\n#### 2.4.7 2.4.7. Subgroup analysis\n\nAcupuncture treatment with 2 types of CINV (Acute CINV and Delayed CINV) will be conducted as subgroup analysis if possible.\n\n#### 2.4.8 Grading the quality of evidence\n\nWe will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to evaluate the quality of evidence which is classified into 4 levels: very low, low, moderate, or high.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThis study protocol adopts the methods of evidence-based medicine to evaluate the overall safety and effectiveness of acupuncture treatment CINV. Acupuncture therapy, as an important external treatment in Chinese medicine, is based on the theory of meridians and collaterals of Chinese medicine. It plays a role in regulating the whole body by stimulating the acupoints on the meridians and collaterals. There are a lot of records about acupuncture treatment of vomiting in ancient Chinese medicine books. (CV12) Zhongwan, (ST36) Zusanli and P6 (Neiguan) are considered to be the main acupoints for treating nausea and vomiting.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16–18]</u></a></sup> Zusanli (ST36) is 1 of the main acupoints of the stomach meridian of Zuyangming. It is often used for digestive system diseases in clinical practice and has significant curative effect. Its main effect is to generate stomach qi and dry spleen dampness. Modern medicine believes that Zusanli has a regulatory effect on the digestive system and immune system.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup>\n\nZhongwan(CV12) is the intersection of hand Taiyin, Shaoyang, foot Yangming and Ren pulse. It mainly treats stomach diseases and has the function of dredging the movement of central Qi. The Neiguan connects the Yin dimension meridian, and the Yin dimension meridian connects the foot Taiyin, Shaoyin and Jueyin meridians and meets the Ren vein and the Yangming meridian. The above meridians pass through the chest and abdomen. It is the main acupoints for the treatment of heart disease and stomach disease.Besides, Studies have shown that the improvement of acupuncture in patients with nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy may be related to the regulation of peripheral substance P content.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup>\n\nThere are still some limitations in this study. Different drugs or different chemotherapy regimens may lead to bias in this study. At present, there is a lack of large-sample, multi-center related clinical studies, and the quality of the literature searched is not high, which may also lead to inaccurate conclusions.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThis work was supported by the Science and Technology Project of Fenghua Science and Technology Bureau (NO: 20186515).\n\nThe funders had no influence on the study design, data collection and analysis, as well as the right to publish.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Dan-Dan Chen, Xianbing Hou.\n\n**Data curation:** Tong-Fei Cheng, Dan Wang.\n\n**Investigation:** Xiao-Jun Dai, Yao Wang.\n\n**Methodology:** Bi-Xian Cui, Yuan-Yuan Wang.\n\n**Supervision:** Hong-Zhou Chen, Hui Xu.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Xianbing Hou, Dan-Dan Chen.\n\n**Writing – review & editing**: Xianbing Hou, Dan-Dan Chen.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:05:22", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:06:31", "cost": 68.849}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:17", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:06:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:05:21"}

Their work provided preliminary data on the excellent safety and efficacy profile of enoxaparin in the treatment of thrombosis in pediatric population. They discovered 2 important concepts in relation to dosing and monitoring of enoxaparin in neonates and children. First, neonates required a higher dose of enoxaparin (1.64 mg/kg/dose twice daily) compared to older children (1 mg/kg/dose twice daily) to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation, evaluated by anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) levels. Second, enoxaparin therapy must be monitored with anti-Xa levels and not activated partial thromboplastin time. In the therapeutic range of 0.5–1.0 u/mL, enoxaparin has minimal effect on activated partial thromboplastin time.\n\nSubsequent to the above work, many investigators have studied the use of enoxaparin and other LMWHs, including dalteparin, tinzaparin and nadroparin, prospectively.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2–5]</u></a></sup> The common emerging theme in all of the studies was that neonates required higher dosing to maintain therapeutic anti-Xa levels compared to older children . These papers form the basis of the most current dosing guidelines by the American College of Chest Physicians.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Enoxaparin is dosed at 1.5 mg/kg for treatment and 0.75 mg/kg for prophylaxis in neonates (<2 months age) and at 1.0 mg/kg for treatment and 0.5 mg/kg for prophylaxis in children (>2 months age). Subsequent to the initial studies, there have been more reports suggesting that neonates may require even higher enoxaparin doses to attain and maintain therapeutic anti-Xa levels. A literature review by Malowany et al. in 2008 suggested to increase enoxaparin doses to 1.7 mg/kg for term and 2.0 mg/kg for premature neonates. Since 2008, few studies have replicated this finding. Of note Bauman et al. compared 75 neonates treated with an initial enoxaparin dose of 1.5 mg/kg or 1.7 mg/kg.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> They found that those neonates treated with 1.7 mg/kg dose had a therapeutic anti-Xa level of 0.57 units/mL (u/mL), with no patients being supratherapeutic. And it took only 1 day versus 2 days for those treated at the lower dose to reach the therapeutic range. Hicks et al. and Chander et al. had similar findings in their cohort.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u></a></sup> These 2 studies also included premature neonates and found that these patients required an even higher enoxaparin dose of 2.0 to 2.2 mg/kg to maintain therapeutic anti-Xa levels. There is substantial evidence in the literature to suggest that premature and term neonates require higher dosing of enoxaparin in order to achieve therapeutic anti-Xa levels.\n\nTable 1 - Schedule of procedures/evaluations.\n\n| Evaluation | Screening | Randomization | Baseline visit | Treatment Visits | Study Completion |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Screening (Inclusion/Exclusion) | X |  |  |  |  |\n| Medical/Medication History | X |  |  |  |  |\n| Consent | X |  |  |  |  |\n| Randomization |  | X |  |  |  |\n| Demographics |  |  | X |  |  |\n| Diagnosis |  |  | X |  |  |\n| Imaging (at diagnosis) |  |  | X |  |  |\n| Imaging (Head U/S) |  |  | X |  |  |\n| Platelet count |  |  | X |  |  |\n| INR |  |  | X |  |  |\n| aPTT |  |  | X |  |  |\n| Treatment |  |  |  | X |  |\n| Anti-Xa levels |  |  |  | Xa |  |\n| Dose Titration |  |  |  | Xa |  |\n| Concomitant Medications |  | X | X | X | X |\n| AEs/SAEs | X | X | X | X | X |\n| Imaging (Follow-up) |  |  |  |  | X |\n\naPTT = activated partial thromboplastin time, Xa = not mandatory, see protocol for detail.\n\nMonitoring of LMWH therapy in neonates and children has been an ongoing challenge. The therapeutic range of anti-Xa (0.50–1.0 u/mL) used by Massicotte et al. was extrapolated from adult studies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> These parameters have since been adopted by the American College of Chest Physicians consensus guidelines and used by other research studies. There is limited evidence correlating anti-Xa levels with resolution of thrombosis or incidence of hemorrhage. Additionally, there is significant variability among commonly used anti-Xa assays in clinical practice. There are 2 types of anti-Xa assay:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> with exogenous AT added and\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> without exogenous AT.\n\nThe addition of exogenous AT allows measurement of the LMWH effect without the influence of AT deficiency (if present), whereas the anti-Xa assay without exogenous AT allows measurement of the _in vivo_ LMWH effect.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Studies comparing different anti-Xa assays found a lack of correlation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u></a></sup> In a recent study published by Greene et al. the authors showed that changing anti-Xa assays resulted in an average 33% change in the anti-Xa values, which significantly affected the dosing of enoxaparin for the treated patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> For patients aged <3 months, there was a 0.35 mg/kg change in the mean enoxaparin dosing to maintain therapeutic anti-Xa levels before and after the anti-Xa assay change at the author's institution.\n\nAlong with methodical issues surrounding the use of anti-Xa assays, there are important clinical and resource issues to consider. The need for multiple venipunctures for blood sampling required to monitor anti-Xa levels is a significant cause for pain in neonates and children<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> and a frustration for health care professionals charged with finding accessible veins frequently. Also, many centers that treat neonates and children with thrombosis do not have the finances to afford resources, such as equipment, anti-Xa assays, and personnel, required for the testing. These centers routinely treat patients with a weight-adjusted fixed dose of enoxaparin. There is no evidence at present to suggest that this is an effective or safe approach. There is, hence, the need to systematically study the utility of anti-Xa monitoring in pediatric population.\n\n### 1.1 Aims\n\nThe aim of this trial is to determine the feasibility and safety of doing a randomized control trial to compare the approach of treating thrombosis in neonates and children with enoxaparin using weight adjusted fixed dose to variable dose titrated to maintain a pre-determined anti-Xa range (0.5–1.0 u/mL).\n\n2 Methods/design\n----------------\n\nThis protocol has been designed in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items Recommendations for Interventional Trials 2013 guidelines.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> Recruitment was start following institutional REB approval and Health Canada approval. This will occur over 1 year per center and may take up to 2 years. Analysis and dissemination will occur after this period of time.\n\n### 2.1 Study design\n\nThe FiXed dose of Enoxaparin for pediatric Thrombosis trial is a prospective pilot, feasibility and safety multicenter, randomized controlled trial.\n\n### 2.2 Study setting and participants\n\nFour or more tertiary hospitals will participate in this trial. We plan to recruit a total of 20 patients based on the following protocol-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Figure 1 outlines the process of patient identification and recruitment.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nProposed process for screening, recruiting, treating and following a subject. <sup>∗</sup>Enoxaparin dosing:  - Neonates <36 completed weeks CGA: 2.0 mg/kg/dose rounded to nearest whole mg twice daily.  - Neonates ≥37 completed week CGA: 1.7 mg/kg/dose rounded to nearest whole mg twice daily.  - Children aged ≥1 month corrected age: 1.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maybe rounded +/− 10% for convenience of dosing).  - Children aged ≥2 month corrected age: 1.0 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maybe rounded +/− 10% for convenience of dosing).  - If the treating physician would like to round the dose in a manner contrary to the suggestion mentioned here for clinical reasons, he/she may do so after discussion with the study PI. <sup>#</sup>Anti-Xa level measured in u/ml. <sup>†</sup>Routine follow-up includes: - Anti-Xa level at least once monthly.  - Appropriate imaging according to institutional guidelines. <sup>‡</sup>Enoxaparin dose will be titrated as per institutional guidelines 3</u>\n\n#### 2.2.1 Inclusion criteria\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Birth to under 18 years of age at the diagnosis of thrombosis event\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis confirmed by either venography or ultrasound, pulmonary embolism confirmed by ventilation perfusion scan or spiral CT scan or pulmonary angiogram, clinically stable cerebral sinovenous thrombosis confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging, or cardiac thrombosis diagnosed by echocardiogram.\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> The treating team has decided to initiate anti-coagulation therapy for the treatment of thrombosis.\n\n#### 2.2.2 Exclusion criteria\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Platelet count < 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Hemorrhage or high risk of bleeding with the use of anticoagulation therapy;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Creatinine > 1.5× upper limit of normal;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Liver dysfunction associated with coagulopathy leading to a clinically relevant bleeding risk;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Documented history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia;\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> Known contraindication to heparin.\n\n### 2.3 Sample size\n\nThe purpose of the larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be to establish non-inferiority of administering weight adjusted fixed dose of enoxaparin in comparison to variable dose titrated to maintain anti-Xa levels of 0.5 to 1.0 u/mL. Considering a difference of less than 10% of no clinical importance and using 80% as the estimated complete/partial response rate for both groups, the sample size required to achieve an 80% power at an alpha of 0.05 would be 396 subjects.\n\nIn order to conduct the RCT among 10 to 12 centers over 3 years, the expected accrual would be 0.9 to 1.1 subjects per month per center, depending on the size of the center. In this trial, we plan to assess feasibility of recruiting at least 5 subjects over the study period per center. The overall sample size would be 20 subjects.\n\n### 2.4 Enrollment and randomization\n\nAll patients will be enrolled and randomized within the first week of their enoxaparin treatment. Informed consent and assent (where applicable) will be obtained participants and/or their substitute decision makers (ex. Parents). The randomization sequence will be generated by a computer program at a ratio of 1:1 among the two arms using simple randomization. Patient's enoxaparin treatment will start to follow this study protocol after the randomization .\n\n### 2.5 Allocation concealment and blinding\n\nThe current pilot study will be open label and there will not be concealment beyond allocation. The larger RCT will be blinded and allocation concealed in most appropriate manner as deemed by the study team and statistician.\n\n### 2.6 Treatment protocol\n\nThe enoxaparin dose for patients will be based on current available evidence. The evidence for higher dose in premature and term neonates is as discussed in the background section.\n\nIf documented weight change occurs in patients on the interventional arm, their dose will be adjusted accordingly. The dose change applies to both increased weight and decreased weight circumstances and there is no limitation in the number of time a patient's dose can be changed during the study period. Patients will have blood sampling for anti-Xa levels drawn after the 3rd<sup>rd</sup> or 4th dose from starting, followed by at least once monthly testing. Patients will have appropriate imaging according to institutional guidelines, which must include at least end of treatment imaging. The duration of enoxaparin therapy will be at the discretion of the treating physician. Enrollment and follow-up procedures are detailed in Table 1.\n\n### 2.7 Interventions\n\nThis trial will have two arms as below.\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Arm A will be the experimental arm where patients will not have any dose titration regardless of anti-Xa level.

Demographic parameters, if normally distributed, will be reported as mean with standard deviation and compared using Student _t_ test or analysis of variance. Non-normally distributed data will be reported as median with interquartile range and compared with appropriate non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis 1 way analysis of variance). Categorical data will be reported as number and percentage and compared using a chi-square or Fisher exact tests where indicated. A two-sided _P_ value of .05 will be used to indicate statistical significance.\n\n### 2.11 Data collection and management\n\nData will be collected by trained research staff at each trial site in an electronic case report form. Electronic data will be stored on a password protected computer. Completed case report forms will be sent to the principal investigator at McMaster Children's Hospital, where it will be inputted into a central trial database. Data will be kept for 10 years, at which time it will be deleted by formatting of hard drive.\n\n### 2.12 Data safety and monitoring\n\nAn independent Data Safety and Monitoring Committee has been established to monitor adverse events. The principle investigator or a designate will be available by telephone during the trial and parents will be provided with contact details in case of any adverse events. Parents will also be interviewed at the time of their routine clinic visit to ascertain the occurrence of any adverse events. Serious adverse events will be recorded separately and followed up until resolution.\n\n### 2.13 Trial modification and discontinuation\n\nEthics approval will be sought for any protocol changes that are felt to be necessary by the research team during the trial. Once approved, amendments will be notified to all investigators and parents. Parents are allowed to discontinue their child's inclusion in the trial at any point or following an unexpected serious adverse event. The data safety and monitoring committee will perform an interim analysis specifically assessing adverse events after 50% of subjects have been recruited. Otherwise, the trial will cease follow-up after all patients have completed anticoagulation therapy.\n\n### 2.14 Ethics approval and trial registration\n\nThe trial has been approved by Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics board (HIREB Ref: 15-002). All participating trial sites will be required to obtain ethics approval from their local research ethics board. A No Objection Letter has been received from Health Canada for version 10 (September, 2019). The trial has also been registered with clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02486666.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThe administration of weight adjusted fixed dose of enoxaparin without anti-Xa monitoring has the potential to reduce pain from multiple venipunctures in neonates and children as well as resources used in their care. The results of the FiXed dose of Enoxaparin for pediatric Thrombosis trial will provide preliminary clinical data regarding the feasibility and safety of this approach to anticoagulation treatment in neonates and children. It will also provide a preliminary idea about the efficacy of such an approach. This trial, if successful, will set groundwork for a larger multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of administering enoxaparin to neonates and children without monitoring to the current conventional approach of routine monitoring with anti-Xa levels. The results of this trial will be disseminated through presentations at international conferences (ex. International Society of Thrombosis Hemostasis (ISTH) and through publication of manuscript.\n\n### 3.1 Trial status\n\nHealth Canada and research ethics board (REB) approvals at McMaster Children's Hospital (Hamilton), IWK Health Center (Halifax) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia) have been received.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe would like to thank Dr. Sandesh Shivananda (Neonatologist) for offering his expert perspective during the initial conception of this study.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nThe idea of the trial was conceived by MDB and AKC.

One of the complications following TURP is urethral stricture formation. The incidence of urethral strictures after TURP varies between 2.2 and 9.8%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> There are methods including urethral dilation with urethral sounds, direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU), and urethral reconstruction for relieving the stricture.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> On comparison of the above treatments, urethral sounding was found to be the most timesaving method.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> The rates of complications and failures are similar between urethral sounding and DVIU. The main complications following DVIU include recurrence, urethral hemorrhage, perineal hematoma, extravasation of fluid into perispongiosal tissues, and scrotal abscesses. There are studies, which suggest that long-term success rates are much higher for urethral reconstruction (85%–90%) than for urethrotomy (20%–30%).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> The risk factors associated with failure after urethral reconstruction include anastomotic tension, incomplete excision of scar tissue, inadequate graft blood supply, and the presence of lichen sclerosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> In order to diminish the complications, such as necrotic grafts and recurrent urethrocutaneous fistula (UCF), scrotal skin island and pudendal thigh flaps were performed after infection control to manage the urethral stricture.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u></a></sup>\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 66-year-old man with no underlying chronic diseases visited the urology outpatient department with complaints of increased urinary frequency and incomplete emptying for 3 years. He had severe lower urinary tract symptoms; based on the International Prostate Symptom Score, he had a score of 28 out of 35. He was on oral tamsulosin supplements (0.4 mg, every night). There was no evidence of hypospadias, chordee, or lichen sclerosis on physical examination. The prostate volume was 60 mL on transrectal ultrasound. The prostate specific antigen level was 1.32 ng/mL. Uroflowmetry revealed a 6 mL/sec Qmax, 3 mL/sec Qaverage, and 160 mL post-void residual urine. No vesical stone was found in the kidney, ureter, and bladder on radiograph. He underwent TURP due to a poor response to oral medication. The prostate, with a 25-mg volume, was resected. The postoperative urinary frequency and a weak stream persisted for 2 weeks. The Qmax and Qaverage were re-evaluated and found to be 5 mL/sec and 4 mL/sec, respectively. Therefore, cystoscopy was carried out, and a pin-hole penile urethral stricture was found. Urethral sounding was performed twice. In view of the worsening symptoms, DVIU was subsequently performed. He developed a UCF, 5 cm from the meatus, along with periurethral and scrotal abscesses . He then came to our hospital for further management.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nThe first stage of the urethral reconstruction.

After 6 months, re-epithelialization of the urethral plate led to a decrease in the urethral plate defect from 4 cm to 2 cm . In the second phase, we spent 5 hours to perform urethral reconstruction. The scrotal skin island flap  was used as the urethral plate, and a pudendal thigh flap, supplied by the internal pudendal artery , was merged over the outer layer to lessen the skin tension. The length and width of the scrotal skin island flap was 3 × 2 cm and that of the pudendal thigh flap was 15 × 5 cm. The penis and the drainage were kept pointing upward for 2 weeks . The patient was confined to bedrest 3 weeks to allow for better recovery of the wound.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nThe second stage of the urethral reconstruction.

No urethral stricture was found after cystoscopy on postoperative day 56. The complications resulting from TURP, urethral sounding, and DVIU had resolved. After a follow-up period of 2 years, there was no evidence of urinary retention nor incomplete emptying. All oral medications had been discontinued. However, there was minimal residual paresthesia from the medial thigh to the left hemi-scrotal skin.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThere are many treatments available for urethral strictures, including urethral dilation with urethral sounds, DVIU, and urethral reconstruction. Urethral dilation and DVIU are the most commonly used methods, but the success rate is low (20%–30%). On the other hand, urethral reconstruction has a higher success rate (85%–90%) and is considered the gold standard.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> In our case, this was complicated by an iatrogenic UCF accompanied by infection. Hence, we did not deal with the urethral stricture and UCF simultaneously. In view of poor wound healing after infection, we did not use primary anastomosis urethroplasty or buccal mucosa urethroplasty initially. The goal was reduction of the urethral plate defect and clearing the infection. This was achieved by the two-stage surgical strategy used.\n\nIn the second stage, the urethral plate defect diminished to 2 cm from 4 cm. We used a scrotal skin island flap to fill the defect, and a pudendal thigh flap integrated with the outer layer and lessened the skin tension. Initially, we chose the hairless areas of the scrotal skin, tailored the flaps, and epilated the hair follicles. These preparations were done to avoid calcified urethral trichobezoars<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> and urethral diverticulum formation. The scrotal skin island flap was derived as described by Singh and Blandy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Singh and Blandy inferred that the blood supply of tunica dartos was similar to the blood supply of superficial external pudendal vessels. In contrast, a study conducted by Gil Vernet revealed good outcomes with regard to the septal blood supply after using a medial scrotal skin island.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe pudendal thigh flap is usually used to cover vulvar skin, scrotal skin, and the perineal region.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u></a></sup> The blood supply to the flap originates from the internal pudendal artery and its perforators. Thus, this is the major benefit of urethral reconstruction, which leads to better wound healing. The abundant coverage not only reinforces the scrotal skin island flap but also keeps the penile urethra watertight. It also lessens the skin tension better than that achieved by primary suturing of the residual scrotal skin.\n\nThe postoperative care is important. In order to avoid wound dehiscence, the patient was kept with the penis pointing upwards and confined to bedrest for 2 and 3 weeks. The wound recovered well because of the decreased movement and overlapping coverage.\n\nIn summary, the advantages of urethral reconstruction with scrotal skin island and pudendal thigh flaps, are that the flaps provide abundant blood supply and less skin tension. The disadvantages are that it is time-consuming and technique sensitive. There is no literature on the indication to use this flap, but, in general, urethral reconstruction of urethral plate defect more than 2 cm can benefit from this flap technique.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Contraindications of flap are previous trauma or surgery, morbid obesity, peripheral vascular disease on the harvest site. Ultimately, we need to consider the possible complications including ejaculatory dysfunction, chordee, wound infections, urinary tract infections, fistula development, neuropraxia, and incontinence.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup>\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nWe would like to thank Editage  for English language editing and publication support.

Although the precise nature of this presumed edema or fluid collection is unclear, they speculated that obesity may play a role in producing such edema. Herein, we discuss the mechanism underlying the development of LSE and describe how traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a modified Maxing Yigan (MYG) formula, which includes _Radix Astragali_ (RA), improved both low back pain and LSE.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 77-year-old woman presented with chronic low back pain that had persisted for several years. She had no objective motor weakness or sensory deficits. Her body mass index (BMI; kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was 25.1 (body weight 60.8 kg, height 155.5 cm), which indicates obesity in Japan (according to the definition of Japan Society for the Study of Obesity). In Asia, the normal BMI is 18.5 to <23, with subjects considered overweight at a BMI of 23.0 to < 25 and obese at a BMI of ≥25.0 (Western Pacific Region WHO criteria). The patient had no conditions, such as cardiac, hepatic, or renal dysfunction, that were considered causative of edema. She had no history of trauma or infectious disease. She had mild findings of lumbar spondylosis but no spondylitis.\n\nSagittal 2D MR myelography (TR/TE, 7000/500 ms), in which high signal intensity is mainly related to free water,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> revealed subcutaneous edema extending from the level of the L2 vertebral body to the sacrum .\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nA: Sagittal 2D MR-myelography (TR/TE, 7000/500 ms) shows subcutaneous edema extending from the level of the L2 vertebral body to the sacrum .

C: Axial T2 weighted MR imaging shows subcutaneous edema in the deep adipose layer at the level of the L5 vertebral body (arrowheads).</u>\n\nAn axial T2- weighted image (TR/TE, 5310/125 ms) showed edema as areas of high signal intensity, triangular form of posterior subcutaneous soft-tissue edema (arrowheads) along the deep fascia plane extending to the deep fat layer under the superficial fascia at the level of the L3 vertebral body  and L5 vertebral body .\n\nWe previously reported that a TCM formula, Maxing Yigan (MYG), with the addition of powdered cinnamon bark (CB) and processed aconite root (AR) demonstrated a good effect in the treatment of sciatica.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> This modified formula is hereafter referred to as modified MYG .\n\nTable 1 - Composition of modified Maxing Yigan extract.\n\n| Constituent herbs | Weight (g) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ephedra herb | 4.0 |\n| Apricot kernel | 3.0 |\n| Coix seed | 10.0 |\n| Glycyrrhiza | 2.0 |\n| Cinnamon bark powder | 1.0 |\n| Processed aconite root powder | 1.0 |\n\nMYG is composed of four medicinal herbs: 4.0g of Ephedra herb, 3.0g of Apricot kernel, 10.0g of Coix seed and 2.0g of Glycyrrhiza are dried and boiled in 10 times their weight of water for 1 hour. The resultant extracts were then spray-dried. MYG, CB and AR are manufactured under modern scientific quality controls and they have been approved for ethical use by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan.\n\nIn the present case, we prescribed modified MYG, which consists of MYG (also called makyoyokukanntou in Japanese) 7.5 g/d plus CB (1 g/d) and AR (1 g/d), for the treatment of the patient's low back pain. We did not use any other analgesics or diuretic drugs at all. We recommended the patient perform aerobic exercise, such as with a stationary bike.\n\nWe used the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) to assess the low back pain. The NRS is based on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents no pain and 10 the worst possible pain.\n\nSix months of treatment, including aerobic exercise, riding a stationary bike, etc. had no effect on the patient's low back pain. The NRS was 7 or 8. We thereafter added RA (1 g/day) to the formula. At one month after the addition of RA, her low back pain was found to have markedly improved. The NRS decreases to 1 or 2. MRI also showed a remarkable reduction in the size of the LSE . On sagittal 2D MR myelography, the area of the LSE was measured by drawing a ROI (region of interest) on the image and then using the area measurement function installed in the MRI system. The area of the LSE before treatment  was 806.8 mm<sup>2</sup>, but it became 85.4 mm<sup>2</sup> after treatment . The reduction rate in the LSE was 89.4%.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nSeven months after administration of TCM (at one month after the addition of _Radix Astragali_), subcutaneous edema markedly reduced as seen on sagittal 2D MR myelography (A), axial T2 weighted MRI imaging at the level of the L3 vertebral body (B) and L5 vertebral body (C).</u>\n\n### 2.1 Follow-up\n\nOur prescription was continued for a further 6 months, at which point we confirmed the reduction in the size of the LSE to be 138. 9 mm<sup>2</sup>, equating to an 82.8% reduction rate. Her BMI was 25.6. The NRS was 3. There were no side effects of our prescription.\n\n3 Discussion and conclusion\n---------------------------\n\nOn MRI findings, LSE is observed within the deep adipose layer along the thoracolumbar fascia, covering a triangle-shaped area under the superficial fascia on axial images, with hypointensity on T1imaging and hyperintensity on T2 imaging. In particular, fat-suppressed short tau inversion recovery T2 weighted images are the most sensitive for the detection of LSE.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> However, the precise mechanisms underlying the development of LSE remain unknown.\n\nQuattrocchi et al described that observing a focal sub-fascial triangular shape of LSE suggests a compartmental pathogenesis of edema, which indicates that poor lymphatic drainage is the most reliable hypothesis for the mechanism of this problem.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup>\n\nAnatomically, subcutaneous adipose tissue is separated by the superficial fascia into the superficial and deep adipose layers. The deep adipose layer is contained within a relatively loose, less organized, and more widely spaced fascial septum than the superficial adipose layer.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> This may account for the accumulation of edema at this level.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup>\n\nAccording to Stecco et al,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> the superficial fascia is composed of loosely interwoven irregular connective tissue, in which numerous adipose cells form the panniculus adiposus, which is tightly connected with the superficial veins and lymphatic vessels. The open-ended initial dermal lymphatic vessels are located just above the superficial adipose layer of the skin.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup>\n\nKnowing the strong relationships between the lymph vessels and the superficial fascia, it can be hypothesized that an alteration in the superficial fascia can cause lymphedema.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Indeed, Schwarz-Nemec et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> recently reported that the perifascial presentation of LSE on MRI may suggest a fascial origin. Thus, it is suggested that the condition is termed lumbar perifascial edema rather than subcutaneous edema. Therefore, we hypothesized that the mechanism underlying the development of LSE could involve lymphatic pooling due to alteration of the superficial fascia.\n\nHow does alteration of the lumbar superficial fascia occur? It seems to occur via the perilymphatic inflammatory responses in obese individuals. Shi et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> reported that LSE occurred more frequently and was more severe in heavy patients. They speculated that obesity may play a role in edema production. Quattrocchi et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> also reported that LSE occurred more frequently with increasing BMI, which confirmed the results of Shi et al.\n\nOur patient's BMI was 25.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which indicates obesity in Japan (obesity is defined by the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity as a BMI ≥25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Our prescription did not improve the patient's BMI or obesity; however, it did improve her low back pain and LSE. This indicates that the effect of our prescription was independent of weight loss. It is therefore unlikely that compression of the lymphatic vessels by increasing adipose deposition caused the lymphedema.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that perilymphatic inflammatory responses play a role in the development of obesity-induced lymphatic dysfunction.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup>\n\nWe hypothesized that our prescription suppressed perilymphatic inflammation of the hypertrophic adipose layer at the lumbar superficial fascia. Our prescription was based on the TCM formula MYG, which was indicated for Wind-Humidity disease in the Synopsis of prescriptions of the Golden chamber edited by Zhang Zhonging approximately one thousand years ago. In MYG, coix seed, which is often used to expel dampness or edema, is an important herb.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> To enhance this effect of coix seed, we added CB and processed AR to the MYG formula, which was named modified MYG.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that modified MYG has a good effect on chronic sciatica.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> We therefore prescribed modified MYG to treat the patient's low back pain. However, the modified MYG had no therapeutic effect for six months, even in conjunction with aerobic exercise. Therefore, we added RA to the prescription. One month later, the patient's low back pain and LSE both markedly improved. It seemed that coix seed in the modified MYG and RA worked together to remove the LSE.\n\nClassically, RA is prescribed in combination with other Chinese medicinal herbs. When CB and RA are used together, they are reported to perform the function of dredging through the Yang, removing obstruction and stimulating vital resistance.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> We suspect that RA might have acted as a major ingredient in the removal of LSE.\n\nAlthough modern pharmacological studies indicate that the dry root extract of RA shows anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and anticarcinogenic properties,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> the first documented record regarding RA dates as far back as the 2nd century CE, when Shen Nong's _Materia Medica_ was written in China. RA was reported to be used for the treatment of carbuncle or furuncle (welling -and -flat abscesses) and to remove pus and stop pain.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> Since then, RA has been considered to improve inflammation in subcutaneous lesions.\n\nHespe et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> found that obesity significantly decreases the number of dermal lymphatics and that this response is ameliorated by aerobic exercise, independent of weight loss. They also pointed out that the perilymphatic accumulation of inflammatory cells (T cells and macrophages) and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) play a key role in the regulation of obesity-related lymphatic dysfunction.\n\nKataru et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> reported that the loss of nitric oxide (NO) gradients around the collecting lymphatic vessels due to the high expression of iNOS by perilymphatic inflammatory cells impairs lymphatic pumping and results in the dilatation of the collecting lymphatic vessels.\n\nUsing a lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage cell model, it was reported that a number of herbs in modified MYG, including RA, may reduce NO and iNOS levels. That is, the aqueous extract of RA inhibits the production of NO, which may be associated with the inhibition of iNOS mRNA expression.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup>\n\nCoixol, a plant polyphenol extracted from coix seed, effectively reduces the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, NO, and iNOS.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Glabridin, an isoflavan from Glycyrrhiza, inhibits NO production and iNOS gene expression in murine macrophages.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> Chung et al also reported that the production of iNOS induced by lipopolysaccharide was significantly inhibited by the Cinnamomi cortex extract, suggesting that it inhibits NO production by suppressing iNOS expression.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> In addition to NO, obese adipose tissue also secretes various inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> which induce chronic inflammation. These cytokines stimulate the secretion of chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, which further enhances the recruitment of macrophages and amplifies the inflammatory response.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup>\n\nHoo et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> showed that the active fraction of RA reduced the expression of macrophage markers (inflammatory cell markers CD68 and F4/80) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) in adipose tissue, indicating an ameliorating effect on chronic inflammation in db/db diabetic mice. RA is a major ingredient in Fang-Ji-Huang-Qi-Tang (FJHQT), which is one of the classic TCM formulas. Han et al demonstrated that FJHQT decoction could delay the progression of osteoarthritis by regulating lymphatic drain function.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup>\n\nTaken together, these studies suggest that our prescription, modified MYG, including RA, suppressed perilymphatic inflammation due to obesity, and improved lymphatic function.\n\nIn conclusion, we herein showed that one type of TCM, namely modified MYG including RA, improved low back pain. MRI also confirmed that LSE was remarkably decreased. Therefore, modified MYG, including RA, might have a suppressive effect on perilymphatic inflammation of the hypertrophic adipose layer at the lumbar superficial fascia, thereby improving lymphatic drainage. This suppressive effect may have resulted in the decreased perilymphatic accumulation of inflammatory cells and iNOS by the synergistic effect of our prescription and aerobic exercise. Further investigations are required to support this hypothesis.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nKN conceived the case report, drafted, and revised the manuscript.

Using a data extraction form in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond). We will extract the following items: data for study identification (the last name of first author, publication year and country); details about the participants (age, gender, height, and height percentile); sample size; details about the interventions (treatment group, control group, duration of the intervention, and composition of HM, if possible); outcome measures; results; and adverse events. Any discrepancies will be discussed with a third researcher (HLL) until consensus is reached.\n\n#### 2.5.3 Risk of bias assessment\n\nTwo researchers (SBS and HLL) will independently assess the risk of bias for the included studies in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook criteria, version 5.2.0. Each of the seven items included in the Cochrane Handbook criteria will be scored in letters ‘L’, ‘U’, and ‘H’, meaning “low risk,” “unclear,” and “high risk,” respectively. The disagreement will be discussed with a third review author (JAL) until a consensus is reached. In cases of unclear information, the authors will be contacted for clarification.\n\n#### 2.5.4 Data synthesis\n\nAll statistical analyses will be performed using the software program Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.3 for Windows (Copenhagen, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, the Cochrane Collaboration, 2012). We will assess the differences between the intervention and control groups. For dichotomous data, we will present outcomes as the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we will measure the effects of treatment as the mean difference with 95% CI. If the studies present the result on different scales, we will use the standard mean difference with 95% CI. We will use the GRADEpro software to create a table of findings.\n\n#### 2.5.5 Dealing with missing data\n\nIf individual patient data are not available, we will review the original of published trial report to obtain it and contact the corresponding authors of the studies to acquire and verify data.\n\n#### 2.5.6 Assessment of heterogeneity\n\nWe will perform a meta-analysis using random or fixed effects models based on our data analyses of the collected data. We will evaluate the heterogeneity of the study using Chi-square and I<sup>2</sup> tests, and analyse that I<sup>2</sup>\\>50% indicates high heterogeneity. IF heterogeneity is presented, a subgroup analyses will be performed to find the possible causes of heterogeneity.\n\n#### 2.5.7 Reporting biases assessment\n\nIf the number of included studies is sufficient (at least 10 trials), the funnel plots will generated to detect reporting biases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> We will also aim to identify the possible reasons for asymmetry in funnel plots, including poor methodological quality and true heterogeneity.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nIn East Asian countries, various HM therapies and GH therapy are currently used for the treatment of paediatric SS patients in clinical settings. However, systematic reviews comparing the effectiveness and safety of GH and CHG are rare. In addition, research and clinical practice guidelines on CHG are rare. Therefore, we will attempt to collect and evaluate available evidence for clinical practice guideline development by comparing the effectiveness and safety of GH and CHG.\n\nWe believe that the findings will help clinicians decide the appropriate treatment for SS, develop clinical practice guidelines, and provide paediatric SS patients with a wide range of evidence-based therapy options.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Hye Lim Lee.\n\n**Funding acquisition:** Hye Lim Lee.\n\n**Methodology:** Soo Bo Shim, Ju Ah Lee, Hye Lim Lee.\n\n**Supervision:** Hye Lim Lee.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Soo Bo Shim.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Hye Ri Ahn, Ju Ah Lee, Hye Lim Lee.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:43:50", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:44:17", "cost": 27.092}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:17", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:44:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:43:49"}

She had no significant medical history except for a surgical intervention for uterine leiomyoma. Arterial hypertension was diagnosed when she was 40 years old. At the time of the visit, the patient was taking 6 antihypertensive drugs (Ramipril 10 mg once daily, Irbesartan 300 mg once daily, Amlodipine 30 mg twice daily, Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, Spironolactone 25 mg once daily, Nebivolol 5 mg, Clonidine transdermal 5 mg once week), hypolipidemic agent (Atorvastatin 20 mg) and aspirin. Despite this large pharmacological treatment, blood pressure was elevated (152/92 mm Hg). Physical examination revealed a body mass index of 28.5 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Her laboratory analyses were normal except for plasma sodium at 144mmol/l and plasma potassium at 3.4 mmol/l . During the hospitalization, we performed a complete instrumental examination for screening of asymptomatic organ damage. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 70 ppm. Transthoracic echocardiograph showed an increase in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic diameter (61 mm, normal value = 37–56 mm), left atrium (42 mm, normal value = 19–40), interventricular septal (IVS) thickness (13 mm, normal value = 6–11 mm) and indexed left ventricular mass (170 g/m<sup>2</sup>, normal value<95 g/m<sup>2</sup>) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%. Furthermore, ophthalmoscopy examination showed the presence of grade I hypertensive retinopathy. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was 52 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, indicating a stage 3 CKD and the 24-hour daily protein excretion was 850 mg/d. The 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed a systo-diastolic hypertension without physiological nocturnal fall (non-dipper pattern).\n\nTable 1 - Patient's laboratory examinations.\n\n| Serum parameters | Results |\n| --- | --- |\n| Glucose _(_mg/dL_)_ | 123 (nv: 70–110) |\n| 2-hours post load glucose _(_mg/dL_)_ | 92 (nv: < 200) |\n| Urea _(_mg/dL_)_ | 71 (nv:10–50) |\n| Creatinine _(_mg/dL_)_ | 1.11 (nv: 0.5–1.0) |\n| Total-Cholesterol (mg/dL_)_ | 172 (nv:<200) |\n| HDL-Cholesterol _(_mg/dL_)_ | 42 (nv: >45) |\n| LDL-Cholesterol (mg/dL_)_ | 115 (nv: < 130) |\n| Triglycerides (mg/dL) | 138 (nv: < 150) |\n| Serum Iron (mg/dL) | 68 (nv: 37–145) |\n| ALT (UI/L) | 21 (nv:< 31) |\n| AST (UI/L) | 22 (nv:< 32) |\n| GGT (UI/L) | 19 (nv: 5–36) |\n| Sodium (mmol/L) | 144 (nv: 136–145) |\n| Potassium (mmol/L) | 3.3 (nv: 3.5–5.1) |\n| Calcium (mg/dL) | 10.1 (nv: 8.4–10.2) |\n| Magnesium (mg/dL) | 2.02 (nv: 1.58–2.55) |\n| Fosforum(mg/dL) | 3.4 (nv: 2.7–4.5) |\n| Albumin (mg/dL) | 4.9 (nv: 3.4–4.8) |\n| White blood cells count (x 103/uL) | 9.22 (nv: 5.2–12.4) |\n| Red blood cells count(x 103/uL) | 5.23 (nv: 4.2–5.4) |\n| Haemoglobin (g/dL) | 10.3 (nv: 12–16) |\n| Haematocrit (%) | 32.4 (nv: 37–47) |\n| Platelets count (x 103/uL) | 132 (nv: 130–400) |\n| Erythrocytes sedimentation rate (mm/h) | 7 (nv:<30) |\n\nALT = alanine transaminase, AST = aspartate transaminase, GGT = gamma glutamiltranspeptidase, HDL = high density lipoprotein, LDL = low density lipoprotein, nv = normal values.\n\nGiven the results of clinical and instrumental examinations, that raised a suspicion of primary aldosteronism, patient underwent a screening for secondary hypertension. The first step was the measurement of plasma aldosterone and renin concentrations, in the supine position and again after 60 minutes of active standing. As known, these measurements are affected by antihypertensive drugs,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> but in our case it was impossible to interrupt pharmacological treatment due to the uncontrolled blood pressure values. Renin and aldosterone plasma concentrations in supine position was1.26 ng/L (normal value = 1.7–23.9 ng/L) and 1125 pmol/L (normal value = 48.8–644 pmol/L) respectively; the same dosage repeated after standing was10.4 ng/L (normal value = 2.6–27.6ng/L) and 1647pmol/L (normal value = 70–1.088 pmol/L), respectively. Aldosterone/renin ratio was 893 in the first case and 158 in the second(normal value < 150). We preferred to use the direct plasma renin concentration rather than plasma renin activity since recent evidences suggest a lower rate of false positive tests if the aldosterone/renin ratio is calculated using direct renin concentration.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> These results reinforced the suspicion of primary hyperaldosteronism. To confirm this hypothesis, patient underwent a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen. As shown in Figure 1, the examination revealed the presence of left adrenal adenoma of 3.5 x 2.5 x 3 cm. The patient underwent laparoscopy adrenalectomy and the histopathological examination confirmed the presence of adrenocortical adenoma. After 3 months of follow-up we observed a significant reduction of blood pressure (140/90 mm Hg) with only Amlodipine 5 mg twice daily and Ramipril 5 mg daily and normal serum potassium.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nThe contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (CT) images show left adrenal adenoma  in the coronal (A), transversal (B) and sagittal (C) sections.</u>\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nIn the present case, we described primary hyperaldosteronism in a woman with resistant hypertension. This case highlights the importance to identify the conditions that cause potentially curable hypertension in order to prevent the adverse outcomes associated with excess aldosterone, including hypokalemia, renal and cardiovascular damage.\n\nPA usually manifests between 30 and 50 years, however a case of late onset disease was recently described in a woman of 71 years-old.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> The first description of primary aldosteronism syndrome was reported by Jerome W. Connin in a 34-years-old woman with a 4 cm unilateral adrenal adenoma.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> PA is the most frequent cause of secondary hypertension, affecting approximately 10% of patients with mild hypertension and 20% of patients with resistant hypertension.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Aldosterone producing adenoma and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia account for 95% of all PA cases. The correct and timely diagnosis is often hampered by the absence of typical biochemical signs such as hypokalemia, but sometimes the accuracy of imaging tests is poor because aldosterone-producing microadenomas and most bilateral lesions are undetectable with the computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u></a></sup>\n\nAlthough PA is rarely observed in subjects above 60 years of age, in our case, the presence of mild hypokalemia, treatment-resistant hypertension and extensive organ damage raised the suspicion of secondary hypertension. Based on clinical story, it is difficult to understand if adrenal adenoma was already present at the time of hypertension diagnosis or it developed as a consequence of a pre-existing essential arterial hypertension. However, instrumental examinations revealed widespread target-organ damage. In particular, we observed dilated cardiomyopathy in the echocardiogram. This finding could be consistent with a poorly controlled long-lasting arterial hypertension, but it could also be a consequence of hyperaldosteronism itself. Recent evidences suggest that long-term exposure to elevated circulating aldosterone results in substantial cardiac damage that occurs independently of the blood pressure levels. Indeed, aldosterone excess not only leads to the development of hypertension through renal sodium and water retention, but also induces tissue inflammation with subsequent fibrosis and remodelling in critical organs such as heart.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Similar cardiovascular alterations were also observed in patients with Cushing's syndrome. These patients showed dilated cardiomyopathy with impaired ejection fraction that improved after surgical and medical treatment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Another important point is the severity of retinal damage observed in our patient. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed “grade I hypertensive retinopathy,” that is lower than expected when comparing with the extent of cardiac damage. As previously demonstrated, the severity of hypertensive retinopathy in PA patients is low, and there is lack of association between the severity of hypertensive retinopathy and degree of left ventricular mass unlike observed in essential hypertension. This fact suggests that aldosteronism, through direct or indirect mechanisms, results in left ventricular hypertrophy and it is less likely to cause extracardiac organ damage.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe present report has some limitations. First, adrenal vein sampling was not performed because of unavailability in our Center. Second, both renin and aldosterone plasma levels might be distorted by the ongoing pharmacological treatment. Lastly, a follow-up after surgical intervention is still lacking.\n\nHowever, this case report contains a worthwhile clinical lesson. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high suspicion for secondary hypertension, especially in patients with multi-drug resistant hypertension. An early detection and treatment of secondary hypertension is important to minimize irreversible changes in the systemic vasculature. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion and consider screening for secondary causes of arterial hypertension in patients with resistant hypertension independent of serum potassium values or patient's age.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThe authors thank our patient and the Internal Medicine Unit of the University “Magna Graecia.”\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization**: MCP, CT, MR, MFR, IZ, BT, MC, BB, FA\n\n**Methodology**: MCP, CT, MR, MFR, IZ, BT, MC, BB, FA\n\n**Supervision**: FA\n\n**Writing – original draft**: MCP, CT, FA\n\n**Writing – review & editing**: MCP, CT, FA</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:07:32", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:08:30", "cost": 57.601}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:17", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:08:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:07:31"}

We instead identified the patient as having unclassified inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, the effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α blockade on the treatment of this patient also differentiates it from that seen in the patient with PAC syndrome.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 22-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital for arthralgia, PG, and acne. His past medical history indicated that acne first appeared when he was 10 years old, and at 11 years of age, a large acne lesion was removed from his scalp. At 20 years of age, the patient visited a hospital due to swelling and pain in his knees and ankles. Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee joint and examination of biopsy tissue using an arthroscope showed synovitis. As a result of mild positive rheumatoid factor and negative anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides antibody in his serum, he was diagnosed with palindromic rheumatism. A small dose of steroid (prednisolone 5 mg) and salazosulfapyridine (1000 mg) were administered. At age 21, 1 year before his first visit to our hospital, his joint symptoms (pain in the wrist and ankle, swelling of the left wrist joint) reappeared and skin ulcers emerged on his trunk and extremities. Skin biopsy revealed neutrophils infiltration into the dermis, and it was diagnosed as PG. Skin ulcers were gradually alleviated by increasing the dose of steroid (prednisolone 20 mg). When he was referred to our department, PAPA syndrome was suspected based on clinical symptoms of arthritis, PG , and acne . The laboratory data showed the following results: white blood cell count was 13000/μL, hemoglobin was 13.1 g/dL, platelets were 42.0 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL, C-reactive protein was 12.31 mg/dL, and immunoglobulin G was 1867 mg/dL. Following immunological and serological testing, anti-nuclear antibodies were 320-fold (speckled pattern), anti-SS-A antibodies were >1200 U/mL, and anti-SS-B antibodies were 46.8 U/mL. One month after the first visit, abdominal pain and diarrhea appeared. An additional 2 months later, he was admitted to a hospital with melena. Colonoscopy  and small intestine capsule examination  indicated inflammatory bowel disease. Histological examination revealed infiltration of inflammatory cells from the lamina propria to the submucosa in ascending colon  and in ileum . Mainly neutrophils, but lymphocyte infiltration was also seen. There was also active inflammation with basal plasmacytosis, cryptitis, and goblet cell depletion, but crypt abscesses were inconspicuous. There was no full-thickness inflammation, noncaseating epithelioid granuloma, or obstructive lymphangitis characteristic of Crohn's disease. The patient initially recovered with steroids, salazosulfapyridine, and enteral feeding, but arthralgia, acne, abdominal symptoms, and exacerbation of inflammatory reaction continued. Administration of adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks was started 1.6 years after the initial case of melena. Symptoms were not completely relieved, and abdominal symptoms were exacerbated. Colchicine was added to the patient's treatment regimen, and granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis therapy was performed 6 times 10 months after the start of adalimumab, but the effect was poor. Since high fever appeared and clinical symptoms did not improve, the biologic was changed from adalimumab to infliximab 250 mg (5 mg/body weight) every 2 months. Methotrexate (8 mg/week) was also added to his therapy. The melena and acne improved after the dose of infliximab was increased to 375 mg (7.5 mg/body weight) every 2 months. The improvement of ulcerative lesions was confirmed by colonoscopy. Joint symptoms did not completely improve. There were no adverse effects of infliximab.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nA) Clinical imaging of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Recurrent PG on the outside of the lower leg on visiting at our hospital.

Although the closest syndrome was PAC syndrome, we diagnosed him with PG, acne, and unclassified inflammatory bowel disease (PAB) syndrome.\n\nGenetic testing revealed that _PSTPIP1_ had an E101G (c.302 A>G) heterozygous variant  and _MEFV_ had no variants. Examination of the _PSTPIP1_ gene in a family study found an E101G heterozygous variant in his father but not in his mother . However, both parents were healthy, suggesting that this variant may not be the primary indicator of this condition. One elder sister, who was 25 years old, suffered repeatedly from multiple acnes on her face, chest, and upper back from a young age but not from PG or bowel diseases.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 5:\n\nChromatogram showing Sanger sequencing results for _PSTPIP1_ gene variant (c.302 A>G) in the patient and his father but not in his mother (A).

Macroscopic examination of intestinal lesions indicated unclassified inflammatory bowel disease rather than UC or Crohn's disease. Furthermore, a new heterozygous variant was present in the _PSTPIP1_ gene (a disease gene of PAPA syndrome), but the same heterozygous variant was also present in the asymptomatic father, suggesting that this variant may not be primarily involved in the pathophysiology in this case.\n\nRecently, many subtypes of PAPA syndrome have been reported.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4–6]</u></a></sup> In our case, although arthritis was present, it was not pyogenic arthritis, which is typical in PAPA syndrome, based on the immunobiological examination of synovial tissue . The patient was HLA-B27 negative, and there were no findings suggestive of spondyloarthritis on magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine, lumbar spine, or sacroiliac joints (data not shown). Anti-SS-A and SS-B antibodies were positive, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides antibody was negative, and no joint erosion was seen on joint X-ray (data not shown) during the study to suggest that his arthritis might be derived from Sjogren syndrome. Of the PAPA syndrome subtypes, inflammatory bowel disease was reported in 1 case with Crohn disease complicated by PASH syndrome,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> 1 case with UC complicated by PAPASH syndrome,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> and in 1 case of so-called PAC syndrome with UC.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Since our patient was found to have unclassified inflammatory bowel disease by macroscopic examination, a diagnosis of PAC syndrome, which is associated with UC, was not accurate. For these reasons, we diagnosed him with PAB syndrome.\n\nIn recent years, the combination of genomics and inflammatory bowel disease has received attention in the field of autoinflammatory diseases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19,20]</u></a></sup> In particular, reports of inflammatory bowel disease associated with _MEFV_, a familial Mediterranean fever disease gene, are increasing.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21,22]</u></a></sup> Before _MEFV_ gene-related enterocolitis was identified as a distinct disorder, it was considered to be a UC-like intestinal lesion. Colchicine, an effective drug for familial Mediterranean fever, is highly effective for intestinal lesions in _MEFV_ gene-related enterocolitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> The characteristics of enterocolitis include rectal sparing, right dominant colitis, discontinuous lesions, pseudopolyps, and granular protrusions.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> The intestinal findings in our case showed:\n\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Enteritis and colitis,\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> rectal sparing,\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> right-side dominant colitis, and\n*   通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> non-specific histological finding, similar to the features of _MEFV_ gene-related enterocolitis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup>\n\nHowever, _MEFV_ variants were not detected, moreover; colchicine was not effective in this case, suggesting that the intestinal findings of our patient clinically differed from _MEFV_ gene-related enterocolitis. Only 1 case of PAC syndrome has been reported, and the details of UC were not described in the paper.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Since the difference between the intestinal lesions of this case and PAC syndrome could not be examined, this case was not diagnosed as PAC syndrome.\n\nBiological agents that block TNF and interleukin (IL)-1 have been used in PAPA syndrome and its subtypes, and many reports have confirmed its effectiveness.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,23]</u></a></sup> In this case, adalimumab had no effect, but the patient responded well to infliximab, which is also an anti-TNF drug. Colchicine was found to suppress fever, but not to control other clinical symptoms in our case. In the report of PAC syndrome, the effects of the anti-TNF drugs adalimumab and infliximab were limited, and symptoms recurred when the dose of steroids was reduced. However, the anti-IL-1 drug anakinra was significantly more effective.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> In the future, we would like to examine the use of an anti-IL-1 drug to determine if clinical symptoms are observed after decreasing the dose of steroids or if the effect of infliximab is diminished.\n\nRecently, we reported a pyrin-associated autoinflammation with neutrophilic dermatosis (PAAND) case with an S242R heterozygous variant in _MEFV_.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> At the 242nd amino acid residue of the pyrin molecule encoded by _MEFV_, phosphorylated 14–3-3 protein binds to suppress the activation of pyrin inflammasome.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u></a></sup> It is believed that the S242R variant leads to enhanced pyrin inflammasome activation as a result of diminishing the binding between phosphorylated 14-3-3 protein and pyrin.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25,26]</u></a></sup> PAAND cases also have severe neutrophilic dermatosis similar to PAPA syndrome.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u></a></sup> PSTPIP1 binds the pyrin and controls activation of the pyrin inflammasome.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,6,28]</u></a></sup> Moreover, PSTPIP1 and pyrin may function together in the cell migration process.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u></a></sup> In our case, we detected a novel variant in _PSTPIP1_ gene in both patient and his healthy father. Therefore, it is possible that the variant could be of low penetrance, and that the _PSTPIP1_ variant was combined with other gene variants in the patient to cause its clinical phenotypes. _MEFV_\\-related neutrophilic dermatosis including PAAND shows similar neutrophilic dermatosis as PAPA, but its skin findings are different from PG shown in this case and PAPA syndrome. Since neutrophils infiltrate to skin lesions in these diseases, the function of pyrin and PSTPIP1 could be involved in the same skin pathogenesis leading to the neutrophilic skin abnormalities. It is hoped that the causative gene in this case will be identified by genetic analysis such as whole exome sequencing in the future, and the mechanism of PAB syndrome will be elucidated by the gene variants.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nWe report the case of a Japanese male patient with clinical features closely resembling PAC syndrome. The patient suffered from PG, acne, and arthritis without neutrophil infiltration. Enteritis and colitis were distinct from UC in a patient with PAC syndrome and similar to _MEFV_ gene-related enterocolitis. Furthermore, the effect of TNFα blockade in the treatment of this patient was also different from the PAC syndrome patient. For these reasons, we diagnosed him with PAB (PG, acne, and unclassified inflammatory bowel disease) syndrome, which may be a newly identified subtype of PAPA syndrome.\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment\n--------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Dr. Osamu Ohara and Dr. Hirotsugu Oda for performing the genetic analysis.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Conceptualization**: Hiroaki Ida, Ryuta Nishikomori, Keiichi Mitsuyama.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Data curation**: Takuma Koga, Yukiko Hidaka, Kazutsugu Iwamoto, Eri Kumaki-Matsumoto, Kumi Fujita.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Investigation**: Takuma Koga, Yukiko Hidaka, Kazutsugu Iwamoto, Yumi Harada, Suzuna Sugi, Makiko Hayashi, Keiichi Mitsuyama, Hiroyasu Ishimaru, Natsuko Iga, Yohei Natsuaki.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Project administration**: Kyoko Fujimoto, Shinjiro Kaieda, Satoshi Yamasaki.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Supervision**: Keiichi Mitsuyama, Tomohiro Morio, Tomoaki Hoshino, Hiroaki Ida.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Writing – original draft**: Takuma Koga, Shinjiro Kaieda, Hiroaki Ida.</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Writing – review and editing**: Hiroaki Ida, Ryuta Nishikomori, Keiichi Mitsuyama.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:50:12", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:50:26", "cost": 14.432}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:17", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:50:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:50:11"}

Clinically, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and acute thrombotic PE (ATPE) after shedding account for the vast majority.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,3]</u></a></sup> The incidence rate of ATPE has been increasing year by year in recent years.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> And ATPE has become a hot topic of common concern in the departments of severe, emergency, respiratory and heart diseases. The onset of ATPE is sudden and dangerous. Research and clinical practice have proved that early thrombolysis and other specific treatment can greatly improve its prognosis<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> However, the early diagnosis and treatment rate of ATPE is only 7%,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> for the lack of simple and objective diagnosis and quantitative evaluation of the degree of ATPE.\n\nThe diagnosis of ATPE, especially the early diagnosis, is a great challenge for every clinician. The specific diagnostic methods are insufficient, such as ECG, myocardial enzyme spectrum for acute myocardial infarction, alanine aminotransferase for liver function damage, etc. Although spiral CT pulmonary artery contrast-enhanced imaging (CTPA) and pulmonary angiography have a high diagnosis rate. However, it is necessary to move patients to the imaging department and receive intravenous contrast agent, which has the disadvantages of moving patients, allergy and nephrotoxicity, and its diagnosis is based on morphology, so it is difficult to achieve dynamic and quantitative monitoring,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> and it also has a lag in time. Although plasma D-dimer level has a good sensitivity,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> it cannot distinguish between simple deep vein thrombosis or thrombus has fallen off causing ATPE, and other factors causing D-dimer increase, such as infection, surgery, pregnancy, tumor, etc. are too common in clinical practice and lack of specificity. Plasma cardiac markers CKMB and BNP are often elevated during ATPE, which is the indirect evidence of increased pulmonary artery pressure and myocardial afterload, and only has a certain auxiliary significance for the diagnosis and prognosis of ATPE.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup>\n\nTherefore, for severe patients, in the absence of a single specific detection method, it is a good choice to combine the risk assessment of deep vein thrombosis, clinical symptoms, D-dimer, echocardiography, ECG and other detection indicators to form a joint diagnosis model. In the actual situation of critical care medicine, the real-time inspection and examination indexes of patients have the conditions of combined dynamic monitoring. Therefore, the risk assessment of DVT, clinical symptoms, D-dimer, echocardiography, plasma cardiac markers CKMB, BNP, pulmonary artery pressure waveform characteristics and some bioactive molecules in pulmonary artery blood can be integrated to explore a valuable early diagnosis model, which has theoretical basis and practical operability. The screening of risk factors for PE in intensive care unit (ICU) patients by systematic review and meta-analysis is an important preliminary work to carry out the early diagnosis model of PE.\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\n### 2.1 Study registration\n\nThis protocol has been registered at INPLASY202150105 .

The diagnosis of the disease is often difficult, because typical symptoms, such as sicca syndrome, have not been described. Moreover, various clinical signs and symptoms are reported as initial manifestations observed in pediatric patients, such as parotid swelling and joint involvement. To the best of our knowledge, symptomatic pericarditis has been reported only in adult primary SS as an initial manifestation, not in pediatric case.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> We report here for the first time a rare case of primary SS in a pediatric patient who developed symptomatic pericarditis.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nAn 11-year-old girl (body weight, 51 kg) presented with chest and left shoulder pain and a fever of 38°C 2 days prior to her admission. When it became difficult to maintain a supine position due to exacerbation of chest pain, she conferred with her family doctor. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed diffuse ST-segment elevations; thus, she was referred to our hospital and admitted. Her family history and psycho-social history are insignificant, but she has a recent treatment history of decayed teeth. On admission, her vital signs were as follows: respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min; heart rate, 123 beats/min; blood pressure, 99/55 mm Hg; and body temperature, 38.9°C. She sat on a chair and leaned forward with a look of agony. Chest pain was exacerbated by deep breathing. Goiter was observed. No murmur or pericardial rub was heard by auscultation. Spontaneous pain and tenderness in the left shoulder were observed with no apparent redness or swelling. She had no dryness of the mouth or eyes but had many decayed teeth. No rash was observed.\n\nThe results of the initial blood workup were as follows: increased C-reactive protein level, 5.27 mg/dL (normal levels: <0.3 mg/dL); N-terminal fragment of pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, 156 pg/mL (normal levels: <125 pg/mL); no pancytopenia; no hypocomplementemia \\[C3, 130 mg/dL (normal levels: 73–138 mg/dL); C4, 19 mg/dL (normal levels:11–31 mg/dL); and CH50, 69.8 IU/mL (normal levels: 31.6–57.6 U/mL)\\]; no increase of creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB \\[CK, 31 IU/L (normal levels: 41–153 IU/L); CK-MB, 4 IU/L (normal levels: <12 IU/L)\\]; human parvovirus B19 IgM, Epstein-Barr virus IgM, Mycoplasma DNA, anti-streptolysin O antibody, anti-streptokinase antibody and rapid influenza antigen test were negative; no dysthyroidism \\[thyroid-stimulating hormone, 3.3 μIU/mL (normal levels: 0.34–3.8 mU/L); free T3, 1.85 pg/mL (normal levels: 2–3.8 pg/mL); and free T4, 1.06 ng/dL (normal levels: 0.8–1.5 ng/dL)\\]. Anti-nuclear (speckled and homogenous pattern), anti-single stranded-DNA, anti-double stranded-DNA, anti-SS-A, anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, as well as rheumatoid factor were positive. Anti-RNP antibodies, anti-Smith antibodies, anti-Jo-1 antibodies, anti-Scl-70 antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies were negative. The results of the urinalysis revealed no cellular casts and persistent proteinuria. An ECG showed tachycardia and diffuse ST-segment elevations , which were suggestive of pericarditis with chest pain. On the chest X-ray, cardiomegaly was observed (cardiothoracic ratio: .54) and the costophrenic angle was dull at the left side. Chest computed tomography showed consolidation and pleural thickening at the left lower lobe of the lung, and slight pleural effusion at the left side. An echocardiogram obtained on the day of admission revealed no diastolic pericardial effusion, but it appeared on the third day of hospitalization . Gum test and salivary gland scintigraphy revealed reduced salivary secretions. A salivary gland biopsy revealed >50 lymphocytic infiltrates around the conduit, and the focus score was 2 focus/4 mm<sup>2</sup> . A cervical ultrasound analysis showed diffuse thyromegaly without blood flow abnormalities.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nElectrocardiogram.

C = capillary, D = duct.</u>\n\nFrom the day of admission, bed rest, antimicrobials (cefotaxime and azithromycin), and analgesics were prescribed because pericarditis was considered due to her typical chest pain and diffuse ST-segment elevation on ECG, and complication of pleuritis. On the third day after admission, the diffuse ST-segment elevations on ECG did not improve, pericardial friction sounds were still audible, diastolic pericardial effusion on echocardiogram was exacerbated, and continuous chest pain was observed, indicating exacerbation of pericarditis. Viral pericarditis was excluded because no pathogens were detected on viral isolation. Pericarditis and pleuritis, which were not relieved by antimicrobials, implied serositis caused by an autoimmune disease. Therefore, prednisolone therapy was initiated (60 mg/d). Her fever promptly reduced, and the chest pain was relieved. Decreased pericardial effusion on echocardiogram and improved ST-segment elevations on ECG were observed. The results of the blood antibody test, gum test, salivary gland scintigram, and salivary gland biopsy led to the diagnosis of SS, as 3 out of the 4 objective criteria of the American-European Consensus Group for SS were fulfilled.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> The patient was not diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as only 3 out of 11 classification criteria of American College of Rheumatology were fulfilled.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u></a></sup> Even with the more sensitive criteria, in which hypocomplementemia was included to the American College of Rheumatology criteria,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> we could not diagnose the case as SLE. After prednisolone had been tapered to 18 mg/d, she was discharged without relapse on day 37 . Pericardial effusion and pleuritis were completely resolved on imaging studies, at the time of discharge. Diffuse thyromegaly and laboratory test results led to the diagnosis of asymptomatic Hashimoto thyroiditis, and the patients was closely monitored without any medications prescribed. She developed no clinical signs and symptoms of SLE and Hashimoto thyroiditis during the 1-year follow-up.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 4:\n\nClinical course. CRP = C-reactive protein in serum.</u>\n\n3 Discussion and conclusion\n---------------------------\n\nSS is an autoimmune disease that develops as a primary disorder or presents concomitantly with other connective tissue diseases, most commonly rheumatoid arthritis or SLE.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Our case was considered to be potentially associated with SLE, because pericarditis was reported to be present in 10.8% of pediatric SLE.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> It was reported that 16-year old female has been diagnosed as SLE during the follow-up of SS.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> In our case, however, no clinical signs and symptoms of SLE were observed during the 1-year follow-up period when prednisolone was tapered.\n\nAnother study reported that pericardial involvement was reported in 10% of pediatric patients with mixed connective tissue disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> The present case, on the other hand, did not meet the most sensitive diagnostic criteria of mixed connective tissue disease.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Moreover, autoimmune thyroiditis is a well-known complication of primary SS.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> This suggests that her asymptomatic Hashimoto's thyroiditis was a complication of primary SS. Some studies reported that pleural effusion and pleuritis emerged in primary SS patients, regardless of whether the patients have undergone treatment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Similar to the cases previously reported, our patient had pleuritis which was regarded as a complication of primary SS. Finally, we diagnosed our patient as having primary SS with symptomatic pericarditis.\n\nAcute symptomatic pericarditis and hemolytic uremic syndrome were reported to be the initial manifestations of adult primary SS.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> In a study of 64 adult primary SS patients, echogenic pericardium, which is a consequence of asymptomatic pericarditis, has been observed in 33% of the patients. This suggested that clinically silent heart changes are common, but obvious heart involvement is extremely rare.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> On the other hand, in childhood-onset primary SS, the most frequent symptom was parotid swelling, and no symptomatic pericarditis was observed in the patients .<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,15–20]</u></a></sup>\n\nTable 1 - Clinical symptoms of pediatric primary Sjögren's syndrome.\n\n| Authors | Patients (n) | Mean age at onset (yr) | Parotid swelling (%) | Sicca syndrome (%) | Joint involvement (%) | Fever (%) | Malaise (%) | Published year |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n通用删除2(英):<u>| Tomiita, et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> | 42 | 10.7 | 35.7 | 23.8 | 26.2 | 52.4 | 28.6 | 1997 |</u>\n通用删除2(英):<u>| Drosos, et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> | 13 | 9.4 | 76.9 | 23 | 23 | – | – | 1997 |</u>\n通用删除2(英):<u>| Bartunkova, et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> | 8 | 13.5 | 100 | – | – | – | – | 1999 |</u>\n通用删除2(英):<u>| Stiller, et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> | 11 | 9.5 | 54.5 | – | – | – | – | 2000 |</u>\n通用删除2(英):<u>| Cimaz, et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> | 40 | 10.6 | 72.5 | 35 | 10 | 10 | 7.5 | 2003 |</u>\n通用删除2(英):<u>| Houghton, et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> | 7 | 8.7 | 71.4 | Mouth 42.9Eye 28.6 | 42.9 | – | 28.6 | 2005 |</u>\n通用删除2(英):<u>| Yokogawa, et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> | 26 | 12.4 | 61.5 | Mouth 61.5Eye 65.4 | 57.7 | 23.1 | – | 2016 |</u>\n\nIn conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of pediatric primary SS with symptomatic pericarditis as the initial manifestation.

VNS increases parasympathetic activity, reduces sympathetic tone, and stabilizes the neural network in the autonomic nervous system regulating cardiovascular function.\n\nMultiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined the effect of ART in patients with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15–19]</u></a></sup> Recent meta-analyses on the effect of ART in HFrEF patients have reported the potential benefits.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u></a></sup> In animal models of hypertension-mediated HF, chronic VNS mitigated hypertrophy and reversed multiple adverse changes in autonomic control of the heart, including myocyte size and left ventricular mass, findings that are particularly relevant to HFpEF.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> Furthermore, in patients with hypertension, RDN reduced left ventricular mass, stiffness, and filling pressures, which are common pathological features of HFpEF patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> However, there is insufficient evidence as to the effect of ART in HFpEF patients.\n\nAccordingly, the purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy as well as safety of ART in HFpEF patients compared with standard therapy or sham control group.\n\n2 Methods\n---------\n\nThis study has been registered as PROSPERO CRD42020212668 .

For search of the eligible studies, the following keywords and Medical Subject Heading will be used: diastolic heart failure, heart failure with normal (preserved) EF, autonomic regulation therapy, renal denervation, vagus (vagal) nerve stimulation, baroreflex activation, spinal cord stimulation. Only articles published in the English language will be included.\n\n### 2.2 Study design\n\nOnly RCTs will be included.

The secondary outcomes will be HF symptoms, health-related quality of life, and mortality and hospitalization rates.\n\n### 2.5 Data extraction\n\nInformation on the study and patient characteristics, methodological quality, intervention strategies, and clinical outcomes will be systematically extracted separately by 2 reviewers. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus.\n\n### 2.6 Quality assessment\n\nThe Cochrane Risk of Bias tool will be used to assess quality of RCTs included.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> The quality of evidence for the outcomes will be evaluated by use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> The quality of evidence will be evaluated across the domains of risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and publication bias.\n\n### 2.7 Statistical analysis\n\nFor continuous outcomes, the effect size for the intervention will be calculated by the difference between the means of the intervention and control groups at the end of the intervention. For morbidity and mortality, relative risk with 95% confidence interval will be calculated. For each outcome, heterogeneity will be assessed using the Cochran _Q_ and _I_<sup>2</sup> statistic; for the Cochran _Q_ and _I_<sup>2</sup> statistic, a _P_ value of < .1 and _I_<sup>2</sup> > 50%, will be considered significant, respectively. When there is significant heterogeneity, the data will be pooled using a random-effects model, otherwise a fixed-effects model will be used. Publication bias will be assessed graphically using a funnel plot and mathematically using Egger test. For these analyses, Comprehensive Meta Analysis Software version 2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ) and STATA 16 software (Stata Corp LP, TX) will be used.\n\n### 2.8 Sensitivity analysis\n\nMeta-regression will be used to determine whether the effect of ART will be confounded by baseline clinical characteristics.\n\n### 2.9 Ethical issues\n\nThis meta-analysis is a literature study. Ethical approval is not required because this meta-analysis will not involve any subject directly.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nAlthough recent meta-analyses on the effect of ART in HFrEF patients have reported the potential benefits, there is insufficient evidence as to the effect of ART in HFpEF patients.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u></a></sup> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis protocol about ART on HFpEF patients.

In 2011, he was diagnosed with severe anemia and renal insufficiency and was treated with erythropoietin (EPO) and intermittent blood transfusion supportive treatment in local hospitals, but he showed little response. His hemoglobin level was maintained at 50 to 65 g/L. The medical history showed he had no symptoms of night sweat, recent weight loss or bone pains. Medical examination revealed severe anemic appearance, no lymphadenopathies and/or hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood examination demonstrated white blood cell count of 2.75 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L(normal reference range: 3.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L to 9.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), hemoglobin concentration 36 g/L (normal reference range: 130∼175 g/L) and a platelet count 142 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L(normal reference range: 125 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L to 350 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Biochemical examination showed normal liver function tests and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Other laboratory findings include: Creatinine - 347.0 μmol/L (normal reference range: 57∼111 μmol/L), serum beta2-microglobulin (β2-MG) - 17.84 mg/L (normal reference range: 1.3∼3.0 mg/L), urine β2-MG >88 mg/L (normal reference range: < 0.3 mg/L), and 24 hours urine total protein 1019 mg (normal reference range: < 150 mg/d). Ultrasonic examination of abdomen revealed right renal cyst without renal atrophy. Computed tomography scan was done to exclude the extramedullary lesions. Further serum immunofixation electrophoresis revealed the presence of M component IgA-κ and IgM-κ (IgA 969 mg/dL(normal reference range: 82∼453 mg/dL), IgM 571 mg/dL (normal reference range: 46∼304 mg/dL), kappa light chain 1580 mg/dL (normal reference range: 629∼1350 mg/dL), lambda light chain 186 mg/dL (normal reference range: 313∼723 mg/dL). Urinary kappa light chain 90.4 mg/dL (normal reference range: 0∼1.85 mg/dL), lambda light chain < 5 mg/dL (normal reference range: < 5 mg/dL) . Given the possibility of plasma cell tumor, bone marrow (BM) aspiration was performed and the procedure indicated hypercellularity. It contained 76.8% abnormal lymphocytes. Most of the lymphocytes had small cell body, uneven chromatin, and little cytoplasm as well as regular cell edge. Cytoplasm of a small number of lymphocytes were deeply stained, foamy, and showed plasma cell-like changes. Nucleolus could be seen in a few cells . BM biopsy showed diffuse infiltrate of small lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm. Plasmacytic differentiation of lymphocytes could be seen in some cells . Moreover, immunophenotyping analysis by flow cytometry showed that 44.37% cells were detected as malignant monoclonal mature small B cells, which expressed clusters of differentiation (CD) 19, bcl-2 and dimly expressed ckappa, partially expressed CD38, CD20, CD180 and CD79b, but negative for CD2, CD117, CD56, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD7, clambda, CD229, CD138, CD11c, kappa, lambda, CD5, Ki67, CD10, FMC7, CD103, CD25, CD23, TDT, CD200. The other 1.16% monoclonal plasma cells expressed ckappa, CD38, CD138, CD229dim, and partially expressed CD19, but not lambda or CD56. It was considered as mature small B cell lymphoma with plasma cell differentiation . Cytogenetic G-band analysis indicated a normal karyotype. Further molecular analysis on BM specimen revealed a mutation in the c.794T>C/P.L265P locus of MYD88 gene . According to the laboratory examinations mentioned, the patient was diagnosed as LPL with paraprotein IgA and IgM. Given the old age and expensive cost, the patient gave up chemotherapy and target therapy. However, he has survived for more than 1 year with supportive treatment of intermittent transfusion.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nThe characteristic of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with paraprotein IgA and IgM.

Non-IgM LPL presenting with IgG or IgA is very rare and comprises less than 5% of reported LPL cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> In the present study, we found both IgA and IgM paraprotein in serum immunofixation electrophoresis in the patient. To our knowledge, this is the first case of LPL with simultaneous secretion of abnormal IgM and IgA immunoglobulin.\n\nSeveral studies show patients with non-IgM LPL had similar clinical and pathologic features with IgM LPL (WM). Cao et al compared the clinical data of 17 non-IgM LPL patients and 312 typical WM patients, and found similar clinical and biological characteristics.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup>\n\nWM express antigen associated with B cells. Its typical immune phenotypes include CD19 (+), CD20 (+), sIgM (+), CD22 (+), CD25 (+), CD27 (+), FMC7 (+), CD5 (+/-), CD10 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>, CD23 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> as well as CD103 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u>. CD38 and CD138 are often expressed on the surface of monoclonal plasma cells. Consistent with previous literature, the patient in our study showed majority of tumor cells were malignant monoclonal mature B cells and the other few cells were mature small B-cell lymphoma with plasma cell differentiation.\n\nMYD88-L265P mutation is very important for the diagnosis and treatment of LPL. More than 90% of WM patients had functional MYD88-L265P mutation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u></a></sup> Also non-IgM LPL cases harbored MYD88-L265P mutation, albeit the mutation frequency was lower than that of typical WM.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5,8]</u></a></sup> King et al. found MYD88 mutation was identified in 43% of 23 patients with non-IgM LPL, which suggested that these non-IgM LPL might be biologically related to WM.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup>\n\nLPL has the characteristic of low-grade malignant cell lymphoma with a long-term survival. “Watch and wait” is the first-choice treatment strategy for LPL patients without systemic symptoms, vital organ impairment, bulky lesions or evident disease progression. However, patients with symptoms require further treatment. Despite much advances in therapy, LPL remains an incurable disease. Rituximab and bendamustine regimen was a preferred option of Mayo Clinic.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Recently, the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib brings a highly active response for WM. Surprisingly, MYD88-L265P mutation patient achieved overall response rate of 100%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Now, ibrutinib can be used in patients with initial and relapsed WM.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11,12]</u></a></sup> However, the long-term response and adverse event needs further studies. The most common symptom of LPL patient is fatigue, which is mainly associated with anemia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> The patient in our study had fatigue for 7 years because of anemia, which was caused mainly by extensive infiltration of small B cells, plasma-like lymphocytes and plasma cells in bone marrow. Although he could not afford the high treatment cost, he has survived for more than 1 year with the supportive treatment, which indicated the disease has an indolent course.\n\nIn conclusion, LPL with paraprotein IgA and IgM is a very rare disease. Further large-scale studies are needed to investigate the clinical outcomes.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nLi Zheng analyzed data and wrote the paper.

In this technique, after selective discectomy of the degenerated disc, the posterior annulus fibrosus and tear site are modulated by thermal annuloplasty (TA) using a bipolar radiofrequency coagulator (PED/TA). PED/TA has been shown to be effective for treating DLBP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4,5]</u></a></sup> However, to our knowledge, few studies have examined the effectiveness of PED/TA specifically for DLBP or evaluated patient-oriented tests that assess health-related quality of life. In this report, we present a case who recovered completely after PED/TA for the treatment of DLBP, CLBP, and severe sitting intolerance, and has remained in good condition in terms of pain score and functional capacity after 2 years of follow-up.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 40-year-old male administrative assistant (current smoker; weight: 77.8 kg; height: 168 cm; body mass index: 27.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) visited our hospital with complaints of CLBP, buttock pain, left-sided sciatica. and sensory disturbance affecting his left thigh. He had experienced an episode of severe LBP during sitting in the past year that had not improved. He underwent a neurological exam that revealed normal gait. His lumbar range of motion was limited to left side bending (Kemp +). Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed single-level degenerative disc disease at L4–5. He was subsequently diagnosed with DLBP with a high intensity zone (HIZ) in the posterior corner of the L4–5 disc. His X-ray and MRI findings upon initial arrival at our hospital are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Degeneration with slight protrusion was observed, and the HIZ was obvious in the central disc of L4/5 previously. Upon arrival at our hospital, he had a score of 7 on the numerical rating scale (NRS) for lumbago pain, but no apparent psychological issues , and a score of 11 on the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA). Before undergoing provocative discography, he completed both the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) and the JOA Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JOABPEQ). To assess specific physical morbidity and condition-specific disability, he completed questionnaires (the NRS for LBP and leg/arm pain, the RDQ, and the JOABPEQ) at specific time points following the lumbar surgery. The JOABPEQ, which provides five different domain scores based on 25 question items, was used as a specific tool to evaluate his LBP. Based on his responses, five functional scores (LBP, lumbar function, walking ability, social life function, and mental health) were calculated by the examiner. Lumbar provocative discography performed as a diagnostic test confirmed the presence of concordant LBP of the L4–5 disc with pain upon pressurization. Therefore, we performed discography combined with steroid and lidocaine injection at the affected site . Discography revealed leakage of contrast media into an annular tear. He obtained relief from LBP (80% effective rate) after the discal block. The patient then reported concordant LBP with leg pain and numbness, which was successfully treated by intradiscal injection. Therefore, the diagnosis was confirmed as low back pain due to L4 / 5 discopathy. However, his pain recurrence was gradual, so at 1 month after the discography and disc block, we decided to perform minimally invasive endoscopic surgery with PED/TA as opposed to the conservative care we had performed previously. The patient underwent PED/TA under uneventful general anesthesia in the prone position . The transforaminal approach was selected. A 7-mm lateral skin incision was performed 8.5 cm from the midline. During the procedure, neither dural tears nor bleeding (surgical blood loss of 10 mL) were observed. Next, a needle was inserted through the safety triangle into the disc, and discography with indigo carmine was conducted to dye the nucleus pulposus and displaced fragment blue . A guide pin was then inserted through the puncture needle into the disc, followed by the obturator and cannula. After the cannula was inserted, PED/TA was started, and the HIZ site was ablated using a coagulator (ie, TA). Immediately after the surgery, the patient's severe LBP in the sitting position resolved and his leg pain and sensory disturbance improved; since then, he has had no difficulties in carrying out activities of daily living. Improvements in his functional capacity and NRS pain score (from 7 to 0) were observed at 24 months after PED/TA (his NRS pain score was also 0 at the 12-month follow-up). The patient's JOA score improved from 11 to 27 points (recovery rate: 88%) at 3 months and to 29 points (100%) at 24 months \\[Recovery rate (%) = (Postoperative score – Preoperative score) / (29 – Preoperative score) × 100\\]. The results of the RDQ showed an improvement from 7 points before the procedure to 0 points at the 24-month follow-up (3 at 3 months and 0 at 12 months). In addition, obvious improvements were seen from 12 to 24 months postoperatively in the patient's JOABPEQ scores for LBP, lumbar function, walking ability, social life function, and mental health compared to baseline . However, in the MRI taken 12 months postoperatively , no changes were seen in the sagittal or axial images, indicating that the size of the disc protrusion was similar to that observed in the first MRI. In addition, no change was seen in the HIZ or the disc bulge. There were no complaints of LBP during the telephone survey at three years postoperation and the patient can perform activities of daily life.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nInitial radiographs at the orthopedic clinic show lateral view of lumbar vertebra.

The results of some studies have suggested that inhibiting the growth of nerve fibrils into the intervertebral disc or interfering with the nociception mediated by these nerves could be useful in treating patients with CLBP,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6,7]</u></a></sup> and surgical treatment may be considered for patients who do not respond to conservative treatment. Spinal fusion and disc replacement surgery remain the conventional surgical procedures used to treat DLBP.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8–12]</u></a></sup> However, numerous minimally invasive percutaneous intradiscal therapies have recently been reported. For example, the use of heat treatment for DLBP is based on two principles. First, heat induces denervation of the nociceptor in the annulus and inhibits the ingrowth of the unmyelinated nerve ending that causes pain. Second, stiffening of the annular fiber due to denaturation and collagen shrinkage enhances stability. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain unclear.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Despite a number of recent advances in the field, it is still unclear how inflammation is initiated and sustained, thereby leading to CLBP. One possible explanation could involve the growth of nerves capable of signaling pain deep into the annular structures.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> In this study, based on the evaluation of postoperative MRI scans, cauterizing the nerve endings may be more effective than lowering the internal pressure of the intervertebral disc for reducing LBP.\n\nA few surgical alternatives, such as disc replacement or fusion, are currently available to treat DLBP; however, the clinical results for these modalities have been disappointing, showing implant failure, adjacent segment disease, loss of motion segment, infection, and blood loss. Moreover, re-operation rates after spinal fusion surgery are slightly higher than those after laminectomy or discectomy without fusion.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup>\n\nOn the other hand, PED/TA is a minimally invasive and relatively simple technique that has a low cost and is associated with few side effects compared with surgical options; however, variable results have been reported.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16–20]</u></a></sup> The advantages of PED/TA are that it allows the object to be confirmed and secures access to the lumbar disc. In addition, an expanded visual field can be obtained with positioning next to the target area because the camera is placed inside the surgical field. It also eliminates blind spots, unlike annuloplasty with radiofrequency, which is advantageous in terms of safety, surgical progress, and education since all surgical staffs can share the same visual field. Moreover, ED/TA makes it possible to avoid disc space fixation following lumbar interbody fusion. In addition, based on postoperative MRI, the cauterization of nerve endings may be more effective than lowering the internal pressure of the intervertebral disc for improving LBP.\n\nThe case reported here suggests that PED/TA is potentially advantageous for treating DLBP, CLBP and severe sitting intolerance. Also, PED/TA may allow lumbar interbody fusion to be avoided in patients with CLBP and severe sitting intolerance.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nAll authors reviewed and approved the final version of the manuscript</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:36:04", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:42:55", "cost": 410.341}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:17", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:42:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:36:04"}

Of particular concern is the markedly high iodine content of the most commonly used OSCM (Lipiodol has 480 mg iodine in one millilitre (ml) vs 150 μg iodine in one standard iodine supplement tablet), and it's very long half-life in tissue (50 days).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup>\n\nTubal patency is established during HSG by visualising passage of the contrast through one or both fallopian tubes into the peritoneal cavity. Following a Lipiodol HSG, there is a variable amount of contrast retained in the peritoneal cavity, depending upon tubal patency and the volume of Lipiodol instilled.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> As up to 10 ml of Lipiodol are typically used in HSG studies, it is conceivable that some women may retain several ml of Lipiodol in the peritoneum after the procedure. Given the half-life of Lipiodol is approximately 50 days,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> and assuming it takes 5 half-lives to result in complete excretion from the system, a single procedure may result in exposure to excess iodine for 250 days or approximately 35 weeks. For instance, if only 2 ml of OCSM is retained, this would result in iodine release of approximately 9600 μg daily in the initial 50 days after Lipiodol HSG. This equates to more than 60 times the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for iodine intake established by Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, which is 150 μg/d in adults and 220 μg/day in pregnant women.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Even after 4 half-lives or 200 days, the estimated iodine released would be approximately 600 μg daily, or four times the recommended daily intake.\n\nA small study from Japan of 22 women who underwent OSCM HSG demonstrated that some had iodine levels elevated by 100-fold, which was maintained up to 24 weeks post HSG.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Urine and serum iodine levels normalised by 40 weeks post HSG, consistent with the known half-life of OSCM. However, the increase in iodine levels was variable and not a universal phenomenon. Some women had no elevation in iodine levels post HSG, while others had a marked rise in iodine levels, possibly reflecting variation in the amount of retained OSCM following the HSG.\n\nThe most obvious risk from markedly elevated iodine levels is altered thyroid function. In particular, a sudden increase in iodine levels results in acute inhibition of both thyroid hormone release and organification, which is termed the Wolff-Chaikoff effect.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14,15]</u></a></sup> This effect is generally transient, lasting less than 2 weeks until ‘adaptation’ or ‘escape’ from the Wolf-Chaikoff effect occurs. However, in some situations the ‘adaptation’ or ‘escape’ mechanism fails, resulting in prolonged hypothyroidism. Such situations include underlying autoimmune thyroid disease, non-thyroidal illness, and iodine exposure in early life (fetus and newborn).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15–17]</u></a></sup> Paradoxically, iodine excess can occasionally induce hyperthyroidism, especially in those with pre-existing Graves disease or multinodular goitre.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u></a></sup> This effect labelled the Jod-Basedow phenomenon induces hyperthyroidism over varying periods following the iodine load, with cases presenting 3 to 6 months following the contrast use.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> Most of these cases with hyperthyroidism are self-limited and often clinically silent.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup> Thyroid dysfunction (both hypo- and hyperthyroidism) is known to affect fertility and pregnancy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> Severe hypothyroidism can cause diminished libido and failed ovulation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> While pregnancy can occur with milder hypothyroidism, there is increased risk of fetal loss in the absence of adequate levothyroxine replacement.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup>\n\nPrevious studies have suggested occurrence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) following OSCM HSG.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13,25,26]</u></a></sup> Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is defined as an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level, with normal free thyroxine (T4) and free triiodothyronine (T3) levels.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u></a></sup> Importantly, even relatively subtle thyroid dysfunction, as seen in SCH, can adversely impact pregnancy. A metanalysis of 38 studies found that SCH was associated with 1.7-fold increase in pre-eclampsia and 2.7-fold increase in perinatal mortality.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u></a></sup> SCH during first trimester may also be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, miscarriages, or having a baby born small for gestational age (SGA).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u></a></sup> Furthermore, maternal SCH during pregnancy can affect the offspring's neurocognitive development and was associated with a 5-point reduction in Intelligence quotient (IQ) for children at 7 to 8 years of age in a case-control study (full scale IQ composite score 103.9 in cases vs 109.1 in controls).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u></a></sup> Another metanalysis also suggested lower intellectual and motor development in children born to mothers who had SCH during pregnancy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[31]</u></a></sup>\n\nAside from the thyroid function abnormalities due to iodine excess and subsequent effects on fertility and pregnancy, there could be other direct pathways by which iodine excess can affect fertility.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[32]</u></a></sup> Potential mechanisms include a direct effect of iodine on the uterus and ovaries, as well as alterations in local and systemic immunological milieu.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[33–35]</u></a></sup> Some earlier animal studies pointed to the negative impact of excess iodine on ovulation and fertility index.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[33,34]</u></a></sup> However, to date, no human studies have examined the potential effects of iodinated contrast on ovarian function or its markers, such as AMH (anti-mullerian hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), or FSH (follicle stimulating hormone).\n\nHigh iodine levels may also affect fetal thyroid development and newborn thyroid function. A Japanese study suggested an increased incidence of newborn thyroid dysfunction in offspring conceived immediately following a Lipiodol HSG.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u></a></sup> Five out of 212 (2.4%) newborns had TSH elevation at birth, four of whom required thyroxine replacement, including two with persistent permanent congenital hypothyroidism.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u></a></sup> Thus, the incidence of permanent congenital hypothyroidism after maternal OSCM HSG in that study was 0.94% (two out of 212 screened), compared to a background rate of 0.07% (6.8:10000 live births) in Japan.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[37]</u></a></sup> Although the sample size was relatively small, this study raised the possibility that the incidence of permanent congenital hypothyroidism may be increased after an OSCM HSG. However, this pattern of increased thyroid dysfunction in newborns was not replicated in a later study in the Netherlands,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u></a></sup> where post-hoc analyses on the offspring from the H2Oil trial (n = 76) showed no changes in the rates of hypothyroidism among babies conceived following OSCM HSG.\n\nOverall, the available evidence suggests that iodine excess from OSCM HSG could adversely affect maternal thyroid function as well as fetal thyroid development and neonatal thyroid function. However, most were retrospective studies or post-hoc analyses. There is a lack of comprehensive prospective studies assessing acute and long-term safety of OSCM. The SELFI study will address this gap in current knowledge, with a particular focus on thyroid safety in the woman and her offspring.\n\n### 1.1 Aims and objectives\n\nThe aim of this study is to assess the safety of OSCM HSG in both the women and their offspring, in particular, regarding the potential impacts of iodine excess. The gold standard for measuring iodine status in women of reproductive age or during pregnancy is UI/Cr.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u></a></sup> The UI/Cr minimizes variations caused by differences in urine volume and dilution among subjects in a well-nourished population,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u></a></sup> and is considered a superior measure than alternatives when adjusted for age and gender.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[41]</u></a></sup> In addition to monitoring UI/Cr, we plan to perform a semi quantitative assessment of OSCM retention in the peritoneum following the HSG, on a delayed post-HSG radiograph, and check its utility as a surrogate marker for the woman's iodine status post-HSG. A delayed radiograph of the pelvis is usually obtained in Lipiodol HSG patients after 45 minutes post procedure to confirm the presence and distribution of peritoneal spill.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe primary objective of SELFI study is to determine:\n\n*   1\\.

We aim to recruit 200 consecutive candidates who meet the eligibility criteria and provide informed consent. The first participant was recruited in June 2019 and the last participant expected by the end of August 2021. The first offspring was recruited in April 2020 and the last offspring expected before June 2022.\n\n### 2.3 Recruitment\n\nThe main inclusion criterion is that women have a referral for an OSCM HSG in the Auckland region. Fertility specialists in the region will identify women who would likely benefit from OSCM HSG. Some specialists prefer that women have proven tubal patency confirmed with WSCM HSG prior to using OSCM HSG, while others use OSCM HSG as a first line for diagnostic purposes and fertility enhancement in the likely absence of tubal pathology.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> OSCM HSG may be used for patients with either primary infertility (defined as infertility of at least one-year duration) or secondary infertility (defined as greater than one-year infertility with a previous pregnancy). OSCM HSG may be used in those with unexplained infertility (lack of conception after one year of regular unprotected sex in the absence of an identifiable cause for infertility in either of the partners) or endometriosis. Also, OSCM HSG may be offered to augment spontaneous conception or to assist with planned intrauterine insemination (IUI).\n\nRecruitment will be from two private fertility clinics and a tertiary hospital. The research team has been in contact with fertility and radiology centers in the region to promote recruitment. Potential participants will be referred to the coordinating investigator by the fertility specialists or the radiology centers (upon receival of the referral form to perform the HSG). The coordinating investigator will contact the potential candidate by email and phone and apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine eligibility to participate in the SELFI study.\n\nThe women meeting below inclusion criteria will be considered:\n\n*   1\\. Age above 18 years; AND\n*   2\\. Having primary or secondary infertility; AND\n*   3\\. Referred for OSCM HSG in the Auckland region; AND\n*   4.\n    *   a. Have probable tubal patency, based on the criterion of “low risk for pre-existing tubal damage” as per Dreyer et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup>; OR\n    *   b. If known to have damage to one or both fallopian tubes, having a referral for an OSCM HSG advised by the fertility specialist (for fertility enhancement from uterine bathing effect of Lipiodol <sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[42]</u></a></sup>); AND\n*   5.\n    *   a. Have normal thyroid function (i.e. normal non-pregnant free T4 and TSH), OR\n    *   b. Have subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as a TSH > 4mIU/L and normal free T4 levels) and not be on treatment with levothyroxine\n\nIn addition, potential participants will be excluded if they:\n\n*   1\\. Have any known contraindication for OSCM use (poppy seed or poppy seed oil allergy, or history of reactions to iodine); OR\n*   2\\. Have active thyroid disease, such as overt hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism or thyroid cancer; OR\n*   3\\. Currently receive treatment with levothyroxine or antithyroid medications; OR\n*   4\\. On medications known to affect thyroid function or iodine metabolism (e.g. Lithium, Amiodarone etc.)\n*   5\\. Have used water-soluble contrast within 3 months prior to the OSCM HSG procedure; OR\n*   6\\. Have used OSCM or any other oil-soluble contrast medium within 6 months before the procedure.\n\n### 2.4 Assessments\n\nWomen meeting the eligibility criteria who provide written informed consent will be enrolled into the study. Their demographic data will be collected from the OSCM HSG referral form from the fertility specialist. Participants will not undergo any anthropometric measurements or physical (clinical) examinations in the SELFI study. However, participants will undergo baseline non-fasting blood tests at a community laboratory (Labtests NZ) in the Auckland region, carried out by phlebotomist at these local laboratories. Blood parameters measured will include TSH, free T4, free T3, as well as reproductive hormones (LH and FSH), anti-thyroid antibodies, and AMH . A first morning urine sample will also be collected to measure UI/Cr.\n\nTable 1 - Assessments of Blood and Urine parameters and their Timing in the SELFI study.\n\n|  |  |  | Time elapsed since OSCM HSG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | \n* * *\n\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Investigation | Baseline |  | Day 7 | wk 4 | wk 8 | wk 12 | wk 16 | wk 20 | wk 24 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TSH | ✓ | OSCMHSGprocedure | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Free T4 | ✓ |  | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Free T3 | ✓ |  | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Urine iodine/creatinine | ✓ |  | ✓ |  | ✓ |  | ✓ |\n| Thyroid antibodies | ✓ |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| LH | ✓ |  | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| FSH | ✓ |  | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| AMH | ✓ |  |  |  | ✓ |  |  |\n\nAMH = anti-mullerian hormone, FSH = follicular stimulating hormone, LH = luteinising hormone, T3 = triiodothyronine, T4 = thyroxine, TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone.\n\nEach participant will undergo an OSCM HSG procedure at one of the two private radiology clinics performing these in the Auckland region. The OSCM HSG will be booked between days 5 and 12 of the woman's cycle and will be performed by one of three experienced radiologists and a fertility specialist following the SELFI protocol. This will include the standard HSG, recording of the exact volume of OSCM used in the procedure, and a post-procedure delayed radiograph after 45 minutes. The steps followed are detailed further in the next section under the heading “OSCM HSG procedure”. Note that we do not expect any differences in performance or outcomes between practitioners as they are all experienced and will closely follow the SELFI protocol; however, we aim to record the practitioner's ID to examine possible inter-observer variability. A semiquantitative assessment of peritoneal retention of OSCM will be recorded for each delayed radiograph by a single radiologist.\n\nFollowing the OSCM HSG, the participant will undergo serial blood and urine tests over the next 6 months as detailed in Table 1. In particular, the UI/Cr will be assessed at 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks following the Lipiodol HSG. TSH, FreeT4 and FreeT3 will be assessed at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks following HSG. To ensure adherence to the scheduled tests, participants will be reminded by a text message or email by the coordinating investigator on the previous day. If any thyroid function abnormality is identified during the serial monitoring, this will be discussed with the reproductive endocrinologist in the research team, and recommendations will be given to the primary fertility specialist, who has the clinical override.\n\nIf the woman conceives during the study period, a repeat consent will be obtained in later part of pregnancy to include the newborn in the study. Following the written informed consent, the newborn will undergo a heel prick test on the seventh day of life at a community lab (Labtests NZ). The blood parameters tested on the neonate will include TSH, free T4, and free T3. These tests will be in addition to the routine 48-hour newborn screening for all neonates born in New Zealand.\n\nAll the blood tests will be analysed in the private laboratory upon collection of the sample by standard protocols, and results sent to the researchers. All test results will also be made available to the participant's clinical team, including GP and fertility specialists. Figure 1 and Table 1 outline the flow of participants through the study and the timing of blood and urine investigations with respect to the OSCM HSG.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nFlow diagram showing the flow of participants in the SELFI study.</u>\n\n### 2.5 The OSCM HSG procedure\n\nFor all OSCM procedures, Lipiodol (Guerbet, France) will be used. The SELFI protocol for the Lipiodol HSG consists of the following:\n\n*   1\\. Fluoroscopic HSG images as per radiologist standard practice.\n*   2\\. Preliminary and post-procedure/delayed pelvic radiographs.\n    *   a. The post-procedure radiograph is obtained at least 45 minutes after completion of the HSG. An unopened ampoule of Lipiodol is taped over the right iliac bone with its long axis transverse, which acts as a reference density.\n    *   b. Both pre- and post-procedure radiographs are obtained on the same x-ray unit under the same conditions (e.g. height of tube and exposure factors), while attempting to match them as closely as possible, including in relation to bony landmarks. The preliminary radiograph will be digitally subtracted from the delayed radiograph, and an experienced radiologist (JMP) will derive a semi-quantitative assessment of the amount of retained OSCM in the pelvis after HSG (i.e. mild, moderate, or excessive).\n\nThe radiologist documents:\n\n*   a. Volume of Lipiodol used – excluding the dead space in the tubing and catheter.\n*   b. Tubal spill – classified as none, unilateral, or bilateral.\n*   c. Length of delay (in minutes) for the post procedure radiograph.\n*   d. Presence or absence of intravasation, graded into 4 levels: 0 – no intravasation; 1 – myometrial/lymphatic intravasation; 2 – intravasation into the adnexal veins; or 3 – intravasation into the pelvic/gonadal veins.\n\nExamples of the pre- and post-HSG radiographs are shown in Figure 2.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nPelvic radiographs: A) preliminary image obtained prior to OSCM hysterosalpingogram (HSG); B) after HSG, with lipiodol ampoule.</u>\n\n### 2.6 Data collection and management\n\nThe coordinating investigator will organise the tests with the community laboratory and receive the results of hormone tests and iodine levels. The radiologist will provide the necessary data from OSCM HSG and post-HSG radiograph to the coordinating investigator. All data collected will remain confidential. Each participant will be assigned a unique code and all data and information used for analyses will be deidentified. Only the clinicians in the study team will be able to match a code with a subject. All collected information in hard copy will be stored in locked cabinets, and electronic data in password-protected hardware or servers, accessible only by the study investigators. Hard copies of assessments and personal information will be stored in locked cabinets at the Liggins Institute (University of Auckland) for a minimum of 10 years, while electronic data will be stored indefinitely on password-protected hardware and/or servers. Anonymised findings from the study (without any identifiable information) will be reported in peer-reviewed publications and as part of a PhD thesis, and presented at reputable scientific meetings.\n\n### 2.7 Safety monitoring process\n\nThe OSCM HSG report will be sent within two days to the fertility specialist who referred the patient for the HSG, ensuring appropriate clinical management from the fertility perspective. Any abnormal thyroid result will be discussed with the research team reproductive endocrinologist, participant's fertility specialist, and their primary physician as needed. The participant will be also be informed of all their results.\n\nOf note, the HSG procedures will be occurring independent of the this study as they are the established current standard of practice. This study, irrespective of the results, will have no impact on use of HSGs, but rather will provide data that can be used to ensure that thyroid function is appropriately monitored following the HSGs and treatment initiated appropriately. Thus, as we are prospectively collecting safety data only, a data monitoring committee was not considered necessary.\n\n### 2.8 Primary outcome\n\nThe primary outcome in this study will be the development of SCH in the women following the HSG.\n\nNote: The reference range used are those for the community lab (Lab tests), where the thyroid assay (3rd generations Siemens) is performed and analysed.\n\nDevelopment of SCH defined as<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[43]</u></a></sup>\n\n*   a.

Thus, we aim to recruit 200 participants, as in the event of an approximate loss to follow-up of ≈33%, our study (n = 135) would still be powered to detect the same difference with 95% confidence. Of note, based on the data from the Japanese study showing a post-HSG rise in iodine levels, we conservatively estimate that 50% of women undergoing OSCM HSG with Lipiodol will develop iodine excess,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> and consequently SCH.\n\nIn this study, the TSH level will be examined in the context of iodine exposure, in particular, for the group of women with the highest and most prolonged iodine excess. Previous studies suggested that thyroid autoimmunity and subclinical hypothyroidism predispose to greater thyroid dysfunction.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[51]</u></a></sup> Thus, although the primary outcome is SCH following Lipiodol HSG, the potential adverse effects of Lipiodol HSG will likely be greater in those with iodine excess and positive thyroid antibodies, and/or SCH prior to HSG on the baseline test results. While the prevalence of positive anti-thyroid antibodies is ethnicity dependent,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[52]</u></a></sup> its overall prevalence in Australasia is 15% to 24%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[53,54]</u></a></sup> Therefore, from our target sample size of 200 participants, it is likely that approximately 100 women will have iodine excess, 15 to 25 of whom will also have positive anti-thyroid antibodies or baseline SCH, both of which predispose to a higher incidence of thyroid dysfunction.\n\nLastly, we estimate that 40% of participants will become pregnant based on data from the H2Oil study.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> As a result, 60 to 80 successful pregnancies are anticipated from conceptions achieved within 6 months of HSG.\n\n#### 2.10.2 Data analyses\n\nThe data will be entered into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with data entry rules to minimise data entry errors. All records entered will be checked by a second investigator to maximise data transcription accuracy. Descriptive statistics will be generated for primary and secondary outcomes. The incidence of SCH in our cohort (i.e. the primary outcome) will be compared to the expected background population rate of 10.1%<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u></a></sup> using a one-proportion _Z_\\-test. A range of additional analytical methods will be adopted to examine the various secondary outcomes. Data will be analysed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), SPSS v27 (IBM Corp, Armonk) and/or Minitab v19 (Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania). All statistical tests will be two-tailed, with statistical significance at _P_ < .05.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThere are compelling data suggesting that OSCM HSG enhances pregnancy rates.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7,8]</u></a></sup> Indeed, a recent Australasian consensus guideline suggested there was good quality evidence to support the use of OSCM to assess tubal patency and enhance pregnancy rates in couple with infertility.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> However, the guidelines suggested there be counselling for rare complications and that possible thyroid dysfunction would need monitoring.\n\nAs noted in the introduction, iodine excess is well described following OSCM HSG and likely common. Abnormalities in thyroid function have also been reported,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13,25,26]</u></a></sup> most commonly SCH and rarely hyperthyroidism. Existing literature indicates SCH occurs<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13,25,26]</u></a></sup> in as many as 1 in every 4 women who undergo an OSCM HSG.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> The available evidence on thyroid safety for the offspring remains contradictory.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[36,55]</u></a></sup>\n\nOur study has been designed to address this concern about the safety profile of OSCM HSG with respect to iodine excess and the impact on thyroid function. These data will subsequently be used to establish a protocol for monitoring thyroid function following OSCM HSG, including the frequency and duration of thyroid testing. Our study will also define the characteristics of women who are more likely to develop thyroid dysfunction. In particular, we hypothesize that those with higher iodine levels, elevated thyroid antibodies, or baseline SCH are at greater risk. We will also assess the utility of a semi-quantitative assessment by the radiologist of peritoneal OSCM spill from the delayed film post-HSG, as a marker for iodine excess, and its ability to identify those who are likely to develop thyroid dysfunction. Furthermore, this research will provide information on thyroid safety for the offspring conceived following a OSCM HSG.\n\nThe main limitation of the study is the lack of a control group. While the latter would have been useful, the primary aim of this study is to assess the prevalence and severity of iodine excess, and how these impact on the thyroid function in women receiving OSCM HSG.\n\nThe major strengths of the study are our relatively large planned sample size and multiple measurements of study outcomes. Although other studies have investigated thyroid function following Lipiodol HSG,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13,25,26]</u></a></sup> their sample sizes were relatively small, thyroid testing strategy heterogenous, and outcome endpoints inconsistent. Moreover, subjects with higher iodine levels were not grouped together and assessed for the extent of thyroid dysfunction.\n\nIn conclusion, we expect the SELFI study will improve the existing knowledge regarding the safety of Lipiodol HSG for the woman and their offspring. This will help infertile couples make informed choices on whether to undergo a Lipiodol HSG, and provide the supervising clinicians with valuable data to determine the appropriate frequency and duration of thyroid monitoring following a Lipiodol HSG.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThe author would like to thank the team at Auckland Radiology Group, Repromed fertility clinic, and Ascot Radiology for their support with recruitment.

An incidence estimated as approximately 2 to 5 in 100,000 children and adolescents are affected without convincing reference or statistic.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,3]</u></a></sup> Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in children has a bimodal distribution that reflects different etiologies in very young and older children. In neonates and infants, it is caused exclusively by inactivating mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor gene located on chromosome 3q, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> In older children and adolescents, HPT is usually more symptomatic, caused by the development of either solitary adenoma (85% of cases) commonly localized at the normal parathyroid gland level in the posterior aspect of the thyroid gland or ectopic (22%-of cases).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> The thymus gland is the most common site of ectopic parathyroid adenoma. Parathyroid carcinoma (<1% of cases) in children is very rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> The standard treatment of PHPT is surgical removal; however, locating an ectopic parathyroid adenoma preoperatively can be challenging.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> PHPT affects approximately 1% of the population, occurring mainly in individuals aged 50 to 60 years.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> This report presents a case of PHPT caused by ectopic parathyroid adenoma in an adolescent female.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 13-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a history of acute abdominal pain. Investigations revealed high lipase (220 U/L reference of 8–78 U/L) and high amylase (153 U/L; reference of 25–125 U/L) levels. The patient was admitted to a pediatric ward as a case of acute pancreatitis for conservative treatment. Further investigations were remarkable for high calcium level (2.7 mmol/L; reference of 2.1–2.55 mmol/L) and low serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level (7.5 ng/mL). Abdominal ultrasonography during admissions was normal.\n\nAfter uneventful hospitalization, she was discharged with a follow-up referral to the pediatric endocrinology clinic after one week for evaluation of hypercalcemia. After a thorough history review, we found that the patient exhibited multiple symptoms of hypercalcemia, including an inability to concentrate, worsening generalized muscle fatigue. The patient was not suffering from other symptoms of hypercalcemia like anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction, constipation, polyuria, and dehydration signs. Her family history was unremarkable. Further laboratory investigations results were elevated parathyroid hormone level (326.0 pg/mL; reference range of 15.0–68.3 pg/mL), normal phosphate level (1.3 mmol/L reference of0.7–1.5 mmol/L) and high chloride:phosphate ratio 82.1 which supported the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism which usually presents with a ratio >33.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Hence the diagnosis was primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT).\n\nA full imaging study including a normal neck ultrasound and 99mTc- MIBI (Sestamibi) scan was performed, which confirmed an ectopic anterior mediastinal parathyroid adenoma measuring 8.4 × 6.6 mm. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast showed an anterior mediastinal lesion at the midline embedded into the thymus at the level of the manubriosternal junction with no surrounding vasculature. Abdominal and renal ultrasound showed no nephrolithiasis. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scans with contrast were normal. The genetic test results of whole-exome sequencing were negative.\n\nDuring follow-up; the patient's calcium level was persistently high on three separate occasions ranging from (2.8–2.9 mmol/L); parathyroid hormone levels were also elevated ranging from (152.3–328.6 pg/mL) and phosphorus level was normal throughout our investigation ranging from (0.9 – 1.3 mmol/L). The fractional excreted calcium level was 0.005.\n\nThe patient was referred for further evaluation. Six months from the initial diagnosis, the patient was electively admitted for thoracoscopic thymus excision and ectopic anterior mediastinal parathyroid removal. Immediately after the operation, the parathyroid hormone level dropped to (1.22 pg/mL; reference range of 15.0–68.3 pg/mL), serum calcium and phosphorus were normal 2.48 mmol/Land 0.99 mmol/L, respectively. The patient became asymptomatic gradually. Laboratory workup repeated three times over three months showed PTH increase to 92.6,186.3, 165,2 pg/mL, respectively and serum calcium continued to be in the normal range of 2.5 mmol/L in the presence of low normal serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level 30 ng/mL. The patient was started on cholecalciferol and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D repeated twice 42 and 55.7 ng/mL with regular laboratory workup in an outpatient setting.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nCalcium is critically important for many body functions; the regulation of plasma concentrations is tightly controlled by the actions of the kidney, intestines, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Hypercalcemic disorders in children may present with hypotonia, poor feeding, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, lethargy, polyuria, dehydration, failure to thrive, and seizures. In severe cases, renal failure, pancreatitis, and reduced consciousness may also occur, and older children and adolescents may present with psychiatric symptoms.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Acute pancreatitis is a relatively uncommon presentation, recorded in less than 15% of reported cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe pathophysiology of pancreatitis in primary hyperparathyroidism is attributed to hypercalcemia, which leads to accelerated intrapancreatic activation of trypsinogen to trypsin, which causes pancreatic damage.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> Hypercalcemia in children is classified as parathyroid hormone PTH-dependent or PTH-independent and may be congenital or acquired.\n\nPTH-independent hypercalcemia is more common in children than PTH-dependent hypercalcemia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is relatively rare in the pediatric population with an incidence of 2 to 5 in 100,000 children and adolescents.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> In Saudi Arabia, one case reported primary hyperparathyroidism caused by severe neonatal primary hyperparathyroidism; a review of 46 cases at King Khalid University Hospital showed the patients affected to have a mean age of 44 years (13–70 years).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u></a></sup> Until 2013, only 200 cases of pediatric primary hyperparathyroidism were reported in the literature.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> PTH-dependent hypercalcemia is mostly due to primary parathyroid glandular disorder caused by a single adenoma (85% of cases), multiple adenomas (5% of cases), parathyroid hyperplasia (10%–15% of cases), and rarely caused by parathyroid carcinoma, which accounts for <1% of cases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Double adenomas are discrete entities that occur more often in older patients. Patients with double adenomas can be successfully treated by removing the two abnormal glands.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn this paper, we report a case of ectopic anterior mediastinal adenoma in a pediatric patient. PHPT in the pediatric population is usually due to isolated non-syndromic and non-hereditary endocrinopathies. Hereditary etiology in children is most commonly due to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT), familial isolated primary hyperparathyroidism or due to inherited complex syndrome disorders such as multiple endocrine neoplasia which is much less common than other hereditary causes .<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup>\n\nTable 1 - Genetics of Primary Hyperparathyroidism.\n\n| Syndrome | Responsible gene | Inheritance | Organs affected |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MEN 1 | MEN 1 gene on chromosome 11 | Autosomal Dominant | Parathyroid (90%), neuroendocrine tumor of pancreas and gastrointestinal tract (60%), pituitary adenoma (30%), neuroendocrine tumors of thymus and bronchus, adrenal hyperplasia and adenoma |\n| MEN 2A | MEN 2A (RET) gene on chromosome 10 | Autosomal Dominant | Parathyroid adenoma (20%-30%), medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma |\n| FHH 1 | CaSR gene on chromosome 3 | Autosomal Dominant | Parathyroid gland |\n| FHH 2 | GNA11 gene | Autosomal Dominant | Parathyroid gland |\n| FHH 3 | AP2S1 gene | Autosomal Dominant | Parathyroid gland |\n| NSHPT | CaSR gene | Autosomal Dominant | Parathyroid gland |\n| HPT-JT | CDC7 (HRPT2) gene on chromosome 1 | Autosomal Dominant | Hyperparathyroidisim, Fibro-osseous lesions of the mandible and maxilla; risk of parathyroid-carcinoma in 10% – 15%; associated with renal lesions; renal cell carcinoma, Wilms tumor; hamartomas and cysts. |\n| FIHPT | Different mutations: MEN1, CaSR, CDC73 (HRTP2) genes |  | Parathyroid gland |\n\nCaSR = calcium-sensing receptor, FHH1–3 = familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia1–3, FIHPT = familial isolated hyperparathyroidism,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2,8]</u></a></sup> HPT-JT = hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, MEN1 = multiple endocrine neoplasia1, MEN2A = multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A, NSHPT = neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism.\n\nParathyroid adenomas may occur in ectopic sites in up to 20% to 22% of primary hyperparathyroidism cases <sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>. This is attributed to the embryological origin of the parathyroid glands, which develop from the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches and descends with the thymus.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> When found at the ectopic site, parathyroid adenoma is located at the mediastinum in approximately 60% of cases, with the majority being localized in the thymus gland.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> The diagnosis of HPT in children is increasing, most likely due to routine screening of calcium levels and increasing awareness of this diagnosis by primary physicians.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup>\n\nRoutine investigations for primary hyperparathyroidism caused by adenoma include elevated serum calcium level and parathyroid hormone level, decreased or low normal phosphate level, elevated serum chloride, elevated chloride-to-phosphate ratio >33,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,7]</u></a></sup> and calcium-to-creatinine clearance ratio will be generally >0.02 while the ratio is < 0.02 in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20,21]</u></a></sup>\n\nGenetic screening in children diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism is essential, as genetic mutations are observed in 24% to 46% of children with PHPT.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup>\n\nImaging of abnormal parathyroid glands is needed for the diagnostic workup to identify the exact location of the enlarged gland, whether it is eutopic or ectopic, and differentiate between single and multiple gland diseases. The initial use of ultrasound to detect the size, position, and location has a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 67%. The Tc 99 MIBI scan is better than ultrasound for detecting ectopic adenomas in children with a sensitivity of 60% to 90%; combined use of ultrasound and Tc 99 MIBI have a sensitivity of 73%. CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and selective venous sampling are rarely required in pediatric patients and are only performed in cases where ultrasound and Tc 99 MIBI are negative or in cases of recurrent hyperparathyroidism.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup>\n\nEctopic parathyroid gland (EPG) refers to a gland that is located outside of its orthotopic site. An EPG can arise from abnormal migration during embryogenesis or can be acquired. The enlarged glands can become displaced from their orthotopic locations due to their size, under the influence of gravity, or by mass effect from an associated enlarged thyroid. EPG is divided by location to inferior, superior, and intrathyroidal EPG  .<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nIntrathymic inferior parathyroid adenoma.

Symptomatic patients or those who have high levels of calcium (>3 mmol/L) require admission and treatment with rehydration, diuretics, and bisphosphonate infusion. While asymptomatic patients with moderate hypercalcemia should be investigated and observed. Most children should be promptly scheduled for surgery.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup>\n\nFor surgical management, the choice of operating technique includes traditional bilateral neck exploration or minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP). MIP has shown favorable outcomes due to improved sensitivity of imaging and use of Tc 99 MIBI/SPECT CT and ultrasound, although reports regarding MIP in pediatric patients are limited.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup>\n\nPHPT due to ectopic parathyroid adenoma/carcinoma is treated by parathyroidectomy. Surgical exploration should be minimized by accurate preoperative localization of the target gland. Detection methods include preoperative 99mTc-MIBI, which has a sensitivity of 68% to 86%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24,25]</u></a></sup> False-positive findings on imaging of the mediastinum may be due to lung cancer metastasis or mediastinal tumors such as thymoma, seminoma, and lymphoma. Negative results can be caused by multiple adenomas and hyperplasia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26,27]</u></a></sup> Following successful resection of hyperfunctional parathyroid glands, PTH levels can drop >50%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[28,29]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe parathyroid hormone level might remain elevated three months after the operation as in this case despite normalization of serum calcium and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels. After surgical treatment of HPT, the outcome is defined by long term calcium levels rather than PTH levels because PTH levels can remain elevated despite normal calcium levels. Patients with normal calcium levels over the long-term are said to be cured. The outcomes of pediatric patients after parathyroidectomy for HPT are similar to adults, with 96% to 100% cured in reported series.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,21–22]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn a recent case report and literature review, an adolescent with ectopic parathyroid adenoma was successfully treated with surgery and was followed up for 5 years with no signs or symptoms of hyperparathyroidism. By reviewing the literature, only seven cases of PHPT associated with ectopic parathyroid lesions in adolescents have been reported. Parathyroidectomy is the only known curative treatment. Accurate preoperative localization of the target lesion is critical.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup>\n\nFinally, in case of acute pancreatitis with unusual generalized body fatigue in adolescent age group, we should check for hypercalcemia as the initial workup for possible hyperparathyroidism.\n\n4 Conclusions\n-------------\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is rare, and pancreatitis is an unusual presentation in children. The diagnosis of PHPT in pediatric patients is frequently delayed. Here, we report a rare case of PHPT due to parathyroid ectopic adenoma in an adolescent female. We recommend initial laboratory and imaging screening for children in whom PHPT is suspected. Early diagnosis can facilitate early treatment and prevent organ damage that can result from delayed diagnosis.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nAll authors shared in researching and writing.

Approximately 1 in 3 people in the United States will develop shingles in their lifetime.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Typical untreated healing time of herpes zoster symptoms is approximately 30 days, although symptoms may last for weeks, months or even longer. More severe symptoms often associated with herpes zoster include postherpetic neuralgia, which leads to persistent stabbing and burning pain for 3 or more months after complete healing of the lesions.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> This pain occurs along the previously shingles-affected dermatome without the development of a rash. Conventional medicine most commonly uses anti-viral pharmaceuticals such as oral acyclovir and narcotic analgesics, such as oxycodone, for treatment of the virus and pain relief, respectively. Acyclovir and related compounds, including valacyclovir and famcicyclovir, act by competitive inhibition of the viral deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase followed by incorporation into and termination of the growing viral deoxyribonucleic acid chain. Naturopathic medicine has had repeated success in treating VZV with the use of botanicals with antiviral, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and vulnerary properties. Historical use of _Melissa officinalis_,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3,4]</u></a></sup>_Hypericum perforatum_,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5–7]</u></a></sup>_Eleutherococcus senticosus_,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup>_Glycyrrhiza glabra_,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9,10]</u></a></sup>_Lavandula officinalis_<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> and _Sarracenia purpurea_<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11–14]</u></a></sup> have purported anti-viral properties making them putative efficacious herbs for use against VZV. Some of these herbs have other actions as well that may aid in the healing process of herpes zoster infections such as _Hypericum perforatum_ with vulnerary actions, _Glycyrrhiza glabra_ with anti-inflammatory properties, and _Sarracenia purpurea_ with analgesic constituents. Significantly, constituents of _Sarracenia purpurea_ have been used for relieving pain in the neck, back and other body locations.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u></a></sup> Studies have also shown allantoin<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> and glycerin, which are present in the formulation used in this study, to have wound healing properties and therefore may improve VZV-associated symptoms as well.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> The following case presents the efficacy of a commercially available topical herbal formulation containing the constituents listed above in the successful treatment of an active herpes zoster outbreak.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 26-year-old Caucasian female presented with a diagnosis of herpes zoster with small lesions on her mid-right abdomen and large weeping lesions on her mid-left abdomen and back . The patient complained of severe burning, pain and itching, which she reported as a 9/10 (10 being the worst) . Her primary care physician prescribed acyclovir, neurontin and codeine, but she declined treatment because she was interested in seeking naturopathic alternatives. Following a subsequent medical exam, the patient was prescribed a commercially available botanical formulation (Aviratek Biomedical Solutions) of ethanol and/or glycerin extracted _Hypericum perforatum_ (2.5%), _Lavandula officinalis_ (10%), _Glycyrrhiza glabra_ (2.5%), _Melissa officinalis_ (6%), _Eleutherococcus senticosus_ (4%) and mixed species of _Sarracenia_ (25%) suspended in a Versabase gel (50%). The Versabase gel was composed of allantoin, aloe vera, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and methylchloroisothiazolinone. The patient was asked to document her pain and photograph the affected area to monitor her progress. Instructions for application of the topical gel were to wash the area with warm water only (no soap) and pat dry, then begin at the outer edge of the affected area and apply a very thin layer of gel to cover all the lesions. The entire area was then covered with a Teflon coated bandage. The gel was to be reapplied 4 times daily with repeated application and covering instructions including rewashing the area prior to bedtime and as well in the morning. The physician recommended no other adjunct medications or supplementations for the patient during the treatment period. The treatment protocol was continued for a period of 14-days.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nPhotographic progress of the patient's zoster lesions.

A numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0–10, with 10 being the most severe, was used to assess the pain level. Figure 1 demonstrates the visual improvement of the herpes zoster lesions on the mid-left abdomen (top panels) and the mid-left back (bottom panels) throughout the protocol, and Figure 2 shows the improvement in pain levels and sensitivity. Dramatically, the majority of improvement in both lesion severity and pain was observed from day 1 to day 3. The lesions started out as extremely painful, large fluid-filled vesicles, and by day 3, a significant visual decrease in fluid extrusion from the blisters was observed and the vesicles were no longer raised. By day 3 of treatment, the lesions only showed signs of erythema and were beginning to form crusts. In addition, between days 1, 2 ,and 3, the patient reported her pain level went from 9/10 to 2/10, to less than 1/10, respectively. The patient also reported that the itching was completely resolved by day 3. From day 3 to day 6, the lesions became completely dried and crusted with her pain being completely resolved. By day 9 all of the lesions were healed, with minor erythema still visible. By day 14, the patient reported feeling completely well again with very slight redness from where the initial larger lesions were located.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThis case demonstrates the effectiveness of a naturopathic approach for the treatment of an outbreak of herpes zoster using a topical antiviral/analgesic botanical treatment. A typical, untreated herpes zoster outbreak frequently takes a minimum of 30 days to fully resolve. In many instances, resolution may take much longer. The common timeline for shingles is a 2 to 3 day prodromal phase, followed by 3 to 4 days for the rash to form into vesicles or blisters.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Fluid inside the blisters is initially clear, but may become cloudy after 3 to 4 days. After another 5 days, the blisters begin erupting, secreting fluid and subsequently drying out and forming a crust. Complete healing typically takes another 2 to 4 weeks.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Oral acyclovir, or related compounds, are the most common first line of treatment for a herpes zoster outbreak, but it has often been proven only moderately effective in clinical settings. A clinical study demonstrated that acyclovir dosed at 800 mg, 5 times daily for 7 to 10 days had no statistically significant effect on acute pain after 1 month.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> Acyclovir did show a decrease in overall healing time of herpes zoster when compared to a placebo, but only by 1 to 2 days.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> Another study done on valacyclovir versus acyclovir showed that valacyclovir healed the rash by day 15 with complete healing by day 22 which was better than acyclovir's healing time of 29 days, but still demonstrating only moderate efficacy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> As shown in this case study, the botanical herbal formulation used to treat herpes zoster resulted in the fluid-filled vesicles crusting over by day 3 and complete healing by day 14, which is at least a 50% decrease in healing time compared to acyclovir.\n\nPain is 1 of the most debilitating factors about a herpes zoster outbreak and with acyclovir and valacyclovir treatments alone, pain is typically not fully relieved until days 14 to 29.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> Oxycodone is the most common conventional treatment for the neuralgia associated with a herpes zoster outbreak. It is an oral opioid pain medication prescribed to help decrease the symptoms of pain associated with shingles, but has several adverse side effects including constipation, nausea, vomiting, headaches, fatigue and itchiness. Studies with oxycodone report a moderate reduction in pain in only about 50% of shingles patients and the medication is often discontinued due to severe constipation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Therefore, conventional approaches have, at best, limited success with reducing pain in patients afflicted with shingles. In the presented case, the antiviral/analgesic botanical formulation (_Hypericum perforatum_ (2.5%), _Lavandula officinalis_ (10%), _Glycyrrhiza glabra_ (2.5%), _Melissa officinalis_ (6%), _Eleutherococcus senticosus_ (4%) and mixed species of _Sarracenia_ (25%) suspended in a Versabase gel (50%)) resulted in a drastic decrease in pain by day 2 and complete pain relief between days 3 to 6. Much of this analgesic effect is likely associated with the _Sarracenia spp._, which has a long history of pain relief and use as an anesthetic.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup>\n\nAcyclovir, like many pharmaceutical-grade treatments, have common, as well as serious, side effects associated with their use. Acyclovir most commonly causes a general ill feeling, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea and headaches, and more concerning side effects like seizures, hallucinations, and possible signs of an allergic reaction. Notably, the topical botanical formulation used in this case study presented no adverse reactions when used on the patient during the treatment protocol. This may support the use of these anti-viral/analgesic herbs for topical application on immunocompromised patients infected with VZV, who are 1 of the largest populations affected by herpes zoster. With acyclovir being so commonly used to treat VZV, there are numerous studies that illustrate the frequent development of drug-resistant herpes viruses in clinical settings, particularly in immunocompromised patients. When using a mono-therapy, like acyclovir, a virus is often more likely to gain resistance as compared to a combination therapy,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18,19]</u></a></sup> such as a multi-herbal formulation, since numerous different constituents are present to inhibit viral replication.\n\nThis case study used research-based, historical anti-viral/analgesic botanicals in the efficacious treatment of herpes zoster in a clinical setting. This botanical formulation has previously been reported to have efficacy for the treatment of herpes simplex virus-1 associated herpes labialis, supporting the use of these botanicals against other members of the herpes virus family.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> This case demonstrates a significant and rapid decrease in pain and lesion severity when compared to the conventional first line therapy of acyclovir. In conclusion, the anti-viral/analgesic commercially available botanical formulation described in this study showed significant efficacy related to overall healing and decreased pain of a herpes zoster outbreak. This case study provides support that an alternative botanical protocol may represent a more efficacious treatment of varicella-zoster virus leading to the development of shingles .\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nSouthwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and the Ric Scalzo Institute for Botanical Research and the Research Department\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nAF and JL supervised the study.

Since most of them are in the advanced stage at the time of diagnosis and the treatment effect is not satisfactory, gastric cancer has also become one of the common causes of death caused by cancer worldwide.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> The primary surgical approach for patients with resectable Stomach Neoplasms is radical resection with D2 lymph node dissection.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy was first performed for A patient with early-stage stomach cancer by Kitanoin in Japan in 1994,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Since then, Laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) has gradually become a surgical option for gastric cancer. As several randomized clinical trials have reported, laparoscopic distal gastrectomy expressed the following benefits comparing with open surgery for Early-stage cancer patients: Less intraoperative bleeding, Earlier autonomous activities, Accelerated recovery of gastrointestinal function with earlier oral intake, shorter hospital stay, and similar curative effect.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4–12]</u></a></sup> Currently, Most guidelines regard laparoscopic surgery as one of the standard operation for early-stage cancer patients undergoing distal gastrectomy (eg, The latest guide in Japan (5th edition).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> As laparoscopic techniques become more widely accepted and expertly applied in clinical practice, more and more surgeons are performing it during surgical treatment for patients beyond the early stage. However, the effects of LG on Short-term clinical outcomes and long-term survival are still uncertainty for patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC), compared with open gastrectomy (OG). although several randomized control trials and meta-analysis studies have shown that laparoscopic approach has the advantage of less trauma and fast recovery,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13–20]</u></a></sup> the evidence is not enough to prove laparoscopic surgery can be recommended as an effective measure to treatment resectable AGC, compared to laparotomy. More convincing evidence should be synthesized and presented.\n\n2 Aim and purpose of this review\n--------------------------------\n\nThe academic community needs a summary overview that evaluates the depth and strength of existing research evidence in order to clarify the potential benefits and harms of laparoscopic gastrectomy for AGC compared to OG. To achieve this goal, we will conduct a comprehensive review by collecting and evaluating supporting evidence from previous systematic reviews comparing LG and OG. Results from this high quality system review should answer the following questions: What are the benefits and harms of LG versus OG in patients with AGC? Does it have non-inferiority? Whether LG can be an effective surgical method to replace OG? since there have been a lot about this topic reviews, but the conclusion is not the same, need timely evidence to tell medical terms, therefore, a new systematic review is inappropriate. Umbrella review is an ideal way to summarize the highest level of evidence (eg. systematic reviews and meta-analyses), guiding us to critically integrate the existing evidence base and explore differences found in previous systematic reviews to draw more reliable conclusions.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u></a></sup>\n\n3 Methods and analysis\n----------------------\n\nThe design of the study was inspired by the Joanna Briggs Institute's Umbrella Review Methodology guidelines.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> the protocol was drafted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 (PRISMA-P 2015)删除6：<u>(Appendix)</u>.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> Note Express will be used for literature management in the process of research, including the preservation of search results, preliminary screening of research, acquisition and reading of full text.

The literature retrieval will be conducted in Medical subject heading terms and keywords, which including ‘Stomach Neoplasms’, ‘Gastric Neoplasm’, ‘gastric cancer’, ‘gastric carcinoma’, ‘gastric adenocarcinoma’, ‘advanced’, ‘open gastrectomy’, ‘laparoscopic gastrectomy’ and ‘systematic reviews’ or ‘meta-analysis’. The key words will be combined as much as possible to retrieve the maximum number of Published articles. Additionally, we will search the reference folder of included articles by manual to identify other reviews relevant to our topic.\n\n### 3.2 Eligibility criteria\n\nThe criteria for inclusion in this review will accord the ‘PICOS’ pattern:<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup>\n\nParticipant: Adult patients diagnosed as resectable AGC.\n\nIntervention: Laparoscopic total/partial gastrectomy.\n\nComparison: Open total/partial gastrectomy.\n\nOutcomes: the outcomes of laparoscopic approach compared with open surgery will include intraoperative conditions, postoperative short-term clinical outcomes and long-term survival rate.\n\nStudy design: systematic review and/or meta- analysis.\n\nThe outcomes will respect the study reports and will not determine the inclusion or exclusion of the reviews. The individual study design included in the systematic reviews was limited to randomized controlled trial or retrospective non-randomized controlled study or both. aggregated data for the laparoscopic and open groups must be presented separately during the evidence evaluation process. All English and Chinese literature conformed to the admission criteria will be selected and included in the study.\n\nIncluded reviews will be excluded if they do not meet the following minimum criteria:\n\nThe search strategy was performed in at least two databases, and the specific search process was described in detail; Inclusion and exclusion of studies were clearly defined and elaborated; System review must include a meta-analysis, and include at least three original studies; Must provide a standard and reasonable quality evaluation of all selected studies as well as present the results; Risk of bias in individual studies must be assessed; The outcomes of interest should be reported from at least two studies, with specific description of characteristic information at both the study and patient levels as well as detailed explanation of the conclusions and significance of the pooled effect. In the comprehensive effect evaluation, early-stage and advanced gastric cancer was described separately, and the effect comparison of mixed together will be excluded.\n\n### 3.3 Study selection\n\nThe titles, abstracts identified in the search will be examined in detail by two researchers (JS and QW) independently in a standardised procedure. Full text will be obtained for all subject-related results determined by at least one reviewer. Literature that meets the criterion of acceptability will be screened and included. Differences will be resolved through discussion, or by the intervention of a third author (PPG) if necessary.\n\n### 3.4 Quality assessment\n\nTwo independent authors (JS and QW) will appraise the quality of all selected reviews using the AMSTAR2 tool, which uses 16 items to measure the methodological quality of systematic reviews.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> disagreements will be resolved by discussion or consultation. The scores assessed reflect only the overall quality of the included studies and do not serve as criteria for inclusion and exclusion. For the same outcome, if the original researches overlap completely in multiple systematic reviews, we will select the highest-quality review.\n\n### 3.5 Outcomes and prioritization\n\nThe primary indicators of interest will be operation time, blood loss, numbers of retrieved lymphnodes, The hospitalization time and the overall survival. Additionally, if data were available, the secondary aims will include time to first flatus, Time to first oral administration, incidence of complications, disease-free survival, and others. All results will be evaluated against the definitions in the selected reviews.\n\n### 3.6 Data collection\n\nData will be collected by two independent authors (DF and PPG) from all inclusion studies screened according to the eligible criteria above indicated. discrepancies will be settled by consensus, in addition, the third investigator (JS) will intervene if necessary and his judgment shall be determined as final. For each included meta-analysis, we will extract the following data: first author, publication date, type of review, search strategy, number of studies, included types of studies (eg, randomized controlled trial or retrospective non-randomized controlled study), interventions, total population, characteristics of participating patients, method of evaluating primary studies and quality assessment, outcomes of interest, as well as its overall effect and 95% confidence interval. For each included individual study within a meta-analysis: first author, publication date, Country of publication, types of studies, number of patients, epidemiologic feature, clinicopathological characteristics will be recorded. we will also keep a watchful eye on the authors’ conclusion or recommendation of each review.\n\nData extraction forms designed according to the Joanna Briggs Institute's recommendation<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u></a></sup> will be generated to record above information.\n\n### 3.7 Data summary\n\nWe will Comprehensive analysis the including high-quality systematic reviews compared between LG and OG for AGC. The advantages and disadvantages of LG versus OG in each outcome will be summarized in a narrative manner. The overall effect extracted from systematic reviews will be pooled to present by using tabular presentation. overall description of included review's characteristics will be exhibited by a detailed Table, which including first author, published year, type of review, numbers of studies, including study design, interventions, number of patients. Outcome indicators will be pooled depending on the number of trials, total patients, effect estimates and heterogeneity. Outcomes will also be subgroup aggregated, including randomized controlled trial and retrospective non-randomized controlled study, total gastrectomy and distal gastrectomy, locally advanced and advanced gastric cancer.\n\nThe assessment report of the methodological quality will be provided in tabular form as a result of a programmatic evaluation of the selected reviews using the AMSTAR tool.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u></a></sup> The _I_<sup><em>2</em></sup> statistics will be used to measure heterogeneity among the included studies of each meta-analysis. Publication bias will be estimated by using Egger test, including the effect of small studies, as well as results of statistical significance will be determined if P value is less than 0.1. Because the existence of a potential excess significance bias implies an implausible increase in the number of statistically significant studies, we will analyze and detect it for each selected review. The strength of evidence for each outcome will be appraised according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation standard,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> as well as categorised into high, moderate, low, or very low quality. Finally, we will identify and elaborate on strong evidence supporting favorable or adverse outcomes in terms of LG versus OG for AGC.\n\n### 3.8 Patient and public involvement\n\nThis umbrella review will be conducted without the participation of patients or any members of the public.\n\n### 3.9 Ethics and dissemination\n\nPatient demographics and clinical data will be obtained from published articles, so informed consent from patients as well as ethical approval will not be required. We will present the progress and results of this review at a number of open academic conferences where surgeons and academic colleagues may be interested in the topic of our review. The final results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated through other digital media.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nDF and PPG designed the study.

Though we achieve the intended goals with cranioplasty, complications are not uncommon in these patients. The complication rate ranges from 12% to 50%, and possible complications include infection, wound dehiscence, hematoma, bone resorption and implant exposure.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> The titanium cranioplasty exposure rate was reported to be as high as 13.9%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> For these patients, free-tissue transfer is a popular reconstruction option to cover the defect, but most patients are afraid to undergo this major surgery.\n\nDermal autografts have been used as alternative acellular dermal matrices in tissue expander breast reconstruction for a long time because they are cost-effective, biocompatible and readily available.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Platelet-rich plasma has been proven to contain more than 1100 peptides that have anti-inflammatory and tissue repair functions.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Many reports have demonstrated that the application of platelet-rich plasma promotes wound healing.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Herein, we propose an easier method for rescuing wounds with titanium mesh exposure.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nOur patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of gout, hepatitis and chronic renal disease. He underwent left frontoparietal-temporal craniectomy and cranioplasty with autologous bone in 2010 due to a traffic accident. However, he suffered from an epidural abscess and then underwent debridement and craniectomy in 2017. Reconstruction with titanium cranioplasty was performed in the same year. Three months later, the neurosurgeon found titanium implant exposure, and he was referred to our outpatient clinic. On examination, the ulcer with implant exposure had little exudate without malodor. The undermining wound had epithelial ingrowth and was 1.5 cm × 0.5 cm in size.  The wound culture was staphylococcus lugdunensis-positive. The following brain computed tomography scan revealed that the skin flap over the titanium mesh was quite thin and unsuitable for local flap harvest, and the titanium cranioplasty area was approximately 15 cm × 10 cm.  Combination treatment with oral antibiotics and biofilm decontamination with Aquacel Ag Plus Extra<sup>®</sup> (ConvaTec Inc. NC) was used to manage peri-implantitis for 6 weeks. Because the patient was a heavy smoker and the skin flap was unreliable for local flap reconstruction as previously mentioned, free flap surgery was suggested, but the patient refused. The alternative procedure, combination treatment with a dermal autograft with platelet-rich plasma, was accepted. Upon repeated wound cultures reporting negative results, we performed the operation under general anesthesia.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\n(A) The underlying wound had epithelial ingrowth and was 1.5 cm × 0.5 cm in size over the left parietal region of the head. (B) The skin flap over the large titanium mesh was 15 cm x 10 cm in size and was quite thin.</u>\n\n3 Operation technique\n---------------------\n\nUnder general anesthesia, dermal autografts were harvested from the left thigh. First, we used a Zimmer dermatome to separate the epidermal flap from the underlying dermis with a thickness of 0.012 inches. In the second step, we harvested the dermal autograft with a thickness of 0.020 inches.  After that, we reattached the epidermal flap to the underlying tissue and fixed it with a surgical staple.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\n(A) (B) We harvested epidermis and partial dermis with a thickness of 0.012 inches, and then we harvested dermal autografts with a thickness of 0.020 inches. (C) One-month follow-up picture showed that the donor site was healing quite well.</u>\n\nWe performed adequate debridement of the implant exposure area without removal of the implant, and an approximately 2 mm wide area of de-epithelization was created around the ulcer margin. The created wound size was 2 cm x 1 cm. The dermal autograft was secured to the wound with PDS (polydioxanone) 4–0 sutures, and then platelet-rich plasma was locally injected into the periwound skin.\n\nThe initial dressing after the procedure included the topical usage of antibiotic ointment with AQUACEL Foam<sup>®</sup> (ConvaTec Inc. NC) for coverage for 3 weeks,  and then his dressing was later shifted to Biatain<sup>®</sup> (Coloplast, Amsterdam) until the wound completely healed. The wound healed after 4 weeks.  The donor site also showed great healing of reattached skin without complications.  A telephone interview was performed at 9 months postoperatively, and the scar condition was stable without recurrent ulcers. Also, the patient gave his informed consent authorizing use and disclosure of his protected health information after this interview.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 3:\n\n(A) Recipient site picture on postoperative day 1. (B) The process of angiogenesis within the wound bed could be observed on postoperative day 4, and (C) the 1-month follow-up picture showed a completely healed ulcer.</u>\n\n4 Discussion\n------------\n\nThere are many factors that can cause patients to have titanium implant exposure and poor healing. Systemic factors such as age, sex, hormones, diabetes, fibrosis, smoking, and radiation and local factors such as infection and foreign bodies will lead to poor wound healing.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> In addition, titanium mesh has been reported to cause thinning of the soft tissues and extrusion,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> and compromised tissue quality and vascularity due to repeated surgery could also result in scalp ulceration.\n\nThe exposure rate of titanium mesh after cranioplasty was reported to be as high as 13.9%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> For these patients, free-tissue transfer is a popular treatment for reconstruction because of its high salvage rate, even though the defect may be small and amenable to local flap coverage. However, according to a study by Chou et al, a local flap could fail despite the defect size being only 1 cm × 1 cm.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> Given that the patient underwent repeated surgery and was a heavy smoker and that a thin skin flap just overlaid the large titanium mesh (area: 15 cm × 10 cm), the risk of a local flap was extremely high. Therefore, we suggested a dermal autograft with a local injection of platelet-rich plasma as an alternative method to reconstruct the defect.\n\nStatistically, the average thickness of the skin over the thigh is approximately 1.032 mm to 1.220 mm.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Therefore, we separated the epidermis and partial dermis from the underlying dermis with a thickness of 0.012 inches. Then, we harvested the dermal autograft with a thickness of 0.020 inches, approximately half of the thickness of the skin.\n\nThe acellular dermal matrix has been proven to be useful in wound healing and tissue regeneration due to its properties as a scaffold for granulation as well as fibroblast attachment, angiogenesis stimulation and inclusion of growth factors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> The dermal autograft demonstrated no significant impact in the complication rate compared with acellular dermal matrix.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Moreover, the autologous dermis serves as a cost-effective, more readily available, safer, and well-tolerated material for reconstruction.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Hence, dermal autografts have been used to cover various wounds, including burns and complicated wounds with exposed bones or tendons.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13,14]</u></a></sup>\n\nPlatelet-rich plasma contains more than 1100 various peptides and has some anti-inflammatory and tissue repair functions.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Several kinds of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor, platelet-derived angiogenesis factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor and fibronectin, are believed to be transmitters in the process of healing.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> Thus, platelet-rich plasma has been applied to various fields, including tissue regeneration, wound healing, scar revision, skin rejuvenating effects, and alopecia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> Similar concepts to dermal autografts with platelet-rich plasma injections, such as acellular dermal matrix loaded with connective tissue growth factor, were believed to promote diabetic wound healing.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> In our case, neovascular ingrowth was found on postoperative day 4, and the wound completely healed after 4 weeks. A skin graft could not survive on a nonviable implant, but the dermal autograft could serve as a scaffold for cell migration and promote wound healing with the help of platelet-rich plasma.\n\nOnce the complication occurred after titanium cranioplasty, the plate removal rate was reported to be as high as 10.3%.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> According to Di Rienzo et al, 33% (2 in 6) of patients underwent local flap reconstruction, which failed to treat the scalp ulcers.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> As we have mentioned, compromised tissue quality and vascularity after repeated surgery contributed to the high recurrence rate after local flap reconstruction. Our surgical technique successfully salvaged the implant with less tissue dispense and donor site morbidity than free flaps. In addition, less manpower and equipment were needed than that with free tissue transfer, and this skill is easier to acquire and master. Although the extraction of platelet-rich plasma may require an extra expense, the shortened length of stay and lower requirement for medical resources lead to reduced health insurance expenses.\n\nIn the case series reported by Chou et al. 4 of 12 (33%) implant exposure areas were less than 1 cm<sup>2</sup> in size.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> In the case series from Yoshioka et al,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> 10 of 14 (71.4%) mesh exposure ulcer areas were less than 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. In these cases, dermal autografts with platelet-rich plasma could serve as a salvage alternative if the outcome of the local flap was in doubt. We do not claim that this technique could treat all implant exposures of any size because there are still limitations in its application for the reconstruction of large defects. If the exposure area is too large, this technique would not be feasible. We need more case-control studies and larger case numbers for further investigation.\n\n5 Conclusion\n------------\n\nDermal autografts with platelet-rich plasma may serve as an alternative method if the feasibility of a local flap is in doubt and the wound defect is smaller than 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case to present a satisfactory result from the reconstruction of a titanium implant exposure site by this simple method.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nLee performed case review and writing of manuscript.

It is characterized by severe skin lesions affecting exposed parts of the body, hemolytic anemia, and a large concentration of porphyrins in the urine.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> There is no special treatment for this disease. It is reported that avoidance of sunlight and oral administration of β-carotene has a beneficial effect.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> There are few reports about this disease in literature. Here we present one case of congenital eryhtropoietic porphyria with details about the diagnosis and treatment.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nA 4-year-old female presented to our hospital in August 2020 with a 3-year history of papular vesicles and blisters on the face and hands. At 1 year after birth, the child began to develop red papules and blisters (ranging in sizes comparable to rice grains and soybeans) on her face and hands. The papules were recurrent and aggravated after exposure to the sun or during the summer months; the condition appeared to be relieved in winter months. Concave scarring was left on the skin after the papules resolved. Meanwhile, dark brown urine began to accompany the rash episodes. At about 2-years-old, the parents noted that the child's facial skin had become rough and there were wrinkles around the mouth. At the age of 3 years, the child's hands gradually began to deform, with the joints becoming stiff. The child had no other past illness. The birth history and feeding history was uneventful. There was no abnormality in growth and development. She was in kindergarten, and there was no significant difference in intelligence with children of the same age. The parents had a non-consanguineous marriage. She had a sibling sister who had no similar disease. There was no history of similar illness in the family.\n\nExamination upon admission revealed the child's skin on the exposed parts of the face and back of the hands to be rough and regularly pigmented but with spots of hypopigmentation and atrophic scars. Telangiectatic erythema was observed on the face and auricle. The child had heavy eyebrows and eyelashes, atrophic lines around the mouth, and yellowish-brown teeth. Both hands had rice-size papulovesicles and blisters, which were ulcerated and scabby; the interphalangeal joints were stiff, with limited extension ability, and the nails were slightly thickened, deformed, and lacking luster.\n\nRoutine testing for blood parameters, liver function and renal function gave normal results. Abdominal ultrasound showed no obvious abnormalities. Ophthalmic examination showed no photophobia and no visual loss. Wood's lamp examination showed the brown teeth to display pink fluorescence and the dark brown urine to display orange-red fluorescence. Under the fluorescence microscope, the blood smear showed fluorescence positive red blood cells. Continuous spectrophotometer was used to detect the absorption spectra of serum and urine. It was found that there was a strong absorption peak at 390 to 430 nm in serum and 380–420 nm in urine, which was consistent with the absorption peak range of porphyrins.\n\nX-ray showed contracture of the distal phalanges for both hands but no abnormalities of the metacarpal and carpal bones. Histopathological examination of the left dorsal skin lesions showed mild hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the epidermis, along with formation of subepidermal blisters and infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils in the superficial dermis. The final diagnosis was CEP.\n\nSun protection was recommended and β-carotene (15 mg/d, oral) was prescribed. After 2 months, the papules and papulovesicles were significantly reduced. At present, the child is still under follow-up but no recurrence of the rash has occurred.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nCEP, although rare and hereditary, can occur in both males and females, with onset in both childhood and adult years. It is the most serious and rare type of porphyria. The underlying pathogenesis involves uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS) gene defect in the process of bone marrow erythropoiesis. It leads to disordered synthesis of urobilinogen to uroporphyrinogen III, due to a decrease in or lack of uroporphyrinogen III synthase (URO-COS), which leads to substantially increased synthesis of uroporphyrinogen I and coproporphyrinogen.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u></a></sup> Consequently, a large number of protoporphyrins are not only deposited in immature erythrocytes but also distributed throughout various tissues _via_ the blood circulation. These molecular events release energy, producing fluorescence (and destructive chemical reactions) visible under ultraviolet radiation, detected under 400 nm wavelength. The reactions can cause skin damage, brown teeth and bone marrow, hemolytic anemia, and red-colored urine. Laboratory parameters detectable in clinic include significantly elevated porphyrin I in plasma, erythrocytes, urine and feces; reticulocyte increase, as well as vigorous bone marrow hyperplasia, with red blood cells emitting red fluorescence in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> CEP is a disease with diverse clinical manifestations, which is closely related to the degree of UROS defect caused by gene mutation.\n\nFor the case described, herein, the blisters gradually appeared on the exposed parts of the skin (_i.e_. face and hands), leaving sunken scars upon healing. Under regular visibility in the sunlight or standard artificial (room) lighting, the urine was dark brown, the face was old in appearance, the facial hair growth was robust; laboratory testing showed the hematoporphyrin concentration to be higher than normal and the urine porphyrin to yield a strongly positive result. Under Wood's’ lighting, the teeth fluoresced light pink and the urine fluoresced orange-red. These combined findings supported the diagnosis of CEP.\n\nThere is no special treatment for this disease. Clinicians generally recommend avoidance of sunlight. Creams and other topically-applied protective agents are recommended to be applied locally; dihydroxyacetone and henna quinone are reportedly most effective, as they can produce a barrier effect against sunlight through chemical induction in the skin.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Oral administration of β-carotene also produces a beneficial effect. In the first 3 months, oral administration of 15 to 180 mg/d could improve light tolerance, without any serious side effects.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> However, hemolysis can increase the production of porphyrin and enhance light sensitivity. In that case, a splenectomy can reduce the hemolysis and, consequently, the production of porphyrin and the proliferation of bone marrow erythrocytes. In patients with symptomatic hemolytic anemia, intermittent massive erythrocyte cell transfusions may be necessary to suppress hematopoiesis and decrease the marrow production of porphyrins.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u></a></sup> In severe cases, bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been performed, which proved to be curative.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> Therapeutic approaches including gene therapy, proteasome inhibition, and pharmacologic chaperones are currently under investigation.\n\nThrough the study of this case, it is suggested that clinicians should strengthen their understanding of CEP. Knowledge of the typical clinical manifestations and laboratory findings play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of such rare diseases as CEP.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThe author is grateful to the patient and her parents for participating in the clinical care and allowing publication of this rare case report.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nXiao-ling Li collected the data of the patient, consulted AQ7 literatures, wrote the manuscript and established the diagnosis.\n\nAll authors read and approved the final manuscript.\n\n**Data curation:** Xiao-ling Li.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Xiao-ling Li.

Thirteen years before, the patient had a stage pT1N3M0 breast cancer pathologically confirmed as invasive ductal carcinoma that was treated by right modified radical mastectomy and intensity modulated radiotherapy.\n\nIn Jan 2017, left axillary lymph node enlargement was noted. The lymph node biopsy showed metastasis from the right breast cancer with estrogen receptor 3+, progesterone receptor and human epidermal-growth-factor receptor 2 negative, which was considered occult breast carcinoma. The patient received modified radical resection of left breast and intensity modulated radiotherapy for one month. Then endocrine therapy with exemestane was administered.\n\nDuring the radiotherapy, the patient developed grade 1 dysphagia (dysphagia to solids) according to a standard five-point scale.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> The endoscopic examination revealed normal esophageal mucosa. After 13 months, the patient still suffered from dysphagia which was aggravated to grade 2 with retrosternal pain in the past one month. Barium swallow presented a stricture of length 4 cm at the midthoracic esophagus . On endoscopy, a stricture was observed in the esophageal lumen at the 28<sup>th</sup> centimeter. Endoscopic biopsy showed adenocarcinoma with estrogen receptor (ER) 90% positive, progesterone receptor 20% positive, human epidermal-growth-factor receptor 2 2+, cytokeratin 7 positive, and cytokeratin 20 negative . Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization examination was negative. Blood routine and biochemistry examination was normal. Levels of CEA, CA125 and CA153 was also normal. Metastatic esophagus cancer from breast carcinoma was diagnosed based on the histopathology and the history of breast cancer. There was no family history of cancer. In addition, the lymph nodes of the right porta pulmonis and mediastinum, bilateral pulmonary and bone showed involvement on imaging. The patient received chemotherapy with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on days 1 and 8 combined with capecitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally twice daily on days 1 to 14 of 21 days for 2 cycles. After treatment, the dysphagia markedly improved to grade 1 of dysphagia from grade 2. Endoscopy was not performed after treatment to evaluate the status of the stricture. In November 2020, the patient was diagnosed with pleural effusion, bone metastasis.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nBarium swallow showed a stricture of 4 cm length at the midthoracic esophagus.</u>\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nMicroscopic finding of the esophageal metastasis.

Ayantunde et al, the median latency time interval between the diagnosis of primary breast cancer and secondary esophagogastric metastasis was 6.5 (range: 2.8–32.8).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> In our report, 10 years interval was present between the treatment of breast carcinoma and esophageal metastasis. Esophageal metastasis of breast cancer is mainly seen in patients between 50 and 70 years of age.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> The most common site of metastasis is the middle third of the esophagus.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> Dysphagia is the main complaint and non-specific upper GI symptoms includes anemia, vomiting, weight loss, and stomach-ache.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> It is difficult to confirm the diagnosis based on the symptoms because of its non-specific nature. Endoscopic examination with ultrasonography is the commonly used diagnostic aid. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is safe and effective and has high positive rate. Mediastinoscopy or open biopsy via surgery can provide definitive diagnosis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> The mechanism of breast cancer metastasis to esophagus is debatable, and can be via lymphatics, the bloodstream and direct invasion.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10–13]</u></a></sup> Esophagoscopy shows esophageal stricture which can alert the clinicians to a possible pathology.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> But radiotherapy for the breast cancer can also contribute to the stricture.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> Hence histopathologic examination is essential to differentiate a secondary from primary esophageal cancer. Also noteworthy is that the lobular infiltrating breast carcinoma has a propensity to metastasize to the digestive tract.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> In order to obtain a definitive diagnosis, immunoprofiling of the tumor cells is important. Testing for Progesterone and/or estrogen receptor protein markers would suggest metastatic breast cancer but using only these markers is not suitable because not all breast cancer cells express these hormone receptors. Furthermore, these receptor expressions may be lost in metastatic tissue because of disease progression or following prolonged hormonal therapy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup>\n\nThere are many methods for treating secondary esophageal cancer. Standard approach to relieve the symptom of dysphagia is with radiotherapy as a stand-alone treatment or combined with chemotherapy. Endoscopic dilatation of the stricture is not considered as a standard therapy due to the risk of perforation. Palliative surgical resection is one of the effective methods for achieving local control in esophageal metastasis without other severe visceral metastases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Since treatment of metastatic breast cancer is generally palliative, systemic (chemo- and/or endocrine-) therapy in combination with radiotherapy is used for esophageal metastasis of breast cancer.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> In our case, the patient had widespread disease, thus chemotherapy was selected. After treatment, the symptom of dysphagia was improved. Though a follow-up endoscopy was not performed to evaluate the status of the esophageal stricture after treatment in this case, the improvement in the severity of dysphagia indicated the effectiveness of the treatment. The prognosis depends on the local control at the metastatic sites and the degree of esophageal stenosis Patients with only a single esophageal metastasis have survived for more than 5 years after the onset of metastasis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn conclusion, esophageal metastasis from breast cancer is rare. Dysphagia after breast cancer therapy should alert the clinician to possible esophageal metastasis.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization:** Huijun Xu, Yifu He.\n\n**Data curation:** Ying Yan, Shusheng Wu.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Yang Yang, Jiayu Niu, Xiaoxiu Hu, Huimin Li.\n\n**Methodology:** Wenju Chen, Mengge Li, Huiqing Luo, Lulu Cao.\n\n**Resources:** Huijun Xu, Lihong Ke.\n\n**Writing:** Huijun Xu.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:34:08", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:34:13", "cost": 4.89}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:17", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:34:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:34:07"}

However, reports on AD due to brainstem lesions are rather rare,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4–7]</u></a></sup> and the innervation modes of the supraspinal inhibitory pathways with respect to each level of the spinal sympathetic segment and laterality remain unclear.\n\nHere, excessive sweating due to AD (AD-S) restricted to the sacral region in a patient with traumatic brainstem injury has been reported. The results of thermal sweating (TS) and AD-S might provide new insights into the pathophysiology of AD.\n\n2 Case report\n-------------\n\nA 36-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of excessive sweating of the sacral region elicited by rectal or bladder inflation. Ten months before the current admission, he suffered a traffic accident and was transported to a nearby emergency hospital. He showed spontaneous but ataxic respiration, and was in a deep coma with a decerebrated posture, conjugated deviation to the right, and mydriatic pupils with anisocoria (R < L) non-reactive to light. Brain computed tomography demonstrated severe brain edema, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and hematomas in the interhemispheric fissure and lower brainstem. Tracheostomy was performed to assist with respiration via a ventilator. Two weeks later, he regained consciousness and became capable of speaking, even though he was dysarthric. Over the following 5 months, he did not need a respirator and became alert and ambulant with ataxic gait. Urination was also possible, although self-catheterization was occasionally required. Whenever he had a desire for defecation, he felt sick and developed excessive sweat on the sacral region, which ceased after defecation. Later, he also noted that when he was jolted in a vehicle, he became sick, and his sacral region became drenched with sweat.\n\nPhysically, he was alert and showed right Horner's eye signs, right-sided palatal myoclonus, horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus, cerebellar ataxia on the right side, and slightly impaired superficial sensation on the left upper part of the body. He had no weakness in his extremities and presented with normal deep tendon reflexes and flexor plantar reflexes. The abdominal skin, anal, and cremasteric reflexes were preserved. Urination and penile erection were reported to have recovered approximately a month previously. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a high signal intensity area in the mid-pontine region and a low-signal-intensity area in the lower lateral medullary region, both on the right side . Spinal magnetic resonance imaging, including the lumbosacral segments, was normal.\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 1:\n\nA: Brain MRI images showing high-signal-intensity area in the mid-pons and a round low-signal-intensity area in the medulla, both on the right side.

D: Before the bladder distension, no sweating was observed (upper), but an apparent discoloration appeared on the sacral region within 6 minute of the bladder distension (lower). MRI = magnetic resonance imaging.</u>\n\nAfter obtaining informed consent from the patient and his family, sweat tests were performed. TS was induced by heating the patient with electric blankets in the supine position. The deep temperature on the forehead was monitored using a deep thermometer (Core-temo-CNT-204, Probe-No-ME-PD-51, Terumo-Japan). Sweating was detected qualitatively using a modified Minor's colorimetric method, and sweat rates were monitored using a capacitance hygrometer (Hydrograph-AMU-2, Kyokuto-Denshi, Nagoya).<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup>\n\nTS, tested 14 months after the accident, revealed no sweating before heating. Forty minutes after heating, sweating appeared on the face (R < L), left upper part of the chest, and on the lower extremities. After another 40 minute of heating, the whole body, with the exception of the right side of the trunk, became discolored . A TS examined on the back side on a different day yielded similar results. Discoloration of the lumbosacral territory appeared earlier than that of the trunk, with a clear demarcation at the L2/3 sensory dermatomes. TS expulsions on both forearms were synchronous, whereas sweat rates were less abundant on the right forearm than on the left forearm (c.f).\n\n删除2：<u>Figure 2:\n\nContinuous record of sweat rates.

An inset indicates the recording sites. 通用删除1(英):<u>(The figure has been retraced)</u>.</u>\n\nAD-S was investigated in relation to bladder distension in the left recumbent position at room temperature. There was no sweating before the distension. When the patient experienced bladder distension after the administration of 300 ml of saline, the indwelling tube was clamped. Within approximately 2 min, twitching of the gluteal and hamstring muscles was observed, and sweating appeared on the left side of the perianal region, followed by sweating on the right side . Rectum distension using air resulted in similar phenomena. Sweat rates were significantly higher on the left side. Sweating rapidly ceased (within 1 minute) after the release of distension on both occasions. Blood pressure and heart rate before distension were 110–116/70–72 mm Hg and 78 to 82 beats per min, respectively. They increased to 133–137/84–90 mm Hg and 92 beats per min at maximum during distension, respectively, and returned to the basal level after the release of distension. These features suggested that his sacral excessive sweating might be due to AD.\n\nOral baclofen (15 mg/d) was administered. Three weeks later, although neurological features did not change significantly, the patient testified that his excessive sweating was reduced by more than 50%, and the medication was continued for more than three months. Thereafter, he showed further convalescence without adverse events and left the hospital. Two years after the accident, cerebellar ataxia and sacral hyperhidrosis were less remarkable, and riding in a car caused slight sweating in the sacral region, albeit without nausea.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nThe present patient displayed AD-S restricted to the sacral region. His neurological features indicated that the sudomotor-related hypothalamospinal pathway was impaired, together with disruption of the connections between the brainstem and the cerebellum on the right side. Thus, the excessive sweating observed in the patient may be attributable to right-sided lesions of the lower brainstem.\n\nCases of AD and allied disorders caused by brain lesions have rarely been reported.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4–7]</u></a></sup> Finestone and Teasell<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> reported a case of episodic hypertension as an AD after brainstem tumor resection. However, excessive sweating has not yet been described. Saito et al reported a patient with left-sided lateral medullary infarction with marked dysuria.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> In this patient, TS was reduced on the left side, whereas bladder distension elicited sweating on the entire left side of the body, but not on the right side. This case suggests that the hypothalamospinal TS pathway and supraspinal inhibitory pathways to spinal preganglionic neurons may descend on the same side at the cervical level. Conversely, in the present patient, TS was impaired on the right side, whereas AD-S was observed bilaterally, being more abundant on the left side. These observations suggest that the mode of the supraspinal inhibitory sympathetic innervation of the body may differ according to the spinal segment level.\n\nFoerster<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> analyzed the relationship between spinal segment levels and their sudomotor innervation territory using electrical stimulation of sympathetic preganglionic fibers. The author concluded that the skin of the lumbosacral area may be innervated by the T12–L3 segments, albeit with great individual variations. This concept has been confirmed by subsequent studies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10,11]</u></a></sup>\n\nCentral sudomotor facilitatory fibers are ipsilateral dominant in the upper spinal segments, whereas ipsilateral dominance appears to be weak in the lower sympathetic segments.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Moreover, a somatotopic arrangement has been suggested. If a similar tendency exists in the supraspinal inhibitory projections to the lumbar sympathetic segments, unilateral brainstem lesions may produce bilateral AD-S. These pathways include monoamine pathways that are inhibitory and pass through the entire spinal cord.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12,13]</u></a></sup> Given that the principles of the central organization of sympathetic systems are similar in humans and other animals,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> the right-sided pontine and/or medullary lesions in the present patient might have caused disinhibition of sympathetic preganglionic neurons at the level of the lumbosacral segment(s), resulting in paroxysmal excessive sweating elicited by various sensory stimuli into disinhibited sympathetic segments.\n\nBaclofen has been known to inhibit preganglionic neurons,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15–17]</u></a></sup> and may be used intrathecally for the treatment of spasticity or severe autonomic dysfunction due to brain or spinal cord disorders.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18–20]</u></a></sup> Although it was administered orally in the present patient, and was seemingly favorable, single case experience is not conclusive and requires further accumulation of similar cases.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nThis may be the first report of excessive sweating localized to the sacral region caused by AD. Although it could not be determined if pontine or medullary lesion was more responsible for this abnormal sweating could not be determined, the present observations might indicate the possibility of a somatotopic arrangement even in the inhibitory supraspinal pathways to the spinal sympathetic segments.\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment\n--------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>The author would like to thank Enago  for the English language review.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------</u>\n\n通用结尾删除-1:<u>The corresponding author: Hiroshi Saito contributed and is responsible to all study process.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 13:56:21", "endTime": "2024/09/19 13:57:54", "cost": 92.447}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:17", "update_time": "2024-09-18 21:57:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 21:56:20"}

She had no medical history and was 160 cm tall and weighed 53 kg at the time of her visit. Ten years ago, she presented with a 46 × 35-mm-sized myoma compressing the endometrium, and another 24 × 18-mm sized myoma in the posterior fundus . She had severe anemia due to a large amount of menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea. Hence, the patient underwent open myomectomy after blood transfusion. Pathology results showed ULM. After marriage, Seven and five years ago, she delivered two babies by cesarean section (due to the risk of uterine rupture) at another hospital. She said there were no myoma findings at the time of the two cesarean sections. Four years earlier, a 61 × 39-mm-sized left ovarian mucinous cyst adenoma was removed laparoscopically at our hospital. At that time, two myomas measuring 18 × 16 mm and 19 × 11 mm were observed at the lower posterior segment on transvaginal ultrasound . Three years ago, the size of the myomas had increased to 28 × 22 mm and 40 × 27 mm , and one month prior, they had increased to 37 × 37 mm and 100 × 98 mm with secondary degeneration noted on ultrasound and abdomen and pelvis computed tomography . The cancer antigen (CA) 125 level was 12.5 U/mL (normal: 0–35 U/mL) four years ago, 21 U/mL three years ago, and 47 U/mL a month ago. All other laboratory values were within normal ranges. She was hospitalized and underwent a laparoscopic multiple myomectomy because she wanted to preserve her fertility. A 100-mm-sized large myoma at the uterine posterior wall was observed and removed laparoscopically . A small 37-mm-sized myoma was also removed laparoscopically . Grossly, the specimen consisted of several fragments of myomectomy specimens measuring 250 × 200 × 65 mm. Microscopically, mildly increased cellularity, marked nuclear pleomorphism, moderate to severe atypia, and two mitotic figures per ten high power field were observed, but with no coagulative necrosis. These pathological findings were indicative of ALM . The Ki-67 proliferation index was 15% . Additional immunostaining for vimentin or p16 was not performed.

The World Health Organization classification includes ULMs with bizarre nuclei in the definition of ALMs.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> ALM sometimes recurs but does not cause death of the patient.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> A previous study reported that 49% (17/35) of patients with LMS and 7% (1/14) of patients with STUMP died due to the disease, but no deaths were attributed to ALM (0/42). The mean age of ALM patient was 40.5 years and the mean tumor size was 7.6 cm. ALMs are rare in postmenopausal women.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> A 2013 study by Mills et al found that cell cycle markers such as Ki-67, phosphorylated histone H3, p16, p21, and p53 were not useful for predicting ALM recurrence.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> However, in a 2014 study by Zhang et al p53 mutations and phosphatase and tensin homolog deletions were significantly higher in patients with LMS and ALM.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> ALM shares many molecular alterations with LMS. ALM may be a precursor lesion of LMS or may have similar genetic changes during its early stages.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> However, a 2021 study by Gao et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> reported that ALM showed similar genomic instability but distinct genomic alterations with its malignant counterpart LMS. Genetic studies on benign, borderline, and malignant SMTs of uterine origin suggested a very low probability of malignant transformation of benign tumors.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Histological features of LMS include a triad of severe atypia, increased mitoses, and cell necrosis. Biomarkers that differentiate ALM from USMT has not yet been studied. Both intra-abdominal recurrence and distant metastasis to lungs have been reported, but no prospective series are available, probably due to the rarity of the diagnosis, although the actual incidence is undetermined.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> Benign metastasizing leiomyoma is a rare disease. It is considered to be benign histologically, but it occasionally metastasizes to distant sites such as the lung, heart, inferior vena cava, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and muscles.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> There is no pelvic imaging modality that can reliably diagnose uterine LMS. Although most ULMs are diagnosed by ultrasonography, this imaging technique is limited to precisely distinguish the type of solid myometrial masses. On magnetic resonance imaging, ULMs can be precisely diagnosed when manifesting as a well-delineated myometrial solid lesion with low signal intensity on both T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> Nevertheless, many ULMs can manifest atypical imaging features as heterogeneous masses because of the presence of areas of degeneration such as cystic, hyaline, myxoid, red, and calcification. The morphologic, signal intensity, and contrast enhancement patterns of these ALMs can overlap those of LMS on magnetic resonance imaging, making it more difficult to reach an accurate differential diagnosis. Moreover, there are no sensitive imaging studies that can diagnose ALM before surgery.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u></a></sup> Myomectomies are performed in symptomatic women who wish to preserve their fertility. Although pregnancy may increase the size and number of ULMs, there is no evidence that fibroids progress to atypia. Unusual-appearing uterine masses on preoperative imaging may best be treated surgically with myomectomy or hysterectomy rather than medically or with uterine fibroid embolization. It is unclear whether uterine fibroid embolization effectively treats ALM, but if the fibroid could be LMS, uterine fibroid embolization will not be effective and the fibroid will continue to grow.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> The rapid growth of fibroids has little to do with malignant transformation.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u></a></sup> If a woman does not want a hysterectomy, to avoid dissemination of the neoplasm, it would seem prudent to avoid power morcellation procedures to remove an unusual-appearing fibroid if preoperative imaging studies raise the possibility of a leiomyoma variant.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> The treatment of choice for ALM is hysterectomy. However, myomectomy may be an option for fertility-sparing cases. There is a lack of evidence concerning the relapse rate of patients with ALMs treated with myomectomy via laparoscopy. The patient in our case was again managed by myomectomy and remained alive without evidence of disease 36 months after the second myomectomy. Sung et al reported that none of the patients had developed a metastasis of atypical leiomyoma during 20 to 151 months (mean = 76.1 months) follow-up after myomectomy. However, one patient showed local recurrence at the myomectomy site 22 months after the initial myomectomy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> Factors that increase the risk of recurrence is presently not known. Patient education regarding the uncertain behavior of such tumors and a rigorous follow-up must be done due to the risk of late local recurrences. There is controversy in the literature regarding whether CA 125 is suitable as a biomarker for myomas. The tumor marker CA 125 is mostly used as a tumor marker for serous ovarian carcinoma, but elevated levels are also found in breast cancer and other malignancies, in benign gynecological diseases such as endometriosis or ovarian cysts, in early pregnancy, and in general diseases such as renal insufficiency and hepatitis. The postoperative concentration of insulin-like growth factor-1 correlated with evidence of new myomas and can be potentially used for further monitoring.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> There are no guidelines available regarding the follow-up intervals for ALM patients. ALM had no evidence of local or distant recurrence at a median follow-up time of 72 months in previous studies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Therefore, we recommend patient follow-up every three months for the first two years after surgery, every six months for the next two years, and then every year until menopause and routine follow-ups after menopause. Abdomen and pelvis computed tomography during follow-up should be considered based on the risks of radiation exposure and the possible benefits of the examination. Transvaginal ultrasound is generally used as a follow-up method because it is easy and convenient.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup> Since fibroids are very common, further genetic and molecular studies to differentiate them from ALMs are needed. Regular transvaginal ultrasonographic follow-up must be offered to patients with ALM treated with myomectomy because of the risk of late local recurrences, although it is low.\n\n删除8：<u>Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThe authors are grateful to Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital for their assistance and encouragement.\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\nAll authors read and approved the final manuscript.\n\n**Conceptualization:** Yun Sook Kim.\n\n**Data curation:** Yun Sook Kim.\n\n**Investigation:** Yun Sook Kim.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Yun Sook Kim.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:10:00", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:10:43", "cost": 42.35}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:17", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:10:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:10:00"}

Hereditary mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy is a rare genetic condition which leads to progressive degeneration of the white matter of the central nervous system.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> Reports from literature describe at least 60 gene mutations associated with this condition.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> The estimated and calculated incidence for all forms of leukodystrophy is 2/100,000 live births.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup> Clinical and radiological presentations often overlap; thus, patients undergo a long diagnostic path before receiving treatment. Here, we present a case of hereditary mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy with a mutation in both alleles of the _AARS2_ gene, which has previously not been implicated in relation to human diseases.\n\n2 Case presentation\n-------------------\n\nIn 2016, a 25-year-old male professional driver visited our family medicine office with a gait disorder he had been struggling with for the past 5 years. He noticed that he had become clumsier, and over the last 2 months, he had experienced two car accidents, and it had become difficult for him to walk. His mother said that during this period, his behavior had changed and he was quiet, introverted, and sad. She took him to a psychiatrist where he was treated with escitalopram. In the past, he was healthy and had not received any medical intervention. The family history provided no relevant information, and there was no genetic history of neurological disease. He was vaccinated according to the national program, and he denied having any allergies. His drug, alcohol, smoking history, and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative. During clinical examination, cerebellar gait ataxia was evident. We observed horizontal nystagmus, but otherwise no specificities in his neurological disorder (no findings suggestive of balance disorder, no incoordination complaints of involuntary movements), and other somatic status. At this time, no cognitive impairment was suspected; thus, no tests were performed, and basic laboratory tests were carried out. These included a complete blood count, liver enzyme and renal tests, thyroid stimulating hormone, iron and vitamin B12 levels, and serology for _Borrelia burgdorferi_, which were all within normal limits. The patient was sent to a neurologist for further diagnostic treatment. This resulted in an magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head, where a diagnosis of adrenoleukodystrophy was considered, but the results of genetic testing and a biochemical analysis of long-chain fatty acid levels were negative (mutation of the _ABCD1_ gene was excluded). At this point, there was no progression in his condition; he had no specific treatment, but he was no longer fit for work.\n\nIn 2018, the patient returned to an infirmary with his mother. She noticed that for the last 2 months, he had difficulty in speaking and could no longer retain urine. During the examination, he was not oriented in time and space, no longer recognized the staff, and responded only in a few words. We used the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition test, where he scored 4/9, which indicated cognitive impairment. Clinically, we observed postural and action tremors, bradykinesia and hypokinesia, and an increased muscle tone. We used The Modified Ashworth Scale, and evaluated his condition as stage 3 (considerable increase in muscle tone, difficult passive movement). During the Romberg test, he fell backward, showing ataxia of walking. The basic laboratory test results were within normal limits. He was referred to a neurologist for additional exploration and better management. This time, the head magnetic resonance imaging scan showed moderate cortical atrophy and extensive leukoencephalopathy, and the control genetic testing using a ACMG classifications showed that there was hereditary mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy with a point mutation in both alleles in the 199th position of the _AARS2_ gene (arginine to cysteine), which is an inherited recessive autosomal trait. The identified version c.2884C>T in the _AARS2_ gene has not previously been implicated in human diseases. The patient's parents were both tested using Sanger sequencing, which showed that he had inherited the pathological mutation of the _AARS2_ gene (c.2884C>T) from his mother.\n\nThe patient is now 30 years old and has progressive hereditary ataxia. Treatment is limited mainly to palliative care and is performed at home. He did not establish eye contact during the examination, and both his upper and lower limbs were rigid. He underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and was completely dependent on the care and assistance of another person.\n\n3 Discussion\n------------\n\nOur report described the management of a patient with a rare disease and with severe disability in young adulthood at the primary health care level. It emphasizes the importance of correct action and of differential diagnosis in patients with ataxia and cognitive decline at an early age.\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutations in mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase results in a rare leukodystrophy syndrome called _AARS2_ (also called an ovario-leukodystrophy switch) is characterized by rapid development of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric dysfunctions.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> The classic presentation of _AARS2_ leukoencephalopathy is a childhood-to-adulthood onset of neurological deterioration with features of ataxia, spasticity, and cognitive decline. Symptoms usually occur in the third or fourth decade of life, with cognitive decline and motor impairment. When the cerebellum is involved, ataxia or nystagmus appears. There are many possible causes of ataxia.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[1,2,7]</u></a></sup> While the spectrum of hereditary degenerative ataxias is expanding, special attention should be given to those with reversible etiologies. Diagnostic tests performed at the primary health care level include basic blood tests, such as measurement of vitamin B12, folate, and serology for Borrelia Burgdorferi.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u></a></sup> Most patients require referrals to neurologists in order to undergo genetic testing.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u></a></sup> Early onset ataxia is usually genetically conditioned, most often autosomal recessive or mitochondrial, even if there are no similar cases in the family history.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup> Many studies have been carried out in this field, but the genetic mutation in our patient is undocumented.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Unfortunately, no specific treatment is available. Within 5–10 years, these patients advance to the point of no or limited interaction with the environment and suffer premature death.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup>\n\nFamily medicine doctors are long-term companions to patients and are sometimes the only support for them and their families when it comes to incurable diseases.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup> Crucial in this case is the identification of symptoms, which may be very mild and non-specific. Referring to appropriate diagnostic procedures and persistence in diagnostic exploration despite the initial negative results, is an important contribution that the family medicine physician can provide in finding an appropriate diagnosis. Treatment of cognitive impairment and physical rehabilitation, supporting family members, and advising them about possible genetic testing is sometimes the only form of help family medicine doctors can provide.\n\nCurrently, the patient in this case only receives palliative care. The diagnostic path was completed, and no specific therapy was available. The parents required considerable support, as they faced feelings of guilt. The patient's 23-year-old sister is currently undergoing diagnostic treatment. Our desire is that this example may serve as a reminder that family physicians can deal with patients with rare diseases. After the diagnosis is completed, they remain in our care, which requires a team-based approach and treatment of both the patient and loved ones facing a difficult situation.\n\n4 Conclusion\n------------\n\nFamily medicine specialists must identify potentially curable forms of ataxia and take appropriate action. Ataxia in early life is rare, but it is necessary to consider it during diagnosis and refer the patient for further investigation. The example shows a 25-year-old patient with a severe and advanced neurological disease, as well as his diagnosis and treatment by a family medicine physician. Family doctors play an important role due to their long-term relationship with the patient and the comprehensive care they provide, even in cases where the disease is severe, and the prognosis is unfavorable.\n删除1：<u>Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n**Conceptualization**: Staša Vodička.\n\n**Data curation:** Staša Vodička.\n\n**Formal Analysis:** Staša Vodička.\n\n**Investigation:** Staša Vodička.\n\n**Methodology:** Staša Vodička.\n\n**Supervision:** Erika Zelko.\n\n**Validation:** Erika Zelko.\n\n**Writing – original draft:** Staša Vodička.\n\n**Writing – review & editing:** Erika Zelko.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "crsp_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/19 14:18:55", "endTime": "2024/09/19 14:20:17", "cost": 82.55}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-18 00:13:17", "update_time": "2024-09-18 22:20:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-18 22:18:54"}

The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) varies according to country, age, and sex, and increases with age due to increased life expectancy.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u></a></sup> Moreover, infections seem to play an essential role in COPD occurrence; repeated exacerbations, viral or bacterial, could also contribute to lung function decline.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u></a></sup>\n\nSince the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020, patients and primary care practitioners have canceled or postponed visits and appointments due to a shortage of healthcare resources and the risk of infection.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u></a></sup> The full impact of COVID-19 on society and the economy is not fully understood. Still, it has been estimated that the gross domestic product (GDP) will decline by about 5% for each month of partial economic shutdown, which equates to 1.07 trillion dollars in the United States of America.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u></a></sup> The COVID-19 outbreak poses a major threat to patients suffering from chronic lung conditions. Some researchers and institutions suggest that uncontrolled asthma could increase the risk of COVID-19,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[8,9]</u></a></sup> and the same applies to COPD.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u></a></sup>\n\nAsthma and COPD erode the health and well-being of patients and harm families and societies.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u></a></sup> The total cost of respiratory conditions accounts for more than €380 billion annually in Europe, which includes the costs of primary and hospital care (€55 billion), the cost of productivity loss due to sickness (€42 billion), and the monetized value of disability-adjusted life-years lost (€280 billion). Healthcare costs and lost productivity due to COPD are estimated at €48.4 billion. Those due to asthma amounted to €33.9 billion per year.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> A link between disease control (asthma<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u></a></sup> and COPD<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u></a></sup>) and costs to the National Health Service and society has been demonstrated. The treatment of chronic disease includes the long-term use of medication,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u></a></sup> which applies to asthma and COPD. The National Institute for Care and Clinical Excellence issued guidelines regarding medicine optimization, a person-centered approach to safe and effective medicine use, to ensure that people obtain the best possible outcomes from their medicines.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[15,16]</u></a></sup>\n\nNevertheless, the use of medications without support is not sufficient for patients to achieve good clinical outcomes, quality of life, and cost containment.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u></a></sup> Practitioners working in primary care are well placed to provide support for their patients, and community pharmacists are easily accessible even during the COVID-19 outbreak.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u></a></sup> An activity often undertaken by community pharmacists to help people improve their use of medication is the medicine use review, which is considered a complex intervention according to Craig et al.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u></a></sup> The evaluation of this intervention is far from easy. A recent systematic literature review, published in 2019, pointed out that an “_ideal_” method for evaluating complex interventions cannot be proposed. Instead, methods can be used according to the research questions that need to be addressed.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u></a></sup> Besides objective outcome measures (e.g. blood tests, smoking status, date of death), patient-reported outcome measures in clinical practice have the potential to enhance care for people by identifying problems and improving patient–clinician communication.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u></a></sup>\n\nOne of the earliest funded advanced pharmacy services in England was the Medicines Use Review (MUR) introduced in 2005, which up until now, showed little evidence to support either its effectiveness or cost-effectiveness.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[21,22]</u></a></sup> In 2017, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of medication review suggested that an isolated medication review has minimal effect on clinical outcomes, no impact on the quality of life, and lack evidence of economic outcomes. However, studies have shown a decrease in the number of drug-related problems and dosage, more changes in medication, and a greater decrease or smaller increase in the number of medications used.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u></a></sup> Newman et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u></a></sup> evaluated the impact of community pharmacist-led interventions in chronic disease management on clinical utilization and economic outcomes. Other positive results were identified in other reviews,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[25–27]</u></a></sup> but more robust studies are needed to assess their economic outcomes.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u></a></sup>\n\nIn 2012, the Italian Pharmacists’ Federation founded a research project called Italian Medicines Use Review (I-MUR), aiming to develop, test, and evaluate the effectiveness and cost of the first community pharmacist-led intervention using asthma as a chronic condition. The Medical Research Council framework for complex intervention informed the development of I-MUR, which was conducted in different steps: 1) a literature review, 2) development and testing, 4) feedback from the main stakeholders, 5) evaluation, and 6) further analysis.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[29–32]</u></a></sup>\n\nThe success of the I-MUR project raised the pharmacy profession's profile to a new challenge: the introduction and delivery of these services at the national level. The results of the project significantly impacted policy and practice, and the Italian government allocated funds for such services. Following this experience, SOFAD srl (the sponsor), part of the FARVIMA group, a privately owned company and its stakeholders, decided to provide funds to explore the possibility of developing a pharmacist-led intervention that can be used for asthma and COPD patients as well.\n\nA Belgian study suggested that pharmacists could improve outcomes in patients with COPD.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u></a></sup> Hesso et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[33]</u></a></sup> assessed the impact of pharmacists on COPD management, looking at inhalation technique and medication adherence; the results demonstrated that these activities were cost-effective. In India, a study evaluated the direct impact of clinical pharmacist interventions on medicine costs in patients suffering from COPD. The study was an RCT conducted for 24 months; the results showed a reduction of 30.6% in the cost of medicines.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[34]</u></a></sup> The United States is suggesting an emerging role for pharmacists in managing patients with COPD.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u></a></sup> Pharmacists’ roles are evolving, and they seem to work increasingly more often as part of multidisciplinary care teams.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[35]</u></a></sup>\n\nAsthma control is important because it improves the quality of sleep and life in general, reduces days lost at work or school, enhances productivity, reduces the use of rescue medications, and reduces the healthcare system's economic burden (e.g. the number of doctors’ appointments), and society.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[36]</u></a></sup> Likewise, COPD control improves quality of life, reduces symptoms, mental and physical dysfunction, and mortality rate.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[37,38]</u></a></sup> In this study, the primary outcome was patient-reported outcome measure. Therefore, the study protocol was designed according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT-PRO) extension <sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u></a></sup> and mapped against the SPIRIT checklist 删除6：<u>(Appendix 1)</u>. The comparator is usual care, defined as pharmacists’ safe supply of medicines and medication-taking advice to the patient.\n\n2 Objectives\n------------\n\n### 2.1 Key research questions\n\nThe key research questions of this study are:\n\nIs the pharmacist-led intervention called chronic respiratory conditions medicines use review (CRC-MUR) provided by community pharmacists in collaboration with physicians.\n\nEffective in\n\n*   a) Improving asthma or COPD control as assessed by the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) scores?\n*   b) Reducing the risk of having asthma and COPD uncontrolled?\n*   c) Optimizing the number of active ingredients used by asthma and COPD patients?\n*   d) Identifying and resolving pharmaceutical care issues?\n*   e) Improving patients’ adherence to asthma or COPD medications?\n*   f) Achieving the minimal clinically important differences (MCID) in asthma and COPD control?\n\nCost-effective for\n\n*   a) The healthcare system and society (compared to usual care) in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALY) using the EuroQol five dimensions five levels (EQ-5D-5L).\n\n### 2.2 Trial design\n\nIt is a pragmatic, parallel randomized controlled superiority trial that aims to mimic routine practice as closely as possible, except that patients will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[40]</u></a></sup> The patient follow-up period was 12 months. The study should begin in January 2022 (COVID-19 permitting).\n\n3 Methods\n---------\n\n### 3.1 Study setting\n\nThe study will be conducted in community pharmacies in southern Italy, in one region only, Sicily, which has over 5 million inhabitants.\n\n### 3.2 Eligibility criteria\n\nParticipants will be selected according to the following eligibility criteria:\n\nPharmacies must have\n\n*   a private area for private consultation with patients;\n*   and/or telephone, smartphone, tablet, or other devices allowing remote consultation with their patients if required due to COVID-19 restrictions;\n*   an internet connection;\n\nPharmacists must\n\n*   be qualified and registered with the Italian Pharmacy Board practicing in Italy;\n*   have experiences in providing advice to patients;\n*   have already provided one or more services, such as blood pressure monitoring, smoking cessation, cholesterol monitoring, signposting, and food intolerance testing (this will be verified during the recruitment process asking for a self-declaration).\n*   be able to attend the full training session(s).\n\nPharmacies must be excluded if they\n\n*   have no internet access;\n*   no consultation room or no telephone, smartphone, tablet, or other devices allowing remote consultation with their patients if required due to COVID-19 restrictions;\n*   are currently involved in any other clinical pharmacy research project.\n\nPatients\n\nPatients must:\n\n*   be at least 18 years of age;\n*   have been diagnosed with either asthma or COPD for at least six months before enrollment in the study.\n*   have prescription(s) for asthma/COPD medications with R03 as Anatomical, Therapeutic Chemical Classification code, or drugs for obstructive airway disease.\n\nPatients must be excluded if they\n\n*   have a terminal illness (defined as an advanced stage of a disease with an unfavorable prognosis and no known cure) as identified by the pharmacists through prescription coding.\n*   are currently enrolled in another clinical trial;\n*   do not self-administer their medications (e.g. inhaler);\n*   are not able to communicate well in Italian, both written and spoken.\n\nTo minimize diagnostic inaccuracy, asthma and COPD diagnosis will be reviewed in every patient at baseline, before enrollment, following the global initiative for asthma 通用删除7(英):<u>(40)</u> and global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) 通用删除7(英):<u>(41)</u> strategies.\n\n### 3.3 Intervention\n\n#### 3.3.1 Description of the intervention\n\nThe name of the pharmacist-led intervention is CRC-MUR. Community pharmacists will deliver interventions in the primary care setting. The delivery format is verbal (face-to-face or remotely using phone or video facilities). The development of the intervention was informed by its affordability (cost associated with the design and delivery), practicability (pharmacists/patients), effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, acceptability (patients/pharmacists/physicians), side effects/safety (patients), consistency, and replicability. CRC-MUR is a theoretically informed pharmacist-led intervention.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[41–44]</u></a></sup> It consists of a bespoke, systematic, structured face-to-face or remote consultation (due to COVID-19) with a patient, covering asthma/COPD symptoms, health and social care received, medicines used, attitude towards medicines, adherence to medication, recording pharmacist-identified pharmaceutical care issues. If required, pharmacists advise patients, including healthy living advice; they advise physicians on patients’ conditions using a standard template. Pharmacists will be trained to advise patients and send recommendations to their general practitioners and/or hospital consultants during the training session before the beginning of the study. The CRC-MUR intervention was mapped against the template for intervention description and replication.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[45]</u></a></sup> Following each consultation, pharmacists will be required to enter the information on a web-based platform, maintaining patient anonymity.

Participants will be invited to participate in an outcome-related assessment to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.\n\n### 3.5 Strategies for monitoring and improving protocol adherence\n\nMeasures suggested to maintain and improve adherence to the trial protocol include telephone calls, text reminders, social support provided by community pharmacists and physicians to their patients, and educating patients on the management of the disease.\n\nCommunity pharmacists will have to\n\n*   create a welcoming, non-judgmental, and accepting environment;\n*   establish an effective tracking system that will be provided by the online web platform used for data entry.\n*   educate patients about their role as research participants;\n*   establish a routine while maintaining flexibility;\n*   provide incentives for participation, such as transportation, parking spaces, home visits, and videoconferences.\n\n### 3.6 Relevant concomitant care and interventions that are permitted or prohibited during the trial\n\nPatients were hospitalized, but overall, no other intervention restriction was imposed in this study.\n\n### 3.7 Outcomes\n\n#### 3.7.1 Primary outcomes: Asthma and COPD control\n\nThe primary outcomes are asthma and COPD control at baseline and 12 months (according to the patients’ disease), assessed at 3-months intervals, using the ACT score and the CCQ score.\n\nACT score was defined by international guidelines as\n\n*   ACT≤14=not controlled;\n*   15≤ACT≤19=partially controlled;\n*   ACT≥20 controlled 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[154\\]</u>.\n\nThe MCID is defined as an increase of ≥ 3-point of the ACT score.\n\nThe CCQ was developed by van der Molen et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[46]</u></a></sup>, and it assesses COPD control according to a scale-out of ten.\n\nThe CCQ scores are defined as\n\n*   CCQ<1 = Acceptable;\n*   1≤CCQ<2 = Acceptable for moderate disease (controlled);\n*   2≤CCQ≤3 = Instable-severe limited;\n*   CCQ>3 = Very instable-very severe limited.\n\nThe MCID is defined as a reduction of ≥0.4 points of the CCQ score. Furthermore, the CCQ assesses three main domains:\n\nSymptoms = (Item 1 + 2 + 5 + 6)/4, Functional = (Item 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)/4, Mental = (Item 3 + 4)/2.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[38]</u></a></sup>\n\n#### 3.7.2 Justification for the use of ACT and CCQ\n\nThe ACT was previously used in Italy in a study conducted by the Italian Society of General Medicine (Societá Italiana di Medicina Generale) and in the I-MUR study. The International Primary Care Respiratory Group proposed creating a user's guide for primary healthcare practitioners to assess “wellness” in COPD patients in an everyday clinical setting. They ranked the CCQ as the most recommended among the eight questionnaires examined in their study.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[47]</u></a></sup> Moreover, the CCQ was used in another study by a member of our research team.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[48]</u></a></sup>\n\n#### 3.7.3 Secondary outcomes\n\n*   1\\. Reduction of the risk of having asthma and COPD uncontrolled, assessed using the ACT and CCQ scores assessed at baseline and 3-month intervals, as reported by patients.\n*   2\\. The number of active ingredients used by patients at baseline and 12 months assessed at 3-month intervals, as reported by patients.\n*   3\\. Patients’ self-reported adherence to asthma/COPD medications at baseline and 12 months assessed at 3-month intervals using the questions used in the I-MUR study.\n*   4\\. Pharmaceutical care issues at baseline and 12 months assessed at 3-month intervals using the questions used in the I-MUR study.\n*   5\\. The MCID in ACT and CCQ scores at baseline and 12 months assessed at 3-month intervals, as reported by the patients.\n*   6\\. Cost-effectiveness of CRC-MUR asthma/COPD service compared with usual care, measured in terms of cost per QALY as a measure of disease burden, including both the quality and the quantity of life gained, at the 12-month follow-up.\n\n#### 3.7.4 EQ-5D-5L\n\nThe EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be used to measure health-related quality of life at baseline and at each subsequent 3-month data collection time point. The EQ-5D-5L was selected for use in calculating QALYs using Italian utility tariffs. It is more “sensitive” than the 3-level version, including dimensions of anxiety and depression and daily activities that may have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual patient data on visits to the GP and outpatient departments, attendance to the Accidents and Emergency department, hospital admissions, and medication will be retrieved from electronic patient records for the 12-month follow-up. The Italian unit costs of these services are used to monetize resource use into costs. Trial management will provide intervention costs allocated to each patient in the intervention arm using a top-down costing approach.\n\n### 3.8 Participant timeline\n\nPharmacists will encounter their patients at baseline (T0) and every three months. Table 1 was designed according to the SPIRIT 2013;<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[49]</u></a></sup> summarizes the enrollment, intervention, and assessment schedule.\n\n### 3.9 Sample size\n\nThe power calculation was conducted using the z-test family, calculating the proportion of the difference between two independent groups with two tails using the dichotomized scores of ACT and CCQ: controlled (ACT≥20; CCQ<2) versus non-controlled (ACT<20; CCQ≥2). A 2:1 randomization and sample size of 887 patients (591 in the IG and 296 in the control group \\[CG\\]) will be enough to detect a difference of 15% between the intervention and control groups using a dichotomized score (controlled vs. non-controlled) of the ACT/CCQ, a 99% power and 5% significance level. The 15% difference represents the difference between the percentage of controlled (65%) and non-controlled (50%) patients at the end of the study. The power calculation was conducted using G∗Power version 3.1.9.4; the results were assessed and confirmed by a senior statistician working at the UCLan's Clinical Trial Unit.\n\n#### 3.9.1 Recruitment\n\nWe decided to round up the number for simplicity; therefore, we aim to recruit 100 pharmacists and 900 consecutive patients (asthma = 450; COPD = 450). Our recruitment strategy will focus on increasing potential participants’ awareness of the health problem being studied, its potential impact on their health, and engagement in the learning process.\n\n#### 3.9.2 Pharmacist patient ratio\n\nThe pharmacist-patient ratio was 1:9, meaning that each pharmacist will recruit and follow-up nine patients.\n\n### 3.10 Randomization, sequence generation, allocation and blinding\n\n#### 3.10.1 Randomization\n\nAn academic from the UCLan expert in the use of statistics will oversee the randomization process. The randomization procedure was simplified as follows. Thus, the 2:1 allocation was rounded up to 600 in the intervention group (instead of 591) and 300 in the control group (instead of 296) . The 2:1 randomization was requested by the lead clinician, who reviewed the results of the I-MUR study and did not want to prevent patients from getting the potential benefits from the intervention.\n\n#### 3.10.2 Unit of randomization and intervention\n\nThe patient is the unit of randomization and intervention.\n\n#### 3.10.3 Block size\n\nThe choice of using the block equal to nine will be adopted because large blocks reduce predictability but will not restrict randomization as closely as small blocks.\n\n#### 3.10.4 Sequence generation\n\nSequence generation will be conducted using block permutation without stratification, followed by randomization, owing to the expected large sample size (n = 900), as suggested by the senior statistician of the Lancashire Clinical Trial Unit (LCTU). The procedure will be performed by a member of the research team at UCLan using the sealed envelope online system.\n\n#### 3.10.5 Allocation concealment\n\nAllocation concealment will be performed by a member of the research team using the sealed-envelope online system, which generates an allocation schedule. In this study, two lists will be produced. The first list will be given to the pharmacist before patient recruitment, where a unique three-digit code (e.g. relative risk 3, TS7, VS5) will be assigned to each participant. A second list will be released at the end of the recruitment process and will allocate each three-digit code (participant) to either IG or CG. This approach will be adopted because it will not be possible to produce 900 sealed envelopes and circulate them on the starting date (before baseline) while maintaining the cost within the allocated budget.\n\n#### 3.10.6 Blinding\n\nIn our study, blinding will not be possible either at the pharmacist or patient level because the nature of the intervention requires their full knowledge. However, the chief investigator (CI), as an assessor of the main outcome measures, asthma and COPD control, will remain blind. As group allocation is intrinsic to the data gathered for each patient, to maintain blindness, the CI will access the data only after all patients have been followed up at three months . Friedman et al<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[50]</u></a></sup> suggested that an unblinded trial might not be simple, but it more accurately reflects clinical practice.\n\n### 3.11 Data collection\n\nData will be collected by the pharmacists at baseline and 3-month intervals using a bespoke web platform (FarmPro) already in use in many pharmacies in Sicily following the procedure illustrated in Table 1 and Figure 1. All questionnaires will be available in two languages: Italian and English. The CI is proficient in both languages and has translated the CRC-MUR from English to Italian. Another member of the research team, proficient in both languages, has back-translated CRC-MUR into English, and the two English versions were compared to avoid discrepancies. ACT, CCQ, and EQ-5D-5L are also available in English and Italian. A small test will be conducted during the summer of 2020 to verify that the platform will respond to all requirements. The platform will allow the use of different digital devices, such as personal computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The platform also complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) procedure. Primary and secondary outcomes were collected according to the timeline of the study. The length of the patient consultation was expected to be between 30 and 45 minutes. A small number (subgroup) of COPD patients (n = 45), 30 in the IG and 15 in the CG, will have their vital signs monitored using a wearable device named Health REmote MOnitoring System (HEREMOS). The vital signs monitored will be heart rate, respiratory rate, and saturation of peripheral oxygen. Additionally, body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate variability, step count, and pain may be included. Furthermore, we will capture pollen concentration, air pollution 通用删除7(英):<u>(108)</u>, particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter, and sulfur dioxide. Monitoring will mostly take place at the patients’ home premises and during patient consultation when necessary.\n\n### 3.12 Data management\n\nData will be managed following the procedure used in a previous study.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u></a></sup> Input data will be saved and stored on a password-protected system. Only individuals authorized by the CI will be allowed to access the data. Paper data, such as pharmacists’ informed consent, will be kept in a locked cabinet by the research team. Patients’ informed consent will be kept in a locked cabinet by the pharmacists.\n\n### 3.13 Statistical methods\n\nThe primary analysis will be the intention-to-treat, including all randomized participants in the group where they were randomly assigned, regardless of their adherence to the protocol or their withdrawal.\n\nMissing data: The previous experience of the CI suggests that data will be missing at random (MAR); therefore, multiple imputations will be applied.\n\nEach variable will be analyzed using the Shapiro-Wills and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to check for normality.\n\nPrimary outcomes: The primary outcome measures will be dichotomized, controlled (ACT≥20; CCQ<2) and not controlled (ACT<20; CCQ≥2) and analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) at 12 months. The GEE model will be used to calculate the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) without adjustment. It will then be adjusted using the ACT/CCQ values obtained at baseline, sex, and age. The relative risk, relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction, and number needed to treat will be calculated. The proportion of controlled and non-controlled patients will be presented using descriptive statistics at each time point.\n\nSecondary outcomes: Survival analysis will be conducted using the Kaplan-Meier curve, with the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) option, aiming to estimate the survival curve, using the ACT/CCQ control as the event of interest. The risk of uncontrolled disease will be estimated using Cox regression. The mean/median number of active ingredients and PCI will be assessed at each time point using either the unpaired Student _t_\\-test or Mann Whitney _U_ test; GEE at 12 months. Adherence to medications and MCID will be assessed, dichotomizing the variable (adherent and non-adherent; MCID yes or no); the analysis will be conducted using Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact test at each time point and GEEs at 12 months.\n\nAn economic evaluation will be undertaken to assess the cost-effectiveness of CRC-MUR at 12 months. Cost effectiveness will be expressed in terms of incremental cost per QALY gained. Bootstrapping will be performed to address uncertainty in the estimates. Uncertainty will be displayed in cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.\n\nMethod for additional analysis: A small cohort of COPD patients (30 in the IG and 15 in the CG) will have their vital parameters monitored through the smart sensors of the HEREMOS platform. The data collected: Saturation of Peripheral Oxygen, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate variability, step count, and pain will be analyzed with the help of machine learning technology. Additionally, the patients’ data collected through the study questionnaires will be included in the analysis. Different classification techniques, such as support vector machines and random forests, will be considered to evaluate the level of disease control.\n\nStatistical significance was set at P <0.05. In addition, the effect size between the two groups and the 95% confidence interval will be reported (when appropriate). Data analysis will be performed using the SPSS 27 (IBM).\n\n### 3.14 Data monitoring\n\nThis trial was designed to minimize the risk, as demonstrated in a previous trial.<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u></a></sup> Therefore, no formal committee has been organized, and no interim analysis of the impact of the intervention has been planned. The coordinating center for the study in Italy is the Catania Policlinico (Hospital), supported by UCLan.\n\n### 3.15 Risk and safety issues\n\nDuring this study, there will be no risks for the patients. Patients receiving the CRC-MUR service will be at no greater risk than those receiving usual care. Pharmacists will not dispense or administer any medications based on the ACT, CCQ, EQ-5D-5L scores, or CRC-MUR results. Pharmacists will not be involved in the interpretation of diagnostic tests or their results.\n\n### 3.16 Harm\n\nWe do not expect adverse events or other unintended effects. All information regarding the trial will be included in the pharmacists’ and patient information sheets. Patients using the remote monitoring system HEREMOS will not be exposed to any harm. The HEREMOS sensor system is intended for the sole purpose of monitoring vital signs. This system is not intended for use in cardiac pacemakers. In addition, the system is not intended for use during an MRI scan or when using an internal or external defibrillator. Strong electromagnetic fields can damage the system and make it dangerous.\n\n### 3.17 Auditing\n\nNo audit has been planned at this time.\n\n4 Research and dissemination\n----------------------------\n\n### 4.1 Research ethics approval\n\nEthics approval was obtained from the Catania Ethics Committee (Italy) (ref. 47/2021/PO; February 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2021), and the University of Central Lancashire (UK) (ref HEALTH 0163; March 29<sup>th</sup>, 2021).\n\n### 4.2 Protocol amendments\n\nWe are not expecting to make any changes to the eligibility criteria, outcomes, and analyses during our study.\n\n### 4.3 Consent, invitation and confidentiality\n\nAll documentation related to information and consent for pharmacists and patients has been enclosed in the protocol and approved by the ethics committees in Italy and the UK. The procedures followed for consent and confidentiality are described in the following paragraphs.\n\n#### 4.3.1 Informed consent\n\nThe chief investigator (CI; AM) obtained consent from the participating pharmacists.\n\nParticipating pharmacists will recruit their patients and obtain consent from them.\n\n#### 4.3.2 Who will write to the pharmacists?\n\nAn invitation letter and a summary of the study will be prepared by the CI and sent to SOFAD and Federfarma Sicilia, which will distribute the letter with information regarding the study to all community pharmacists in all the identified locations inviting pharmacists to participate in the study.\n\n#### 4.3.3 How will pharmacists consent?\n\nPharmacists who express interest in participating will be invited to attend presentations. At presentation, which will take place between January and February 2022 (COVID permitting), the CI will outline the study protocol and enrollment criteria. Participants received a detailed participant information sheet. The president of SOFAD and Federfarma Sicilia will collate the names of pharmacists who will express interest over the next few weeks. The first 100 pharmacists who met the inclusion criteria will be selected for inclusion in the study.\n\n#### 4.3.4 Patients’ recruitment and informed consent\n\nAfter assessing patients’ eligibility for the study, pharmacists will provide an information letter and consent form to each patient, who will get a week to consider their participation. The pharmacist will retain all signed consent forms in the pharmacy in a locked cabinet.\n\n#### 4.3.5 Confidentiality\n\nWritten informed consent will be obtained from all participants included in the study. All data will be handled following the requirements of the Data Protection Act 通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u> and/or the GDPR 2016, according to European Union law. Therefore, the data will be anonymized and stripped of any identifiable reference to the participants.\n\n#### 4.3.6 Declaration of interest\n\nNone\n\n#### 4.3.7 Dissemination policy\n\nThe dissemination of the study will begin immediately after the publication of the protocol. Then, it will continue throughout the study using social media posts, patient events, the third sector, and public engagement events. The results of this trial will be presented at national and international conferences. They will be submitted as scientific manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals, and subsequently published in non-peer-reviewed publications in Italian and maybe other languages. The trial results aim to inform policymakers, the Italian Ministry of Health, the Italian National Health Services, and all other stakeholders that might benefit from the results. The results will be disseminated to service users and their families via media, healthcare professionals via professional training and meetings, and to researchers via conferences and publications.\n\n#### 4.3.8 Ancillary and post-trial care\n\nWe are not envisaging the need for the provision of post-trial care. Nevertheless, all participants will be provided with an emergency contact number to reach the study investigators so that they can receive the necessary support when they have any questions or problems.\n\n#### 4.3.9 Plans, if any, for granting public access to the full protocol, participant-level data set, and statistical code\n\nThe research team aims to publish the research protocol before starting the trial in a gold open-access journal. Therefore, everyone will have free access to trial protocols. Once the study is completed and the main paper submitted for publication, the data set will be available at the University of Central Lancashire's repository, and all data will be anonymized in line with GDPR requirements.\n\n5 Patient and public involvement\n--------------------------------\n\nThe research team developed a protocol during the COVID-19 outbreak (February-July 2020). Hence, it was not possible to organize meetings with patients to obtain their views and opinions. Therefore, the research team contacted Active Citizenship (Cittadinanza Attiva), an Italian national body looking after patients’ health and safety. They assessed the research protocol considering its clarity and patients’ overall burden during the study, providing positive feedback, and praising the initiative.\n\n6 Discussion\n------------\n\nMany studies conducted in community-pharmacy settings have assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pharmacist-led interventions. However, there is a lack of consistency in the intervention designs and assessments. In Italy, the only study that used a randomized controlled trial design to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist-led intervention in a chronic condition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Italy, aiming to assess pharmacists’ contribution to improving disease control in two very common chronic lung conditions: asthma and COPD. It is one of the largest studies conducted in one region, and it introduces a new systematic and quantitative bespoke research instrument, CRC-MUR. In Italy, it appears to be the first RCT protocol drafted according to the SPIRIT-PRO extension guidelines,<sup><a>通用删除6(英):<u>[39]</u></a></sup> assessing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist-led intervention delivered by community pharmacists during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. The effect of COVID will be long-lasting and will impact the healthcare system and the availability of patients’ appointments with their general practitioners (GPs). Thus, this intervention aims to reduce GPs’ workloads, allowing them to concentrate on more serious conditions, such as cancer. Furthermore, this study will test the intervention and evaluate a model that can be adapted to other chronic conditions if successful.\n\nThe study included only adults and patients who will be followed up for 12 months. Given the study's size, we anticipate that problems may arise, for example, due to COVID-19, with the pharmacist and patient recruitment, resulting in the loss of power. However, we considered this in our power calculation by evaluating two possible options based on the actual results of our previous studies. A potential/expected drop-out rate has already been factored into the power calculation. Assuming that we aim to recruit 900 consecutive patients, we expect a dropout rate of 25% (n = 225 patients) in an unlikely scenario. The number of participants will then be reduced to 675, but the study will still retain 96% of the power. In the worst-case scenario, if the number of participants dropped to 413, the study retained 90% of the power.\n\n7 Conclusions\n-------------\n\nThis is the first study conducted in Italy to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist-led intervention in asthma and COPD patients at the same time. The potential benefits of this study are multifold. Thus, the intervention could 1) improve patients’ quality of life, 2) reduce the cost to the national healthcare service and society, 3) upskill community pharmacists, 4) introduce a new remuneration scheme for such services, 4) contribute to better integration of community pharmacies in the primary healthcare team, and 5) free up physicians’ time to allow them to concentrate on other difficult conditions. This research could introduce a new model of care that can be adapted to other chronic conditions in primary care settings.\n\n删除3：<u>8 Protocol version\n------------------\n\nThe study protocol version was 1.1.1; 30.09.2020.
