It may consist of short ground hair, long guard hair, and, in some cases, medium awn hair.\nMammals with reduced amounts of fur are often called \"naked\", as in The Naked Ape, naked mole rat, and naked dogs. An animal with commercially valuable fur is known within the fur industry as a furbearer,\nThe acquisition and use of fur is controversial. Animal welfare advocates object to the trapping and killing of wildlife, and the confinement and killing of animals on fur farms. More than 40 million animals are killed worldwide each year for their fur, 30 million of them on fur farms.\n\n【1】 # Nature of fur\nFur usually consists of two main layers:\n- Ground hair or underfur — the bottom layer consisting of wool hairs which tend to be shorter, flattened, curly, and denser than the top layer.\n- Guard hair — the top layer consisting of longer straight shafts of hair that stick out through the underfur. This is usually the visible layer for most mammals and contains most of the pigmentation.\n\n【2】 # Use in clothing\nIn clothing, fur is basically leather with the hair retained for its insulating properties. Such has long served as a source of clothing for humans, especially in colder climates. Modern cultures continue to wear natural fiber fur and fur trim and for many, such natural fibers are preferred alternatives to synthetic clothing from petrochemicals.\nAnimal furs used in garments and trim may be dyed bright colors or to mimic exotic animal patterns, or shorn down to imitate the feel of a soft velvet fabric. The term \"a fur\" is often used to \nCommon animal sources for fur clothing and fur trimmed accessories include fox, rabbit, mink, beavers, ermine, otters, sable, seals, cats, dogs, coyotes, and chinchilla. The import and sale of seal products was banned in the US in 1972 over conservation concerns about Canadian seals. While there is no market in the US for products produced by incorporating utilization into feral animal control programs, the import, export and sales of domesticated cat and dog fur was banned in the U.S. under the Dog and Cat Protection Act of 2000.\nThe manufacturing of fur clothing involves obtaining animal pelts where the hair is left on the animal's processed skin. In contrast, leather made from involves removing the hair from the hide or pelt and using only the leather. The use of wool involves shearing the animal's hair from the living animal, so that the wool can be regrown but sheepskin shearling is a fur made by retaining the fleece to the leather and shearing it. Shearling is used for boots, jackets and coats and is probably the most common fur worn.\nFur is also used to make felt. A common felt is made from beaver hair and is used in high-end cowboy hats.\nFake fur or \"faux fur\" designates any synthetic material that mimics the appearance and feel of real fur, without the use of animal products. It is not renewable or biodegradable, and there are mounting concerns about its ecological footprint.

Two segments of the vertebral column, namely cervical and lumbar, are normally lordotic, that is, they are set in a curve that has its convexity anteriorly (the front) and concavity posteriorly (behind), in the context of human anatomy. When referring to the anatomy of other mammals, the direction of the curve is termed ventral.  Curvature in the opposite direction, that is, apex posteriorly (humans) or dorsally (mammals) is termed kyphosis.\nLordotic curvatures of the vertebral column, also known as secondary curvatures are caused mainly because of the difference of thickness between the anterior and posterior part of the intervertebral disc. Those curvatures start to appear during the fetal period, but don't become evident until infancy.\nExcessive lordotic curvature is also called hollow back, saddle back, and swayback. Common causes of excessive lordosis including tight low back muscles, excessive visceral fat, and pregnancy.  Loss of lordosis is sometimes seen with painful spinal conditions. If rigid, usually after spinal fusion surgery, it is known as flat-back.\nThe familiar concave shape of the horse's back is, by extension, described as lordotic.\nLordosis behavior refers to the position that some mammals (cats, mice, rats, etc.) display when they are ready to mate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

They lack a ring, and have an Amanita-like volva at the stem base.  Some species of Amanita look similar, but Amanita has white spores and often have a ring.  Since the gills of young Volvariella  are white at first, they are more easily mistaken for Amanita.\nMany sources list Volvariella as a member of the Pluteaceae family, but recent DNA studies have revealed that Pluteus and Volvareilla evolved separately and have very different DNA.  These studies show that Volvariella is very closely related to \"schizophylloid\" mushrooms like Schizophyllum commune.  \nSome species of Volvariella are popular edibles in Europe, accounting for 16% of total production of cultivated mushrooms in the world.\nVolvariella volvacea, well known as the \"paddy straw mushroom,\" is cultured in rice straw in the Philippines and Southeast Asia.  This species also favours wood chip piles. Unfortunately, it is easy to mistake the death cap mushroom (Amanita phalloides), as well as some other Amanita species, for this edible species due to similarities in appearance. This mistake is the leading cause of lethal mushroom poisoning in the United States. Volvariella and Amanita cannot be distinguished in the early \"button stage\", that, for many, is  considered the best stage to collect Volvariella for consumption. Like Amanita, the paddy straw mushroom has a volva, or universal veil, so called because it is a membrane that encapsulates the entire mushroom when it is young. This structure breaks apart as the mushroom expands, leaving parts that can be found at the base of the stalk as a cup-like structure.\n\n【1】 # List of Species\n- File:Unknown toxicity icon.pngVolvariella bombycina\n- File:Edible toxicity icon.pngVolvariella gloiocephala\n- File:Choice toxicity icon.pngVolvariella volvacea", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

A previously unknown coronavirus was isolated from the sputum of a 60-year-old man who presented with acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure with a fatal outcome in Saudi Arabia. A novel coronavirus (human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012) has caused a handful of infections in three countries in the Middle East. Although it does not seem to be transmitted between humans, it can cause severe disease and death, and scientists are watching closely for new cases.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\nThe virus first emerged in the Middle East, and was discovered on September 2012 in a Qatari patient who had recently traveled to Saudi Arabia. Virologist Ron Fouchier has speculated that the virus might originate from bats.\n\n【3】 # Causes\nNovel human coronavirus is a ssRNA positive-strand viruses with no DNA stage. It belongs to order Nidovirales and family Coronaviridae.\n\n【4】 # Differentiating Novel Human Coronavirus Infection from other Diseases\nWHO recognizes that the emergence of a new coronavirus capable of causing severe disease raises concerns because of experience with SARS.

In 1976, mammography became officially recommended by the American cancer society for screening breast cancer. Breast cancer may be classified according to anatomy into 4 subtypes: ductal, lobular, sarcoma, and lymphoma. Genes involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer include  BRCA1, BRCA2 and p53. On microscopic histopathological analysis, minimal tubule formation marked pleomorphism, and numerous mitotic figures are characteristic findings of breast cancer. Breast cancer must be differentiated from other diseases that cause mass in the breast such as fibroadenoma, fibrocystic disease of the breast, mastitis, galactocele, traumatic fat necrosis, intraductal papilloma, and lipoma. The prevalence of breast cancer is approximately 124.8 per 100,000 women per year. The number of deaths was 21.9 per 100,000 women per year, based on 2010-2012 data. Common risk factors in the development of breast cancer are family history, dense breast, obesity, radiation therapy, older age at first birth or never having given birth, hormone replacement therapy, and alcohol. Symptoms of breast cancer include a lump in the breast, discharge from the nipple, and thickening of the skin. A breast biopsy may be helpful in the diagnosis of breast cancer. Breast cancer chemotherapy refers to the use of cytotoxic drugs (chemotherapy) in the treatment of breast cancer. The aim of chemotherapy is to prevent the growth of micrometastatic disease that is responsible for systemic disease recurrence. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for breast cancer.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\nBreast cancer was first described in Egyptian literature. In 1976, mammography became officially recommended by the American cancer society for screening the breast cancer.\n\n【3】 # Classification\nBreast cancer may be classified according to anatomy into 4 subtypes: ductal, lobular, sarcoma, and lymphoma. There are also other methods of classification such as classification based on gene expression, and classification based on hormone receptors present. In practice, a combination of all above-mentioned classification is combined with the surgical characteristics of tumors and radiologic findings is being applied for patient management, treatment planning, and prognosis determination.\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\nGenes involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer include BRCA1, BRCA2 and p53. On microscopic histopathological analysis, minimal tubule formation, marked pleomorphism, and numerous mitotic figures are characteristic findings of breast cancer.\n\n【5】 # Causes\nThe cause of breast cancer is not yet known exactly, though many risk factors can increase the chance of developing breast cancer.\n\n【6】 # Differentiating Epithelioid sarcoma from other Diseases\nBreast cancer must be differentiated from other diseases such as malignancy, cysts, inflammation and non-inflammatory solid lumps. Breast symptoms such as nipple discharge and mastalgia require assessment as well. Differentiating breast cancer different types of breast lumps are based on imaging findings and breast clinical exam results.\n\n【7】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe prevalence of breast cancer is approximately 124.8 per 100,000 women per year. The number of deaths was 21.9 per 100,000 women per year, based on 2010-2012 data. About 1 out of 8 women in United states will develop invasive breast cancer. Annually (i . e in 2019) around 268,600 and 62,930 new cases of invasive and non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed respectively. In men, life time likelihood of developing breast cancer is about 1 in 883. Annually 2,670 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in males. Breast cancer increasing pattern of incidence rates began decreasing after year 2000 in US.\n\n【8】 # Risk Factors\nCommon risk factors in the development of breast cancer are family history, dense breast, obesity, radiation therapy, older age at first birth or never having given birth, hormone replacement therapy, and alcohol.\n\n【9】 # Screening\nAccording to the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), screening for breast cancer by a mammogram is recommended for women aged 50-74 years, twice a year.\n\n【10】 # Natural history, Complications and Prognosis\nIf left untreated, 22% of patients with breast cancer may regress. Common complications of breast cancer include metastasis. Prognosis is generally good with treatment.\nBreast cancer used to be staged according to the TNM system. Recently, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual (8th edition, last updated 1/25/2018) extensively revised their staging system. The 8th edition of the AJCC TNM breast cancer staging system delivers a flexible platform for prognostic classification based on traditional anatomic factors, which may be modified and enhanced with respect to patient biomarkers and other prognostic panel data. Nevertheless, in order to maintain worldwide value, AJCC tumor staging system remained based on classic TNM anatomic factors. Prognosis is closely linked to results of staging, and staging is also used to allocate patients to treatments both in clinical trials and clinical practice.\n\n【11】 # Diagnostic study of choice\nBiopsy is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Meanwhile, the diagnostic study of choice for breast cancer screening is mammography. Magnetic resonance imaging  is also recommended in selected patients. Compared to the Mammography, MRIhas higher sensitivity and lower specificity.\n\n【12】 # Biopsy\nBreast biopsy the only definite way to diagnose breast cancer. Hence, every patient with a suspicious lesion in her/his breast needs a biopsy to evaluate the nature of the mass precisely. Nevertheless, a large number of biopsy samples taken from breast lumps are found to be benign.\n\n【13】 # History and Symptoms\nSymptoms of breast cancer include a lump in the breast, discharge from the nipple, and thickening of the skin.\n\n【14】 # Physical Examination\nPatients with breast cancer usually are generally well appearing. Physical examination of patients with breast cancer is usually remarkable for a lump in the breast, peau d'orange, an inverted nipple.\n\n【15】 # Laboratory Findings\nLaboratory studies play a crucial role in prevention, diagnosis, staging, treatment planning, management, determining prognosis and follow up of patients with breast cancer. Among them are single gene studies (i. e. BRCA1, BRCA2, and HER2), multiple gene panels (i.e. Oncotype DX), tumor markers (Ki67), and metastatic markers such as serum alkaline phosphatase as a marker of bone metastasis. A variety of other blood chemistry tests are also used in the management process of patients with breast cancer, among them are liver function tests ,alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST. bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) and markers of kidney function (BUN, creatinine).\n\n【16】 # Electrocardiogram\nThere are no ECG findings associated with breast cancer\n\n【17】 # X Ray\nThere are no x-ray findings associated with breast cancer. However, an x-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of complications of breast cancer, which include:\n- Bone and lung metastasis.\n- Nevertheless, more accurate and sensitive imaging techniques are available and are widely used, among them are CT scan, MRI, PET scan, PET- CT scan.\n\n【18】 # CT scan\nThere are no CT scan findings associated with breast cancer. However, a CT scan may be helpful in staging and the diagnosis of complications of breast cancer, which include brain, bone, liver, lung, and peritoneal metastasis. A combination of CT scan with other imaging techniques such as PET scan increases its\n\n【19】 # MRI\nAlthough a number of breast MRI indications remained controversial, breast MRI has been recommended for a variety of conditions such as studying a probable occult primary breast cancers, evaluation of disease extension, watching up the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, studying disease recurrence, as an adjuvant method to clarify inconclusive clinical or imaging findings, and as the recommended method of screening for high-risk patients another indication of breast MRI is assessment of silicone implant integrity\n\n【20】 # Ultrasound\nBreast ultrasound may be helpful in the diagnosis of breast cancer, especially, to further evaluate an abnormal mammogram and to distinguish between solid and cystic lesions. Ultrasonography is the first-line imaging method in pregnant women and women less than 30 years old with focal breast sign and symptoms. AlthoughUltrasonography might be used as an adjunct to mammography in women with increased breast density, it has not been shown to decrease mortality from breast cancer. Nevertheless, using ultrasound may increase the risk for false-positive findings, unnecessary breast biopsy, and follow-up imaging.\nIt has been shown that heart failure is prevalent in women being treated with this novel treatment. As a potentially serious side effect of this novel treatment, serial Echocardiography is recommended in all patients treated with trastuzumab.\n\n【21】 # Other Imaging Studies\nOther diagnostic studies for breast cancer include modified MRI utilitie.high-field strength MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and diffusion weighted imaging, breast-specific gamma imaging, positron emissionmammography, scintimammography, thermography and bone scan.\n\n【22】 # Mammography\nMammography has been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer. No other imaging technique has been shown to reduce risk. In some countries, routine (annual to five-yearly) mammography of older women is encouraged as a screening method to diagnose early breast cancer.\n\n【23】 # Other Diagnostic Studies\nOther diagnostic studies for breast cancer is hormone receptor testing.\n\n【24】 # Medical Therapy\nBreast cancer chemotherapy is a combination of cytotoxic drugs (chemotherapy), hormonal therapy, hormonal receptor modulators, aromatase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors\n\n【25】 # Surgery\nSurgery is the mainstay of treatment for breast cancer.\n\n【26】 # Bone Metastasis\nBone is the most common site of breast cancer distant spread. Bone metastases due to the breast cancer cause major morbidity, decrease survival and reduce the quality of life of many patients. Rather than systemic chemotherapy, bisphosphonates like Pamidronate, Alendronate, Ibandronate, Risedronate, and Zoledronic aci. RANKL-RANK inhibitors like Denosumab, also has been recommended and studied for the treatment of bone metastasesAdditionally, External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) has been, and continues to be, the mainstay for the treatment of painful, uncomplicated bone metastases.\n\n【27】 # Primary Prevention\nAvoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.\n\n【28】 # Future or Investigational Therapies\nMedical investigational therapies are a wide range of new generations of targeted therapy, cancer vaccines, oncolytic virotherapy, gene therapy, and immunotherapy.

As it is normal for skin cells to die and flake off, a small amount of flaking is normal and in fact quite common.  Some people, however, either chronically or as a result of certain triggers, experience an unusually large amount of flaking, which can also be accompanied by redness and irritation. Most cases of dandruff can be easily treated with specialized shampoos. Dandruff is not an organism like lice; it is just dead skin that accumulates in the scalp. Dandruff is unlikely to be the cause of hair loss.\nExcessive flaking can also be a symptom of seborrhoeic dermatitis, psoriasis, fungal infection or excoriation associated with infestation of head lice.\nDandruff is a global phenomenon and many people find that dandruff can cause social or self-esteem problems. Treatment may be important purely for psychological reasons.\n\n【1】 # Causes\nAs the epidermal layer continually replaces itself, cells are pushed outward where they eventually die and flake off.  In most people, these flakes of skin are too small to be visible.  However, certain conditions cause cell turnover to be unusually rapid, especially in the scalp. For people with dandruff, skin cells may mature and be shed in 2 - 7 days, as opposed to around a month in people without dandruff.  The result is that dead skin cells are shed in large, oily clumps, which appear as white or grayish patches on the scalp skin and clothes.\nDandruff has been shown to be the result of three required factors:\n- Skin oil commonly referred to as sebum or sebaceous secretions\n- The metabolic by-products of skin micro-organisms (most specifically Malassezia yeasts)\n- Individual susceptibility\nCommon older literature cites the fungus Malassezia furfur (previously known as Pityrosporum ovale) as the cause of dandruff.  While this fungus is found naturally on the skin surface of both healthy people and those with dandruff, it has recently been shown that a scalp specific fungus,  Malassezia globosa, is the responsible agent.  This fungus metabolizes triglycerides present in sebum by the expression of lipase, resulting in a lipid byproduct oleic acid (OA). Penetration by OA of the top layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, results in an inflammatory response in susceptible persons which disturbs homeostasis and results in erratic cleavage of stratum corneum cells.\nRarely, dandruff can be a manifestation of an allergic reaction to chemicals in hair gels/sprays, hair oils, or sometimes even dandruff medications like ketoconazole.\nThere is no convincing evidence that food (such as sugar or yeast), excessive perspiration, or climate have any role in the pathogenesis of dandruff.\n\n【2】 # Seborrheic dermatitis\nFlaking is a symptom of seborrheic dermatitis. Joseph Bark notes that \"Redness and itching is actually seborrheic dermatitis, and it frequently occurs around the folds of the nose and the eyebrow areas, not just the scalp.\"  Dry, thick, well-defined lesions consisting of large, silvery scales may be traced to the less common psoriasis of the scalp.\nSeasonal changes, stress, and immuno-suppression seem to affect seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n【3】 # Treatment\nThere have been many strategies for the control of dandruff.  Simply increasing shampooing will remove flakes. However, elimination of the fungus results in dramatic improvement. Regular shampooing with an anti-fungal product can reduce recurrence.\nAnti-fungal/anti-dandruff shampoos containing ketoconazole have been shown to be more effective than zinc pyrithione.

Transient, mild drowsiness is commonly seen in the first few days of therapy. If it persists, the dosage should be reduced. In few instances, dizziness, vertigo, headache, and rarely syncope have occurred either alone or together with drowsiness. Mild paradoxical reactions, i.e., excitement, stimulation of affect, have been reported in psychiatric patients; these reactions may be secondary to relief of anxiety and usually appear in the first two weeks of therapy.\nOther side effects occurring during oxazepam therapy include rare instances of minor diffuse skin rashes-morbilliform, urticarial, and maculopapular, nausea, lethargy, edema, slurred speech, tremor, and altered libido. Such side effects have been infrequent and are generally controlled with reduction of dosage. A case of an extensive fixed drug eruption also has been reported.\nAlthough rare, leukopenia and hepatic dysfunction including jaundice have been reported during therapy.

Oxazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, has not been studied adequately to determine whether it, too, may be associated with an increased risk of fetal abnormality. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency, their use during this period should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Oxazepam in women who are pregnant.\n\n【24】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Oxazepam during labor and delivery.\n\n【25】 ### Nursing Mothers\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Oxazepam in women who are nursing.\n\n【26】 ### Pediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 6 years of age have not been established.

Periodic blood counts and liver-function tests are advisable.\n\n【37】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Oxazepam and IV administrations.\n\n【38】 # Overdosage\nIn the management of overdosage with any drug, it should be born in mind that multiple agents may have been taken.\n\n【39】 ### Symptoms\nOverdosage of benzodiazepines is usually manifested by varying degrees of central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild cases, symptoms include drowsiness, mental confusion and lethargy. In more serious cases, and especially when other drugs or alcohol were ingested, symptoms may include ataxia, hypotonia, hypotension, hypnotic state, stage one  to three  coma, and very rarely, death.\n\n【40】 ### Management\nInduced vomiting and/or gastric lavage should be undertaken, followed by general supportive care, monitoring of vital signs, and close observation of the patient. Hypotension, though unlikely, usually may be controlled with norepinephrine bitartrate injection. The value of dialysis has not been adequately determined for oxazepam.\nThe benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may be used in hospitalized patients as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose. The complete flumazenil package insert including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS should be consulted prior to use.\n\n【41】 # Pharmacology\n\n【42】 ## Mechanism of Action\nThere is limited information regarding mechanism of action of oxazepam in the drug label.\n\n【43】 ## Structure\n- Oxazepam is the first of a chemical series of compounds, the 3-hydroxybenzodiazepinones.\n- Oxazepam is 7 chloro-1,3-dihydro-3-hydroxy-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one, and has the following structural formula:\n- Oxazepam is a white crystalline powder.\n\n【44】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of oxazepam in the drug label.\n\n【45】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Pharmacokinetic testing in 12 volunteers demonstrated that a single 30 mg dose of a capsule, tablet or suspension will result in an equivalent extent of absorption.\n- For the capsule and tablet, peak plasma levels averaged 450 mg/mL and were observed to occur about 3 hours after dosing.\n- The mean elimination half-life for oxazepam was approximately 8.2 hours (range 5.7 to 10.9 hours).\n- This product has a single, major inactive metabolite in man, a glucuronide excreted in urine.\nAge (80 years old) does not appear to have a clinically significant effect on oxazepam kinetics.\n- A statistically significant increase in elimination half-life in the very elderly (80 years of age) as compared to younger subjects has been reported, due to a 30% increase in volume of distribution, as well as a 50% reduction in unbound clearance ofoxazepam in the very elderly.\n\n【46】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding nonclinical toxicology of oxazepam in the drug label.\n\n【47】 # Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Oxazepam Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n\n【48】 # How Supplied\nOxazepam capsules are available as follows:\n- 10 mg — Each pink opaque gelatin #4 capsule printed withand 067 in black ink on both cap and body contains 10 mg of Oxazepam, USP.

The stimulus is then mediated through the Central Nervous System (CNS) and the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS).\nThe CNS is made up of the spinal cord and brain, which control voluntary acts and end organs via their respective nerves. The PNS is made up from 12 pairs of cranial nerves, spinal nerves and peripheral nerves. The PNS also is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is responsible for the signs and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. The autonomic nervous system normally maintains body homeostasis via its two branches, the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system (PANS) and the sympathetic autonomic nervous system (SANS). These branches have complementary roles through a negative-feedback system; that is, when one branch is stimulated, the other branch is suppressed.\nThe SANS is associated with the flight-or-fight response, causing dilation of the pupils, increased heart rate, vasoconstriction, decreased peristalsis and tone of the gut, release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as other effects. The effects of PANS stimulation are the opposite of the SANS; for the most part, these are constriction of the pupil, decreased heart rate, as well as increased peristalsis and tone of the gut.\nThe PANS and SANS exit at different sites in the CNS. The PANS exits via the midbrain, pons, medulla (cranial nerves  III, VII, IX, and X), and the sacral level of the spinal cord. The SANS exits via the thoracic and lumbar segments of the spinal cord. There is a major sympathetic output (called the splanchnic outflow) between T5 and L2.\nIn someone with a high-level SCI, intact lower motor neurons sense the painful stimuli below the level of injury and transmit the message up the spinal cord . At the level of the SCI, the pain signal is interrupted and prevented from being transmitted to the cerebral cortex. The site of the SCI also interrupts the two branches of the autonomic nervous system and disconnects the feedback loop, causing the two branches to function independently.\nThe ascending information reaches the major splanchnic sympathetic outflow (T5-T6) and stimulates a sympathetic response. The sympathetic response causes vasoconstriction, resulting in hypertension, pounding headache, visual changes, anxiety, pallor, and goose bumps below the level of injury. This hypertension stimulates the baroreceptors in the carotid sinuses and aortic arch. The PANS is unable to counteract these effects through the injured spinal cord, however. Instead, the PANS attempts to maintain homeostasis by slowing down the heart rate. The brainstem stimulates the heart, through the vagus nerve, causing bradycardia and vasodilation above the level of injury. The PANS impulses are unable to descend past the lesion, and therefore no changes occur below the level of injury.\n\n【3】 # Diagnosis\n\n【4】 ## Symptoms\nThe most common symptoms include excess sweating, headache, a tingling sensation on the face and neck, blotchy skin around the neck and goose bumps.  Not all the symptoms always appear at once, and their severity may vary.\nThere can be many stimuli that cause autonomic dysreflexia. Anything that would have been painful, uncomfortable, or physically irritating before the injury may cause autonomic dysreflexia after the injury.\nThe most common cause seems to be overfilling of the bladder. This could be due to a blockage in the urinary drainage device, bladder infection (cystitis), inadequate bladder emptying, bladder spasms, or possibly stones in the bladder.\nThe second most common cause is a bowel that is full of stool or gas. Any stimulus to the rectum, such as digital stimulation, can trigger a reaction, leading to autonomic dysreflexia.\nOther causes include skin irritations, wounds, pressure sores, burns, broken bones, pregnancy, ingrown toenails, appendicitis, and other medical complications.\n\n【5】 # Differential Diagnosis of Causes of Spinal Autonomic Dysreflexia\nIn general, noxious stimuli (irritants, things which would ordinarily cause pain) to areas of body below the level of spinal injury. Things to consider include:\n\n【6】 # Treatment\nThe key strategy in treatment is to treat and/or remove any underlying precipitants of the syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "8de96da9-4d0c-4ca5-bd26-16fbd8289b72", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Pathologic nystagmus\nPathologic nystagmus is a form of involuntary eye movement. It is characterized by alternating smooth pursuit in one direction and saccadic movement in the other direction.\nWhen nystagmus occurs without filling its normal function, it is pathologic (deviating from the healthy or normal condition). Pathological nystagmus is the result of damage to one or more components of the vestibular system, including the semicircular canals, otolith organs, and the vestibulocerebellum.\nPathological nystagmus generally causes a degree of vision impairment, although the severity of such impairment varies widely.  Sometimes it is the other way around — many blind people have nystagmus, which is one reason that some wear dark glasses.\n\n【1】 # Prevalence\nNystagmus is a relatively common clinical condition, affecting one in every 5,000 to 10,000 individuals. One survey in Oxfordshire, England identified one in every 670 children by the age of two as manifesting nystagmus.\n\n【2】 # Variations\n- Peripheral nystagmus occurs as a result of either normal or diseased functional states of the vestibular system and may combine a rotational component with vertical or horizontal eye movements and may be spontaneous, positional or evoked.\nPositional nystagmus occurs when a persons head is in a specific position.  An example of disease state in which this occurs is Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).\nGaze Induced nystagmus occurs or is exacerbated as a result of changing one's gaze toward or away from a particular side which has an affected vestibular apparatus.\nPost rotational nystagmus occurs after an imbalance is created between a normal side and a diseased side by stimulation of the vestibular system by rapid shaking or rotation of the head.\nSpontaneous nystagmus is nystagmus that occurs randomly, regardless of the position of the patient's head.\n- Positional nystagmus occurs when a persons head is in a specific position.  An example of disease state in which this occurs is Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).\n- Gaze Induced nystagmus occurs or is exacerbated as a result of changing one's gaze toward or away from a particular side which has an affected vestibular apparatus.\n- Post rotational nystagmus occurs after an imbalance is created between a normal side and a diseased side by stimulation of the vestibular system by rapid shaking or rotation of the head.\n- Spontaneous nystagmus is nystagmus that occurs randomly, regardless of the position of the patient's head.\n- Central nystagmus occurs as a result of either normal or abnormal processes not related to the vestibular organ.  For example lesions of the midbrain or cerebellum can result in up and down-beat nystagmus.\n\n【3】 # Causes\nThe cause for pathological nystagmus may be congenital, idiopathic, secondary to a pre-existing neurological disorder or may be induced temporarily by disorientation (such as on roller coaster rides) or certain drugs (alcohol and other central nervous system depressants and stimulants, such as lithium salts, phenytoin and ecstasy).\n\n【4】 ## Congenital\nCongenital nystagmus occurs more frequently than acquired nystagmus.  It can be insular or accompany other disorders (such as micro-ophthalmic anomalies or Down's Syndrome). Congential nystagmus itself is usually mild and non-progressive. The affected persons are not normally aware of their spontaneous eye movements but vision can be impaired depending on the severity of the movements.\n- Infantile:\n- Idiopathic\n- Albinism\n- Aniridia\n- Leber's congenital amaurosis\n- Bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia\n- Bilateral congenital cataracts\n- Rod monochromatism\n- Optic nerve or macular disease\n- Persistent tunica vasculosa lentis\n- Latent nystagmus\n- Nystagmus blockage syndrome\nX-linked infantile nystagmus is associated with FRMD7.\n\n【5】 ## Acquired\nSome of the diseases which present nystagmus as a pathological sign are:\n- Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo \n- Head trauma\n- Stroke (the most common cause in older people)\n- Ménière's disease and other balance disorders\n- Multiple sclerosis\n- Brain tumors\n- Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome\n- Encephalopathy\n- Lateral medullary syndrome\n- Aniridia\n- Optic nerve hypoplasia\n- Albinism\n- Noonan syndrome\n- Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease\n- Superior canal dehiscence syndrome\n- Tullio phenomenon\n- Horner's Syndrome\nNystagmus from toxic or metabolic reasons could be the result of e.g.:\n- Alcohol intoxication \n- Lithium\n- Barbiturates\n- Phenytoin (Dilantin)\n- Salicylates\n- Benzodiazepines\n- Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)\n- Phencyclidine (PCP)\n- Ketamine\n- Other anticonvulsants or sedatives\n- Methylenedioxymethamphetamine\n- Wernicke's encephalopathy\n- Thiamine deficiency\nIf the pathologic nystagmus is based in the central nervous system (CNS), such as with a cerebellar problem, the nystagmus can be in any direction including horizontal. Purely vertical nystagmus is usually central in origin.\nCauses include e.g.:\n- Thalamic hemorrhage\n- Tumor\n- Stroke\n- Trauma\n- Cerebellar ataxia\n- Vestibular Pathology (Ménière's disease, SCDS (superior canal dehiscence syndrome), BPPV, Labyrinthitis)\n- Trochlear nerve malfunction\n- Non-physiologic\n\n【6】 # Diagnosis\nNystagmus is very noticeable, but little recognized. Nystagmus can be clinically investigated by using a number of non-invasive standard tests. The simplest one is Caloric reflex test. In a caloric reflex test, one external auditory meatus is irrigated with warm or cold water. The temperature gradient provokes the stimulation of the vestibulocochlear nerve and the consequent nystagmus.\nThe resulting movement of the eyes may be recorded and quantified by special devices called electronystagmograph (ENG), which is a form of electrooculography (an electrical method of measuring eye movements using external electrodes) or even less invasive devices called videoonystagmograph (VNG), which is a form of videooculography(VOG) (a video-based method of measuring eye movements using external small cameras built into head masks). Special swinging chairs with electrical controls are also used in this test to induce rotatory nystagmus.\n\n【7】 # Treatment\nCongenital nystagmus has traditionally been viewed as non-treatable, but medications have been discovered in recent years that show promise in some patients.  In 1980, researchers discovered that a drug called baclofen could effectively stop periodic alternating nystagmus.  Subsequently, gabapentin, an anticonvulsant, was found to cause improvement in about half the patients who received it to relieve symptoms of nystagmus. Other drugs found to be effective against nystagmus in some patients include memantine, levetiracetam, 3,4-diaminopyridine, 4-aminopyridine, and acetazolamide. Several therapeutic approaches, such as contact lenses, drugs, surgery, and low vision rehabilitation have also been proposed.\nClinical trials of a surgery to treat nystagmus (known as tenotomy) concluded in 2001. Tenotomy is being performed regularly at the University of Pittsburgh Children's Hospital and by a handful of surgeons around the world. The surgery developed by Louis F. Dell'Osso Ph.D aims to reduce the eye shaking (oscillations) which in turn tends to improve visual acuity.\n\n【8】 # Research\nSeveral universities are researching Nystagmus and are looking for volunteers to take part in research activities.\nCurrent UK Research Projects", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

However, the elements comprising Virchow's triad were neither proposed by Virchow, nor did he ever suggest a triad to describe the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis. In fact, it was decades following Virchow's death before a consensus was reached proposing that thrombosis is the result of alterations in blood flow, vascular endothelial injury, or alterations in the constitution of the blood. Still, the modern understanding of the factors leading to embolism are similar to the description provided by Virchow. Its nebulous origins notwithstanding, Virchow's triad remains a useful concept for clinicians and pathologists alike in understanding the contributors to thrombosis.\n\n【2】 # The triad\nThe triad consists of three components:\n\n【3】 # Historical Perspective\nThe origin of the term \"Virchow's Triad\" is of historical interest, and has been subject to reinterpretation in recent years. While both Virchow's and the modern triads describe thrombosis, the previous triad has been characterized as \"the consequences of thrombosis\", and the modern triad as \"the causes of thrombosis\".\nRudolf Virchow elucidated the etiology of pulmonary embolism, whereby thrombi occurring within the veins, particularly those of the extremities, become dislodged and migrate to the pulmonary vasculature. He published his description in 1856   In detailing the pathophysiology surrounding pulmonary embolism, he alluded to many of the factors known to contribute to venous thrombosis.  While these factors had already been previously established in the medical literature by others, for unclear reasons they ultimately became known as Virchow's triad.  This eponym did not emerge in the literature until long after Virchow's death. One estimate of the first use of the phrase dates it to the early 1950s.\nAlthough the concept of the triad is usually attributed to Virchow, he did not include endothelial injury in his description. This has been attributed to a dispute Virchow had with Jean Cruveilhier, who considered local trauma of primary importance in the development of pulmonary artery thrombosis.\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\nThis video explains the process of thrombosis:", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Among such patients, TB can be a severe systemic disease with high fevers, rapid progression, and sepsis syndrome.\nHistopathologic findings also are affected by the degree of immunodeficiency. Patients with relatively intact immune function have typical granulomatous inflammation associated with TB disease. With progressive immunodeficiency, granulomas become poorly formed or can be completely absent .\nIn severely immunodeficient patients with a high mycobacterial load, TB disease may be subclinical or oligo-symptomatic. After initiation of ART, immune reconstitution might unmask active TB, resulting in pronounced inflammatory reactions at the sites of infection (294--298). This type of IRIS can manifest as early as 7 days after starting ART. Signs and symptoms include fever; weight loss; and signs of local inflammatory reactions such as lymphadenitis, pulmonary consolidation, infiltrates, nodules, and effusions. Histologically, a vigorous granulomatous reaction, with or without caseation, but with suppuration, necrotising inflammation, and AFB might be evident; cultures of this material are almost invariably positive for M. tuberculosis.\n\n【4】 # Diagnosis\n\n【5】 ## Diagnosis of Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI)\nAll persons should be tested for LTBI at the time of HIV diagnosis regardless of their TB risk category (AII). Persons with negative diagnostic tests for LTBI, advanced HIV infectio.CD4+ count 200 cells/µL (AIII). In general, annual testing for LTBI is recommended for HIV-infected persons who are or remain in a \"high-risk\" category for repeated or ongoing exposure to persons with active TB, i.e., persons who are or who have been incarcerated, live in congregate settings, are active drug users, or have other sociodemographic risk factors for TB (AIII). All HIV-infected persons with a positive diagnostic test for LTBI should undergo chest radiography and clinical evaluation to rule out active TB (AI).\nDiagnosis of LTBI can be accomplished with one of two approaches. The tuberculin skin test (TST), placed by the Mantoux method, is considered positive in HIV-infected persons if induration of >5 mm is demonstrated 48--72 hours after the intradermal placement of 0.1 mL purified protein derivative (PPD). Recently, new in vitro assays that detect IFN-γ release in response to M. tuberculosis-specific peptides have been developed for diagnosing LTBI . Given the high risk for progression to active disease in HIV-infected persons, any HIV-infected person with reactivity on any of the current LTBI diagnostic tests should be considered infected with M. tuberculosis  .\nEvidence suggests that the IGRAs have more consistent and higher specificity (92%--97%) compared with TST (56%--95%), better correlation with surrogate measures of exposure to M. tuberculosis, and less cross reactivity because of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination or other nontuberculous mycobacteria exposure than the TST .\nResults from comparative studies of TST and IGRAs in HIV-infected patients indicate that concordance between the tests is not complete .\nFibrotic lesions consistent with TB might be incidentally noted on a chest radiograph obtained for other reasons. Persons with fibrotic lesions should undergo diagnostic testing for LTBI and be evaluated for active disease. Unless the patient has a known history of prior adequate treatment for active TB, sputum samples for AFB smear and culture should be obtained even if the patient is asymptomatic. HIV-infected persons with CD4+ counts <200 cells/µL who have fibrotic lesions consistent with TB on a chest radiograph and no prior history of treatment should be considered as having M. tuberculosis infection irrespective of the results of LTBI diagnostic tests. In situations with moderate-to-high suspicion of active TB regardless of the results of LTBI tests, empiric treatment for active TB should be initiated while awaiting the results of further diagnostic tests (AII).\n\n【6】 ## Diagnosis of Active Tuberculosis\nThe evaluation of suspected HIV-related TB should include a chest radiograph regardless of the possible anatomic site of disease. Sputum samples for AFB smear and culture should be obtained from patients with pulmonary symptoms and chest radiographic abnormalities. A normal chest radiograph does not exclude the possibility of active pulmonary TB and when suspicion for disease is high, sputum samples should still be obtained .\nHIV serostatus does not affect the yield from sputum smear and culture examinations; positive smear results are more common in cavitary pulmonary disease . The yield of AFB smear and culture of specimens from extrapulmonary sites is greater among patients with advanced immunodeficiency compared with HIV-uninfected adults . Nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests, also called \"direct amplification tests,\" can be applied directly to clinical specimens such as sputum and help to evaluate persons with a positive AFB smear. A positive NAA result in an AFB smear-positive patient likely reflects active TB. In persons with AFB smear-negative sputum or extrapulmonary disease, however, NAA tests have lower sensitivity and negative predictive value and should be used and interpreted with caution .\nFor patients with signs of extrapulmonary TB, needle aspiration or tissue biopsy of skin lesions, lymph nodes, or pleural or pericardial fluid should be performed. Mycobacterial blood cultures might be helpful for patients with signs of disseminated disease or worsening immunodeficiency.\nA positive AFB smear result in any specimen (sputum, needle aspirate, tissue biopsy) represents some form of mycobacterial disease but does not always represent TB. Because TB is the most virulent mycobacterial pathogen and can be spread from person to person, patients with smear-positive results should be considered to have TB disease until definitive mycobacterial species identification is made. Automated liquid media culture systems might indicate growth of M. tuberculosis within 1--3 weeks compared with 3--8 weeks in solid media.\n\n【7】 Molecular beacons, phage-based assays, and line probe assays are three methods for rapidly detecting the presence of drug resistance, specifically to INH and RIF. These assays are expensive, require sophisticated laboratory support, need further study, and are not yet FDA-approved for use in the United States. Published results on the performance of the two assays suitable for direct use on samples, the INNO-LiPA Rif.TB kit (Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium) and FASTPlaque-TB (Biotec Laboratories Ltd., Ipswich, United Kingdom), have been inconsistent. Until results of ongoing validation and field testing of these rapid tests are available, conventional laboratory methods for culture and susceptibility testing should be pursued on all suspect clinical specimens.\n\n【8】 ## Preventing Exposure\nHIV-infected persons should be advised that time spent in congregate settings or other environments identified as possible sites of TB transmission (e.g., correctional facilities, homeless shelters, nursing homes) might increase the likelihood of contracting M. tuberculosis infection (BIII) . Factors known to increase contagiousness include anatomical site of TB disease (pulmonary or laryngeal), AFB smear-positive sputum, cavities evident on chest radiograph, and aerosolization by coughing or singing. HIV-infected patients who have pulmonary or laryngeal TB are, on average, as contagious as patients who are not HIV-infected. Exposure to patients with known TB, but who have AFB smear-negative sputum results, poses a lower but not nonexistent risk for M. tuberculosis transmission .\nIn health-care facilities and other environments with a high risk for transmission, all patients with known or presumed infectious TB should be physically separated from other patients, but especially from those with HIV infection (AII) . A patient with infectious TB returning to a congregate living setting or to any setting in which susceptible persons might be exposed should be receiving or should have completed treatment and have three consecutive negative AFB smear results from good quality sputum samples collected >8 hours apart (with one specimen collected during the early morning), be on adequate treatment for >2 weeks, and demonstrate clinical improvement before being considered noninfectious (AIII) . Certain specialists recommend that patients with MDR-TB have a negative sputum culture before returning to a congregate setting.\nTreatment of LTBI is effective in reducing TB incidence among populations who reside in areas of low, medium, and high TB transmission (316--318). All possible strategies should be pursued to ensure that HIV-infected persons with risk factors for TB are tested for M. tuberculosis infection and those with LTBI receive and complete a course of LTBI treatment (AII) . Persons infected with HIV should be treated presumptively for LTBI when the history of TB exposure is substantial, regardless of the results of diagnostic testing for LTBI (BII) .\n\n【9】 ## Preventing Disease (Treatment of LTBI)\nAll HIV-infected persons with suspected LTBI or who have symptoms indicating TB should promptly undergo chest radiography and clinical evaluation to rule out active TB regardless of the results of diagnostic tests for LTBI .\nHIV-infected persons, regardless of age, should be treated for LTBI if they have no evidence of active TB and exhibit the following characteristics: 1 a positive diagnostic test for LTBI and no prior history of treatment for active or latent TB (AI); 2 a negative diagnostic test for LTBI but are close contacts of persons with infectious pulmonary TB (AII); and 3 a history of untreated or inadequately treated healed TB (i.e., old fibrotic lesions on chest radiography) regardless of diagnostic tests for LTBI (AII) .\nThe efficacy of LTBI treatment has not been documented for HIV-infected persons with negative diagnostic tests for LTBI without known exposure to M. tuberculosis. Persons from groups or geographic areas with a high prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection might be at increased risk for primary or reactivation TB and, in this situation, decisions to treat for LTBI must include consideration of CD4+ count and other factors (BIII) .\nTreatment options for LTBI include INH daily (AII) or twice weekly (BII) for 9 months .\nNo evidence suggests that LTBI treatment should be continued beyond the recommended duration in persons with HIV infection. Therefore, LTBI treatment should be discontinued after completing the appropriate number of doses (AII).\n\n【10】 ## Treatment of Disease\nConsidering the variability of yield from smear microscopy and NAA tests, empiric treatment should be initiated and continued in HIV-infected persons in whom TB is suspected until all diagnostic work-up (smears, cultures, or other identification results) is complete (AII). When active TB is diagnosed or suspected, a multi-drug anti-TB treatment regimen should be started immediately (AI). This approach promotes rapid killing of tubercle bacilli, prevents the emergence of drug resistance, and decreases the period of contagion . DOT is recommended for all patients with HIV-related TB (AII). Likelihood of treatment success is further enhanced by DOT with support for other social and medical needs of HIV-infected patients (BII) (enhanced DOT) . A treatment plan should be based on completion of the total number of recommended doses ingested rather than the duration of treatment administration (AIII) . The following text summarizes both duration-based and total number-based dosing recommendations.\nRecommendations for anti-TB treatment regimens in HIV-infected adults follow the same principles as for adults without HIV infection (AI) . Treatment of drug-susceptible TB disease should include a 6-month regimen with an initial phase of INH, RIF or rifabutin, PZA, and EMB administered for 2 months, followed by INH and RIF (or rifabutin) for 4 additional months (AI). When drug-susceptibility testing confirms the absence of resistance to INH, RIF, and PZA, EMB may be discontinued before 2 months of treatment have been completed (AI) . For patients with cavitary lung disease and cultures positive for M. tuberculosis after completion of 2 months of therapy, treatment should be extended with INH and RIF for an additional 3 months for a total of 9 months (AII). All HIV-infected patients treated with INH should receive pyridoxine supplementation (BIII). For patients with extrapulmonary TB, a 6- to 9-month regimen (2 months of INH, RIF, PZA, and EMB followed by 4--7 months of INH and RIF) is recommended (AII). Exceptions to the recommendation for a 6- to 9-month regimen for extrapulmonary TB include CNS disease (tuberculoma or meningitis) and bone and joint TB, for which many experts recommend 9--12 months (AII) . Adjuvant corticosteroids should be added when treating CNS and pericardial disease (AII). Treatment with corticosteroids should be started intravenously as early as possible with change to oral therapy individualized according to clinical improvement . Recommended corticosteroid regimens are dexamethasone 0.3--0.4 mg/kg tapered over 6--8 weeks  or prednisone 1 mg/kg for 3 weeks, then tapered for 3--5 weeks.\nThe optimal way to prevent relapse has not been determined. How the CD4+ count relates to likelihood of treatment failure and relapse remains uncertain. Some recent observational studies suggest that 9 months of therapy result in a lower rate of relapse than shorter or 6-month anti-TB regimens (325--327). While awaiting definitive results of randomized comparisons of treatment duration in HIV-infected patients with TB disease, 6 months of therapy are probably adequate for the majority of patients, but prolonged therapy (up to 9 months) is recommended (as in HIV-uninfected patients) for patients with a delayed response to therapy, with cavitary disease on chest radiograph, and for those with extrapulmonary or CNS disease (BII) .\nIntermittent dosing (i.e., twice or thrice weekly) facilitates DOT by decreasing the number of encounters required, might provide more effective peak serum concentrations, and is preferable to complete the regimen. For HIV-infected patients, the initial 8-week phase of therapy should be administered daily by DOT (7 days per week for 56 doses or 5 days per week for 40 doses) (AII) or 3 times weekly by DOT for 24 doses (BII) . Because twice-weekly administration of the continuation phase of therapy is associated with an increased risk for relapse with acquired rifamycin-resistant M. tuberculosis strains .\n\n【11】 # Monitoring and Adverse Events\n\n【12】 ## Monitoring of LTBI Treatment\nAll patients with a diagnosis of LTBI should be counseled about risk for TB, adherence to treatment regimens, benefits and risks of treatment, interactions with other drugs, and an optimal follow-up plan. HIV-infected patients receiving treatment for LTBI also should have baseline laboratory testing, including an evaluation of hepatic function (serum aspartate aminotransferas. bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) for patients treated with INH and a complete blood count and platelet count for patients taking RIF or rifabutin .\nPatients being treated for LTBI should be monitored at least monthly with a history and physical assessment designed to detect hepatitis and neuropathy. Patients should be advised to stop treatment and promptly seek medical evaluation if symptoms suggesting hepatitis occur, such as nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or dark urine. Clinicians in all settings should consider dispensing no more than a 1-month supply of medication .\n\n【13】 ## Monitoring of Active TB Disease Treatment\nA baseline evaluation and monthly follow-up consisting of clinical, bacteriologic, and periodic laboratory and radiographic evaluations are essential to ensure treatment success. Clinical history and baseline tests to evaluate hepatic function (AST, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase), renal function (serum creatinine), complete blood count (including platelet count), and CD4+ counts are recommended for all patients . HIV-infected patients being treated for active TB should have a clinic-based evaluation at least monthly. For patients with extrapulmonary TB, the frequency and types of evaluations will depend on the sites involved and the ease with which specimens can be obtained. For patients with pulmonary TB, at least one sputum specimen for AFB smear and mycobacterial culture should be obtained monthly until two consecutive specimens are culture negative. Sputum specimens should be obtained after 8 weeks of treatment to inform clinical decision-making about the duration of the continuation phase. For patients with positive AFB smears at initiation of treatment, follow-up smears may be obtained at more frequent intervals (e.g., every 2 weeks until two consecutive specimens are negative) to provide an early assessment of the treatment response .\nFor patients with positive M. tuberculosis cultures after 3 months of treatment, drug-susceptibility tests should be repeated on newly acquired sputum specimens. Patients with positive M. tuberculosis cultures after 4 months of treatment should be considered as treatment failures and managed accordingly . At each visit, patients should be questioned about adherence and possible adverse effects of anti-TB medications; those taking EMB should be asked about blurred vision or scotomata and tested for visual acuity and color discrimination. Routine laboratory monitoring during treatment, even when baseline laboratory abnormalities are not present, could be considered .\nIn HIV-infected persons with active TB, serum concentrations of the first-line anti-TB drugs are frequently lower than published normal ranges . However, routine drug-level monitoring is not recommended . For those with a slow response to treatment, drug concentration measurements might provide objective information on which to base modifications of treatment .\n\n【14】 ## Management of Common Adverse Events\nAlthough the reported frequency of anti-TB drug-related toxicity in patients with HIV infection varies, for most adverse events, rates are not different than for HIV-uninfected patients .\nGastrointestinal reactions are common with many of the anti-TB medications . If gastrointestinal symptoms occur, AST and bilirubin should be measured, and if the AST level is less than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or the baseline for the patient, the symptoms are assumed not to be caused by hepatic toxicity. Typically, gastrointestinal symptoms should be managed without discontinuing TB medications; initial approaches should include either changing the hour of administration or administering drugs with food.\nSkin rashes are common with all of the anti-TB drugs. If rash is minor, affects a limited area, or causes pruritis, antihistamines should be administered for symptomatic relief and all anti-TB medications continued. If the rash is severe, all TB medications should be stopped until the rash is substantially improved, and TB drugs restarted one by one at intervals of 2--3 days. RIF or rifabutin should be restarted first (because they are least likely to cause rash and their role in treatment is critical). If the rash recurs, the last drug added should be stopped. If a petechial rash thought to be caused by thrombocytopenia occurs, the RIF or rifabutin should be stopped permanently . If a generalized rash associated with either fever or mucous membrane involvement occurs, all drugs should be stopped immediately, the patient should be switched to alternative anti-TB agents, and LTBI or TB treatment should be managed in consultation with a specialist.\nFever in an HIV-infected patient who has been receiving effective TB therapy for several weeks might represent drug fever, a paradoxical reaction, or IRIS . If superinfection or worsening TB is excluded as a potential cause, all TB drugs should be stopped. Once the fever has resolved, the general guidelines described for restarting/stopping drugs in the presence of a rash should be followed.\nAn increase in AST concentration occurs in approximately 20% of patients treated with the standard four-drug anti-TB regimen . Drug-induced liver injury can be caused by INH, rifamycins, or PZA and is defined as an AST elevation to >3 times the ULN in the presence of symptoms, or >5 times the ULN in the absence of symptoms . In addition to AST elevation, disproportionate increases in bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase occur occasionally. This latter pattern is more consistent with rifamycin hepatotoxicity than with INH or PZA hepatotoxicity. In most patients, asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations resolve spontaneously.\nIn the absence of symptoms, elevations of AST 5 times the ULN regardless of symptoms, >3 times the ULN with symptoms, or if a significant increase in bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase occurs, hepatotoxic drugs should be stopped, and the patient should be evaluated immediately. For any substantial new transaminase or bilirubin elevation, serologic testing for hepatitis A, B, and C should be performed and the patient questioned regarding symptoms suggestive of biliary tract disease and exposures to alcohol and other hepatotoxins.\nIf anti-TB drugs must be stopped for hepatotoxicity, substituting >3 nonhepatotoxic anti-TB drugs is prudent until the specific cause of hepatotoxicity can be determined and an alternative longer-term regimen constructed. The suspected anti-TB medications should be restarted one at a time after the AST level returns to <2 times the ULN or to near baseline for patients with pre-existing abnormalities. Because the rifamycins are a critical part of the TB regimen and are less likely to cause hepatotoxicity than INH or PZ. they should be restarted first. If no increase in AST occurs after 1 week, INH may be restarted. PZA may be restarted 1 week after INH if AST does not increase. If symptoms recur or AST increases, the last drug added should be stopped. If RIF and INH are tolerated and hepatitis was severe, PZA should be assumed responsible and should be discontinued. In this last circumstance, depending on the number of doses of PZA taken, severity of disease, and bacteriological status, therapy might be extended to 9 months with RIF and INH alone.\nFor HIV-infected patients on LTBI therapy who have hepatotoxicity, most of the general guidelines described for restarting/stopping drugs for patients on therapy for active TB apply. The ultimate decision regarding resumption of therapy with the same or a different agent for LTBI treatment should be made after weighing the risk for additional hepatic injury against the benefit of preventing progression to TB disease  and always in consultation with an expert in treating LTBI in persons with HIV infection.\n\n【15】 # ART in the Management of TB Disease\nThe treatment of TB can be complicated by drug interactions with the rifamycins and overlapping toxicities associated with antiretrovirals (ARVs) and anti-TB drugs when therapy for both HIV and TB infections is concomitantly administered. Both RIF and rifabutin induce CYP3A enzymes, and although rifabutin is not as potent an inducer as RIF, it is a substrate, leading to drug interactions with the PIs and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) when these agents are concomitantly administered with the rifamycins; such administration might result in increased metabolism and suboptimal levels of ARVs .\nCompared with PI-based regimens, NNRTI-based regimens have fewer interactions with RIF-based TB therapy . Rifabutin is an alternative to RIF and can be administered with PIs or NNRTIs with appropriate dose adjustments . Concomitant use of RIF with ritonavir-boosted PIs has been shown to result in subtherapeutic levels of the PI. Use of ritonavir-boosted saquinavir with RIF was associated with a high incidence of hepatotoxicity in a pharmacokinetic study using healthy volunteers . RIF should not be used in patients on PI-based regimens, with or without ritonavir-boosting (EII). For patients undergoing treatment for active TB, starting ART with either an efavirenz- or nevirapine-based regimen is preferred because these NNRTIs have fewer interactions with RIF (BII); dosage adjustments for these NNRTIs might be needed for persons weighing more than 60 kg (BII) .\nIf rifabutin is used in place of RIF, dosage reduction is required with boosted-PI regimens. Efavirenz decreases the levels of rifabutin, and the dose of the latter might have to be increased. Nevirapine does not affect the levels of rifabutin sufficiently to merit adjustment of the rifabutin dose. Underdosing of ARVs or rifabutin can result in selection of HIV drug-resistant mutants or acquired rifamycin resistance, respectively, whereas overdosing of rifabutin might result in dose-related toxicities such as neutropenia and uveitis. Because interpatient variations in the degree of enzyme induction or inhibition can occur, the use of therapeutic drug monitoring for levels of rifabutin, PIs, or NNRTIs might help to adjust dosing for individual patients.\nHIV nucleos(tide) analogs and the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide are not affected by the CYP enzymes and can be used with the rifamycins. Results of ongoing drug-drug interaction studies predict that the combination of RIF (and possibly rifabutin) will result in decreased levels of maraviroc, raltegravir, and elvitegravir. Until data are available to guide dose adjustment, these drugs in combination should be avoided or used with extreme caution. Available NNRTIs and PIs do not have clinically significant drug interactions with other first- and second-line anti-TB drugs; thus, when rifamycins cannot be administered because of toxicity or resistance (MDR or XDR M. tuberculosis strains), ART regimens should be selected on the basis of other factors appropriate to the patient (AIII).\n\n【16】 ## Optimal Timing of Initiation of ART in ART-Naïve Patients with Active TB\nFor ART-naïve, HIV-infected persons who are diagnosed with active TB, anti-TB treatment must be started immediately (AIII). The optimal timing of initiation of ART in this setting is not clear. Options include simultaneous TB and ART or treatment of TB first with delay of ART by several weeks to months. A positive aspect of starting both regimens simultaneously is the possible prevention of progressive HIV disease and reduction in morbidity or mortality associated with TB or other OIs. A negative of this approach is the possibility of overlapping toxicities, drug interactions, a high pill burden, and the possibility of developing IRIS or a paradoxical reaction. These factors must be weighed carefully when choosing the best time to start ART in individual patients.\nSeveral randomized clinical trials are under way to address the optimal timing of initiation of ART in persons being treated for active TB, but the results will not be known for several years. Pending these results, certain specialists determine when to start ART based on the immunologic status of the patients  treated with a RIF-based anti-TB regimen and efavirenz-based ART, morbidity and side effects of medications in patients who started ART 3 weeks after initiation of TB treatment were reduced, compared with those who started ART and anti-TB treatment simultaneously. Furthermore, simultaneous anti-TB and anti-HIV treatment did not reduce overall mortality.\nWhen TB occurs in patients already on ART, treatment for TB must be started immediately (AIII), and ART should be modified to reduce the risk for drug interactions and maintain virologic suppression. When TB occurs in the setting of virologic failure, ART drug-resistance testing should be performed and a new ART regimen constructed to achieve virologic suppression and avoid drug interactions with the anti-TB regimen administered (AIII).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Common adverse reactions include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, blurred vision, tinnitus.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Aminocaproic acid injection is administered by infusion, utilizing the usual compatible intravenous vehicles (e.g., Sterile Water for Injection, Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9%, Dextrose Injection 5% or Ringer’s Injection).  Although Sterile Water for Injection is compatible for intravenous injection, the resultant solution is hypo-osmolar.  Rapid injection of aminocaproic acid injection undiluted into a vein is not recommended.\n- For the treatment of acute bleeding syndromes due to elevated fibrinolytic activity, it is suggested that 16 to 20 mL (4 to 5 g) of aminocaproic acid injection in 250 mL of diluent be administered by infusion during the first hour of treatment, followed by a continuing infusion at the rate of 4 mL (1 g) per hour in 50 mL of diluent.  This method of treatment would ordinarily be continued for about 8 hours or until the bleeding situation has been controlled. - Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\n\n【5】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Aminocaproic acid in adult patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- Dosing Information\n- 100 mg/kg PO q4h.\n- Administer 3 boluses (10 gram each) of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) diluted in saline solution 0.9% (total volume 40mL) after anesthesia induction, administration of protamine  and administration of heparin in the pump.\n- 100 mg/kg 4 to 6 hours after surgery PO to a maximum dose of 6 g q6h.\n\n【8】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【9】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding Aminocaproic acid (injection) FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【10】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【11】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Aminocaproic acid in pediatric patients.\n\n【12】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\n- Dosing Information\n- 5 g 60 minutes before surgery, then 5 g q6h.\n\n【13】 # Contraindications\nAminocaproic acid should not be used when there is evidence of an active intravascular clotting process.\nWhen there is uncertainty as to whether the cause of bleeding is primary fibrinolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), this distinction must be made before administering aminocaproic acid.\nThe following tests can be applied to differentiate the two conditions:\n- Platelet count is usually decreased in DIC but normal in primary fibrinolysis.\n- Protamine paracoagulation test is positive in DIC; a precipitate forms when protamine sulfate is dropped into citrated plasma. The test is negative in the presence of primary fibrinolysis.\n- The euglobulin clot Iysis test is abnormal in primary fibrinolysis but normal in DIC.\nAMICAR must not be used in the presence of DIC without concomitant heparin.\n\n【14】 # Warnings\nIn patients with upper urinary tract bleeding, aminocaproic acid administration has been known to cause intrarenal obstruction in the form of glomerular capillary thrombosis or clots in the renal pelvis and ureters. For this reason, aminocaproic acid should not be used in hematuria of upper urinary tract origin, unless the possible benefits outweigh the risk.\nSubendocardial hemorrhages have been observed in dogs given intravenous infusions of 0.2 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of aminocaproic acid and in monkeys given 8 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of aminocaproic acid.\nFatty degeneration of the myocardium has been reported in dogs given intravenous doses of aminocaproic acid at 0.8 to 3.3 times the maximum human therapeutic dose and in monkeys given intravenous doses of aminocaproic acid at 6 times the maximum human therapeutic dose.\nRarely, skeletal muscle weakness with necrosis of muscle fibers has been reported following prolonged administration. Clinical presentation may range from mild myalgias with weakness and fatigue to a severe proximal myopathy with rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and acute renal failure. Muscle enzymes, especially creatine phosphokinase (CPK) are elevated. CPK levels should be monitored in patients on long-term therapy. Aminocaproic acid administration should be stopped if a rise in CPK is noted. Resolution follows discontinuation of aminocaproic acid; however, the syndrome may recur if aminocaproic acid is restarted.\nThe possibility of cardiac muscle damage should also be considered when skeletal myopathy occurs. One case of cardiac and hepatic lesions observed in man has been reported. The patient received 2 g of aminocaproic acid every 6 hours for a total dose of 26 g. Death was due to continued cerebrovascular hemorrhage. Necrotic changes in the heart and liver were noted at autopsy.\n\n【15】 ### Precautions\nAminocaproic acid inhibits both the action of plasminogen activators and to a lesser degree, plasmin activity. The drug should not be administered without a definite diagnosis and/or laboratory finding indicative of hyperfibrinolysis (hyperplasminemia). Inhibition of fibrinolysis by aminocaproic acid may theoretically result in clotting or thrombosis. However, there is no definite evidence that administration of aminocaproic acid has been responsible for the few reported cases of intravascular clotting which followed this treatment. Rather, it appears that such intravascular clotting was most likely due to the patient's preexisting clinical condition, e.g., the presence of DIC. It has been postulated that extravascular clots formed in vivo may not undergo spontaneous Iysis as do normal clots.\nReports have appeared in the literature of an increased incidence of certain neurological deficits such as hydrocephalus, cerebral ischemia, or cerebral vasospasm associated with the use of antifibrinolytic agents in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). All of these events have also been described as part of the natural course of SAH, or as a consequence of diagnostic procedures such as angiography. Drug relatedness remains unclear.\nAminocaproic acid should not be administered with Factor IX Complex concentrates or Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant concentrates, as the risk of thrombosis may be increased.\nThe use of aminocaproic acid should be accompanied by tests designed to determine the amount of fibrinolysis present. There are presently available: (a) general tests such as those for the determination of the Iysis of a clot of blood or plasma; and (b) more specific tests for the study of various phases of the fibrinolytic mechanisms. These latter tests include both semiquantitative and quantitative techniques for the determination of profibrinolysin, fibrinolysin, and antifibrinolysin.\n- Prolongation of the template bleeding time has been reported during continuous intravenous infusion of aminocaproic acid at dosages exceeding 24 g/day.\n- Platelet function studies in these patients have not demonstrated any significant platelet dysfunction. However, in vitro studies have shown that at high concentrations (7.4 mMol/L or 0.97 mg/mL and greater) aminocaproic acid inhibits ADP and collagen-induced platelet aggregation, the release of ATP and serotonin, and the binding of fibrinogen to the platelets in a concentration-response manner.\n- Following a 10 g bolus of aminocaproic acid, transient peak plasma concentrations of 4.6 mMol/L or 0.60 mg/mL have been obtained. The concentration of aminocaproic acid necessary to maintain inhibition of fibrinolysis is 0.99 mMol/L or 0.13 mg/mL. Administration of a 5 g bolus followed by 1 to 1.25 g/hr should achieve and sustain plasma levels of 0.13 mg/mL.\n- Concentrations which have been obtained in vivo clinically in patients with normal renal function are considerably lower than the in vitro concentrations found to induce abnormalities in platelet function tests.\n\n【16】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【17】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nAminocaproic acid is generally well tolerated. The following adverse experiences have been reported:\n- General: Edema, headache, malaise.\n- Hypersensitivity Reactions: Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions, anaphylaxis.\n- Cardiovascular: Bradycardia, hypotension, peripheral ischemia, thrombosis.\n- Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.\n- Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, coagulation disorder,leukopenia, thrombocytopenia.\n- Musculoskeletal: CPK increased, muscle weakness, myalgia, myopathy, myositis, rhabdomyolysis.\n- Neurologic: Confusion, convulsions, delirium, dizziness, hallucinations,intracranial hypertension, stroke, syncope.\n- Respiratory: Dyspnea, nasal congestion, pulmonary embolism.\n- Skin: Pruritis, rash.\n- Special Senses: Tinnitus, vision decreased, watery eyes.\n- Urogenital: BUN increased, renal failure. There have been some reports of dry ejaculation during the period of AMICAR treatment. These have been reported to date only in hemophilia patients who received the drug after undergoing dental surgical procedures. However, this symptom resolved in all patients within 24 to 48 hours of completion of therapy.\n\n【18】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Aminocaproic acid (injection) Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n【19】 # Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Aminocaproic acid (injection) Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【20】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【21】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with aminocaproic acid. It is also not known whether aminocaproic acid can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Aminocaproic acid should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Aminocaproic acid (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【22】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Aminocaproic acid (injection) during labor and delivery.\n\n【23】 ### Nursing Mothers\nIt is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when AMICAR is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【24】 ### Pediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n【25】 ### Geriatic Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (injection) in geriatric settings.\n\n【26】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【27】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【28】 ### Renal Impairment\nHigher plasma concentrations of aminocaproic acid may occur in patients with severe renal failure.\n\n【29】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (injection) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【30】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Aminocaproic acid (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【31】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Aminocaproic acid (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【32】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【33】 ### Administration\nIntravenous\n\n【34】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Aminocaproic acid (injection) Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【35】 # IV Compatibility\nAminocaproic acid injection is administered by infusion, utilizing the usual compatible intravenous vehicles (e.g., Sterile Water for Injection, Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9%, Dextrose Injection 5% or Ringer’s Injection).\n\n【36】 # Overdosage\nA few cases of acute overdosage with aminocaproic acid administered intravenously have been reported. The effects have ranged from no reaction to transient hypotension to severe acute renal failure leading to death. One patient with a history of brain tumor and seizures experienced seizures after receiving an 8 gram bolus injection of aminocaproic acid. The single dose of aminocaproic acid causing symptoms of overdosage or considered to be life-threatening is unknown. Patients have tolerated doses as high as 100 grams while acute renal failure has been reported following a dose of 12 grams.\nThe intravenous and oral LD50 of aminocaproic acid were 3.0 and 12.0 g/kg, respectively, in the mouse and 3.2 and 16.4 g/kg, respectively, in the rat. An intravenous infusion dose of 2.3 g/kg was lethal in the dog. On intravenous administration, tonic-clonic convulsions were observed in dogs and mice.\nNo treatment for overdosage is known, although evidence exists that aminocaproic acid is removed by hemodialysis and may be removed by peritoneal dialysis. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that total body clearance of aminocaproic acid is markedly decreased in patients with severe renal failure.\n\n【37】 # Pharmacology\n\n【38】 ## Mechanism of Action\nThe fibrinolysis-inhibitory effects of aminocaproic acid appear to be exerted principally via inhibition of plasminogen activators and to a lesser degree through antiplasmin activity.\n\n【39】 ## Structure\nAminocaproic acid is 6-aminohexanoic acid, which acts as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis.\nIts chemical structure is:\nAminocaproic acid is soluble in water, acid, and alkaline solutions; it is sparingly soluble in methanol and practically insoluble in chloroform.\nAminocaproic acid oral solution for oral administration, contains 0.25 g/mL of aminocaproic acid with methylparaben 0.20%, propylparaben 0.05%, edetate disodium 0.30% as preservatives and the following inactive ingredients: sodium saccharin, sorbitol solution, citric acid anhydrous, natural and artificial raspberry flavor and an artificial bitterness modifier.\nEach AMICAR (aminocaproic acid) Tablet, for oral administration contains 500 mg or 1000 mg of aminocaproic acid and the following inactive ingredients: povidone, crospovidone, stearic acid, and magnesium stearate.\nAminocaproic Acid Injection, USP, for intravenous administration, is a sterile pyrogen-free solution containing 250 mg/mL of aminocaproic acid with Benzyl Alcohol 0.9%, as a preservative, and Water for Injection q.s.  The pH is adjusted to approximately 6.8 with Hydrochloric Acid and/or Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n【40】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of aminocaproic acid in the drug label.\n\n【41】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nIn adults, oral absorption appears to be a zero-order process with an absorption rate of 5.2 g/hr. The mean lag time in absorption is 10 minutes.\nAfter a single oral dose of 5 g, absorption was complete (F=1). Mean ± SD peak plasma concentrations (164 ± 28 mcg/mL) were reached within 1.2 ± 0.45 hours.\nAfter oral administration, the apparent volume of distribution was estimated to be 23.1 ± 6.6 L (mean ± SD). Correspondingly, the volume of distribution after intravenous administration has been reported to be 30.0 ± 8.2 L. After prolonged administration, aminocaproic acid has been found to distribute throughout extravascular and intravascular compartments of the body, penetrating human red blood cells as well as other tissue cells.\nRenal excretion is the primary route of elimination. Sixty-five percent of the dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug and 11% of the dose appears as the metabolite adipic acid. Renal clearance (116 mL/min) approximates endogenous creatinine clearance. The total body clearance is 169 mL/min. The terminal elimination half-life for aminocaproic acid is approximately 2 hours.\n\n【42】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nLong-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of aminocaproic acid and studies to evaluate its mutagenic potential have not been conducted. Dietary administration of an equivalent of the maximum human therapeutic dose of aminocaproic acid to rats of both sexes impaired fertility as evidenced by decreased implantations, litter sizes and number of pups born.\n\n【43】 # Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Aminocaproic acid (injection) Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n\n【44】 # How Supplied\n- Store at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F); excursions permitted to 15°-30°C (59°-86°F).\n\n【45】 ## Storage\nThere is limited information regarding Aminocaproic acid (injection) Storage in the drug label.\n\n【46】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n【47】 # Patient Counseling Information\nThere is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of aminocaproic acid in the drug label.\n\n【48】 # Precautions with Alcohol\nAlcohol-Aminocaproic acid interaction has not been established.

One of the factors for increased mortality for dialysis patients as compared to the general population due to COVID-19 infection is the increased age of the patients. Adequate measures should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection in dialysis patients.\n\n【2】 # Pathophysiology\nPatients on hemodialysis have a mild clinical course of COVID 19 infection. It could be due to multiple reasons.\n- Patients with chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease have low immunity. The low immunity results in low-intensity cytokine storm in response to viral antigens. The patients on maintenance hemodialysis rarely present with a full-blown clinical picture of pneumonia.\n- Hypercoagulation plays an important role in aggravating the disease. Hypercoagulation initiates the coagulation cascade resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC results in organ dysfunction and high mortality in COVID 19 infection. Anticoagulants administered during hemodialysis inhibit coagulation cascade preventing hypercoagulation and DIC.\n- In a study done at a hemodialysis center at Renmin Hospital in Wuhan, 37 out of a total of 230 patients were infected with covid-19 infections in one month. Four members of the health care staff were also infected. The peripheral blood examination of the covid 19 infected hemodialysis patients had reduced levels of killer T cells, helper T cells, Natural killer cells, and lower level of inflammatory cytokines as compared to non-dialysis infected patients.\n\n【3】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- Patients on maintenance hemodialysis and end-stage kidney disease have low immunity and multiple co-morbidities. They are at an increased risk of contracting the covid-19 infection.  A case series of 5,700 patients with covid-19 infection was done in 12 hospitals under the Northwell Health system in New York. It showed a prevalence of 5% chronic kidney disease and 3.5% end-stage renal disease in hospitalized covid-19 patients.\n- A research study done in Japan showed a higher mortality 16.2% (16/99) in dialysis patients as compared to the general population 5.3% (874/16,532). The average age of patients on dialysis was 70 to 90 years while of the general population was 20 to 60 years.\n- A study was done in 208 acute care hospitals in the UK. The total patients studied were 20,133. It showed chronic kidney disease was one of the most common co-morbidity in hospitalized covid-19 patients present in 16% of patients.\n- Clinical research was done by Alberici et al. at four outpatient dialysis facilities in Italy showed high overall mortality of 29% in dialysis patients.\n\n【4】 # Treatment\n\n【5】 ## Measures to prevent COVID 19 infection in hemodialysis patients\nStrict measures should be taken to prevent covid 19 infections in hemodialysis patients and health care workers. The measures include:\n\n【6】 ### Screening of the patients\n- Appropriate screening of patients should be done before dialysis. The best approach is to call patients and inquire about covid-19 symptoms.\n- Patients reporting illness or covid-19 symptoms should be placed in the screening area. Hand sanitizers and face masks should be provided to patients.\n- A triage protocol should be instituted in dialysis facilities to take patients to testing clinics, particular dialysis facilities, and hospitals.\n\n【7】 ### Managing patients with suspected illness\n- If there are adequate resources in the hospital, patients should have dialysis at a specific shift, or a separate isolation dialysis ward should be made.\n- Patients should be instructed to wear masks and cover mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing. This will reduce air droplet transmission of the virus.\n- Suspected covid-19 patients should have at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart from each other in all directions.\n\n【8】 ### Personnel protective equipment\n- A selected group of healthcare personnel should be assigned for suspected covid-19 patients. Personal protective equipment should be given to patients and healthcare personnel.\n- Healthcare workers should follow droplet and contact precautions. The workers should wear masks, gowns, goggles, shields, and gloves. Surgical face masks and N95 masks can be used. \n- Eyeshields and goggles can be used to prevent droplet spread via eyes.\n\n【9】 ### Disinfection\nDisinfecting personnel should also wear personal protective equipment while disinfecting the dialysis surface. The dialysis machine, chair, dialysis surface station including BP cuff, stethoscope, the chairside stand should be cleaned with disinfecting wipes and allowed to be air dry.\n\n【10】 ### Optimum utilization of resources\n- As pandemic will be for a long duration, hence resources should be utilized optimally. The gown should ideally be worn by both the health care workers and the patients.\n- If there are a limited number of gowns, then health care workers should wear it at the time of initiating and terminating dialysis, manipulating catheters and access sites, disinfecting dialysis station, and assisting to and from the dialysis station. \n- The goggles and eye shields can be reused after proper disinfection procedure. The eye shields and face masks should be used for an extended time period. \n- A track of the personal protective equipment stock should be made.\n\n【11】 ### Work labor Management\n- The healthcare workers are at risk for infection with covid-19 due to exposure. The exposure of health care workers can be minimized by working in shifts.\n- In this pandemic, the health care workers can become sick and shortage of health care staff can arise. To encounter it a back up list should be created to fill up the positions. Training courses should be conducted for the health care staff.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "fac613b7-64d8-4c5b-a842-456db6a0b3c1", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Behavioural change theories\n\n【1】 # Behavioral change theories and models\nBehavioral change theories and models are attempts to explain the reasons behind alterations in individuals' behavioral patterns.  These theories cite environmental, personal, and behavioral characteristics as the major factors in behavioral determination.  In recent years, there has been increased interest in the application of these theories in the areas of health, education, and criminology with the hope that understanding behavioral change will improve the services offered in these areas.\n\n【2】 # History\nMany of the original works outlining the major theories that are the basis for current knowledge about behavioral change theories were published in the 1970s and 1980s.  These include Icek Ajzen’s articles on the Theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior, Albert Bandura’s writings on Social Cognitive Theory, and James Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente’s works on the Transtheoretical Model.  More recently, interest in behavioral change theories has arisen due to their apparent application in areas like health, education, and criminology, leading to further research backed by institutions like the National Institutes of Health.  With this renewed interest, however, there is also a shift towards research into understanding the maintenance of behavioral change in addition to broadening the research base for revising current theories that focus on initial change (NIH 2003).\n\n【3】 # General theories and models\nEach behavioral change theory or model focuses on different factors in attempting to explain behavioral change.  Of the many that exist, the most prevalent are the Learning Theories, Social Learning Theory, Theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior, and Transtheoretical Model.  Research has also been conducted regarding specific elements of these theories, especially elements like self-efficacy that are common to several of the theories (Ajzen 1985).\n\n【4】 ## Self-Efficacy\nSelf-efficacy is an individual’s impression of their own ability to perform a task.  This impression is based upon factors like the individual’s prior success in the task or in related tasks, the individual’s physiological state, and outside sources of persuasion (Bandura 1977).  Self-efficacy is thought to be predictive of the amount of effort an individual will expend in initiating and maintaining a behavioral change, so although self-efficacy is not a behavioral change theory per se, it is an important element of many of the theories, including the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior (Bandura 1977 and USDHHS 1996).\n\n【5】 ## Learning Theories/Behavior Analytic Theories of Change\nFrom behaviorists like Burrhus Frederic Skinner come the Learning Theories, which state that complex behavior is learned gradually through the modification of simpler behaviors (USDHHS 1996).  Imitation and reinforcement play important roles in these theories, which state that individuals learn by duplicating behaviors they observe in others and that rewards are essential to ensuring the repetition of desirable behavior (Skinner 1953).  As each simple behavior is established through imitation and subsequent reinforcement, the complex behavior develops. When verbal behavior is established the organism can learn through rule governed behavior and thus not all action needs to be contingency shaped.\nSkinner  was one of the first psychologists to recognize the critical role of imitation (what he termed echoic behavior) in the learning of language Behavior analytic theories of change have been quite effective in improving the human condition .\n\n【6】 ## Social Learning/Social Cognitive Theory\nAccording to the Social Learning Theory, which is also known as the Social Cognitive Theory, behavioral change is determined by environmental, personal, and behavioral elements.  Each factor affects each of the others.  For example, in congruence with the principles of self-efficacy, an individual’s thoughts affect their behavior and an individual’s characteristics elicit certain responses from the social environment.  Likewise, an individual’s environment affects the development of personal characteristics as well as the person’s behavior, and an individual’s behavior may change their environment as well as the way the individual thinks or feels.  Social Learning Theory focuses on the reciprocal interactions between these factors, which are hypothesized to determine behavioral change (Bandura 1989).\n\n【7】 ## Theory of Reasoned Action\nThe Theory of Reasoned Action assumes that individuals consider a behavior’s consequences before performing the particular behavior.  As a result, intention is an important factor in determining behavior and behavioral change. According to Icek Ajze. intentions develop from an individual’s perception of a behavior as positive or negative together with the individual’s impression of the way their society perceives the same behavior.  Thus, personal attitude and social pressure shape intention, which is essential to performance of a behavior and consequently behavioral change (Ajzen 1985).\n\n【8】 ## Theory of Planned Behavior\nIn 1985, Ajzen expanded upon the Theory of Reasoned Action, formulating the Theory of Planned Behavior, which also emphasizes the role of intention in behavior performance but is intended to cover cases in which a person is not in control of all factors affecting the actual performance of a behavior.  As a result, the new theory states that the incidence of actual behavior performance is proportional to the amount of control an individual possesses over the behavior and the strength of the individual’s intention in performing the behavior.  In his article, Ajzen  further hypothesizes that self-efficacy is important in determining the strength of the individual’s intention to perform a behavior.\n\n【9】 ## Transtheoretical/Stages of Change Model\nAccording to the Transtheoretical Model, which is also known as the Stages of Change Model, behavioral change is a five-step process.  The five stages, between which individuals may oscillate before achieving complete change, are precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance (USDHHS 1996).  At the precontemplation stage, an individual may or may not be aware of a problem but has no thought of changing their behavior.  From precontemplation to contemplation, the individual develops a desire to change a behavior.  During preparation, the individual intends to change the behavior within the next month, and during the action stage, the individual begins to exhibit new behavior consistently.  An individual finally enters the maintenance stage once they exhibit the new behavior consistently for over six months (“Behavior Change” 2007).\n\n【10】 # Applications\nBehavioral change theories have potential applications in many areas.  Currently, the most prominent areas of application are in healthcare, education, and criminal behavior.  These issues are important to societal functionality and policy-making, resulting in recent renewed interest in these theories.\n\n【11】 ## Health\nIn the interest of promoting healthy lifestyle development, behavioral change theories have gained recognition for their possible effectiveness in explaining health-related behaviors and providing insight into methods that would encourage individuals to develop and maintain healthy lifestyles.  Specific health applications of behavioral change theories include the development of programs promoting active lifestyles and programs reducing the spread of diseases like AIDS (USDHHS 1996 and “Behavior Change” 2007).  In addition, the National Institutes of Health has, in recent years, funded research to broaden the information base for behavioral change theories (NIH 2003).\nModels specific to health applications include the Health Belief/Health Action Model and Relapse Prevention Model.  The Health Belief Model, also known as the Health Action Model, states that individuals will alter health-related behavior according to the perceived severity of the threat to their health (Chen & Land 1986).  The Relapse Prevention Model concentrates on promoting prolonged healthy behavior by making distinctions between lapses and relapses in an attempt to encourage individuals to maintain healthy lifestyles (USDHHS 1996).\n\n【12】 ## Education\nBehavioral change theories can be used as guides in developing effective teaching methods.  Since the goal of much education is behavioral change, the understanding of behavior afforded by behavioral change theories provides insight into the formulation of effective teaching methods that tap into the mechanisms of behavioral change.  In an era when education programs strive to reach large audiences with varying socioeconomic statuses, the designers of such programs increasingly strive to understand the reasons behind behavioral change in order to understand universal characteristics that may be crucial to program design (Nutbeam 2000).\nIn fact, some of the theories, like the Social Learning Theory and Theory of Planned Behavior, were developed as attempts to improve health education.  Because these theories address the interaction between individuals and their environments, they can provide insight into the effectiveness of education programs given a specific set of predetermined conditions, like the social context in which a program will be initiated (Nutbeam 2000).  Although health education is still the area in which behavioral change theories are most often applied, theories like the Stages of Change Model have begun to be applied in other areas like employee training and developing systems of higher education (Government 2007 and Elton 2003).\n\n【13】 ## Criminology\nEmpirical studies in criminology support behavioral change theories.  At the same time, the general theories of behavioral change suggest possible explanations to criminal behavior and methods of correcting deviant behavior (Akers 1979).  Since deviant behavior correction entails behavioral change, understanding of behavioral change can facilitate the adoption of effective correctional methods in policy-making.  For example, the understanding that deviant behavior like stealing may be learned behavior resulting from reinforcers like hunger satisfaction that are unrelated to criminal behavior can aid the development of social controls that address this underlying issue rather than merely the resultant behavior (Jeffery 1965).\nSpecific theories that have been applied to criminology include the Social Learning and Differential Association Theories.  Social Learning Theory’s element of interaction between an individual and their environment explains the development of deviant behavior as a function of an individual’s exposure to a certain behavior and their acquaintances, who can reinforce either socially acceptable or socially unacceptable behavior (Akers 1979).  Differential Association Theory, originally formulated by Edwin Sutherland, is a popular, related theoretical explanation of criminal behavior that applies learning theory concepts and asserts that deviant behavior is learned behavior.  Jeffery’s  reexamination of Sutherland’s original theory adds that because of the necessity of temporal proximity between punishment and behavior for conditioning to occur, the legal system’s application of punishment is more likely to generate law evasion rather than to correct deviant behavior.\n\n【14】 # Objections\nBehavioral change theories are not universally accepted.  Criticisms include the theories’ emphases on individual behavior and a general disregard for the influence of environmental factors on behavior.  In addition, as some theories were formulated as guides to understanding behavior while others were designed as frameworks for behavioral interventions, the theories’ purposes are not consistent (USDHHS 1996).  Such criticism illuminates the strengths and weaknesses of the theories, showing that there is room for further research into behavioral change theories (NIH 2003).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It is different from narcolepsy in that idiopathic hypersomnia does not involve suddenly falling asleep or losing muscle control associated with strong emotions (cataplexy).\n\n【3】 # What are the symptoms of Hypersomnia?\n- Symptoms often develop slowly during adolescence or young adulthood. They include:\n- Daytime naps that do not relieve drowsiness\n- Difficulty waking from a long sleep may feel confused or disoriented\n- Increased need for sleep during the day even while at work, or during a meal or conversation\n- Increased sleep time up to 14 - 18 hours per day\n- Other symptoms may include anxiety, feeling irritated, low energy, restlessness, slow thinking or speech, loss of appetite, and memory difficulty.\n- Cataplexy: suddenly falling asleep or losing muscle control which is part of narcolepsy, is NOT a symptom of idiopathic hypersomnia.\n\n【4】 # What causes Hypersomnia?\n- The usual approach is to consider other potential causes of excessive daytime sleepiness.\n- Other sleep disorders that may cause daytime sleepiness include:\n- Isolated sleep paralysis\n- Narcolepsy\n- Obstructive sleep apnea\n- Restless leg syndrome\n- Other causes of excessive sleepiness include:\n- Atypical depression\n- Certain medications\n- Drug and alcohol use\n- Low thyroid function (hypothyroidism)\n- Previous head injury\n\n【5】 # Diagnosis\n- The health care provider will take a detailed sleep history. Tests may include:\n- Multiple sleep latency test\n- Sleep study (polysomnography, done to identify other sleep disorders)\n- A psychiatric evaluation for atypical depression may also be done.\n\n【6】 # Treatment options\n- Idiopathic hypersomnia is usually treated with stimulant medications such as amphetamine, methylphenidate, and modafinil.

{"seq_id": "e7c32345-62f2-4037-afeb-8d6f6914e274", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Niacin/Simvastatin clinical pharmacology\n\n【1】 # Clinical Pharmacology\n\n【2】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nA variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of Total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDL-C are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of Total-C and LDL-C, and inversely with the level of HDL-C.\nLike LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and their remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma TG are frequently found in a triad with low HDL-C levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with non-lipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.\n\n【3】 ### SIMCOR\nSIMCOR reduces Total-C, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, Apo B, TG, and Lp(a) levels and increases HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia, mixed dyslipidemia, or hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n【4】 ### Niacin\nNiacin (but not nicotinamide) in gram doses reduces LDL-C, Apo B, Lp(a), TG, and Total-C, and increases HDL-C. The magnitude of individual lipid and lipoprotein responses may be influenced by the severity and type of underlying lipid abnormality. The increase in HDL-C is associated with an increase in apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) and a shift in the distribution of HDL subfractions. These shifts include an increase in the HDL2:HDL3 ratio, and an elevation in lipoprotein A-I (Lp A-I, an HDL-C particle containing only Apo A-I). Niacin treatment also decreases serum levels of apolipoprotein B-100 (Apo B), the major protein component of the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions, and of Lp(a), a variant form of LDL independently associated with coronary risk. In addition, preliminary reports suggest that niacin causes favorable LDL particle size transformations, although the clinical relevance of this effect requires further investigation.\n\n【5】 ### Simvastatin\nSimvastatin reduces elevated Total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with primary heterozygous familial and nonfamilial hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Simvastatin reduces Total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Simvastatin decreases VLDL, Total-C/HDL-C ratio, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio.\n\n【6】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n\n【7】 ### Absorption and Bioavailability\nThe relative bioavailability of niacin (Nicotinuric acid, NUA, Cmax and total urinary excretion as the surrogate), simvastatin, and simvastatin acid was evaluated under a light snack conditions in healthy volunteers (n=42), following administration of two 1000/20 mg SIMCOR tablets. Niacin exposure (Cmax and AUC) after SIMCOR was similar to that of a niacin extended-release formulation. However, simvastatin and simvastatin acid AUC after SIMCOR increased by 23% and 41%, respectively, compared to those of a simvastatin immediate release formulation. The mean time to Cmax (Tmax) for niacin ranged from 4.6 to 4.9 hours and simvastatin from 1.9 to 2.0 hours. Following administration of 2 x 1000/20 mg SIMCOR, the mean Cmax, Tmax and AUC(0-t) for simvastatin acid, active metabolite of simvastatin, were 3.29 ng/mL, 6.56 hours and 30.81 /mL respectively.\nBioequivalence has not been evaluated among different SIMCOR dosage strengths except between 1000/40 and 500/20 mg. SIMCOR tablets 1000/40 mg and 500/20 mg were bioequivalent following a single dose of 2000/80 mg. Therefore, dosage strengths of SIMCOR should not be considered exchangeable except between these two strengths.\nDue to extensive and saturable first-pass metabolism, niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable. Peak steady-state niacin concentrations were 0.6, 4.9, and 15.5 mcg/mL after doses of 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg NIASPAN once daily (given as two 500 mg, two 750 mg, and two 1000 mg tablets, respectively). To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal upset, administration of niacin extended-release with a low-fat meal or snack is recommended.\nSince simvastatin undergoes extensive first-pass extraction in the liver, the availability of the drug to the general circulation is low (<5%). Peak plasma concentrations of both active and total inhibitors were attained within 1.3 to 2.4 hours postdose. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled simvastatin in man, plasma concentration of total radioactivity (simvastatin plus 14C-metabolites) peaked at 4 hours and declined rapidly to about 10% of peak by 12 hours postdose. Relative to the fasting state, the plasma profile of inhibitors was not affected when simvastatin was administered immediately before an American Heart Association recommended low-fat meal.\n\n【8】 ### Metabolism\nFollowing administration of SIMCOR, niacin and simvastatin undergo rapid and extensive first-pass metabolism as described in the following niacin and simvastatin sections. Following administration of 2 x 1000/20 mg SIMCOR in healthy volunteers, 10.2%, 10.7%, and 29.5% of the administered niacin dose was recovered in urine as niacin metabolites, NUA, N-methylnicotinamide (MNA), and N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY), respectively. Following administration of 2 x 1000/20 mg SIMCOR, the mean Cmax, Tmax, and AUC(0-t) for the simvastatin metabolite, simvastatin acid were 3.29 ng/mL, 6.56hours, and 30.81ng·hr/mL respectively.\nNiacin undergoes rapid and extensive first-pass metabolism that is dose-rate specific and, at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia, saturable. In humans, one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form NUA. NUA is then excreted, although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin. The other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to, or following the synthesis of, NAD. Nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least MNA and nicotinamide-N-oxide NNO. MNA is further metabolized to two other compounds, 2PY and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY). The formation of 2PY appears to predominate over 4PY in humans.\nSimvastatin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Simvastatin is a lactone that is readily hydrolyzed in vivo to the corresponding β-hydroxyacid, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. The major active metabolites of simvastatin present in human plasma are the β-hydroxyacid of simvastatin and its 6’-hydroxy, 6’-hydroxymethyl, and 6’-exomethylene derivatives.\n\n【9】 ### Elimination\nFollowing 2 x 1000/20 mg SIMCOR administration, approximately 54% of the niacin dose administered was recovered in urine in 96 hours as niacin and metabolites of which 3.6% was recovered as niacin.\nAfter SIMCOR administration, the mean terminal plasma half-life for simvastatin was 4.2 to 4.9 hours and for simvastatin acid was 4.6 to 5.0 hours.\nNiacin and its metabolites are rapidly eliminated in the urine. Following single and multiple doses of 1500 to 2000 mg niacin, approximately 53 to 77% of the niacin dose administered as NIASPAN was recovered in urine as niacin and metabolites; up to 7.7% of the dose was recovered in urine as unchanged niacin after multiple dosing with 2 x 1000 mg NIASPAN. The ratio of metabolites recovered in the urine was dependent on the dose administered.\nSimvastatin is excreted in urine, based on studies in humans. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled simvastatin in man, 13% of the dose was excreted in urine and 60% in feces.\n\n【10】 ### Special Populations\nA pharmacokinetic study with simvastatin showed the mean plasma level of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity to be approximately 45% higher in elderly patients between 70-78 years of age compared with patients between 18-30 years of age.\nSteady-state plasma concentrations of niacin and metabolites after administration of niacin extended-release are generally higher in women than in men, with the magnitude of the difference varying with dose and metabolite. Recovery of niacin and metabolites in urine, however, is generally similar for men and women, indicating that absorption is similar for both genders. The gender differences observed in plasma levels of niacin and its metabolites may be due to gender-specific differences in metabolic rate or volume of distribution.\nPharmacokinetic studies with a statin having a similar principal route of elimination to that of simvastatin have suggested that for a given dose level, higher systemic exposure may be achieved in patients with severe renal insufficiency (as measured by creatinine clearance).\n\n【11】 ### Drug Interaction\nEffect of other drugs on simvastatin:\n\n【12】 ### Simvastatin effect on other drugs\nIn a study of 12 healthy volunteers, simvastatin at the 80-mg dose had no effect on the metabolism of the probe cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates midazolam and erythromycin. This indicates that simvastatin is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, and, therefore, is not expected to affect the plasma levels of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.\nCoadministration of simvastatin (40 mg QD for 10 days) resulted in an increase in the maximum mean levels of cardioactive digoxin (given as a single 0.4 mg dose on day 10) by approximately 0.3 ng/mL.\n\n【13】 ### Niacin effect on other drugs\nNiacin did not affect fluvastatin pharmacokinetics.\nWhen NIASPAN 2000 mg and lovastatin 40 mg were co-administered, NIASPAN increased lovastatin Cmax and AUC by 2% and 14%, respectively, and decreased lovastatin acid Cmax and AUC by 22% and 2%, respectively. Lovastatin reduced NIASPAN bioavailability by 2-3%.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b5e52a04-e29c-4f44-8a00-f40784daf8cf", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Phosphoric acids and phosphates\nOf the many phosphorus oxoacids, the phosphoric acids constitute the largest and most diverse group. The simplest phosphoric acid series begins with monophosphoric (orthophosphoric) acid, continues with many oligophosphoric acids such as diphosphoric (pyrophosphoric) acid and concludes in the polyphorphoric acids. But phosphoric acid units can bind together into rings or cyclic structures, chains (catenas), or branched structures, with various combinations possible. Each of these can form phosphates (salts or esters).\nPhosphorus can be further oxidized while in the +5 state to paraphosphoric acid (H5PO5). Occasionally oxygen can be replaced by sulfur to form thiophosphoric acids. When the acid contains one more oxygen (+7 state for phosphorus) than phosphoric acid, it is called perphosphoric acid.\nWhen commercially produced for fertilizers, a blend of phosphoric acids is used and termed superphosphoric acid. Further concentrating of phosphoric acid results in hyperphosphoric acid.\n\n【1】 # Orthophosphoric acid\nThe simplest compound of a series of phosphoric acids is sometimes called by its common name, orthophosphoric acid, but more often called by its IUPAC name, simply phosphoric acid, by both non-technical people and even many chemists. It has also been called monophosphoric acid.  The chemical formula of orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4 and its chemical structure is labeled in the illustration.  There is a separate article on this most important compound in the series at: Phosphoric acid.  However, two or more orthophosphoric acid molecules can be joined by condensation into larger molecules by elimination of water.  This way, a series of polyphosphoric acids can be obtained.\n- orthophosphoric acidH3PO4\n- pyrophosphoric acidH4P2O7\n- tripolyphosphoric acidH5P3O10\n- trimetaphosphoric acidH3P3O9\n- phosphoric anhydrideP4O10\n\n【2】 # Orthophosphate\nOrthophosphoric acid has three hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen atoms in its structure.  All three hydrogens are acidic to varying degrees and can be lost from the molecule as H+ ions (alternatively referred to as protons).  When all three H+ ions are lost from orthophosphoric acid, an orthophosphate ion (PO43-) is formed.  Orthophosphate is the simplest in a series of phosphates, and is usually just called phosphate by both non-technical people and many chemists alike; see a separate article on phosphate for details.\nBecause orthophosphoric acid can undergo as many as three dissociations or ionizations (losses of H+ ions),  H2PO41-, dihydrogen phosphate ion, HPO42-, hydrogen phosphate ion, and PO43-, phosphate ion, it has three acid dissociation constants called Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3.  Another way to provide acid dissociation constant data is to list pKa1, pKa2, and pKa3 instead.  Orthophosphate is in a sense the triple conjugate base of phosphoric acid and has three related basicity constants, Kb1, Kb2, and Kb3, which likewise have corresponding pKb1, pKb2, and pKb3 values.\n\n【3】 # Oligophosphoric acids\nWhen two orthophosphoric acid molecules are condensed into one molecule, pyrophosphoric acid (H4P2O7) is obtained as follows:\nThe chemical structure of pyrophosphoric acid is also shown in the illustration.  There is also a separate article on Pyrophosphoric acid.  Three orthophosphoric acid molecules can condense in a row to obtain tripolyphosphoric acid (H5P3O10), which is also shown in the illustration and has a separate article: Triphosphoric acid.  This condensation process can continue with additional orthophosphoric acid units to obtain tetrapolyphosphoric acid (H6P4O13, pictured) and so on.  Note that each extra phosphoric unit adds 1 extra H (hydrogen) atom, 1 extra P (phosphorus) atom, and 3 extra O (oxygen) atoms.  The \"backbone\" chain of these types of molecules consists of alternating P and O atoms covalently bonded together. The term oligophosphoric acid refers to this series of phosphoric acids when a small number of phosphoric acids are joined, per the general formula Hn+2PnO3n+1, if n = 3, 4, 5, etc., oligo-. Alternately, the above series follows the naming pattern of di- (pyrophosphoric), tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexaphosphoric acid, etc.\n\n【4】 # Oligophosphates\nIn a pyrophosphoric acid molecule, there are four hydrogens bonded to oxygens, and one, two, three, or all four can be lost as H+ ions.  When all four are lost from pyrophosphoric acid, a pyrophosphate ion is formed.   Because pyrophosphoric acids can undergo four dissociations, there are four Ka values for it, as well as four corresponding pKa values.  Similarly, pyrophosphate is a base with four Kb and, of course, four pKb values for regaining the H+ ions in reverse order.\nThe situation with higher order oligophosphoric acids and oligophosphates continues in a similar way.  Tripolyphosphoric acid can lose up to five H+ ions to form a tripolyphosphate ion, tetrapolyphosphoric acid can lose up to six H+ ions to form tetrapolyphosphate, etc.  As more dissociations per molecule are possible, the intervals between individual pKa and pKb values now start becoming smaller on the pH scale.\nOrtho-, pyro-, and tripolyphosphate compounds have been commonly used in detergents (i. e. cleaners) formulations.  For example, see Sodium tripolyphosphate.  Sometimes pyrophosphate, tripolyphosphate, tetrapolyphosphate, etc. are called diphosphate, triphosphate, tetraphosphate, etc., especially when they are part of phosphate esters in biochemistry.\n\n【5】 # Polyphosphoric acids\nWhen n is very large, the polymer is polyphosphoric acid. Polyphosphoric acid molecules can have dozens of such phosphoric units bonded in a row.  A general formula for such poly-acid compounds is HO(PO2OH)xH, where x = number of phosphoric units in the molecule. The four oxygen atoms bonded to each phosphorus atom are in a tetrahedral configuration with the phosphorus in the center of the tetrahedron and the oxygens in each of the four corners.\n\n【6】 # Polyphosphates\nAs the polyphosphoric molecules grow increasingly larger and more complex, practically any number of the somewhat acidic -OH groups in them can dissociate to become negatively charged oxygens, forming numerous combinations of multiple-charged polyphosphoric/polyphosphate anions.  Generally in an aqueous solution, the degree or percentage of dissociation depends on the pH of the solution.\n\n【7】 # Cyclo- or metaphosphoric acids and metaphosphates\n\n【8】 When these metaphosphoric acids lose their hydrogens as H+, cyclic anions called metaphosphates are formed.  An example of a compound with such an anion is sodium hexametaphosphate (Na6P6O18) used as a sequestrant and a food additive.\n\n【9】 # Branched polyphosphates\nThe third -OH group on an orthophosphoric acid unit can also be used for condensation with other phosphoric groups to form branches in the polyphosphoric/polyphosphate chains.  The ultimate example of cyclic and branching condensation would be the cyclic four-phosphate unit double-branched to form the phosphoric anhydride P4O10; see illustration. Polyphosphoric acids that are also branched can be referred to as ultraphosphoric acid or ultrapolyphosphoric acid.\n\n【10】 # Paraphosphoric acid\nParaphosphoric acid (H5PO5) is obtained by burning phosphorus in dry air, or oxygen gas, appears in small crystals, like snow, and is formed, combined with water, by heating to redness pyrophosphoric and phosphoric acids; when fused, it cools into a brittle and transparent solid, resembling ice. Paraphosphoric acid has phosphorus in the formal oxidation state of +5. It occurs as P(OH)5, CID 517655 with IUPAC name pentahydroxyphosphorane.\n\n【11】 # Thiophosphoric acid\nThiophosphoric acids have one or more oxygens replaced by sulfur\n\n【12】 # Perphosphoric acid\nThe use of per before the phosphoric indicates that the acid contains one more oxygen than phosphoric acid. For example, permonophosphoric acid has the formula H3PO5 instead of H3PO4 for orthophosphoric acid (monophosphoric acid).\nPermonophosphoric acid is an acid formed when pyrophosphoric acid is treated with a large excess of hydrogen peroxide.\nH4P2O7 + 2H2O2  2H3PO5 + H2O\nPermonophosphoric acid 114 Da is a triprotic acid, yielding PO53- (permonophosphate ion) with its H+s removed. The preparation of permonophosphoric acid, H3PO5, was obtained by J. Schmidlin and P. Massini (Ber., 1910, 43, 1162). Monoperphosphoric acid can be obtained when phosphorus pentoxide is treated with 30 % hydrogen peroxide, while cooled with ice-water. But there are other forms of H3PO5.\nWhen two oxygens are linked as in hydrogen peroxide, the permonophosphoric acid formed is peroxomonophosphoric acid (PMPA), (OH)2O=P-O-O-H, H3PO5. PMPA can be prepared by the perchloric acid hydrolysis of potassium peroxodiphosphate. The species H3PO5, H2PO5-, HPO52-, and PO53- become predominant in this order with increasing pH and the electrophilic character of these species decreases. PMPA exists as H2PO5- and HPO52- in the pH range 4-7.\nMonoperphosphoric acid and permonophosphoric acid are the same acid. Should the phosphoric acid be either an oligophosphoric acid or polyphosphoric acid as discussed below, the location of per may indicate different acids. For instance, perdiphosphoric acid would be H4P2O8, one more oxygen added to pyrophosphoric acid. But diperphosphoric acid could \n\n【13】 # Perphosphates\nPerphosphates have been produced from perphosphoric acid.\n\n【14】 # Superphosphoric acid\nSuperphosphoric acid is a blend of orthophosphoric and polyphosphoric acid, CAS Number 8017-16-1. Superphosphoric acids can be in the concentration range of 62-85% P2O5 (86-117% H3PO4), but at about 90% H3PO4 the amount of condensed phosphate species becomes significant. The concentration range of the superphosphoric acids is a range of increasing importance in fertilizer technology.\nSuperphosphoric acid is sometimes called multiphosphoric acid or polyphosphoric acid.\n\n【15】 # Superphosphates\nSuperphosphates (salts or esters) can result from the use of superphosphoric acid. Superphosphate has been produced by acidulating phosphate rock with superphosphoric acid, where the superphosphoric acid contained about 49% of its phosphate as orthophosphate, 42% as pyrophosphate, and the remainder as polyphosphates.\n\n【16】 # Hyperphosphoric acid\nHyperphosphoric acid is concentrated phosphoric acid. It can be prepared in two ways by:\n producing phosphorus pentoxide electrothermically and dissolving this oxide in a small quantity of water or\n concentrating phosphoric acid obtained by wet treatment with hot gas at temperatures above 700°C.\nIt has also been called oleophosphoric acid.\nThe first process produces hyperphosphoric acid of high purity and concentration but is very expensive. The second process produces a cheaper acid but introduces several impurities, among which are fluorine and sulphuric acid, and various metals, e.g. aluminium and iron. The metallic impurities exist as complexes in the form of polyphosphoric salts.\nHyperphosphoric acid can be added to blood to release CO2.\n\n【17】 # Hyperphosphates\nHyperphosphates (salts or esters) or oleophosphates can result from the use of hyperphosphoric acid. Hyperphosphate, when used to induce hyperphosphatemia, may directly promote calcium deposition and osteocalcin expression.\n\n【18】 # Hydrolysis of polyphosphoric/polyphosphates\nThese phosphoric acids series are generally water-soluble considering the polarity of the molecules.  Ammonium and alkali phosphates are also quite soluble in water.  The alkaline earth salts start becoming less soluble and phosphate salts of various other metals are even less soluble.  In aqueous solutions (solutions of water), water gradually (over the course of hours) hydrolyzes polyphosphates into smaller phosphates and finally into ortho-phosphate, given enough water.   Higher temperature or acidic conditions can speed up the hydrolysis reactions considerably.\nConversely, polyphosphoric acids or polyphosphates are often formed by dehydrating a phosphoric acid solution; in other words, removing water from it often by heating and evaporating the water off.\n\n【19】 # Phosphate and phosphite esters", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

As the name implies, TBI involves irradiation of the entire body, though in modern practice the lungs are often partially shielded to lower the risk of radiation-induced lung injury. Total body irradiation in the setting of bone marrow transplantation serves to destroy or suppress the recipient's immune system, preventing immunologic rejection of transplanted donor bone marrow or blood stem cells. Additionally, high doses of total body irradiation can eradicate residual cancer cells in the transplant recipient, increasing the likelihood that the transplant will be successful.\n\n【1】 In modern practice, total body irradiation is typically fractionated. That is, the radiation is delivered in multiple small doses rather than one large dose. Early research in bone marrow transplantation by E. Donnall Thomas and colleagues demonstrated that this process of splitting TBI into multiple smaller doses resulted in lower toxicity and better outcomes than delivering a single, large dose.\nIn addition to its use in bone marrow transplantation, total body irradiation has been explored as a treatment modality for high-risk Ewing sarcoma. However, subsequent findings suggest that TBI in this setting causes toxicity without improving disease control, and TBI is not currently used in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma outside of clinical trials.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Common adverse reactions include Abdominal Pain (gynecological), Headache, Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome, Vaginal Bleeding.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【5】 ### Indications\n- Ganirelix Acetate Injection is indicated for the inhibition of premature LH surges in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation.\n\n【6】 ### Dosage\n- After initiating FSH therapy on Day 2 or 3 of the cycle, Ganirelix Acetate Injection 250 mcg may be administered subcutaneously once daily during the mid to late portion of the follicular phase. By taking advantage of endogenous pituitary FSH secretion, the requirement for exogenously administered FSH may be reduced. Treatment with Ganirelix Acetate should be continued daily until the day of hCG administration. When a sufficient number of follicles of adequate size are present, as assessed by ultrasound, final maturation of follicles is induced by administering hCG. The administration of hCG should be withheld in cases where the ovaries are abnormally enlarged on the last day of FSH therapy to reduce the chance of developing OHSS (Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome).\n\n【7】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【8】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Ganirelix in adult patients.\n\n【9】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Ganirelix in adult patients.\n\n【10】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【11】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Ganirelix in pediatric patients.\n\n【12】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【13】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Ganirelix in pediatric patients.\n\n【14】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Ganirelix in pediatric patients.\n\n【15】 # Contraindications\n- Ganirelix Acetate Injection is contraindicated under the following conditions:\n- Known hypersensitivity to Ganirelix Acetate or to any of its components.\n- Known hypersensitivity to GnRH or any other GnRH analog.\n- Known or suspected pregnancy\n\n【16】 # Warnings\n- Ganirelix Acetate Injection should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in infertility treatment.

In the absence of clinical experience, Ganirelix Acetate treatment is not advised in women with severe allergic conditions.\n- The packaging of this product contains natural rubber latex which may cause allergic reactions.\n- Prior to therapy with Ganirelix Acetate Injection, patients should be informed of the duration of treatment and monitoring procedures that will be required. The risk of possible adverse reactions should be discussed.\n- Ganirelix Acetate should not be prescribed if the patient is pregnant.\n- A neutrophil count ≥ 8.3 ( x 109/L) was noted in 11.9% (up to 16.8 x 109/L) of all subjects treated within the adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. In addition, downward shifts within the Ganirelix Acetate Injection group were observed for hematocrit and total bilirubin. The clinical significance of these findings was not determined.\n\n【18】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【19】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The safety of Ganirelix Acetate Injection was evaluated in two randomized, parallel-group, multicenter controlled clinical studies.\n- Ongoing clinical follow-up studies of 283 newborns of women administered Ganirelix Acetate Injection were reviewed. There were three neonates with major congenital anomalies and 18 neonates with minor congenital anomalies. The major congenital anomalies were: hydrocephalus/meningocele, omphalocele, and Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome. The minor congenital anomalies were: nevus, skin tags, sacral sinus, hemangioma, torticollis/asymmetric skull, talipes, supernumerary digit finger, hip subluxation, torticollis/high palate, occiput/abnormal hand crease, hernia umbilicalis, hernia inguinalis, hydrocele, undescended testis, and hydronephrosis. The causal relationship between these congenital anomalies and Ganirelix Acetate is unknown. Multiple factors, genetic and others (including, but not limited to ICSI, IVF, gonadotropins, progesterone) may confound ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) procedures.\n\n【20】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactoid reactions, have been reported, as early as with the first dose\n\n【21】 # Drug Interactions\n- No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed.\n\n【22】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【23】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): X\n- Ganirelix Acetate Injection is contraindicated in pregnant women. When administered from Day 7 to near term to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 10 and 30 mcg/day (approximately 0.4 to 3.2 times the human dose based on body surface area), Ganirelix Acetate increased the incidence of litter resorption. There was no increase in fetal abnormalities. No treatment-related changes in fertility, physical, or behavioral characteristics were observed in the offspring of female rats treated with Ganirelix Acetate during pregnancy and lactation.\n- The effects on fetal resorption are logical consequences of the alteration in hormonal levels brought about by the antigonadotropic properties of this drug and could result in fetal loss in humans. Therefore, this drug should not be used in pregnant women\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Ganirelix in women who are pregnant.\n\n【24】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Ganirelix during labor and delivery.\n\n【25】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Ganirelix Acetate Injection should not be used by lactating women. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.\n\n【26】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ganirelix with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【27】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies with Ganirelix Acetate Injection did not include a sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over.\n\n【28】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ganirelix with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【29】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ganirelix with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【30】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ganirelix in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【31】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ganirelix in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【32】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Ganirelix in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【33】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Ganirelix in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【34】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【35】 ### Administration\n- Ganirelix Acetate Injection is supplied in a sterile, prefilled syringe and is intended for SUBCUTANEOUS administration only.\n- Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n- The most convenient sites for SUBCUTANEOUS injection are in the abdomen around the navel or upper thigh.\n- The injection site should be swabbed with a disinfectant to remove any surface bacteria. Clean about two inches around the point where the needle will be inserted and let the disinfectant dry for at least one minute before proceeding.\n- With syringe held upward, remove needle cover.\n- Pinch up a large area of skin between the finger and thumb. Vary the injection site a little with each injection.\n- The needle should be inserted at the base of the pinched-up skin at an angle of 45–90° to the skin surface.\n- When the needle is correctly positioned, it will be difficult to draw back on the plunger. If any blood is drawn into the syringe, the needle tip has penetrated a vein or artery. If this happens, withdraw the needle slightly and reposition the needle without removing it from the skin. Alternatively, remove the needle and use a new, sterile, prefilled syringe. Cover the injection site with a swab containing disinfectant and apply pressure; the site should stop bleeding within one or two minutes.\n- Once the needle is correctly placed, depress the plunger slowly and steadily, so the solution is correctly injected and the skin is not damaged.\n- Pull the syringe out quickly and apply pressure to the site with a swab containing disinfectant.\n- Use the sterile, prefilled syringe only once and dispose of it properly.\n\n【36】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Ganirelix in the drug label.\n\n【37】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Ganirelix in the drug label.\n\n【38】 # Overdosage\n- There have been no reports of overdosage with Ganirelix Acetate Injection in humans.\n\n【39】 # Pharmacology\n\n【40】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- The pulsatile release of GnRH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The frequency of LH pulses in the mid and late follicular phase is approximately 1 pulse per hour. These pulses can be detected as transient rises in serum LH. At midcycle, a large increase in GnRH release results in an LH surge. The midcycle LH surge initiates several physiologic actions including: ovulation, resumption of meiosis in the oocyte, and luteinization. Luteinization results in a rise in serum progesterone with an accompanying decrease in estradiol levels.\n- Ganirelix Acetate acts by competitively blocking the GnRH receptors on the pituitary gonadotroph and subsequent transduction pathway. It induces a rapid, reversible suppression of gonadotropin secretion. The suppression of pituitary LH secretion by Ganirelix Acetate is more pronounced than that of FSH. An initial release of endogenous gonadotropins has not been detected with Ganirelix Acetate, which is consistent with an antagonist effect. Upon discontinuation of Ganirelix Acetate, pituitary LH and FSH levels are fully recovered within 48 hours.\n\n【41】 ## Structure\n- Ganirelix Acetate Injection is a synthetic decapeptide with high antagonistic activity against naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Ganirelix Acetate is derived from native GnRH with substitutions of amino acids at positions 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10 to form the following molecular formula of the peptide: N-acetyl-3-(2-naphthyl)-D-alanyl-4-chloro-D-phenylalanyl-3-(3-pyridyl)-D-alanyl-L-seryl-L-tyrosyl-N9,N10-diethyl-D-homoarginyl-L-leucyl-N9,N10-diethyl-L-homoarginyl-L-prolyl-D-alanylamide acetate. The molecular weight for Ganirelix Acetate is 1570.4 as an anhydrous free base. The structural formula is as follows:\nGanirelix Acetate\n- Ganirelix Acetate Injection is supplied as a colorless, sterile, ready-to-use, aqueous solution intended for SUBCUTANEOUS administration only. Each sterile, prefilled syringe contains 250 mcg/0.5 mL of Ganirelix Acetate, 0.1 mg glacial acetic acid, 23.5 mg mannitol, and water for injection adjusted to pH 5.0 with acetic acid, NF and/or sodium hydroxide, NF.\n\n【42】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Ganirelix in the drug label.\n\n【43】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- The pharmacokinetic parameters of single and multiple injections of Ganirelix Acetate Injection in healthy adult females are summarized in Table I. Steady-state serum concentrations are reached after 3 days of treatment. The pharmacokinetics of Ganirelix Acetate are dose-proportional in the dose range of 125 to 500 mcg.\n- Ganirelix Acetate is rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous injection with maximum serum concentrations reached approximately one hour after dosing. The mean absolute bioavailability of Ganirelix Acetate following a single 250 mcg subcutaneous injection to healthy female volunteers is 91.1%.\n- The mean (SD) volume of distribution of Ganirelix Acetate in healthy females following intravenous administration of a single 250-mcg dose is 43.7 (11.4) liters (L). In vitro protein binding to human plasma is 81.9%.\n- Following single-dose intravenous administration of radiolabeled Ganirelix Acetate to healthy female volunteers, Ganirelix Acetate is the major compound present in the plasma (50–70% of total radioactivity in the plasma) up to 4 hours and urine (17.1–18.4% of administered dose) up to 24 hours. Ganirelix Acetate is not found in the feces. The 1–4 peptide and 1–6 peptide of Ganirelix Acetate are the primary metabolites observed in the feces.\n- On average, 97.2% of the total radiolabeled Ganirelix Acetate dose is recovered in the feces and urine (75.1% and 22.1%, respectively) over 288 h following intravenous single dose administration of 1 mg -Ganirelix Acetate. Urinary excretion is virtually complete in 24 h, whereas fecal excretion starts to plateau 192 h after dosing.\n- The pharmacokinetics of Ganirelix Acetate Injection have not been determined in special populations such as geriatric, pediatric, renally impaired and hepatically impaired patients.\n- Formal in vivo or in vitro drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted . Since Ganirelix Acetate can suppress the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins, dose adjustments of exogenous gonadotropins may be necessary when used during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH).\n\n【44】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Long-term toxicity studies in animals have not been performed with Ganirelix Acetate Injection to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of the drug. Ganirelix Acetate did not induce a mutagenic response in the Ames test (S. typhimurium and E. coli) or produce chromosomal aberrations in in vitro assay using Chinese Hamster Ovary cells.\n\n【45】 # Clinical Studies\n- The efficacy of Ganirelix Acetate Injection was established in two adequate and well-controlled clinical studies which included women with normal endocrine and pelvic ultrasound parameters. The studies intended to exclude subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and subjects with low or no ovarian reserve. One cycle of study medication was administered to each randomized subject. For both studies, the administration of exogenous recombinant FSH  150 IU daily was initiated on the morning of Day 2 or 3 of a natural menstrual cycle. Ganirelix Acetate Injection was administered on the morning of Day 7 or 8 (Day 6 of recombinant FSH administration). The dose of recombinant FSH administered was adjusted according to individual responses starting on the day of initiation of Ganirelix Acetate. Both recombinant FSH and Ganirelix Acetate were continued daily until at least three follicles were 17 mm or greater in diameter at which time hCG  was administered. Following hCG administration, Ganirelix Acetate and recombinant FSH administration were discontinued. Oocyte retrieval, followed by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), was subsequently performed.\n- In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, dose-finding study, the safety and efficacy of Ganirelix Acetate Injection were evaluated for the prevention of LH surges in women undergoing COH with recombinant FSH.\n- Transient LH rises alone were not deleterious to achieving pregnancy with Ganirelix Acetate at doses of 125 mcg (3/6 subjects) and 250 mcg (1/1 subjects). In addition, none of the subjects with LH rises ≥ 10 mIU/mL had premature luteinization indicated by a serum progesterone above 2 ng/mL.\n- A multicenter, open-label, randomized study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Ganirelix Acetate Injection in women undergoing COH.\n- The mean number of days of Ganirelix Acetate treatment was 5.4 (2–14).\n- The midcycle LH surge initiates several physiologic actions including: ovulation, resumption of meiosis in the oocyte, and luteinization. In 463 subjects administered Ganirelix Acetate Injection 250 mcg, a premature LH surge prior to hCG administration, (LH rise ≥ 10 mIU/mL with a significant rise in serum progesterone > 2 ng/mL, or a significant decline in serum estradiol) occurred in less than 1% of subjects.\n\n【46】 # How Supplied\n- Ganirelix Acetate Injection is supplied in:\n- Disposable, sterile, ready for use, prefilled 1 mL glass syringes containing 250 mcg/0.5 mL aqueous solution of Ganirelix Acetate closed with a rubber piston that does not contain latex. Each Ganirelix Acetate sterile, prefilled syringe is affixed with a 27 gauge × ½-inch needle closed by a needle shield of natural rubber latex and is blister-packed.\n\n【47】 ## Storage\n- Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15–30°C (59–86°F) .

In some animals, known as ruminants, this is a natural and healthy part of digestion and is not considered an eating disorder. However, in other species (including humans), such behavior is atypical and potentially dangerous as the esophagus can be damaged by frequent exposure to stomach acids.  Rumination is also associated with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, and can be the result of one's apprehension and nervousness after eating a normal meal. For those with purging behaviors, rumination can take place when the option of getting rid of a meal via throwing up is not available (thus, one might feel worried and visibly upset).  Rumination has also been reported in developmentally normal children and adults who experience regurgitation of previously swallowed food, without disgust, nausea or an acidic taste.

{"seq_id": "951d326f-5945-4a29-8840-214b8c73a334", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Nivolumab with chemotherapy for neoadjuvant treatment of resectable non-small-cell lung cancer\n\n【1】 Evidence-based recommendations on nivolumab (Opdivo) with chemotherapy for neoadjuvant treatment of resectable non-small-cell lung cancer in adults.\n\n【2】 # Recommendations\nNivolumab with chemotherapy is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for the neoadjuvant treatment of resectable (tumours at least 4 cm or node positive) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults. It is only recommended if the company provides it according to the commercial arrangement.\nWhy the committee made this recommendation\nStandard care for NSCLC that can be surgically removed (resectable) is surgery. Sometimes chemoradiotherapy before (neoadjuvant) or chemotherapy after (adjuvant) surgery is also used.\nThere is no clinical trial evidence directly comparing neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy with standard care but an indirect comparison suggests it is more effective.\nThe cost-effectiveness estimates for neoadjuvant nivolumab with chemotherapy compared with standard care are within the range NICE normally considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. So, neoadjuvant nivolumab with chemotherapy is recommended.# Information about nivolumab with chemotherapy\n\n【3】 # Marketing authorisation indication\nNivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb) with chemotherapy is indicated for 'the neoadjuvant treatment of resectable (tumours ≥ 4 cm or node positive) non-small cell lung cancer in adults'.\n\n【4】 # Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for nivolumab.\n\n【5】 The list price for nivolumab is £439.00 for a (10 mg/ml) 4‑ml vial (excluding VAT; BNF online, accessed January 2023).\nThe company has a commercial arrangement. This makes nivolumab available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the company's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# Committee discussion\n\n【6】 # The condition\n\n【7】 ## Unmet need\nStandard care for resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is surgical resection. Treatment options in addition to surgery are limited. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered with the aim of improving long-term outcomes. Some people choose not to have adjuvant chemotherapy because of the associated serious adverse events and some may not be fit enough to tolerate it after surgery. The patient organisation submission highlighted that the 5‑year survival rate after surgical resection with curative intent is about 50%, with relapses in distant sites. It explained that symptoms of recurrent NSCLC, such as breathlessness, cough and weight loss, are often difficult to manage without active treatment. It also highlighted that neoadjuvant treatment is well established in other cancers, such as breast cancer, as a promising approach for prolonging survival and increasing the chance of cure for people with potentially resectable NSCLC. A professional organisation submission highlighted that NSCLC has a very poor prognosis in the UK. It explained that only a small proportion of people have NSCLC that can be cured at an early stage and a substantial proportion have recurrence. So, it is important that new treatment options are made available to ensure the best chance of cure. This submission noted that nivolumab plus chemotherapy increases the potential of good outcomes for the small proportion of people who have potentially curable NSCLC. There are limited treatment options for resectable NSCLC after surgery, and outcomes with available treatments are poor. Also, there is a need for a new treatment option, particularly in the neoadjuvant setting. The committee concluded that there is an unmet need for treatments for resectable NSCLC, and neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy would be welcomed.\n\n【8】 ## Comparators\nIn its submission, the company compared neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, surgery alone and adjuvant chemotherapy. The company highlighted that surgery alone represents the active monitoring comparator as per the NICE scope. It further explained that, in its economic model, people in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy arm had chemotherapy plus radiotherapy then surgery. Some people had adjuvant treatment. In the surgery alone arm, people had surgery and did not have neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment, but had monitoring after surgery. In the adjuvant chemotherapy arm people had surgery and a subsequent course of chemotherapy. The EAG noted that the comparators included in the company's economic evaluation were in line with the NICE scope and representative of NHS clinical practice. The committee concluded that the comparators included in the company submission were appropriate.\n\n【9】 # Clinical effectiveness\n\n【10】 ## CheckMate-816 trial evidence\nThe clinical-effectiveness evidence for neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy came from CheckMate‑816. This is an ongoing phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label, clinical trial. It is comparing neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone in adults with resectable stage 1B to 3A NSCLC. In the interim analysis 1 (October 2021), there was a median follow up of 29.5 months. Results from this analysis showed that neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy improved event-free and overall survival. They also showed that the odds of pathological complete response were higher compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. The EAG highlighted that its clinical advice suggested that NSCLC disease stage is the main prognostic factor. It did subgroup analyses for disease stage, which showed that neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy was less effective for stage 1B to 2 NSCLC than for stage 3 NSCLC. The result was less precise for stage 1B to 2 NSCLC, indicating that the analysis was underpowered. The EAG noted that more people in CheckMate‑816 had cisplatin-based chemotherapy than carboplatin-based chemotherapy, consistent with clinical advice it had received. But clinical advice also suggested carboplatin-based chemotherapy could be paired with nivolumab. Clinical advice to the EAG further suggested that cisplatin plus vinorelbine would be the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen in the UK. But this combination was only used in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone arm of CheckMate‑816. The EAG considered that, when assessed in the overall population, neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy is more effective for stage 1B to 3A resectable NSCLC compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. It also thought that, although neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy may be less effective for the stage 1B to 2 NSCLC subgroup (compared with the stage 3A NSCLC subgroup), its effectiveness in the overall resectable stage 1B to 3A NSCLC population is more relevant. The committee concluded that neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy is more effective for stage 1B to 3A resectable NSCLC compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone.\n\n【11】 ## CheckMate-816 generalisability\nThe EAG noted that CheckMate‑816 has not recruited anyone from the UK, and that about 50% of people in the study had an Asian family background. So, it considered that generalisability of the trial to NHS clinical practice is questionable. The EAG also noted that the characteristics of the North American and European family background subgroups from CheckMate‑816 may be more applicable to NHS clinical practice. The EAG's subgroup analyses by family background showed that neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy was less effective in the North American and European populations compared with the Asian population. In CheckMate‑816, 59.1% of people in the neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy arm and 63.0% of people in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone arm had thoracotomy. Also, 16.8% of people in the neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy arm and 25.2% in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone arm had pneumonectomy. But clinical advice to the EAG suggested that minimally invasive surgery is more common in NHS clinical practice. In CheckMate‑816 only 29.5% of people in the neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy arm and 21.5% in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone arm had minimally invasive surgery. Clinical advice to the EAG also suggested that pneumonectomy is now very uncommon for NSCLC resection in NHS clinical practice. So, the EAG considered that the main resection types used in CheckMate‑816 may not reflect NHS clinical practice. But it is unclear if resection type is associated with different recurrence rates and health-related quality of life. The EAG considered that all other baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms in CheckMate‑816. The committee acknowledged that there were differences in demographics between the trial and NHS clinical practice, and noted that neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy is less effective in some subgroups. But it considered that the trial is likely representative of NHS clinical practice and that most baseline characteristics between the CheckMate‑816 treatment arms were well balanced. So, the committee concluded that clinical evidence from CheckMate‑816 was uncertain but suitable for decision making.\n\n【12】 ## Indirect comparison\nThere was no evidence directly comparing neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, surgery alone or adjuvant chemotherapy. So, the company presented an indirect treatment comparison informed by network meta-analyses. These provided comparative effectiveness evidence for neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy compared with all the relevant comparators and neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. The primary outcomes assessed in the network meta-analyses were event-free survival and overall survival. The secondary outcomes assessed were time to locoregional recurrence (TTLR), time to distant metastasis, pathological complete response and safety. The results of the network meta-analyses showed that neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy was more effective at improving survival outcomes compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, surgery alone and adjuvant chemotherapy. Results for secondary outcomes were considered confidential by the company, so cannot be reported here. The EAG noted that some studies in the network meta-analyses only included people with an Asian family background, while about 50% of people in CheckMate‑816 had an Asian family background. Also, it noted that, although its clinical advice suggested disease stage is the main prognostic factor, only CheckMate‑816 included stage 1B to 3A NSCLC. Subgroup analyses conducted by the EAG contained data that the company considered confidential, so cannot be reported here. Despite the differences between the studies included in the network meta-analyses, it was considered that the company had sufficiently responded to the EAG's requests at the clarification stage to explore these uncertainties. It was also decided that little more could be done to further address the uncertainties. So, the network meta-analyses were deemed sufficient, and the results considered acceptable for decision making. Because the marketing authorisation for nivolumab plus chemotherapy is not restricted by disease stage, the results of the network meta-analyses for neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy for the overall resectable stage 1B to 3A NSCLC population were considered appropriate. The committee concluded that neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy is more effective than all the relevant comparators.\n\n【13】 ## Survival extrapolation\nThe parametric models used to extrapolate time to any progression (TTaP) and TTLR beyond CheckMate‑816 follow up played an important role in determining the efficacy of the intervention. There is considerable uncertainty around the extrapolation of the TTaP and TTLR curves. The company's and EAG's approaches to modelling long-term TTLR and event-free mortality was uncertain. But both were considered plausible and produced cost-effectiveness estimates that were well below NICE's cost-effectiveness threshold. The committee concluded that the optimal approach to modelling survival was uncertain.\n\n【14】 # Economic model\n\n【15】 ## Model structure\nThe company presented a 4‑state semi-Markov model to estimate the cost effectiveness of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, surgery alone and adjuvant chemotherapy. The 4 health states were event-free, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis and death. The model used a lifetime horizon and a cycle length of 3 weeks. The model assumed distant metastasis was an absorbing state and applied a one-off cost, and life-year and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) pay-off upon transitions to the distant metastasis health state. Utility values in the locoregional recurrence state were assumed to be lower than in the event-free state and lower still in the distant metastasis state. A short-term disutility was included to reflect grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events associated with adjuvant treatment during the first cycle of the model. The EAG noted the model structure was consistent with previous economic models for lung cancer. It considered the approach to modelling the distant metastasis state was pragmatic, reduced the complexity of the model and was consistent with previous NICE technology appraisals for lung cancer. The committee concluded that the company's model was appropriate based on the available evidence for this appraisal.\n\n【16】 ## Cure assumption\nIn its economic model, the company applied a 'cure assumption'. The EAG considered that there was no convincing clinical evidence to support how the cure assumption had been modelled. It was noted that there is generally a consensus among clinical experts that cure occurs between years 5 and 8. But there is no consensus on the rates of cure, and the empirical evidence to support this assumption is lacking. The company's and the EAG's scenario analysis removing the cure assumption only had a small effect on the cost-effectiveness results. The committee concluded that the cure assumption applied was uncertain.\n\n【17】 ## Utility values\nThe health-state utility values used in the cost-effectiveness model were associated with a degree of uncertainty. This was mainly because the utility values for both the event-free and locoregional recurrence health states were higher than what would be expected in a population with NSCLC. Other minor issues included:\nusing overall rather than treatment-specific utilities from CheckMate‑816\nusing linear mixed models when analysing non-linear EQ‑5D‑3L data\nthe age-sex adjustment process implemented in the model.But these issues would be difficult to resolve given the lack of evidence. The EAG presented 4 scenarios to explore this uncertainty. The committee concluded that, given the available evidence, the uncertainty had been sufficiently explored.\n\n【18】 ## Retreatment restrictions\nIn its model, the company applied immuno-oncology therapy retreatment restrictions for people who had neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy as their initial treatment and whose NSCLC progressed within 6 months. These people were not considered eligible for further immuno-oncology treatment. Data from CheckMate‑816 was used to adjust the distribution of treatment in the distant metastasis health state to account for the proportion of people in the neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy arm who had an event while on treatment. So, these people were not eligible for further treatment with immuno-oncology therapy for 6 months, and their treatments were redistributed across the remaining treatment options. The EAG considered there was uncertainty in the proportion of people ineligible for retreatment with immuno-oncology therapy and the timelines of these restrictions. But it noted that the company had done a scenario analysis with retreatment restriction extended to 12 months, and that the percentage of those not considered for further immuno-oncology retreatment was increased. A further scenario analysis was done by both the company and the EAG in which the retreatment restriction was not included. The EAG did additional scenario analyses by assuming the distribution of chemotherapies in the distant metastasis health state were the same for immuno-oncology and non-immuno-oncology treatments. It was noted that further evidence on the distribution of chemotherapies used for immuno-oncology and non-immuno-oncology treatments in the distant metastasis health state would help address this uncertainty. The committee concluded that the application of retreatment restrictions in the economic model was uncertain.\n\n【19】 # Cost-effectiveness estimates\n\n【20】 ## Results\nWhen commercial arrangements for nivolumab plus chemotherapy and all the comparators were included, the company's and EAG's base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, surgery alone and adjuvant chemotherapy were all below £20,000 per QALY gained. The exact ICERs are considered confidential and cannot be reported here. Outstanding areas of uncertainty were considered, including:\nlong-term survival modelling beyond CheckMate‑816 trial follow up \napplication of a cure assumption \nutility values for event-free and locoregional recurrence health states \napplication of retreatment restrictions .The committee considered that key uncertainties had been explored sufficiently by both the company and EAG. It noted that almost all of the ICERs remained within the range that is normally considered by NICE as a cost-effective use of NHS resources. So, the likelihood of decision error in this appraisal was assessed to be minimal. The committee concluded that neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy for neoadjuvant treatment of resectable NSCLC is likely to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources.\n\n【21】 # Other factors\n\n【22】 ## Equality issues\nNo equality issues were identified. NICE's advice about conditions with a high degree of severity did not apply.\n\n【23】 ## Innovation\nIt was considered whether neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy is innovative. No additional benefits of nivolumab plus chemotherapy were identified that were not captured in the economic modelling. So, the committee concluded that all additional benefits of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy had already been taken into account.\n\n【24】 # Conclusion\n\n【25】 ## Recommendation\nAll the ICERs considered were in the range normally considered by NICE to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources. So, nivolumab plus chemotherapy is recommended for the neoadjuvant treatment of resectable NSCLC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "b77c9aa9-fc0b-402e-8345-f56bde1307b3", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Bitter melon\nMomordica charantia is a tropical and subtropical vine of the family Cucurbitaceae, widely grown for edible fruit, which is among the most bitter of all vegetables.  English names for the plant and its fruit include bitter melon or bitter gourd (translated from Template:Zh-cp). The original home of the species is not known, other than that it is a native of the tropics. It is widely grown in India (Karela करेला in Hindi), Pakistan (Karela کریلا in Urdu, اردو),(komboze کمبوزه in Persian), South Asia, Southeast Asia, China, Africa and the Caribbean.\n\n【1】 # Description\nAlso known as Ku gua, the herbaceous, tendril-bearing vine grows to 5 m.  It bears simple, alternate leaves 4-12 cm across, with 3-7 deeply separated lobes.  Each plant bears separate yellow male and female flowers.\n\n【2】 Bitter Gourd comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. The typical Chinese phenotype is 20 to 30 cm long, oblong with bluntly tapering ends and pale green in color, with a gently undulating, warty surface.  The bitter melon more typical of India has a narrower shape with pointed ends, and a surface covered with jagged, triangular \"teeth\" and ridges. Coloration is green or white. Between these two extremes are any number of intermediate forms. Some bear miniature fruit of only 6 - 10 cm in length, which may be served individually as stuffed vegetables. These miniature fruit are popular in Southeast Asia as well as India.\n\n【3】 # Culinary uses\nBitter melons are seldom mixed with other vegetables due to the strong bitter taste, although this can be moderated to some extent by salting and then washing the cut melon before use.\nBitter melon is often used in Chinese cooking for its bitter flavor, typically in stir-fries (often with pork and douchi), soups, and also as tea.\nIt is also a popular vegetable in Indian cooking, where it is often prepared with potatoes and served with yogurt on the side to offset the bitterness, or used in sabji. Bitter melon fried in oil and then stuffed with other spicy ingredients is very popular in Andhra Pradesh, a south Indian state.\nBitter melon is rarely used in mainland Japan, but is a significant component of Okinawan cuisine.\nIn Indonesia, bitter melon is prepared in various dishes, such as stir fry, cooked in coconut milk, or steamed.\nIn Vietnam, raw bitter melon slices consumed with dried meat floss and bitter melon soup with shrimp are popular dishes.\nIt is prepared into various dishes in the Philippines, where it is known as ampalaya. Ampalaya may also be stir-fried with ground beef and oyster sauce, or with eggs and diced tomato. A very popular dish from the Ilocos region of the Philippines, pinakbet, consists mainly of bitter melons, eggplant, okra, string beans, tomatoes, lima beans, and other various regional vegetables stewed with a little bagoong-based stock.\nThe young shoots and leaves may also be eaten as greens; in the Philippines, where bitter melon leaves are most commonly consumed, they are called dahon (leaves) ng ampalaya.  The seeds can also be eaten, and give off a sweet taste, but have been known to cause vomiting and stomach upset.\nIn Nepal bitter melon is prepared in various ways. Most prepare it as fresh achar(kind of salsa). For this the bitter gourd is cut into cubes or slices and sauted covered in little bit of oil and sprikle of water. When it is softened and water dries out, it is minced in tradition mortar with few cloves of garlic, salt and red or green pepper. Other way is the sauted version. In this, bitter gourd is cut in thin round slices or cubes fried(sauted) with very less oil with some salt, cumin and red chilli. It is fried until the vegetable softens and with hints of golden brown on the sides.  It is even prepared as a curry on its own or with with potato and made as stuffed vegetables.\nIn Pakistan bitter melon is available in the summertime and is cooked mostly with lots of onions. A traditional way to cook bitter melon curry is, to peel off the skin and cut into thin slices. Then it is salted and kept under the sun for few hours to reduce its bitterness to some extent. After few hours, its salty and bitter water is squeezed out (by pressing with the hands) and then bitter melon is washed with water for few times. The bitter melon is fried in cooking oil in a separate pan whereas lots of onions are fried in another pan. When onions are turned little pink in color, the fried bitter melon is added to them. After some frying both the onions and bitter melon, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, salt, coriander powder and a pinch of cumin seeds are added. Now little water is sprinkled while frying the spices. Then a good amount of tomatoes is added to the curry and also the green chillies are added if one likes to. Now the pan is covered with a lid and heat is reduced to minimum so the tomatoes get tender and all spices could work their magic. The curry is stirred or fried for few times (at intervals) during this covering period. After half an hour or before, the curry is ready to serve. It is served with soft and hot flat breads (chappatis, چپاتی) and yogurt chutney.\nAnother dish in Pakistan calls for whole, un peeled bitter melon to be boiled and then stuffed with cooked ground beef. In this dish, it is recommended that the bitter melon be left 'de-bittered'. It is either served with hot tandoori bread, naan, chappati, or with khichri (a mixture of lentils and rice).\n\n【4】 # Medicinal uses\nBitter melons have been used in various Asian traditional medicine systems for a long time . Like most bitter-tasting foods, bitter melon stimulates digestion. While this can be helpful in people with sluggish digestion, dyspepsia, and constipation, it can sometimes make heartburn and ulcers worse. The fact that bitter melon is also a demulcent and at least mild inflammation modulator, however, means that it rarely does have these negative effects, based on clinical experience and traditional reports.\nThough it has been claimed that bitter melon’s bitterness comes from quinine, no evidence could be located supporting this claim. Bitter melon is traditionally regarded by Asians, as well as Panamanians and Colombians, as useful for preventing and treating malaria. Laboratory studies have confirmed that various species of bitter melon have anti-malarial activity, though human studies have not yet been published .\nLaboratory tests suggest that compounds in bitter melon might be effective for treating HIV infection . As most compounds isolated from bitter melon that impact HIV have either been proteins or glycoproteins lectins, neither of which are well-absorbed, it is unlikely that oral intake of bitter melon will slow HIV in infected people. It is possible oral ingestion of bitter melon could offset negative effects of anti-HIV drugs, if a test tube study can be shown to be true in people . In one preliminary clinical trial, an enema form of a bitter melon extract showed some benefits in people infected with HIV (Zhang 1992). Clearly more research is necessary before this could be recommended.\nThe other realm showing the most promise related to bitter melon is as an immunomodulator. One clinical trial found very limited evidence that bitter melon might improve immune cell function in people with cancer, but this needs to be verified and amplified in other research . If proven correct this is another way bitter melon could help people infected with HIV.\nSome claim bitter melon as \"a cure for diabetes\", although outside of anecdotal stories there is limited scientific evidence for this claim\n\n【5】 # Names in other languages\nAustronesian languages\n- Chavacano:amargozo\n- Ilocano: pariya\n- Malay and Indonesian: peria, pare, or parai\n- Tagalog:ampalaya\nDravidian languages\n- Kannada: hāgala kāyi\n- Malayalam: kaipakka or pavakkya\n- Tamil: pākaRkāi or pavakka\n- Telugu: kākara kāyi\n- Tulu: kānchaal\nIndic languages\n- Bengali: করল্লা kôrolla\n- Bishnupriya Manipuri: কারল karol\n- Gujarati: કારેલું kāreluṃ\n- Hindi/Urdu: करेला کریلا karelā\n- Marathi: कारले karla\n- Konkani: kārate\n- Punjabi: karaila\n- Sinhalese: karawila\n- Trinidad Hindi: karailī\nJaponic languages\n- Japanese: nigauri Template:Nihongo, tsurureishi Template:Nihongo, usually gōya Template:Nihongo\n- Okinawan: gōyā\nSino-Tibetan languages\n- Mandarin: 苦瓜 kǔ guā\n- Taiwanese (Min Nan): 苦瓜 ko guai'\n- Burmese: kyethinkhathee\nOther languages\n- Arabic: Hanzal\n- Portuguese: melão-de-são-caetano\n- Thai:  มะระจีน marajin or มะระ mara\n- Vietnamese: khổ qua\n- Nepali: tito karela\n- Korean : 여주\ntamil    : pagarkai\n\n【6】 # Trivia\n- A \"bitter Gourd face\" (苦瓜臉) is a common Chinese description for a serious or sad face.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

NACI also recommended the continued application of the existing decision -making framework for booster doses. NACI approved these recommendations on January 06, 2023. Further information on NACI's process and procedures is available elsewhere  .# Preamble\nThe National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is an External Advisory Body that provides the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) with independent, ongoing and timely medical, scientific, and public health advice in response to questions from PHAC relating to immunization.\nIn addition to burden of disease and vaccine characteristics, PHAC has expanded the mandate of NACI to include the systematic consideration of programmatic factors in developing evidence based recommendations to facilitate timely decision-making for publicly funded vaccine programs at provincial and territorial levels.\nThe additional factors to be systematically considered by NACI include: economics, ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability. Not all NACI statements will require in-depth analyses of all programmatic factors. While systematic consideration of programmatic factors will be cond ucted using evidence-informed tools to identify distinct issues that could impact decision -making for recommendation development, only distinct issues identified as being specific to the vaccine or vaccine-preventable disease will be included.\nThis statement contains NACI's independent advice and recommendations, which are based upon the best current available scientific knowledge. This document is being disseminated for information purposes. People administering the vaccine should also be aware of the con tents of the relevant product monograph. Recommendations for use and other information set out herein may differ from that set out in the product monographs of the Canadian manufacturers of the vaccines.

The epidemiology of COVID-19 is expected to continue to evolve, and the likelihood, timing, and severity of any potential future resurgence of COVID-19 is uncertain. No strong evidence of seasonality of COVID-19 has emerged to date, and it has yet to be seen whether the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections will be analogous to other respiratory viruses that increase in the fall and winter seasons, thereby increasing pressure on health systems during this period.\nSince September 2021, NACI has been developing and updating guidance on the use of COVID-19 booster doses based on a decision-making framework assessing the need for, and benefit of, additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines in various populations. These decisions were supported by vaccine principles, as well as evidence where available.\nThe NACI Interim guidance on planning considerations for a fall 2022 COVID-19 vaccine booster program in Canada (June 29, 2022) provided jurisdictions with planning advice for a booster dose program in advance of a possible future surge of COVID-19 in Canada over the fall and winter months and included an updated decision-making framework on booster doses. More specific guidance on vaccination recommendations for the fall of 2022, including booster doses in children 5 to 11 years of age and the use of bivalent Omicron-containing mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, was provided in the following NACI statements: Since then, additional NACI guidance has been requested as provinces and territories begin to consider planning for 2023.\nNACI's recommendations remain aligned with the current goals of the Canadian COVID-19 Pandemic Response (as of February 14, 2022):\n- To minimize serious illness and death while minimizing societal disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. - To transition away from the crisis phase towards a more sustainable approach to long term management of COVID-19.\nFor further information on NACI's recommendations on the use of COVID-19 vaccines, please \n- Previous waves of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada have occurred over the spring, summer, fall and winter months, with some regional variability. The evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2, including the emergence of novel variants of concern (VOCs), is uncertain, and the seasonality of SARS-CoV-2 has not been established. - COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths continue to occur at a higher baseline frequency since the appearance of Omicron in late 2021 compared to the pre-Omicron period. - Some populations are at increased risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19 due to biological factors (e.g., advanced age, pre-existing medical conditions, pregnancy) and social factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, belonging to a racialized population) that may intersect. However, age continues to be the single greatest risk factor for severe outcomes of COVID-19. Older adults are the most likely to experience severe disease, with hospitalizations, ICU admissions and death rates highest in those 80 years of age and over, and ICU admission rates also high in those 70 to 79 years of age . - Previously dominant BA.5.2 and BA.5.2.1 Omicron sublineages are decreasing, with more immune-evasive sublineages increasing (e.g., BQ.1, BQ.1.1 and BF.7).\n\n【2】 # Duration of protection from booster doses against severe outcomes due to COVID-19\n- Thus far, vaccine protection has been shown to wane over time, with protection against severe outcomes persisting longer than protection against symptomatic disease. - For BA.1 and BA.2 sublineages of Omicron, the duration of protection against severe disease such as hospitalization has remained high, with most estimates above 70% out to 26 weeks following receipt of an original (non-bivalent) COVID-19 vaccine booster dose  . - Duration of protection against severe disease for more recent variants and new vaccine formulations is not known at this time and continues to be monitored.\n- When vaccine programs are implemented, data on duration of protection from the vaccine are often lacking and it is with ongoing monitoring that we determine whether and how often booster doses are required for the population (e.g., booster doses for pertussis in adolescents and adults and no booster doses for either HPV or hepatitis B vaccines).\n\n【3】 # Hybrid immunity\n- Evidence to date shows that vaccine effectiveness (VE) against BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron sublineages is higher in those who have been both vaccinated and infected with SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., in those who have hybrid immunity to SARS-CoV-2) when compared to those with prior infection alone or vaccination alone  . The duration of protection from hybrid immunity has not yet been fully characterized, but is likely to have an impact on the need for and timing of additional booster doses. - In Canada, the hybrid immunity profile differs by age group. A greater proportion of older adults are protected by vaccination only and have not been infected, as compared to younger ages. Adolescents and young adults have the highest proportion of hybrid immunity, and a large proportion of children have been infected but not vaccinated  . - Potential vaccination-and/or infection-induced protection against severe outcomes due to infection or reinfection from emerging Omicron sublineages have yet to be determined and the impact of various immunity profiles on protection against future VOCs is unknown. - There are Canadian data suggesting that vaccine protection may reach a plateau for adults with hybrid immunity, and the benefit of additional mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster doses may be marginal  . This study assessed VE of the original mRNA COVID-19 vaccine against BA.2 among healthcare workers, and whether the findings would apply broadly to other COVID-19 vaccines (i.e., Omicron-containing bivalent mRNA vaccines), other VOCs, and populations has yet to be determined.\n\n【4】 # Immunogenicity and VE of booster doses of Omicron-containing bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine\n- Clinical trials show that a booster dose of Omicron-containing bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine produce higher neutralizing antibody responses against Omicron sublineages than the original vaccines, although preliminary results from small real-world studies have been somewhat variable. The immune response against the ancestral strain is similar after a booster dose of the original or Omicron-containing bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. - Neutralization of more recent Omicron sublineages such as BQ.1 is reduced compared to neutralization of earlier Omicron sublineages such as BA.1 or BA.5 after booster vaccination with either an original or Omicron-containing bivalent vaccine  . - Preliminary data from Ontario demonstrates that short-term (<90 days) VE against severe outcomes in community dwelling adults aged 50 years and older was similar between original and bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster doses and between the available vaccine products (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech) during a period when BA.5 was the predominant Omicron sublineage and BQ.1 was emerging  . - A study from the United States in adults who had received at least 2 doses of an original mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reported improved VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection after a subsequent booster dose of BA.4/5 bivalent mRNA vaccine compared to adults who did not receive a bivalent Omicron-containing mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  . The relative increase in VE was also larger for individuals with a longer interval since receipt of their previous original dose. A similar trend was observed for protection against COVID-19-associated emergency department/urgent care encounters and hospitalizations  .\n- Early estimates of VE against hospitalization in immunocompetent adults 65 years of age and older from the United States, reported that a booster dose using a BA.4/5 bivalent Omicron-containing mRNA vaccine provided an additional 73% protection against COVID-19 hospitalization compared with past vaccination with original mRNA COVID-19 vaccines only (≥2 doses given ≥2 months previously)  . As original mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are no longer authorized for use in the United States, the effectiveness of bivalent versus original vaccines when used as booster doses in the same time period could not be compared. Of note, the VE studies from the United States were released following NACI deliberations and were not considered as part of decision-making  .\n\n【5】 # Ethics, equity, feasibility and acceptability\n- Although age is the greatest risk factor for severe outcomes of COVID-19, intersecting equity factors continue to create disproportionate risk for some key populations. Any future booster program should continue to support reducing the impact on those at highest risk of severe disease. - For all currently vaccine-eligible age-groups (i.e., 6 months of age and older), concurrent administration of any dose of a COVID-19 vaccine with other vaccines (e.g., seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine) has the potential to increase program efficiency and may also increase immunization rates. - There may be variability in how each province, territory and community assesses risk and responds to the needs of their respective jurisdictions, with a focus on protecting those at highest risk for serious outcomes from COVID-19 infection.\n\n【6】 # Recommendations\nAt this time, NACI is reinforcing existing recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines including suggested timing of doses following a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nIt is noted that the start date of the fall 2022 booster program varied across Canadian jurisdictions from August to September 2022.\nPlease see Table 2 for an explanation of strong versus discretionary NACI recommendations.\n\n【7】 # NACI continues to recommend a COVID-19 vaccine primary series as follows:\n1 Individuals 5 years of age and older should be immunized with a primary series of an authorized mRNA vaccine. (Strong NACI recommendation)\n2 Children 6 months to under 5 years of age may be immunized with a primary series of an authorized mRNA vaccine. (Discretionary NACI recommendation)\nAdditional details including those pertaining to alternative vaccine products are available in the COVID-19 vaccine chapter in the Canadian Immunization Guide and NACI statements and publications.\n\n【8】 # NACI continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccine booster doses as follows:\n3 - The first booster dose program for children 5 to 11 years of age coincided with the fall booster dose campaign that targeted individuals 12 years of age and older. Children 5 to 11 years of age are recommended to receive only one booster dose at this time. However, at the provider's discretion, an additional booster dose using the bivalent vaccine (as per the recommended interval -see recommendation #7) could be offered to children considered at high risk of severe COVID-19 who have previously received a fall booster dose with the original Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine. At least one booster dose continues to be recommended for all adults 18 years of age and over.\nRegardless of previous booster doses, a booster since the start of fall 2022 should be offered as per the recommended interval b if not already received.\n\n【9】 # Adults 18 to 64 years of age\n\n【10】 # Should be offered c\nThose at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:\nAt least one booster dose continues to be recommended for all adults 18 years of age and over.\nRegardless of previous booster doses, a booster since the start of fall 2022 should be offered as per the recommended interval b if not already received.\n\n【11】 # Those NOT at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:\nAt least one booster dose continues to be recommended for all adults 18 years of age and over.\nA booster since the start of fall 2022 may be offered as per the recommended interval b if not already received.\n\n【12】 # Adolescents 12 to 17 years of age Should be offered c\nThose at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:\nAt least one booster dose continues to be recommended for adolescents 12 to 17 years of age who are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.\nRegardless of previous booster doses, a booster since the start of fall 2022 should be offered as per the recommended interval b if not already received d .\n\n【13】 # Those NOT at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:\nA booster since the start of fall 2022 may be offered as per the recommended interval b if not already received.\nChildren 5 to 11 years of age Should be offered c\n\n【14】 # Those at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:\nA booster since the start of fall 2022 should be offered as per the recommended interval b if not already received d .\n\n【15】 # Those NOT at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:\nA booster since the start of fall 2022 may be offered as per the recommended interval b if not already received.\n\n【16】 # Children 6 months to less than 5 years of age\nMay be offered c No authorized product; not recommended a. Bivalent Omicron-containing products are preferred for booster doses for the authorized ages. b. The recommended interval between the previous COVID-19 vaccine dose (previous booster or completion of the primary series) and a booster dose is 6 months, and between infection and a booster dose is 6 months (whichever is longer). A shorter interval of at least 3 months may be considered in the context of heightened epidemiologic risk, evolving SARS-COV-2 epidemiology, as well as operational considerations for efficient deployment. c.\nThose who are moderately to severely immunocompromised are recommended to receive an additional dose in the primary series. Additional details are available in the COVID-19 vaccine chapter in the Canadian Immunization Guide and NACI statements and publications.\n\n【17】 # Considerations regarding potential future booster programs and planning\nWith the inherent uncertainties around the evolution of the pandemic, it is unclear when the need for additional COVID-19 vaccine booster doses will arise, or to whom booster doses should be offered in the event that they are needed. NACI will continue to monitor the evidence, including SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and duration of vaccine protection, particularly with regard to severe outcomes, in the coming months to provide recommendations on the timing of subsequent booster doses if warranted. Product options for booster doses could include additional vaccines as they become available.\nThere are a number of options for the timing of possible future booster doses if additional booster doses are required, and these include the following:\n- Offer additional booster doses at a fixed interval from the previous booster dose - Offer additional booster doses at fixed time(s) of year - Offer additional booster doses based on evolving epidemiology - Some combination of the above In addition to monitoring epidemiology, duration of protection from current booster doses and previous infection, safety, immunogenicity, and vaccine effectiveness of bivalent Omicroncontaining vaccines or alternative vaccine products, future booster dose decisions should consider ethics, equity, and acceptability of future booster dose recommendations in addition to feasibility considerations of delivering booster dose campaigns. NACI acknowledges that significant preparations occur every year for the seasonal influenza campaign and will endeavour to provide further advice to inform the potential integration of COVID-19 immunization in advance of the fall of 2023.\n\n【18】 # RESEARCH PRIORITIES\n- Continuous monitoring of data on the safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including booster doses, through clinical trials and studies in realworld settings, including the degree and duration of protection conferred by each booster dose against circulating variants. The research should also consider the clinical implications of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection; repeated immunization; and outcomes after any infection such as MIS-C, post-COVID-19 condition/post-acute COVID syndrome (long COVID), or infection-induced myocarditis or pericarditis in adult, adolescent, and pediatric populations. 2. Further evaluations of the optimal interval between dose administration, as well as further evaluations of the optimal interval between previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine dose administration. 3. Vigilant monitoring and reporting of adverse events of special interest, including myocarditis and/or pericarditis, in order to accurately inform potential risks associated with any future booster doses. Global collaboration should be prioritized to enable dat a sharing so decision makers around the world can weigh benefits and risks of additional booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines. 4. Continuous monitoring of COVID-19 epidemiology and VE in special populations at high risk of severe outcomes or long-term consequences of infection with COVID-19. 5. Further evaluation on the optimal timing and trigger for the initiation of potential future booster dose recommendations, as well as evaluation of potential risks associated with providing booster doses earlier than necessary. 6. Continuous monitoring of vaccine coverage in Canada, for COVID-19 vaccines and other routine vaccines, particularly in the context of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses and including consideration of measures that may reduce the risk of disparities in vaccine confidence and uptake across different sub-populations.\n\n【19】 # Implication\nA strong recommendation applies to most populations/individuals and should be followed unless a clear and compelling rationale f or an alternative approach is present.\nA discretionary recommendation may be considered for some populations/individuals in some circumstances.

But the most likely estimates are within what NICE considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. Therefore, daratumumab is recommended for routine use.# Information about daratumumab\n\n【3】 # Marketing authorisation indication\nDaratumumab (Darzalex, Janssen) has a marketing authorisation as a monotherapy for 'the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy'.\n\n【4】 # Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedules for both injection and infusion are available in the summary of product characteristics for daratumumab.\n\n【5】 The list prices of daratumumab (excluding VAT; BNF online, accessed January 2022) are:\n£4,320 per 1,800 mg/15 ml solution for injection vial\n£360 per 100 mg/5 ml concentrate for solution for infusion vial\nThe company has a commercial arrangement. This makes daratumumab available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the company's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# Committee discussion\n\n【6】 This review looks at data collected in the Cancer Drugs Fund to address uncertainties identified during the original appraisal. Further information about the original appraisal is in the committee papers. As a condition of the Cancer Drugs Fund funding and the managed access arrangement, the company was required to collect updated efficacy data from the MMY2002 study for people with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In addition, data was collected on the use of daratumumab monotherapy in the NHS through the Cancer Drugs Fund using the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) dataset.\n\n【7】 # The condition\n\n【8】 ## Daratumumab is a highly valued treatment option for people with multiple myeloma\nMultiple myeloma is a chronic condition that affects survival and quality of life. When deciding which treatments to use, response to previous treatments and toxicity are important, so having a range of treatment options is desirable. The Cancer Drugs Fund clinical lead reported that since daratumumab monotherapy was made available through the Cancer Drugs Fund, it has become a preferred fourth-line treatment. Patient experts explained that people with multiple myeloma are anxious about the possibility of their disease relapsing. However, they also reported that there are several new multiple myeloma drugs in development, and so any treatment that offered an extension to life offered hope, because it meant it may bridge getting onto a new trial, or perhaps make it possible to access a new treatment that would become available in the future. The patient and clinical experts stated that daratumumab has a favourable toxicity profile, which not only results in an increased quality of life, but also means that people are more likely to be well enough for more options later in the treatment pathway. They also stressed the importance of quality of life after multiple lines of therapy, because the adverse effects of treatments can build up over time. The committee recognised the need for effective, well-tolerated treatment options for people with multiple myeloma who have had previous therapies.\n\n【9】 # Treatment pathway\n\n【10】 ## The treatment pathway for multiple myeloma is rapidly evolving\nTreatment options for multiple myeloma depend on how many previous lines of treatment a person has had, the type of treatments they have had, the response to these treatments, and patient preferences.For someone with a new diagnosis of multiple myeloma, if a stem cell transplant is suitable, available options are:\nInduction with bortezomib and dexamethasone with or without thalidomide (NICE's technology appraisal guidance on bortezomib for induction therapy) given before the stem cell transplant, followed by maintenance treatment with lenalidomide (lenalidomide maintenance treatment).\nInduction with daratumumab plus bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (daratumumab in combination for untreated multiple myeloma when a stem cell transplant is suitable) before the stem cell transplant. If daratumumab plus bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone is used as induction treatment, then it is also recommended as consolidation treatment after the transplant. Lenalidomide maintenance treatment is recommended after consolidation, or directly after the transplant if bortezomib and dexamethasone (with or without thalidomide) is used as induction treatment (lenalidomide maintenance treatment).If a stem cell transplant is not suitable:For untreated disease, treatments include thalidomide or bortezomib plus an alkylating agent, for example, melphalan or cyclophosphamide, and a corticosteroid, for example, dexamethasone (bortezomib and thalidomide for the first‑line treatment of multiple myeloma). Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is also an option when thalidomide is not appropriate (lenalidomide plus dexamethasone for previously untreated multiple myeloma).After 1 previous line of treatment, the following options are available regardless of transplant eligibility:\nLenalidomide with dexamethasone (lenalidomide plus dexamethasone for multiple myeloma after 1 treatment with bortezomib), carfilzomib with dexamethasone (carfilzomib for previously treated multiple myeloma), carfilzomib with dexamethasone and lenalidomide if the person has had bortezomib before (carfilzomib with dexamethasone and lenalidomide for previously treated multiple myeloma) or bortezomib may be used again (bortezomib monotherapy for relapsed multiple myeloma); however, treatment is only continued in people whose condition has a complete or partial response. Also, daratumumab plus bortezomib and dexamethasone is available in the Cancer Drugs Fund (daratumumab with bortezomib and dexamethasone for previously treated multiple myeloma).Treatment options at further relapse are influenced by the choice of initial treatment. The following options are available regardless of transplant eligibility:\nAfter 2 previous lines of treatment, options include lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (lenalidomide for the treatment of multiple myeloma in people who have received at least 2 prior therapies) or panobinostat plus bortezomib and dexamethasone (panobinostat for treating multiple myeloma after at least 2 previous treatments). Also, ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone is available in the Cancer Drugs Fund (ixazomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma).\nAfter 3 previous lines of treatment, options include pomalidomide plus dexamethasone (pomalidomide for multiple myeloma previously treated with lenalidomide and bortezomib), and panobinostat plus bortezomib and dexamethasone (panobinostat for treating multiple myeloma after at least 2 previous treatments). Also available through the Cancer Drugs Fund are ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (ixazomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma) and isatuximab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone (isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for treating relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma).Daratumumab monotherapy can be used whether or not people have had a stem cell transplant. The Cancer Drugs Fund clinical lead explained that, following the publication of NICE's technology appraisal guidance on isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for treating relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, the use of fourth-line daratumumab monotherapy has decreased, but there is an important cohort of people still receiving this treatment. The recent NICE technology appraisal guidance on daratumumab plus bortezomib plus thalidomide and dexamethasone as first-line treatment when a stem cell transplant is suitable may further decrease the need for fourth-line daratumumab. The committee understood that the multiple myeloma pathway is rapidly evolving.\n\n【11】 # Comparators\n\n【12】 ## After 3 previous lines of treatment, pomalidomide plus dexamethasone is the only relevant comparator\nThe committee recalled that treatments recommended in the Cancer Drugs Fund  are not considered to be comparators because they are not available in routine practice. NICE guidance recommends both pomalidomide plus dexamethasone and panobinostat plus bortezomib and dexamethasone after 3 previous lines of treatment for multiple myeloma. NICE's final scope for this appraisal lists these as the comparators. The company did provide analyses for both comparators to comply with the scope, but stated that it did not consider panobinostat plus bortezomib and dexamethasone to be a relevant comparator. It explained that this was because of toxic adverse effects and the lack of perceived efficacy noted by clinicians it consulted, which means it is usually used after 4 previous lines of treatment. The ERG's clinical advisers agreed with the company's position. The clinical expert at the meeting explained that daratumumab monotherapy or pomalidomide plus dexamethasone are the most commonly used options after 3 previous lines of treatment. They stated that panobinostat plus bortezomib and dexamethasone is rarely used after 3 previous lines of treatment because of toxicity and perceived poor clinical efficacy. The Cancer Drugs Fund clinical lead explained that clinicians can now offer bortezomib without having to use it with panobinostat, and that few clinicians offer panobinostat plus bortezomib and dexamethasone after 3 previous lines of treatment. The committee concluded that after 3 previous lines of treatment, pomalidomide plus dexamethasone is the only relevant comparator.\n\n【13】 # Clinical evidence\n\n【14】 ## The clinical trial evidence for daratumumab monotherapy does not include any head-to-head evidence\nThe key clinical study was MMY2002, a completed phase‑2 study investigating different doses of daratumumab (n=106). It included people with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who had had at least 3 previous lines of treatment (including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulators) or whose condition was refractory to both a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulator. There was no comparator. The primary outcome was overall response rate. Overall survival and progression-free survival were among the secondary outcomes. In the original appraisal, people in MMY2002 had been followed up for a median of 20.7 months. At the time, median progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% confidence interval  2.8 to 4.6) and median overall survival was 18.6 months (95% CI 13.7 to not reached). Since the original appraisal, people in MMY2002 have been followed up for a median of 36.7 months. The company considers the updated progression-free survival and overall survival data to be confidential, so it cannot be reported here. The committee concluded that the longer follow-up data was similar to that which it had seen previously, but that it would p\n\n【15】 ## In the absence of comparative data, the SACT dataset provides useful evidence\nThrough the Cancer Drugs Fund, SACT data was collected from people having fourth-line daratumumab monotherapy for multiple myeloma. Between 17 January 2018 and 16 November 2020, 2,301 people had daratumumab, with a median age of 71 years. Most people had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 (20%) or 1 (41%). Less than half of people had previously had a stem cell transplant (44%). Compared with participants in MMY2002, people were older, and lower proportions had an ECOG score of 0, had a previous stem cell transplant, and went on to have subsequent therapy. People in MMY2002 were able to receive carfilzomib as a subsequent therapy, which did not reflect UK clinical practice or the SACT dataset. The committee considered that the SACT dataset provided useful information and represented people who would receive daratumumab in NHS clinical practice. The committee discussed the results from MMY2002 and the SACT dataset and concluded that they were similar, with any differences explained by the characteristics of the participants and subsequent therapies received.\n\n【16】 ## The company did a matching-adjusted indirect comparison to compare daratumumab with the comparators\nTo compare daratumumab with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone and with panobinostat plus bortezomib and dexamethasone in the absence of a common comparator (an 'anchor'), the company presented 'unanchored' matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs). Specifically, it adjusted individual patient-level characteristics in the MMY2002 population to match the published study-level summary characteristics of patients in the comparator trials (1 of 2 arms of the MM‑003 trial for pomalidomide plus dexamethasone, and the single-arm trial PANORAMA‑2 for panobinostat plus bortezomib and dexamethasone).\n\n【17】 ## The SACT trial data is preferred over the single-arm trial data\nThe committee discussed the company's approach to matching. It understood that the company presented a partially adjusted MAIC adjusting for the characteristics it considered important in predicting progression and death based on best practice, published evidence and expert opinion. For pomalidomide plus dexamethasone, 5 characteristics were chosen and adjusted. The company stated that this was necessary to maintain a large enough sample size to use for the analysis. The ERG disagreed with company's approach, referencing NICE technical support document 18 which states that, when only single-arm trial data is available, all the characteristics that could influence the outcomes of interest should be adjusted, that is, a fully adjusted MAIC should be done. Because of this, the ERG considered a fully adjusted MAIC to be methodologically superior to the company's partially adjusted MAIC. However, a fully adjusted MAIC gave implausible survival extrapolations for daratumumab, so the ERG also did a naive comparison of daratumumab against data from MM‑003 for pomalidomide with dexamethasone using the SACT data. The company disagreed with this approach, considering it fairer to compare trial data with trial data, rather than real-world evidence with trial data. The committee acknowledged that neither approach was methodologically sound. It discussed several alternatives that may have been useful. One would be an MAIC using a few key characteristics such as age and sex, using the SACT data for daratumumab; however, the Cancer Drugs Fund clinical lead explained this would be difficult because the SACT data is rather crude, so only a few characteristics would be available to be matched on. Another would be collecting real-world data on pomalidomide and dexamethasone from the SACT data from when daratumumab entered the Cancer Drugs Fund, but this was not available. Although the committee noted neither of the presented comparisons were ideal, it preferred to use the SACT data because the usual benefit of trial data is that it is comparative. However, in this instance, the data from MMY2002, which compared 2 different doses of daratumumab, provided no head-to-head evidence of the effectiveness of daratumumab with a relevant comparator. As such, the committee preferred the data from SACT, which had both a larger sample size and reflected UK clinical practice.\n\n【18】 ## Daratumumab likely increases overall survival, but not progression-free survival compared with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, but this is uncertain\nIn the fully adjusted and partially adjusted MAICs, daratumumab showed no difference in progression-free survival compared with pomalidomide with dexamethasone. In the partially adjusted MAIC preferred by the company, daratumumab provided an improvement in overall survival compared with pomalidomide with dexamethasone. In the naive comparison with SACT data preferred by the ERG, the point estimate indicated that daratumumab resulted in improved overall survival, but this was not statistically significant. The committee asked the clinical expert about the plausibility of seeing overall survival gains without progression-free survival gains. The clinical expert explained that in MMY2002, a significant proportion of people had no response to daratumumab, which in part explains why there was no difference in progression-free survival between daratumumab and pomalidomide plus dexamethasone. Additionally, as discussed in section 3.1, given the favourable tolerability and reduced toxicity of daratumumab, people may go on to receive further treatments later in the pathway, which may impact overall survival. The committee was satisfied with this explanation and agreed it was possible that daratumumab is associated with overall survival gains without providing progression-free survival gains.\n\n【19】 ## The overall survival benefit seen in the naive comparison is generalisable to NHS clinical practice\nSeveral therapies are available if the cancer comes back after daratumumab . The company's submission included several data sources on subsequent treatments, including data from the MMY2002 and MM‑003 trials and the SACT dataset. The ERG expressed concerns about the overall survival data from MMY2002 because people in this trial could have several treatments not available in the NHS, including carfilzomib. The clinical expert agreed that several treatments given after daratumumab in MMY2002 did not reflect UK clinical practice. The evidence for subsequent treatments after daratumumab available from the SACT dataset not only reflects UK clinical practice, but is also a large sample. Because the SACT data is from the UK and is recent, the company, ERG and clinical expert all agreed it best reflects subsequent treatments given after daratumumab in UK clinical practice. The clinical expert explained that the choice of subsequent treatment depends on many factors, including how many previous lines of treatment a person has had, the specific treatments, the response to these treatments, and people's preferences . They agreed that the subsequent treatments seen in the SACT cohort are consistent with what would be expected in clinical practice. Because MMY2002 included treatments not available in the NHS, they considered there was a greater degree of certainty in the SACT data. The committee concluded that subsequent treatment data from the SACT cohort best reflects clinical practice. The committee considered the treatments given after pomalidomide with dexamethasone in MM‑003. It heard from the clinical expert that these were generally aligned with NHS clinical practice. The committee was therefore satisfied that the overall survival benefit implied by the naive comparison  is generalisable to NHS clinical practice, while recognising that this was a naive comparison that could be biased by imbalances in patient characteristics.\n\n【20】 # Adverse events\n\n【21】 ## Daratumumab is well tolerated, improves quality of life, and allows people to receive other treatments further down the pathway\nThe clinical expert explained that daratumumab is well tolerated relative to other fourth-line treatments. The patient experts agreed with this, with one pointing out they have been taking daratumumab for some time, saying that it has been the best treatment they've ever had and is why they are still alive today. Additionally, the other patient expert explained that having a treatment that is so well tolerated gives people hope that they may be able to either go on to a clinical trial for a multiple myeloma treatment or that they will survive until they can have a new treatment once it becomes available. The clinical expert agreed with this and again pointed out that a likely reason why an overall survival gain is observed with daratumumab is because of the subsequent treatments people can receive. They also stated that in MMY2002, participants received intravenous daratumumab, which may be less well tolerated than the subcutaneous formulation available in NHS clinical practice. Additionally, people who take daratumumab subcutaneously often find it more convenient because it requires less time spent in a hospital because of the shorter administration time. The committee concluded that daratumumab is well tolerated, improves quality of life for people who take it, and allows them to receive other treatments further down the pathway.\n\n【22】 ## The company's model structure is acceptable for decision making\nThe company used a 4‑state, partitioned-survival economic model, including states representing pre-progressed disease on treatment, pre-progressed disease off treatment, progressed disease and death. The cycle length was 1 week, and the time horizon was 15 years. The committee noted that this model was similar to previous models used for multiple myeloma, and agreed that it was appropriate to capture the natural history of the disease. The ERG was satisfied that the model structure was suitable for estimating the cost effectiveness of daratumumab compared with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone. The committee concluded that the model structure is acceptable and closely matched its preferred assumptions from the original appraisal.\n\n【23】 # Survival modelling in the economic model\n\n【24】 ## Estimates of overall survival are highly uncertain despite the additional analyses provided\nAs in the original appraisal, the model relied on estimates of relative treatment effects from the company's unanchored MAIC. The ERG raised concerns about the methodology of the partially adjusted MAIC, but recalled that the overall survival extrapolations from the fully adjusted MAIC were implausible. The ERG therefore did a naive comparison using daratumumab data from the SACT dataset . The company accepted that its estimates were associated with uncertainty. It attempted to explore this uncertainty by performing scenario analyses in which different sources of the relative treatment effects were used, including the fully adjusted MAIC and an adjusted comparison with the SACT dataset. The ERG also explored this uncertainty, using the naive comparison with the SACT dataset as its preferred source of relative treatment effect. The committee considered all the scenarios presented by the company and the ERG and recognised that there were high levels of uncertainty in the estimates of overall survival used in the model.\n\n【25】 # Costs of subsequent treatments in the economic model\n\n【26】 ## The cost of subsequent treatments should align with the source of clinical data\nThe company used data from SACT to inform both the proportion of people having further treatment and the treatments taken after daratumumab and after pomalidomide with dexamethasone. In the ERG's analysis, it aligned the cost of subsequent treatment with the source of clinical evidence. That is, for daratumumab, data from SACT on the proportion of people and type of subsequent therapy was used. But for pomalidomide with dexamethasone, data from MM‑003 informed the proportion of people and type of subsequent therapy used. A clinical expert stated that the subsequent therapies used are likely to be influenced by daratumumab, and that those in MM‑003 aligned well with NHS clinical practice after pomalidomide with dexamethasone. Taking this into account, the committee preferred the ERG's approach.\n\n【27】 # End of life considerations\n\n【28】 ## Daratumumab meets the end of life criteria\nThe committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's final Cancer Drugs Fund technology appraisal process and methods. It considered life expectancy for people with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In the ERG's analysis, the mean undiscounted total life years with pomalidomide with dexamethasone was 1.49 years. The committee was satisfied that the life expectancy in this population was less than 24 months. It was also satisfied that introducing daratumumab to the treatment pathway at this point offers at least a 3‑month life extension, because despite the uncertainty around the clinical efficacy of this treatment, there was no scenario by either the company or the ERG in which this criterion was not met. The minimum extension to life modelled in any scenario was 5.5 months. The committee concluded that daratumumab after 3 previous lines of treatment met the criteria to be considered a life-extending, end of life treatment.\n\n【29】 # Cost-effectiveness results\n\n【30】 ## The cost-effectiveness estimates are uncertain, but the ERG's preferred ICER is likely the highest plausible ICER\nThe committee considered the company's and the ERG's cost-effectiveness results, including confidential discounts for daratumumab and all of the comparator technologies and subsequent treatments. The cost-effectiveness results are commercial in confidence and cannot be reported here. The committee noted that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for daratumumab compared with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone varied widely. This reflected the high degree of uncertainty in daratumumab's relative clinical effectiveness. Although the degree of uncertainty in the evidence was high, the committee noted that the naive comparison of clinical trial and real-world data would underestimate the benefits of daratumumab, so it believed that the ERG's preferred ICER likely represented the upper end of plausible values.\n\n【31】 ## The most likely ICER is within what NICE considers an acceptable use of NHS resources\nTaking into account all the confidential patient access schemes for all of the comparator technologies and subsequent treatments, all the resulting ICERs were lower than £50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. However, these were all associated with uncertainty. The committee would have preferred alternative methods to have been used to estimate the relative treatment efficacy of daratumumab compared with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone, specifically obtaining data on pomalidomide plus dexamethasone from the SACT database or an adjusted comparison of SACT data with trial data. The committee was aware that both of these methods would likely be challenging at this stage, but may be of value in future appraisals when considering what data to request when recommending a treatment for the Cancer Drugs Fund. However, because the committee viewed the ERG's preferred ICER as the very upper end of the plausible values, it considered that the true ICER likely fell below this. Taking all of this into account, the committee concluded that daratumumab was an acceptable use of NHS resources.\n\n【32】 # Other factors\n\n【33】 ## Equalities\nNo equality issues were identified.\n\n【34】 ## Innovation\nThe company did not highlight any additional benefits that had not been captured in the QALY calculations.\n\n【35】 # Conclusion\n\n【36】 ## Daratumumab is recommended for routine use\nThe committee concluded that the most plausible cost-effectiveness estimates are within what NICE considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. Therefore, daratumumab is recommended for treating relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in adults whose previous therapy included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulator, and whose disease progressed on the last therapy, if they have daratumumab after 3 previous therapies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "3621983b-b1d9-4c03-a8a4-47b7a09fcb1a", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Crataegus\nHawthorn (Crataegus) is a large genus of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia and North America. The name hawthorn was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the Common Hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. However the name is now also applied to the entire genus, and also to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.\nThey are shrubs and small trees growing to 5-15 m tall, characterized by their small pome fruit and thorny branches. The bark is smooth grey in young individuals, developing shallow longitudinal fissures with narrow ridges in older trees. The fruits are sometimes known as \"haws\", from which the name derived. The thorns grow from branches, and are typically 1-3 cm long. The leaves grow spirally arranged on long shoots, and in clusters on spur shoots on the branches or twigs. The leaves themselves have lobed or serrate margins and are somewhat variable shape.\nThe number of species in the genus depends on taxonomic interpretation, with numerous apomictic microspecies; some botanists recognise a thousand or more species, while others reduce the number to 200 or fewer.\nHawthorns provide food and shelter for many species of birds and mammals, and the flowers are important for many nectar-feeding insects. Hawthorns are also used as food plants by the larvae of a large number Lepidoptera species.\nMany species and hybrids are used as ornamental and street trees. The Common Hawthorn is extensively used in Europe as a hedge plant. Several cultivars of the Midland Hawthorn C. laevigata have been selected for their pink or red flowers. Hawthorns are among the trees most recommended for water-conservation landscapes.\n\n【1】 # Selected species\n\n【2】 # Uses\n\n【3】 ## Culinary use\nThe fruits of the species Crataegus pinnatifida (Chinese Hawthorn) are tart, bright red, and resemble small crabapple fruits. They are used to make many kinds of Chinese snacks, including haw flakes and tanghulu (糖葫芦). The fruits, which are called shānzhā (山楂) in Chinese, are also used to produce jams, jellies, juices, alcoholic beverages, and other drinks . In South Korea, a liquor called sansachun (산사춘) is made from the fruits.To the western palate, drinks made from the fruits taste similar to barbecue sauce.\nThe fruits of Crataegus pubescens are known in Mexico as tejocotes and are eaten raw, cooked, or in jam during the winter months.  They are stuffed in the piñatas broken during the traditional pre-Christmas parties known as posadas.  They are also cooked with other fruits to prepare a Christmas punch. The mixture of tejocote paste, sugar, and chili powder produces a popular Mexican candy called rielitos, which is manufactured by several brands.\nIn the southern United States fruits of three native species are collectively known as Mayhaws and are made into jellies which are considered a great delicacy.\nThe leaves are edible and, if picked in the months of April and May, they are tender enough to be used in salads.\n\n【4】 ## Medicinal use\nThe dried fruits of Crataegus pinnatifida (called 山楂  or shān zhā in Chinese) are used in naturopathic medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, primarily as a digestive aid.  A closely related species, Crataegus cuneata (Japanese Hawthorn, called sanzashi in Japanese) is used in a similar manner. Other species (especially Crataegus laevigata) are used in Western herbal medicine, where the plant is believed to strengthen cardiovascular function . In recent years, this use has been noted and adopted by Chinese herbalists as well . Hawthorn is also used as an aid to lower blood pressure, and treat some heart related diseases.\nSeveral clinical trials have assessed the ability of hawthorn to help improve exercise tolerance in people with NYHA class II cardiac insufficiency compared to placebo. One trial, at (300mg/day) for 4 to 8 weeks, found no difference from placebo. The second trial, including 78 subjects (600mg/day) for 8 weeks, found \"significant improvement in exercise tolerance\" and lower blood pressure and heart rate during exercise. The third trial, including 32 subjects (900mg/day) for 8 weeks, found improved exercise tolerance as well as a reduction in the \"incidence and severity of symptoms such as dyspnea\" and fatigue decreased by approximately 50% .\nIn the HERB-CHF (Hawthorn Extract Randomized Blinded Chronic HF Study) clinical trial, 120 patients took 450mg of hawthorn extract twice daily for 6 months in combination with standard therapy and a standardized exercise program. \"No effects of hawthorn were seen on either quality-of-life endpoint (Tables 1 and 2), or when adjusted for LVEF\" .\nOne study, consisting of 1011 patients taking one tablet (standardized to 84.3mg procyanidin) twice daily for 24 weeks, found \"improvements in clinical symptoms (such as fatigue, palpitations, and exercise dyspnea), performance and exercise tolerance test, and ejection fraction\" .\n\n【5】 ## Other uses\nThe wood of some hawthorn species is very hard and resistant to rot. In rural North America it was prized for use as tool handles and fence posts.\n\n【6】 ## Side effects\nOverdose can cause cardiac arrhythmia and dangerously lower blood pressure.  Milder side effects include nausea and sedation.\n\n【7】 # Folklore\nThe custom of employing the flowering branches for decorative purposes on the 1st of May is of very early origin; but since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1752, the tree has rarely been in full bloom in England before the second week of that month. In the Scottish Highlands the flowers may be seen as late as the middle of June. The saying \"Ne'er cast a cloot til Mey's oot\" conveys a warning not to shed any cloots (clothes) before the summer has fully arrived and the may flowers (hawthorn blossoms) are in full bloom.\nThe hawthorn has been regarded as the emblem of hope, and its branches are stated to have been carried by the ancient Greeks in wedding processions, and to have been used by them to deck the altar of Hymenaios. The supposition that the tree was the source of Jesus's crown of thorns gave rise doubtless to the tradition current (as of 1911) among the French peasantry that it utters groans and cries on Good Friday, and probably also to the old popular superstition in Great Britain and Ireland that ill-luck attended the uprooting of hawthorns. Branches of Glastonbury Thorn, C. Oxyacantha, var. praecox, which flowers both in December and in spring, were formerly highly valued in England, on account of the legend that the tree was originally the staff of Joseph of Arimathea.\nIn Celtic lore, the hawthorn plant was used commonly for rune inscriptions along with Yew and Apple. It was once said to heal the broken heart.\nIn Serbian folklore, a stake made of hawthorn wood was used to impale the corpses of suspected vampires.\n- The fruit of Common Hawthorn (C. monogyna)\nThe fruit of Common Hawthorn (C. monogyna)\n- Spring flowers of the probable hybrid C.laevigata x monogyna\nSpring flowers of the probable hybrid C.laevigata x monogyna\n- Crataegus pinnatifida fruit\nCrataegus pinnatifida fruit\n- Botanical drawing of Crataegus laevigata\nBotanical drawing of Crataegus laevigata\n\n【8】 - Photos of Chinese haw berries\n- Key to Crataegus of Western North America\n- Medicinal uses of Hawthorn in Armenia\n- Edible uses of hawthorns at Plants For A Future\n- Crataegus phaenopyrum images at \nar:زعرور\nbe:Глог\nbe-x-old:Глог\nda:Hvidtjørn\n\n【9】 eo:Kratago\ngd:Sgitheach\nko:산사나무속\nhsb:Hłohonc\nio:Kratego\nka:კუნელი\nlt:Gudobelė\nhu:Galagonya\nnl:Meidoorn\nno:Hagtorner\nsimple:Hawthorn\nsl:Glog\n\n【10】 fi:Orapihlajat\nsv:Hagtornar\nuk:Глід\nbat-smg:Graužoks", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Eggs of Diphyllobothrium that date back to 4000 BC have been found in France and Germany. In 1592 AD, T. Dunus gave the first recognizable description of the disease and the life cycle was fully elucidated at the end of the 19th century. D. latum has an aquatic life cycle and it is usually transmitted to humans by ingestion of the affected aquatic intermediate host (freshwater or marine fish).  It usually causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, and numbness of extremities. Diphyllobothriasis is common in areas with lakes and rivers where humans consume raw or undercooked freshwater fish particularly Japan, Scandinavia, Siberia, and sporadic cases in North and South America. A common risk factor in the development of diphyllobothriasis is consumption of raw or poorly cooked fish meat.The symptoms of diphyllobothriasis usually develop after eating undercooked or raw infected fish meat and start with symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. If left untreated, patients with diphyllobothriasis may progress to develop complications such as megaloblastic anemia, cholecystitis/cholangitis, and intestinal obstruction. The prognosis of diphyllobothriasis is generally good. Patients with diphyllobothriasis are usually asymptomatic but may be irritated. Physical examination of patients with diphyllobothriasis is usually remarkable for abdominal tenderness, pale conjunctiva, pale skin, and decreased vibration and position senses. The diagnosis is made by identifying eggs of the parasite in stool. Blood tests may show megaloblastic anemia, eosinophilia, and a low vitamin B12 level. Diphyllobothriasis is medically treated with a single dose of praziquantel. The transmission of diphyllobothriasis can be prevented by avoiding undercooked or raw fish meat.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\nEggs of Diphyllobothrium that date back to 4000 BC have been found in France and Germany. In 1592 AD, T. Dunus gave the first recognizable description of the disease and the life cycle was fully elucidated at the end of the 19th century.\n\n【3】 # Classification\nThere is no known classification for diphyllobothriasis but it may be classified on the basis of the organisms causing it.\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\nDiphyllobothriasis is a disease caused by Diphyllobothrium latum. D. latum has an aquatic life cycle and is usually transmitted to the humans by ingestion of the affected aquatic intermediate host (freshwater or marine fish). D. latum decreases the intestinal absorption of vitamin B12, resulting in megaloblastic anemia in humans.\n\n【5】 # Causes\nDiphyllobothrium is a genus of tapeworm that can cause Diphyllobothriasis in humans through consumption of raw or under cooked fish. The principal species causing diphyllobothriosis is Diphyllobothrium latum, known as the broad or fish tapeworm,  or broad fish tapeworm.  D. latum is a pseudophyllidea cestode that infects fish and mammals.  D. latum is native to Scandinavia, western Russia, and the Baltics, though it is now also present in North America, especially the Pacific Northwest. Other members of the genus Diphyllobothrium include Diphyllobothrium dendriticum (the salmon tapeworm), which has a much larger range (the whole northern hemisphere), D. pacificum, D. cordatum, D. ursi, D. lanceolatum, D. dalliae, and D. yonagoensis, all of which infect humans only infrequently.  In Japan, the most common species causing human infection is D. nihonkaiense, which was only identified as a separate species from D. latum in 1989.\n\n【6】 # Differentiating (Disease name) from other Conditions\nDiphyllobothriasis must be differentiated from tapeworm infections like taeniasis, hymenolepiasis, and schistosomiasis.\n\n【7】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\nDiphyllobothriasis occurs in areas with lakes and rivers where humans consume raw or under cooked freshwater fish. It is particularly common in Japan, Scandinavia, Siberia, with sporadic cases in North and South America.\n\n【8】 # Risk Factors\nA common risk factor in the development of diphyllobothriasis is consumption of raw or poorly cooked fish meat.\n\n【9】 # Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for diphyllobothriasis.\n\n【10】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nThe symptoms of diphyllobothriasis usually develop after eating undercooked or raw infected fish meat and start with symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. If left untreated, patients with diphyllobothriasis may progress to develop complications such as megaloblastic anemia, cholecystitis/cholangitis, and intestinal obstruction. The prognosis of diphyllobothriasis is generally good.\n\n【11】 # Diagnosis\n\n【12】 ## History and Symptoms\nThe history of patients with diphyllobothriasis is significant for eating raw or poorly cooked fish meat. The symptoms of diphyllobothriasis may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and, less commonly, numbness of toes and fingers.\n\n【13】 ## Physical Examination\nPatients with diphyllobothriasis are usually asymptomatic but may be irritated. Physical examination of patients with diphyllobothriasis is usually remarkable for abdominal tenderness, pale conjunctiva, pale skin, and decreased vibration and position senses.\n\n【14】 ## Laboratory Findings\nDiphyllobothriasis can be diagnosed with the morphological identification of Diphyllobothrium eggs and adults in the stool exam. Molecular diagnosis can also be made with the PCR. Blood tests may show megaloblastic anemia, eosinophilia, and a low vitamin B12 level.\n\n【15】 ## Chest X Ray\nThere are no X-ray findings associated with diphyllobothriasis.\n\n【16】 ## CT\nThere are no CT findings associated with diphyllobothriasis.\n\n【17】 ## MRI\nThere are no MRI findings associated with diphyllobothriasis.\n\n【18】 ## Echocardiography or Ultrasound\nThere are no echocardiography or ultrasound findings associated with diphyllobothriasis.\n\n【19】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nThere are no other imaging findings associated with diphyllobothriasis.\n\n【20】 ## Other diagnostic findings\nColonoscopy can reveal Diphyllobothrium latum, usually located in the terminal ileum and extending to the sigmoid colon.\n\n【21】 # Treatment\n\n【22】 ## Medical Therapy\nDrugs used for diphyllobothriasis include praziquantel and niclosamide.\n\n【23】 ## Surgery\nSurgical intervention is not recommended for the management of diphyllobothriasis.\n\n【24】 ## Primary Prevention\nEffective measures for the primary prevention of diphyllobothriasis include avoiding/limiting consumption of raw fish and proper cooking and storing of fish meat.\n\n【25】 ## Secondary Prevention\nThe secondary prevention strategies for diphyllobothriasis are similar to its primary preventive measures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "2ab9a390-89a0-4936-9ce1-ecd989c09516", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Hysteroscopic metroplasty of a uterine septum for recurrent miscarriage\n\n【1】 # Recommendations\nCurrent evidence on the safety of hysteroscopic metroplasty of a uterine septum for recurrent miscarriage includes some serious but rare complications. Current evidence on efficacy is adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit.\nPatient selection and treatment should be done by a multidisciplinary team including specialists in reproductive medicine, uterine imaging and hysteroscopic surgery.\nClinicians undertaking hysteroscopic metroplasty of a uterine septum for recurrent miscarriage should be trained in hysteroscopic surgery in accordance with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists training module.# Indications and current treatments\nA uterine septum is a congenital anomaly (present from birth). The septum is a muscular or fibrous wall that divides the inside of the uterus, creating 2 cavities (a septate uterus). The septum may be complete or incomplete. It is more common in women with primary infertility and in women who have had repeated miscarriages, and may therefore be one cause of these problems.\nSurgical removal of the septum (metroplasty) is usually considered for women who have a septate uterus in association with repeated adverse reproductive outcomes, including recurrent miscarriage (usually defined as 3 or more miscarriages in a row) and preterm delivery. Metroplasty is also used to manage primary infertility but the causal relationship between this problem and the presence of a uterine septum is less certain.\nMetroplasty was traditionally done by a transabdominal approach. A hysteroscopic approach aims to reduce morbidity and shorten the recovery period. Unlike transabdominal metroplasty, caesarean section is not mandatory for patients who conceive after hysteroscopic metroplasty.# The procedure\nHysteroscopic metroplasty of a uterine septum for recurrent miscarriage aims to create a normal uterine cavity by removing the septum, and consequently reduce the risk of miscarriage.\nHysteroscopic metroplasty is usually done with the patient under general or spinal anaesthesia. After cervical dilation, a hysteroscope is inserted into the uterus through the cervix. The uterine cavity is distended with fluid; fluid control must be carefully monitored to avoid overload. The septum is excised, most commonly using microscissors, electrosurgery or laser. The procedure may be done using ultrasound or laparoscopic guidance.\nAfter a miscarriage, an interval of at least 6 weeks is left before doing a hysteroscopic metroplasty.# Efficacy\nThis section describes efficacy outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview.\nA non‑randomised comparative study of 78 women with a partial septate uterus and a history of recurrent miscarriage reported miscarriage rates of 22% (8/37) after hysteroscopic metroplasty and 50% (9/18) with expectant management (p<0.05), at a mean follow‑up of 11 months. A non‑randomised comparative study of 48 women with a septate uterus and a history of recurrent miscarriage reported miscarriage rates for the first pregnancy after enrolment of 18% (4/22) after hysteroscopic metroplasty and 64% (9/14) with expectant management (p<0.001), at a mean follow‑up of 36 months. A case series of 973 women with a septate uterus and a history of recurrent miscarriage or infertility reported the pregnancy outcomes of 344 women after hysteroscopic metroplasty: 78% (268/344) of women reached term, 14% (48/344) of women miscarried before 12 weeks' gestation, 4% (14/344) of women miscarried after 12 weeks' gestation and 14 women were still pregnant at the close of the study (follow‑up period not reported). A case series of 170 women with a partial or complete septate uterus and a history of recurrent miscarriage, preterm delivery or infertility reported that before hysteroscopic metroplasty, 92% (332/363) of pregnancies ended in miscarriage compared with 13% (24/186) of pregnancies after hysteroscopic metroplasty (p=0.02), at a mean follow‑up of 29 months.\nA review of 2528 women (37 studies) with a septate uterus and a history of recurrent miscarriage, infertility, spontaneous abortion or preterm delivery, that included a meta‑analysis of 2074 women (29 studies) reported a live birth rate of 50% after hysteroscopic metroplasty (95% confidence interval  43 to 57; 19 studies, n=1525; follow‑up period not reported). A case series of 246 women with a septate uterus and a history of recurrent miscarriage or infertility reported a live birth rate after hysteroscopic metroplasty of 60% (71/129) in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage, at a mean follow‑up of 37 months; there were 11 ongoing pregnancies at the close of the study.\nThe non‑randomised comparative study of 78 women with a partial septate uterus and a history of recurrent miscarriage reported preterm delivery in 5% (2/37) of pregnancies in women treated by hysteroscopic metroplasty and 28% (5/18) in women managed expectantly (p<0.05). The non‑randomised comparative study of 48 women with a septate uterus and a history of recurrent miscarriage reported preterm delivery in 5% (1/22) of pregnancies after hysteroscopic metroplasty and 7% (1/14) with expectant management, for the first pregnancy after enrolment (p value not stated). The case series of 170 women with a partial or complete septate uterus and a history of recurrent miscarriage, preterm delivery or infertility reported preterm delivery in 6% (22/363) of pregnancies before hysteroscopic metroplasty compared with 8% (14/186) of pregnancies after hysteroscopic metroplasty (p=0.12). The case series of 246 women with a septate uterus and a history of recurrent miscarriage or infertility reported a preterm delivery rate after hysteroscopic metroplasty of 11% (14/129) of pregnancies in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage.\nThe specialist advisers listed the key efficacy outcomes as a normal‑sized uterine cavity, pregnancy rate, reduced miscarriage rate and increased live birth rate.# Safety\nThis section describes safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. Evidence on both women with a history of recurrent miscarriage and those with primary infertility has been included, because the procedure is the same for both and therefore the safety events are relevant to both conditions. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview.\nUterine perforation during hysteroscopic metroplasty was reported in 1% (17/2167) of women in a review of 2528 women (37 studies) and in 1% (8/923) of women in a case series of 973 women. Uterine perforation was reported in 1% (2/170) of women in a case series of 170 women; this was managed by laparoscopic bipolar coagulation and both women were discharged the same day. One of these women subsequently had a pregnancy that carried to term, with delivery by caesarean section.\nUterine rupture during pregnancy or delivery was identified in 18 confirmed reports in the review of 2528 women; in 10 of the 18 cases, uterine perforation had occurred at the time of the hysteroscopic metroplasty.\nIntraoperative bleeding with 'interruption of the procedure' was reported in 1 woman in the case series of 973 women. Excessive bleeding was reported in 1% (2/170) of women in the case series of 170 women; this was managed by an intrauterine balloon catheter kept in situ for 4 hours.\nCervical laceration (not further described) was reported in less than 1% (2/2167) of women in the review of 2528 women. Difficult dilatation leading to cervical injury (not further described) was reported in 1 woman in the case series of 170 women.\nPulmonary oedema was reported in 1 woman each in the review of 2528 women and in the case series of 973 women (no further details reported).\nUterine synechiae after hysteroscopic metroplasty were reported in 2% (4/181) of women in a case series of 181 women (these synechiae were all treated surgically) and in 1 woman in the review of 2528 women (treatment not reported). Mild adhesions were reported in 7% (11/170) of women in the case series of 170 women (diagnosed by hysteroscopy). These adhesions were all treated by hysteroscopic adhesiolysis; 7 of the women subsequently became pregnant and had term deliveries.\nInterstitial ectopic pregnancy after hysteroscopic metroplasty was reported in 1 woman in a case report. A laparotomy was done to resect a wedge of myometrium that was completely enclosing the gestational sac. A hysteroscopy was done 4 months later and showed only a fine linear scar at the fundus, and the uterine cavity was otherwise normal.\nIn addition to safety outcomes reported in the literature, specialist advisers are asked about anecdotal adverse events (events which they have heard about) and about theoretical adverse events (events which they think might possibly occur, even if they have never done so). For this procedure, specialist advisers considered that the following were theoretical adverse events: incomplete resection of the septum, infection, placenta accreta and percreta, a negative effect on fertility through damage to the endometrium, and detrimental effect on uterine and endometrial blood flow.# Further information\n\n【2】 # Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers (information for the public). It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in mind.# About this guidance\nNICE interventional procedures guidance makes recommendations on the safety and efficacy of the procedure.

If signs of folate deficiency develop, reduce the dosage or discontinue the drug according to the response of the patient. Folinic acid (leucovorin) should be administered in a dosage of 5 to 15 mg daily (orally, IV, or IM) until normal hematopoiesis is restored.\n- Data in 2 humans indicate that pyrimethamine may be carcinogenic; a 51-year-old female who developed chronic granulocytic leukemia after taking pyrimethamine for 2 years for toxoplasmosis and a 56-year-old patient who developed reticulum cell sarcoma after 14 months of pyrimethamine for toxoplasmosis.\n- Pyrimethamine has been reported to produce a significant increase in the number of lung tumors in mice when given intraperitoneally at doses of 25 mg/kg.\n- Pyrimethamine susceptible to adverse effects from an overdose. Deaths in pediatric patients have been reported after accidental ingestion.\n\n【15】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【16】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nHypersensitivity reactions, occasionally severe (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and anaphylaxis), and hyperphenylalaninemia, can occur particularly when pyrimethamine is administered concomitantly with a sulfonamide. Consult the complete prescribing information for the relevant sulfonamide for sulfonamide-associated adverse events. With doses of pyrimethamine used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, anorexia and vomiting may occur. Vomiting may be minimized by giving the medication with meals; it usually disappears promptly upon reduction of dosage. Doses used in toxoplasmosis may produce megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, atrophic glossitis, hematuria, and disorders of cardiac rhythm. Hematologic effects, however, may also occur at low doses in certain individuals.\nPulmonary eosinophilia has been reported rarely.\n\n【17】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Pyrimethamine Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n【18】 # Drug Interactions\n- Pyrimethamine may be used with sulfonamides, quinine and other antimalarials, and with other antibiotics. However, the concomitant use of other antifolic drugs or agents associated with myelosuppression including sulfonamides or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combinations, proguanil, zidovudine, or cytostatic agents (e.g., methotrexate), while the patient is receiving pyrimethamine, may increase the risk of bone marrow suppression.\n- If signs of folate deficiency develop, pyrimethamine should be discontinued. Folinic acid (leucovorin) should be administered until normal hematopoiesis is restored.\n- Mild hepatotoxicity has been reported in some patients when lorazepam and pyrimethamine were administered concomitantly.\n\n【19】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【20】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\nPyrimethamine has been shown to be teratogenic in rats when given in oral doses 7 times the human dose for chemoprophylaxis of malaria or 2.5 times the human dose for treatment of toxoplasmosis. At these doses in rats, there was a significant increase in abnormalities such as cleft palate, brachygnathia, oligodactyly, and microphthalmia. Pyrimethamine has also been shown to produce terata such as meningocele in hamsters and cleft palate in miniature pigs when given in oral doses 170 and 5 times the human dose, respectively, for chemoprophylaxis of malaria or for treatment of toxoplasmosis.\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. pyrimethamine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nConcurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended when used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis during pregnancy.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Pyrimethamine in women who are pregnant.\n\n【21】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Pyrimethamine during labor and delivery.\n\n【22】 ### Nursing Mothers\nPyrimethamine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from pyrimethamine and from concurrent use of a sulfonamide with pyrimethamine for treatment of some patients with toxoplasmosis, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n【23】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyrimethamine in pediatric settings.\n\n【24】 ### Geriatic Use\nClinical studies of pyrimethamine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n\n【25】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyrimethamine with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【26】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyrimethamine with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【27】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyrimethamine in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【28】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyrimethamine in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【29】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Pyrimethamine in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【30】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Pyrimethamine in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【31】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【32】 ### Administration\nOral\n\n【33】 ### Monitoring\nIn patients receiving high dosage, as for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, semiweekly blood counts, including platelet counts, should be performed.\n\n【34】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Pyrimethamine and IV administrations.\n\n【35】 # Overdosage\nFollowing the ingestion of 300 mg or more of pyrimethamine, gastrointestinal and/or central nervous system signs may be present, including convulsions. The initial symptoms are usually gastrointestinal and may include abdominal pain, nausea, severe and repeated vomiting, possibly including hematemesis. Central nervous system toxicity may be manifest by initial excitability, generalized and prolonged convulsions which may be followed by respiratory depression, circulatory collapse, and death within a few hours. Neurological symptoms appear rapidly (30 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion), suggesting that in gross overdosage pyrimethamine has a direct toxic effect on the central nervous system.\nThe fatal dose is variable, with the smallest reported fatal single dose being 375 mg. There are, however, reports of pediatric patients who have recovered after taking 375 to 625 mg.\nThere is no specific antidote to acute pyrimethamine poisoning. In the event of overdosage, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed. Gastric lavage is recommended and is effective if carried out very soon after drug ingestion. Parenteral diazepam may be used to control convulsions. Folinic acid should be administered within 2 hours of drug ingestion to be most effective in counteracting the effects on the hematopoietic system. Due to the long half-life of pyrimethamine, daily monitoring of peripheral blood counts is recommended for up to several weeks after the overdose until normal hematologic values are restored.\n\n【36】 # Pharmacology\n\n【37】 ## Mechanism of Action\nBinds to and reversibly inhibits the protozoal enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, selectively blocking conversion of dihydrofolic acid to its functional form, tetrahydrofolic acid. This depletes folate, an essential cofactor in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids, resulting in interference with protozoal nucleic acid and protein production.\n\n【38】 ## Structure\nPyrimethamine, known chemically as 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-6-ethyl-2,4-pyrimidinediamine, has the following structural formula:\n\n【39】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nPyrimethamine is a folic acid antagonist and the rationale for its therapeutic action is based on the differential requirement between host and parasite for nucleic acid precursors involved in growth. This activity is highly selective against plasmodia and Toxoplasma gondii.\nPyrimethamine possesses blood schizonticidal and some tissue schizonticidal activity against malaria parasites of humans. However, the 4-amino-quinoline compounds are more effective against the erythrocytic schizonts. It does not destroy gametocytes, but arrests sporogony in the mosquito.\nThe action of pyrimethamine against Toxoplasma gondii is greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with sulfonamides. This was demonstrated by Eyles and Coleman1 in the treatment of experimental toxoplasmosis in the mouse. Jacobs et al2 demonstrated that combination of the 2 drugs effectively prevented the development of severe uveitis in most rabbits following the inoculation of the anterior chamber of the eye with toxoplasma.\n\n【40】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nPyrimethamine is well absorbed with peak levels occurring between 2 to 6 hours following administration. It is eliminated slowly and has a plasma half-life of approximately 96 hours. Pyrimethamine is 87% bound to human plasma proteins.\n\n【41】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nData in 2 humans indicate that pyrimethamine may be carcinogenic; a 51-year-old female who developed chronic granulocytic leukemia after taking pyrimethamine for 2 years for toxoplasmosis and a 56-year-old patient who developed reticulum cell sarcoma after 14 months of pyrimethamine for toxoplasmosis.\nPyrimethamine has been reported to produce a significant increase in the number of lung tumors in mice when given intraperitoneally at doses of 25 mg/kg.\nIn vivo, chromosomes analyzed from the bone marrow of rats dosed with pyrimethamine showed an increased number of structural and numerical aberrations.\n\n【42】 # Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Pyrimethamine Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n\n【43】 # How Supplied\n- Pyrimethamine 25 mg tablets\n- Bottles of 100\n- NDC 52054-330-10 and NDC 52054-330-95\n\n【44】 ## Storage\nStore at 15° to 25°C (59° to 77°F)\n\n【45】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n【46】 # Patient Counseling Information\n- Patients should be warned that at the first appearance of a skin rash they should stop use of pyrimethamine and seek medical attention immediately. Patients should also be warned that the appearance of sore throat, pallor, purpura, or glossitis may be early indications of serious disorders which require treatment with pyrimethamine to be stopped and medical treatment to be sought.\n- Women of childbearing potential who are taking pyrimethamine should be warned against becoming pregnant. Patients should be warned to keep pyrimethamine out of the reach of children. Patients should be advised not to exceed recommended doses. Patients should be warned that if anorexia and vomiting occur, they may be minimized by taking the drug with meals.\n- Concurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended when used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis in all patients.\n\n【47】 # Precautions with Alcohol\nAlcohol-Pyrimethamine interaction has not been established.

Please mail us  to indicate your interest in serving either as an Editor-In-Chief of the entire topic or as an Associate Editor-In-Chief for a subtopic. Please be sure to attach your CV and or biographical sketch.\nThe Plague of Cyprian is the name given to a pandemic, probably of smallpox, that afflicted the Roman Empire from 251 AD onwards. It was still raging in 270, when it claimed the life of emperor Claudius II Gothicus (ruled 268-70). The plague caused widespread manpower shortages in agriculture and the Roman army. It is named after St. Cyprian, an early Christian writer who witnessed and described the plague.\nIn 251 to 266, at the height of the outbreak, 5,000 people a day were said to be dying in Rome.  Cyprian's biographer, Pontius the deacon, wrote of the plague at Carthage:\nAs Jews paid with their lives during the 14th century's Black Death, so in Carthage the \"Decian persecution\" unleashed at the onset of the plague sought out Christian scapegoats. Fifty years later, the North African convert to Christianity Arnobius defended his new religion from pagan allegations:\nCyprian drew moralizing analogies in his sermons to the Christian community and drew a word picture of the plague's symptoms in his essay De mortalitate (\"On the Plague\"):\nHistorian William McNeill asserts that the Antonine Plague and the Plague of Cyprian were outbreaks of two different diseases, one of smallpox and one of measles, although not necessarily in that order.  The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that people had no previous exposure - or immunity - to either disease. The modern consensus, however, is that both outbreaks were smallpox.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "13f2f2c8-a019-472c-b829-637e8ebb6b71", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Alprostadil (suppository)\n\n【1】 # Disclaimer\nWikiDoc MAKES NO GUARANTEE OF VALIDITY\n\n【2】 # Overview\nAlprostadil (suppository) is a endocrine-metabolic agen.  erectile dysfunction agent  and genitourinary agent that is FDA approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction due to neurogenic, vasculogenic, psychogenic, or mixed etiology.   Common adverse reactions include bradyarrhythmia, hypotension, tachycardia, flushing, urethral discomfort, fibrosis of penis, pain in penis, pain in testicle and fever.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- CAVERJECT (CAVERJECT IMPULSE and CAVERJECT Sterile Powder) is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction due to neurogenic, vasculogenic, psychogenic, or mixed etiology.\n- Intracavernosal CAVERJECT is also indicated as an adjunct to other diagnostic tests in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.\n\n【5】 ### Dosing Information\n- The dose of CAVERJECT should be individualized for each patient by careful titration under supervision by the physician. In clinical studies, patients were treated with CAVERJECT Sterile Powder in doses ranging from 0.2 to 140 mcg; however, since 99% of patients received doses of 60 mcg or less, doses of greater than 60 mcg are not recommended. In general, the lowest possible effective dose should always be employed. In clinical studies, over 80% of patients experienced an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse after intracavernosal injection of CAVERJECT.\n\n【6】 ### Initial Titration in Physician's Office\n- Dosage titration should be initiated at 2.5 mcg of alprostadil. The 10 mcg strength of CAVERJECT IMPULSE is designed to allow delivery of a 2.5 mcg dose of alprostadil . If there is a partial response at 2.5 mcg, the dose may be increased by 2.5 mcg to a dose of 5 mcg within 1 hour. No more than 2 doses during initial titration should be given within a 24-hour period. If additional titration is required, doses in increments of 5 to 10 mcg may be given at least 24 hours apart until the dose that produces an erection suitable for intercourse and not exceeding a duration of 1 hour is reached. If there is no response to the initial 2.5-mcg dose, the second dose may be increased to 7.5 mcg within 1 hour. No more than 2 doses during initial titration should be given within a 24-hour period. If additional titration is required, doses in increments of 5 to 10 mcg may be given at least 24 hours apart. The patient must stay in the physician's office until complete detumescence occurs.\n- Dosage titration should be initiated at 1.25 mcg of alprostadil. Because CAVERJECT IMPULSE is designed to deliver doses of 2.5 mcg or greate. CAVERJECT Sterile Powder may be used for an initial dose of 1.25 mcg. The initial dose may be increased by 1.25 mcg to a dose of 2.5 mcg within 1 hour. No more than 2 doses during initial titration should be given within a 24-hour period. If additional titration is required, a dose of 5 mcg may be given during the next 24 hours. Thereafter, doses in increments of 5 mcg may be given at least 24 hours apart until the dose that produces an erection suitable for intercourse and not exceeding a duration of 1 hour is reached. The patient must stay in the physician's office until complete detumescence occurs.\n- The majority of patients (56%) in one clinical study involving 579 patients with erectile dysfunction of various etiologies were titrated to doses of greater than 5 mcg but less than or equal to 20 mcg. The mean dose at the end of the titration phase was 17.8 mcg of alprostadil.\n- The first injections of CAVERJECT must be done at the physician's office by medically trained personnel. Self-injection therapy by the patient should be started only after the patient is properly instructed and well trained in the self-injection technique. The physician should make a careful assessment of the patient's skills and competence with this procedure. The intracavernosal injection must be done under sterile conditions. The site of injection is usually along the dorso-lateral aspect of the proximal third of the penis. Visible veins should be avoided. The side of the penis that is injected and the site of injection must be alternated; the injection site must be cleansed with an alcohol swab.\n- The dose of CAVERJECT that is selected for self-injection treatment should provide the patient with an erection that is satisfactory for sexual intercourse and that is maintained for no longer than 1 hour. If the duration of erection is longer than 1 hour, the dose of CAVERJECT should be reduced. Self-injection therapy for use at home should be initiated at the dose that was determined in the physician's office; however, dose adjustment, if required (up to 57% of patients in one clinical study), should be made only after consultation with the physician. The dose should be adjusted in accordance with the titration guidelines described above. The effectiveness of CAVERJECT for long-term use of up to 6 months has been documented in an uncontrolled, self-injection study. The mean dose of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder at the end of 6 months was 20.7 mcg in this study. CAVERJECT IMPULSE in the 10 mcg strength is designed to deliver a minimum dose of 2.5 mcg and a maximum dose of 10 mcg. CAVERJECT IMPULSE in the 20 mcg strength is designed to deliver a minimum dose of 5 mcg and a maximum dose of 20 mcg. The physician should determine the most suitable formulation of CAVERJECT for the individual patient (CAVERJECT IMPULSE or CAVERJECT Sterile Powder).\n- Careful and continuous follow-up of the patient while in the self-injection program must be exercised. This is especially true for the initial self-injections, since adjustments in the dose of CAVERJECT may be needed. The recommended frequency of injection is no more than 3 times weekly, with at least 24 hours between each dose. All formulations of CAVERJECT are intended for single use only and should be discarded after use. The user should be instructed in the proper disposal of the injection materials (e.g., delivery system, needles).\n- While on self-injection treatment, it is recommended that the patient visit the prescribing physician's office every 3 months. At that time, the efficacy and safety of the therapy should be assessed, and the dose of CAVERJECT should be adjusted, if needed.\n- In the simplest diagnostic test for erectile dysfunction (pharmacologic testing), patients are monitored for the occurrence of an erection after an intracavernosal injection of CAVERJECT. Extensions of this testing are the use of CAVERJECT as an adjunct to laboratory investigations, such as duplex or Doppler imaging, 133Xenon washout tests, radioisotope penogram, and penile arteriography, to allow visualization and assessment of penile vasculature. For any of these tests, a single dose of CAVERJECT that induces an erection with firm rigidity should be used.\n- CAVERJECT IMPULSE consists of a disposable, single-dose, dual chamber syringe system. The system includes a glass cartridge, which contains sterile, freeze-dried alprostadil in the front chamber and sterile bacteriostatic water for injection in the rear chamber. Following proper reconstitution instructions, the 10 mcg strength syringe can deliver up to 0.5 mL of solution. Each 0.5 mL of solution contains 10 mcg of alprostadil, 324.7 mcg of alpha cyclodextrin, 45.4 mg of lactose, 23.5 mcg of sodium citrate, and 4.45 mg of benzyl alcohol. The delivery system can be set to deliver a solution volume of 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, or 0.50 mL to enable administration of 2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10 mcg of alprostadil. Following proper reconstitution instructions, the 20 mcg strength syringe can deliver up to 0.5 mL of solution. Each 0.5 mL of solution contains 20 mcg of alprostadil, 649.3 mcg of alpha cyclodextrin, 45.4 mg of lactose, 23.5 mcg of sodium citrate, and 4.45 mg of benzyl alcohol. The delivery system can be set to deliver a solution volume of 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, or 0.50 mL to enable administration of 5, 10, 15, or 20 mcg of alprostadil. After reconstitution, the solution of CAVERJECT should be used within 24 hours when stored at or below 25°C (77°F). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit. The product should not be used if particulate matter or discoloration are present. Following a single use, the injection delivery system and any remaining solution should be properly discarded.\n- CAVERJECT IMPULSE is for single use only.

Patients with penile implants should not be treated with CAVERJECT.\n- CAVERJECT is intended for use in adult men only.\n- CAVERJECT is not indicated for use in children or newborns.\n- CAVERJECT should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable or contraindicated.\n\n【16】 # Warnings\n- Prolonged erection defined as erection lasting > 4 to ≤ 6 hours in duration occurred in 4% of 1,861 patients treated up to 18 months in studies of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder. The incidence of priapism (erections lasting > 6 hours in duration) was 0.4% with the same length of use. Pharmacologic intervention and/or aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosum was performed in 2 of the 7 patients with priapism. To minimize the chances of prolonged erection or priapism, CAVERJECT should be titrated slowly to the lowest effective dose . The patient must be instructed to immediately report to his prescribing physician, or, if unavailable, to seek immediate medical assistance for any erection that persists longer than 4 hours. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may result.\n\n【17】 ### PRECAUTIONS\n- CAVERJECT IMPULSE is designed for one use only. Following a single use, the injection delivery system and any remaining solution should be properly discarded.\n- The overall incidence of penile fibrosis, including Peyronie's disease, reported in clinical studies with CAVERJECT Sterile Powder was 3%. In one self-injection clinical study where duration of use was up to 18 months, the incidence of fibrosis was 7.8%.\n- Regular follow-up of patients, with careful examination of the penis, is strongly recommended to detect signs of penile fibrosis. Treatment with CAVERJECT should be discontinued in patients who develop penile angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease.\n- Intracavernous injections of CAVERJECT can lead to increased peripheral blood levels of PGE1 and its metabolites, especially in those patients with significant corpora cavernosa venous leakage. Increased peripheral blood levels of PGE1 and its metabolites may lead to hypotension and/or dizziness.\n- Patients on anticoagulants, such as warfarin or heparin, may have increased propensity for bleeding after intracavernosal injection.\n- Underlying treatable medical causes of erectile dysfunction should be diagnosed and treated prior to initiation of therapy with CAVERJECT.\n- The safety and efficacy of combinations of CAVERJECT and other vasoactive agents have not been systematically studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.\n- CAVERJECT IMPULSE uses a superfine (29 gauge) needle. As with all superfine needles, the possibility of needle breakage exists. Careful instruction in proper patient handling and injection techniques may minimize the potential for needle breakage.\n- The patient should be instructed not to re-use or to share needles or syringes. As with all prescription medicines, the patient should not allow anyone else to use his medicine.\n\n【18】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【19】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The following local adverse reaction information was derived from controlled and uncontrolled studies of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder, including an uncontrolled 18-month safety study.\n- Penile pain after intracavernosal administration of CAVERJECT was reported at least once by 37% of patients in clinical studies of up to 18 months in duration. In the majority of the cases, penile pain was rated mild or moderate in intensity. Three percent of patients discontinued treatment because of penile pain. The frequency of penile pain was 2% in 294 patients who received 1 to 3 injections of placebo.\n- In clinical trials, prolonged erection was defined as an erection that lasted for 4 to 6 hours; priapism was defined as erection that lasted 6 hours or longer. The frequency of prolonged erection after intracavernosal administration of CAVERJECT was 4%, while the frequency of priapism was 0.4%.\n- The frequency of hematoma and ecchymosis was 3% and 2%, respectively. In most cases, hematoma/ecchymosis was judged to be a complication of a faulty injection technique. Accordingly, proper instruction of the patient in self-injection is of importance to minimize the potential of hematoma/ecchymosis .\n- The following local adverse reactions were reported by fewer than 1% of patients after injection of CAVERJECT: balanitis, injection site hemorrhage, injection site inflammation, injection site itching, injection site swelling, injection site edema, urethral bleeding, penile warmth, numbness, yeast infection, irritation, sensitivity, phimosis, pruritus, erythema, venous leak, painful erection, and abnormal ejaculation.\n- The following systemic adverse event information was derived from controlled and uncontrolled studies of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder, including an uncontrolled 18-month safety study.\n- The following systemic events, which were reported for < 1% of patients in clinical studies, were judged by investigators to be possibly related to use of CAVERJECT: testicular pain, scrotal disorder, scrotal edema, hematuria, testicular disorder, impaired urination, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, pelvic pain, hypotension, vasodilation, peripheral vascular disorder, supraventricular extrasystoles, vasovagal reactions, hypesthesia, non-generalized weakness, diaphoresis, rash, non-application site pruritus, skin neoplasm, nausea, dry mouth, increased serum creatinine, leg cramps, and mydriasis.\n- Hemodynamic changes, manifested as decreases in blood pressure and increases in pulse rate, were observed during clinical studies, principally at doses above 20 mcg and above 30 mcg of alprostadil, respectively, and appeared to be dose-dependent. However, these changes were usually clinically unimportant; only three patients discontinued the treatment because of symptomatic hypotension.\n- CAVERJECT had no clinically important effect on serum or urine laboratory tests.\n- The safety of CAVERJECT IMPULSE was evaluated in a study that compared the formulation of alprostadil for injection contained in CAVERJECT IMPULSE with the formulation contained in CAVERJECT Sterile Powder. The doses used by the 87 patients in this crossover study were the same for both formulations. The number and type of events reported for CAVERJECT IMPULSE were consistent between formulations in this study and in other controlled and uncontrolled studies with CAVERJECT Sterile Powder.\n\n【20】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- The following additional adverse reactions have been reported: device malfunction/failure, drug ineffective and drug effect decreased.\n\n【21】 # Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Drug Interactions of Alprostadil (suppository) in pediatric patients.\n\n【22】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【23】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- CAVERJECT is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Alprostadil (suppository) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【24】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Alprostadil (suppository) during labor and delivery.\n\n【25】 ### Nursing Mothers\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Alprostadil (suppository) with respect to nursing mothers.\n\n【26】 ### Pediatric Use\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Alprostadil (suppository) with respect to pediatric patients.\n\n【27】 ### Geriatic Use\n- A total of 341 subjects included in clinical studies were 65 and older. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and the other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but decreased sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n\n【28】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Alprostadil (suppository) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【29】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Alprostadil (suppository) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【30】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Alprostadil (suppository) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【31】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Alprostadil (suppository) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【32】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Alprostadil (suppository) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【33】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Alprostadil (suppository) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【34】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【35】 ### Administration\n- Intracavernosal\n- Intraurethral\n\n【36】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Alprostadil (suppository) in the drug label.\n- Description\n\n【37】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Alprostadil (suppository) in the drug label.\n\n【38】 # Overdosage\n- Overdosage was not observed in clinical trials with CAVERJECT. If intracavernous overdose of CAVERJECT occurs, the patient should be under medical supervision until any systemic effects have resolved and/or until penile detumescence has occurred. Symptomatic treatment of any systemic symptoms would be appropriate.\n\n【39】 # Pharmacology\nThere is limited information regarding Alprostadil (suppository) Pharmacology in the drug label.\n\n【40】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Alprostadil has a wide variety of pharmacological actions; vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation are among the most notable of these effects. In most animal species tested, alprostadil relaxed retractor penis and corpus cavernosum urethrae in vitro. Alprostadil also relaxed isolated preparations of human corpus cavernosum and spongiosum, as well as cavernous arterial segments contracted by either noradrenaline or PGF2a in vitro. In pigtail monkeys (Macaca nemestrina), alprostadil increased cavernous arterial blood flow in vivo. The degree and duration of cavernous smooth muscle relaxation in this animal model was dose-dependent.\n- Alprostadil induces erection by relaxation of trabecular smooth muscle and by dilation of cavernosal arteries. This leads to expansion of lacunar spaces and entrapment of blood by compressing the venules against the tunica albuginea, a process referred to as the corporal veno-occlusive mechanism.\n\n【41】 ## Structure\n- CAVERJECT contains alprostadil as the naturally occurring form of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and is designated chemically as (11α,13E,15S)-11,15-dihydroxy-9-oxoprost-13-en-1-oic acid. The molecular weight is 354.49.\n- Alprostadil is a white to off-white crystalline powder with a melting point between 115° and 116°C. Its solubility at 35°C is 8000 micrograms (mcg) per 100 milliliter double distilled water.\n- The structural formula of alprostadil is represented below:\n\n【42】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Alprostadil (suppository) in the drug label.\n\n【43】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- For the treatment of erectile dysfunction, alprostadil is administered by injection into the corpora cavernosa. The absolute bioavailability of alprostadil has not been determined.\n- Following intracavernosal injection of 20 mcg alprostadil, mean peripheral plasma concentrations of alprostadil at 30 and 60 minutes after injection (89 and 102 picograms/mL, respectively) were not significantly greater than baseline levels of endogenous alprostadil (96 picograms/mL). Plasma levels of alprostadil were measured using a radioimmunoassay method. Alprostadil is bound in plasma primarily to albumin (81% bound) and to a lesser extent I-globulin IV-4 fraction (55% bound). No significant binding to erythrocytes or white blood cells was observed.\n- Alprostadil is rapidly converted to compounds, which are further metabolized prior to excretion. Following intravenous administration, approximately 80% of circulating alprostadil is metabolized in one pass through the lungs, primarily by beta- and omega-oxidation. Hence, any alprostadil entering the systemic circulation following intracavernosal injection is very rapidly metabolized. Following intracavernosal injection of 20 mcg alprostadil, peripheral levels of the major circulating metabolite, 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-PGE1, increased to reach a peak 30 minutes after injection and returned to pre-dose levels by 60 minutes after injection.\n- The metabolites of alprostadil are excreted primarily by the kidney, with almost 90% of an administered intravenous dose excreted in urine within 24 hours post-dose. The remainder of the dose is excreted in the feces. There is no evidence of tissue retention of alprostadil or its metabolites following intravenous administration.\n\n【44】 ### Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations\n- The potential effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of alprostadil has not been formally evaluated. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the mean (± SD) pulmonary extraction of alprostadil was 72% ± 15% in 11 elderly patients aged 65 years or older (mean, 71 ± 6 years) and 65% ± 20% in 6 young patients aged 35 years or younger (mean, 28 ± 5 years).\n- Alprostadil plasma concentrations were measured in 10 neonates (gestational age of 34 weeks in 2 infants and 38 to 40 weeks in 8 infants) receiving steady-state intravenous infusions of alprostadil to treat underlying cardiac malformations. Infusion rates of alprostadil ranged from 5 to 50 (median, 45) nanograms/kilogram/minute, resulting in alprostadil plasma concentrations ranging between 22 and 530 (median, 56) picograms/mL. The wide range of alprostadil plasma concentrations in neonates reflects high variability in individual clearances of alprostadil in this patient population.\n- The potential influence of gender on the pharmacokinetics of alprostadil has not been formally studied in healthy subjects. Two studies determined the pulmonary extraction of alprostadil following intravascular administration in 23 patients with ARDS. The mean (± SD) pulmonary extraction was 66% ± 20% in 17 male patients and 69% ± 18% in 6 female patients, suggesting that the pharmacokinetics of alprostadil are not influenced by gender.\n- The potential influence of race in the pharmacokinetics of alprostadil has not been formally evaluated.\n- The pharmacokinetics of alprostadil have not been formally studied in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency.\n- The pulmonary extraction of alprostadil following intravascular administration was reduced by 15% (66 ± 3.2% vs. 78 ± 2.4%) in patients with ARDS compared with a control group of patients with normal respiratory function who were undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Pulmonary clearance was found to vary as a function of cardiac output and pulmonary intrinsic clearance in a group of 14 patients with ARDS or at risk of developing ARDS following trauma or sepsis. In this study, the extraction efficiency of alprostadil ranged from subnormal (11%) to normal (90%), with an overall mean of 67%.\n- The potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between alprostadil and other agents has not been formally studied.\n\n【45】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. Rat reproductive studies indicate that alprostadil at doses of up to 0.2 mg/kg/day does not adversely affect or alter rat spermatogenesis, providing a 200-fold margin of safety compared with the usual human doses. The following battery of mutagenicity assays revealed no potential for mutagenesis: bacterial mutation (Ames), alkaline elution, rat micronucleus, sister chromatid exchange, CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation, and unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS).\n- A 1-year irritancy study was conducted in three groups of 5 male Cynomolgus monkeys injected intracavernosally twice weekly with either vehicle or 3 or 8.25 mcg of alprostadil/ injection. An additional two groups of 6 monkeys each were injected with vehicle or with 8.25 mcg/injection twice weekly as described previously plus they received multiple doses during weeks 44, 48, and 52. Three monkeys from each group were retained for a 4-week recovery period. There was no evidence of drug-related penile irritancy or nonpenile tissue lesions, which could be directly related to alprostadil. The irritancy, which was noted for control and treated monkeys, was considered to be a result of the injection procedure itself, and any lesions noted were shown to be reversible. At the end of the 4-week recovery period, the histological changes in the penis had regressed.\n\n【46】 # Clinical Studies\n- The safety and efficacy of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder was investigated in men with a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction due to psychogenic, vasculogenic, neurogenic, and/or mixed etiology in two well-controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2) and in one 6-month open-label study (Study 3).\n- One hundred fifty-three men with a mean age of 53 years (range 23–69 years) were enrolled. The study had three phases: a 2.5 week double-blind, in-office randomized crossover phase in which each man received placebo or 2.5 mcg, 5 mcg, 7.5 mcg, or 10 mcg of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder; a 2 week open-label, in-office dose-titration phase to identify the optimum home-use dose (the latter dose was defined as a dose inducing an erection sufficient for penetration and lasting ≤ 60 minutes); and a 4-week open-label, self-injection phase. In the double-blind phase, each dose of CAVERJECT was significantly more effective than placebo by clinical evaluation (\"full penile rigidity\") and by RigiScan criteria (≥ 70% rigidity for at least 10 minutes); there was no response to placebo. The percentage of responders increased with increasing doses of CAVERJECT. The overall response in the dose-ranging phases was 76% (117/153) by clinical evaluation and 51% (78/152) by RigiScan criteria. The optimum dose for self-injection ranged from 1.25 to 65 mcg (median 20 mcg). Seventy-three percent of the injections in 102 men who self-injected CAVERJECT resulted in satisfactory intercourse. Seventy-five percent of the patients remained on the dose identified during the dose-ranging phase; 17% and 8% of the patients slightly decreased or increased the dose, respectively. The mean duration of erection per injection was 70.8 minutes.\n- Two hundred ninety-six men with a mean age of 53.8 years (range 21–74 years) were enrolled in this parallel-design, double-blind study. The men were randomly assigned to one of five groups and received either a single dose of placebo, 2.5 mcg, 5 mcg, 10 mcg, or 20 mcg of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder. No patient responded to placebo. The differences in the response rates in both the clinical and the RigiScan evaluations between each of the doses of CAVERJECT and placebo were statistically significant. There was also a statistically significant dose-response relationship with higher clinical response rates and higher RigiScan response rates with increasing doses of CAVERJECT (with exception of the 10-mcg dose). The mean duration of erection after injection ranged from 12 minutes after the 2.5-mcg dose to 44 minutes after the 20-mcg dose and the relationship was linear (p = .025, linear regression analysis).\n- The safety and efficacy of CAVERJECT Sterile Powder was evaluated in a 6-month, open-label study in 683 men with a mean age of 58 years (range 20–79 years). The optimum dose of CAVERJECT was established by titration in 89% of men (606/683). Four hundred seventy-one men (69%) completed the 6-month study. At the start of the study, the mean dose was 17.7 mcg of CAVERJECT and at the end of the study it was 20.7 mcg. Eighty-seven percent of the 13,762 injections of CAVERJECT, administered by self-injection by the men in the study, resulted in satisfactory sexual activity. The mean duration of erection was 67.5 minutes.\n- The formulation of alprostadil contained in CAVERJECT IMPULSE includes the inactive excipient alpha cyclodextrin. This formulation was compared with CAVERJECT Sterile Powder in 87 men in a single-blind, crossover study designed to evaluate efficacy and safety. The doses used by the patients in the study ranged from 2.5 mcg to 20 mcg and were the same for both formulations. The efficacy of the two formulations was shown to be comparable, as assessed by the 30-point erectile function (EF) domain score from the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and by a physician-assessment score for erectile response. The mean EF domain scores for CAVERJECT Sterile Powder and the formulation contained in CAVERJECT IMPULSE were 26.6 (SD=5.3) and 27.6 (SD=3.8), respectively. The mean physician's assessment scores for CAVERJECT Sterile Powder and the formulation contained in CAVERJECT IMPULSE were 2.6 (SD=0.6) and 2.7 (SD=0.5), respectively, based on a scale of 0 (no tumescence) to 3 (full rigidity).\n\n【47】 # How Supplied\nCAVERJECT IMPULSE is supplied as a disposable, single-dose, dual chamber syringe system.

The desirable dose should be established in the physician's office.\n- Any reconstituted solution with precipitates or discoloration should be discarded. The CAVERJECT IMPULSE syringe system is designed for one use only and should be discarded after use. The delivery system and the needle must be properly discarded after use. Needles must not be re-used or shared with other persons. Patient instructions for administration are included in each package of CAVERJECT IMPULSE.\n- The dose of CAVERJECT that is established in the physician's office should not be changed by the patient without consulting the physician. The patient may expect an erection to occur within 5 to 20 minutes. A standard treatment goal is to produce an erection lasting no longer than 1 hour. Generally, CAVERJECT should be used no more than 3 times per week, with at least 24 hours between each use.\n- Patients should be aware of possible side effects of therapy with CAVERJECT; the most frequently occurring is penile pain after injection, usually mild to moderate in severity. A potentially serious adverse reaction with intracavernosal therapy is priapism. Accordingly, the patient should be instructed to contact the physician's office immediately or, if unavailable, to seek immediate medical assistance if an erection persists for longer than 4 hours.\n- The patient should report any penile pain that was not present before or that increased in intensity, as well as the occurrence of nodules or hard tissue in the penis to his physician as soon as possible. As with any injection, an infection is a possibility. Patients should be instructed to report to the physician any penile redness, swelling, tenderness or curvature of the erect penis. The patient must visit the physician's office for regular check-ups for assessment of the therapeutic benefit and safety of treatment with CAVERJECT.\n- Note: Use of intracavernosal CAVERJECT offers no protection from the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Individuals who use CAVERJECT should be counseled about the protective measures that are necessary to guard against the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n- The injection of CAVERJECT can induce a small amount of bleeding at the site of injection . In patients infected with blood-borne diseases, this could increase the risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases between partners.\n- In clinical trials, concomitant use of agents such as antihypertensive drugs, diuretics, antidiabetic agents (including insulin), or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had no effect on the efficacy or safety of CAVERJECT.\n\n【51】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Alprostadil (suppository) interaction has not been established.

Eukaryotic cells of which humans are composed contain membrane-bound compartments. The most important among these is the cell nucleus. It is the \"control center\" for each cell that has at least one. Separating the nucleus from the cellular cytoplasm is the double-membraned structure of the nuclear envelope.\nInside the nuclear membrane, including attached to the inner layer of this membrane, are a variety of substances serving special purposes. Depending on conditions, for a time, some of these compose the nucleosol, some compose the nucleohyaloplasm, and still others compose the nucleoplasm. Those substances and the special conditions present, even if temporary, in water can be the nucleosol. The nucleus cannot succeed in its efforts to control the cell without the special properties of the nucleosol.\n\n【2】 # Introduction\nGenerally, in chemistry a fluid suspension of a colloidal solid in a liquid is referred to as a sol. Whereas, a solution is a liquid mixture of a minor component (the solute) distributed uniformly within the major component (the solvent). In the nucleosol the liquid is water and the solvent is also water.\nUsing the water (data page) and the atomic radii of the elements (data page), a water molecule is approximately 120 x 187 pm in maximum diameters (average 154 pm). For its small size a water molecule (H2O), 18 Da, at about 38°C, under 1 atm of pressure (about 101325 kgm-1s-2), in large enough numbers to produce a liquid exhibits a high viscosity, short-range order, clustering, and miscibility.\nThe molecule is polar enough to produce and maintain ions when in a liquid. Liquid water can also dissolve organic compounds such as carbohydrates, fatty acids, amino acids, nucleobases, nucleosides, nucleotides, and peptides. Diffusion of molecules, ions, or particles in liquid water is depended upon by most living organisms. In cell biology, diffusion is the main form of transport for the smaller necessary materials such as amino acids within cells. Metabolism and respiration rely in part upon diffusion in addition to bulk or active processes. For example, in the alveoli of mammalian lungs, due to differences in partial pressures across the alveolar-capillary membrane, oxygen diffuses into the blood (another water-based liquid) and carbon dioxide diffuses out.\nDiffusion in liquid water depends on the lateral speed of the water molecule within liquid water. The lateral speed of a water molecule within liquid water appears to be unknown but can be estimated.Template:Wiktionarypar\nA plasm is a formative or formed material; i.e., something molded. Usually a formed material keeps it shape once the mold is removed. Should something be glassy or transparent it can be said to be hyaloid. Whether a fluid is molded or liquid is often a matter of viscosity and whether a fluid is transparent, translucent, or opaque is often a matter of absorption.\nBefore any internal molding exists within the nucleus or when any portion of the existing nucleoskeleton is dissolved and reconstructed elsewhere, genes within the euchromatin are transcribed, mRNAs are synthesized, and the mers that are to become new portions of the nucleoskeleton become part of the nucleosol: actins (microfilaments), lamins (intermediate filaments), and tubulins (microtubules).\nIn addition to internal molding by the nucleoskeleton there are local increases in viscosity due to macromolecular crowding that help to compose the nucleohyaloplasm and the nucleoplasm of which it is a part.\n\n【3】 # Water\nWater, whether a gas (water vapor) or liquid, is an amorphous substance.\nThe chemical bonding within many amorphous substances can produce short-range order while there is long-range disorder.\nThe short-range order is often a symmetrical arrangement of polyhedra. The long-range disorder can be approached with the disordered arrangement of space-filling polyhedra. These polyhedra are bonded together in a solid and undergo bond breaking through the transitions from solid to fluid. A model based on the configuron is an approach to understanding the viscosity changes that occur with changes in temperature.\nIn the kinetic theory of gases (such as water vapor) there is a correlation between average energy (Eav) and temperature (T):\nEav = 3/2 kT with Eav = 1/2 mvav2.\n⇒ vav2 = 3kT/m.\nFor a water molecule m = 18 Da, or 2.9913 x 10-23 gmolecule-1.\n⇒ vrms = √3kT/m = √3·1.382x10-23 J/K·306 K/(0.018 kg/6.022x1023) = 651 ms-1 at 33°C. vrms is the root mean square velocity.\nHowever, water in the nucleosol is a liquid, not a gas. For example, vrms (O2) in air at 25°C is 482.1 ms-1.\n\n【4】 ## Enthalpy of vaporization for water\nThe enthalpy of vaporization for water at 25°C is 44 kJmol-1. The enthalpy of vaporization can be viewed as the energy required to overcome the intermolecular interactions in water. The molecules in liquid water are held together by relatively strong hydrogen bonds. But care must be taken, however, when using enthalpies of vaporization to measure the strength of intermolecular forces, as these forces may persist to an extent in the gas phase (as is the case with hydrogen fluoride), and so the calculated value of the bond strength will be too low. With water the enthalpy of vaporization is larger than the available kinetic energy suggested by the ideal gas law:\nEav = 3/2 kT with Eav = 1/2 mvav2.\nThe lateral speed of a water molecule estimated using the enthalpy of vaporization is ~2,210 ms-1. For water vapor at 25°C, by the ideal gas law, vrms = 643 ms-1.\n\n【5】 ## Enthalpy of flow for liquid water\nAs a liquid much of the available kinetic energy is expressed through additional degrees of freedom. Some of this energy is in the form of intermolecular bonds. These bonds are a resistance to flow.\nWater has a resistance to flow that is considered relatively \"thin\", having a lower viscosity than other liquids such as vegetable oil. At 25°C, water has a nominal viscosity of 1.0 × 10-3 Pa∙s and motor oil has a nominal apparent viscosity of 250 ×  10-3 Pa∙s. Because of its density of \\rho = 1 g/cm3 (varies slightly with temperature), and its dynamic viscosity near 1 mPa·s, the viscosity values of water are, to rough precision, all powers of ten:\nDynamic viscosity:\nKinematic viscosity:\n{\\nu} = {\\mu}/{\\rho}, where {\\rho} is the density (kg/m3).\nIn water\n- viscosity is independent of pressure (except at very high pressure); and\n- viscosity tends to fall as temperature increases: from 1.79 cP to 0.28 cP in the temperature range from 0°C to 100°C; see temperature dependence of liquid viscosity for more details.\nThe viscosity of water is 8.94 × 10−4 Pa·s or 8.94 × 10−3 dyn·s/cm2 or 10−1 cP at about 25 °C.\nAs a function of temperature T (K):\nμ(Pa·s) = A × 10B/(T−C)\nwhere A=2.414 × 10−5 Pa·s ; B = 247.8 K ; and C = 140 K.\nWhereas, for a gas such as air, the viscosity is much lower and also depends mostly on temperature. At 15.0 °C, the viscosity of air is 1.78 × 10−5 kg/(m·s) or 1.78 × 10−4 cP. One can get the viscosity of air as a function of temperature from the Gas Viscosity Calculator.\nViscous flow, which results from viscosity, in amorphous materials such as water is a thermally activated process:\nwhere QL is the activation energy in the liquid state, T is temperature, R is the molar gas constant and AL is approximately a constant.\nWith\nwhere Hm is the enthalpy of motion of the broken hydrogen bonds. Hm ~ 1/2 mvav2. Here, the energy of motion for flow suggests a lateral speed of ~1590 ms-1.\nBecause of its small molecular size and ability to quickly rearrange, it cannot be made amorphous without resorting to specialized hyperquenching techniques. These produce amorphous ice, which has a quenching rate in the range of metallic glasses.\nThe higher the temperature of an amorphous material the higher the configuron concentration. The higher the configuron concentration the lower the viscosity. As configurons form percolating clusters, an amorphous solid can transition to a liquid. This clustering facilitates viscous flow. Thermodynamic parameters of configurons can be found from viscosity-temperature relationships.\n\n【6】 ## Short-range order\nLike a liquid an amorphous solid has a topologically disordered distribution of particles but elastic properties of an isotropic solid. The symmetry similarity of both liquid and solid phases cannot explain the qualitative differences in their behavior.\nDue to chemical bonding characteristics amorphous solids such as glasses do possess a high degree of short-range order with respect to local atomic polyhedra. The amorphous structure of glassy silica has no long range order but shows local ordering with respect to the tetrahedral arrangement of oxygen atoms around silicon atoms.\nThe most ubiquitous, and perhaps simplest, example of a hydrogen bond is\nfound between water molecules. This intermolecular hydrogen bonding is responsible for the high boiling point of water (100 °C) due to the high number of hydrogen bonds each molecule can have relative to its low molecular mass, and the great strength of these bonds. The length of hydrogen bonds depends on bond strength, temperature, and pressure.  The bond strength itself is dependent on temperature, pressure, bond angle, and environment (usually characterized by local dielectric constant). The typical length of a hydrogen bond (H-bond) in water is 1.97 Å (197 pm).\nEvery water molecule can be H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms.) Water has a very high boiling point, melting point and viscosity compared to other similar substances not conjoined by hydrogen bonds.\nThe exact number of hydrogen bonds in which a molecule in liquid water participates fluctuates with time and depends on the temperature. From liquid water simulations at 25 °C, each water molecule may participate in an average of 3.59 hydrogen bonds. At 100 °C, this number apparently decreases to 3.24 due to the increased molecular motion and decreased density, while at 0 °C, the average number of hydrogen bonds increases to 3.69. A more recent study found a much smaller number of hydrogen bonds: 2.357 at 25 °C. The differences may be due to the use of a different method for defining and counting the hydrogen bonds.\nWhere the bond strengths are more equivalent, one might instead find the atoms of two interacting water molecules partitioned into two polyatomic ions of opposite charge, specifically hydroxide (OH−) and hydronium (H3O+). (Hydronium ions are also known as 'hydroxonium' ions.)\nIndeed, in pure water under conditions of standard temperature and pressure, this latter formulation is applicable only rarely; on average about one in every 5.5 × 108 molecules gives up a proton to another water molecule, in accordance with the value of the dissociation constant for water under such conditions. It is a crucial part of the uniqueness of water.\nIt can be that a single hydrogen atom participates in two hydrogen bonds, rather than one.  This type of bonding is called \"bifurcated\". It was suggested that a bifurcated hydrogen atom is an essential step in water reorientation.\n\n【7】 ## Water clusters\nIn chemistry a water cluster is a discrete hydrogen bonded assembly or cluster of molecules of water . These clusters have been found experimentally or predicted in silico in various forms of water; in ice, in crystal lattices and in bulk liquid water, the simplest one being the water dimer (W2). Water manifests itself as clusters. Water clusters are also implicated in the stabilization of certain supramolecular structures. Supramolecular forces include hydrogen bonding that result in molecular self-assembly, folding, and mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures.\nIn silico, cyclic water clusters (H2O)n are found with n = 3 to 6. Many isomeric forms seem to exist for the hexamer: from ring, book, bag, cage, to prism shape with nearly identical energy.  Two cage-like isomers exist for heptamers and octamers: either cyclic or in the shape of a cube. Even larger clusters are predicted: the fullerene-like cluster W28 is called bucky water and even for a 280 water molecule monster icosahedral network (with each water molecule coordinated to 4 others) there is found a local energy minimum.\nWhen water is trapped in a liquid helium environment the hexamer occurs as a cyclic planar assembly but in the gas-phase it is the cage form and in an organic host (water trapped in the crystal lattice of an organic compound) the hexamer occurs as a conformation reminiscent of a cyclohexane chair. Cubic configurations for clusters in the range W8-W10 have been found.\nAnother heptamer (cyclic twisted nonplanar) is the conformation for water as a hydrate in a crystal structure.\nRecent research has revealed that liquid water at ambient conditions has two distinct structures, either a very disordered or a very tetrahedral (clusters) at any temperature, which are spatially separated. As temperature increases the very tetrahedral structure concentration decreases and the very disordered increases.\n\n【8】 ## Glass transition temperature of water\nThe glass transition temperature for water is about 136 K or -137°C. Factors in the formation of amorphous ice include ingredients that form a heterogenous mixture with water (such as is used in the production of ice cream), pressure (which may convert one form into another), and cryoprotectants that lower its freezing point and increase viscosity. Melting low-density amorphous ice (LDA) between 140 and 210 K through its transition temperature shows that it is more viscous than normal water. LDA has a density of 0.94 g/cm³, less dense than the densest water (1.00 g/cm³ at 277 K), but denser than ordinary ice.\nAmorphous ice is used in some scientific experiments, especially in electron cryomicroscopy of biomolecules. The individual molecules can be preserved for imaging in a state close to what they are in liquid water.\n\n【9】 ## Enthalpy of motion for water configurons\nA simple estimate of QL can be obtained by using the two temperatures 0°C and 100°C, where µ=1.79 x 10-3 Pa·s at 0°C and 0.28 x 10-3 Pa·s at 100°C, and solving for AL and QL. AL = 7.7 x 10-7 Pa·s and QL = 18 kJmol-1. R=8.314472 JK-1mol-1. Temperature is in K (273.15 + °C). QL includes the energy to break the hydrogen bond and move the configuron, as such HM ≤ QL. Using\nAL and QL to calculate the viscosity of water and comparing the calculated values to the experimentally determined ones for a range of temperature values shows that there is a systematic deviation at the higher temperatures. As the data for the viscosity of water vapor is available, AV and QV can be estimated: AV ~ 1.2 x 10-4 Pa·s and QV ~ - 6.0 kJmol-1. This added to the calculated configuron contribution\nimproves the fit to the liquid water viscosity data remarkably well, suggesting that like other gas molecules mixed into water, water vapor can also be.\nBut, here again the enthalpy of motion for water configurons suggests an average lateral speed of 1410 ms-1 and the enthalpy of dissolved water molecules suggests ~816 ms-1 which is also too high.\n\n【10】 ## Average speed for water molecules\nAlthough a liquid, some idea of the average speed for water molecules can be estimated using the self-diffusion coefficients for water at various temperatures. In the gas phase, \\, \\lambda is often defined as the diffusional mean free path, by assuming a simple approximate relation is exact:\nD = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda \\,v,\nwhere \\, v is the root mean square (rms) speed of the gas molecules:\nv = \\sqrt {{3\\, k\\, T}\\over{m}}\nwhere\n\\, m is the mass of the diffusing species. This approximate equation becomes exact when used to define the diffusional mean free path. If the diffusional mean free path were nominally the same number of µm as vrms, then, with the apparent self-diffusion coefficients (ADCs) ranging from 0.58 x 10-9 to 1.23 x 10-9 m2s-1, an approximate vrms would range from 34-50 µms-1 for λ from 34-50 µm. So if in liquid water λ is much greater, then vrms may be much less.\nThe self-diffusion coefficient, D, for pure liquid water has been measured for temperatures between 2°C and 225°C at pressures up to 1.75 kbar.\nThe average speeds of translation for various small molecules having the same kinetic energy as a water molecule, when water is at 500 nms-1, m = 18 Da, are Pi at 200 nms-1, m = 96 Da, adenosine (Ado) at 100 nms-1, m = 267 Da, and EC 3.1.3.5 at 6 nms-1, m = 140 kDa (homodimer), for the reaction:\nAdo + Pi  H2O + AMP,\nalthough EC 3.1.3.5 (70 kDa) may not occur within the nucleosol. But EC 3.1.3.5 NT5C1A cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A, m = 41 kDa can, with 82 kDa as a homodimer.\nBut, if the average speed of lateral translation for a water molecule were on the order of 500 nms-1, an average cell could not operate ~64,000 RNA polymerase II transcription units by diffusion of ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP to the RNA polymerase II transcription locations to produce, e.g., the mRNA of dystrophin, at the rate needed of ~42 NTPs per second. For a lateral speed of ~37 µms-1 of a water molecule, an average cell could operate ~14,400 transcription units by diffusion, ~75 µms-1, ~28,800 transcription units, and ~167 µms-1, ~64,000 transcription units. This in turn suggests λs of ~32, ~15, and ~6.9 µm.\nSignal transduction also depends on the lateral speed of a water molecule (diffusion) to succeed. With completion times on the order of a few minutes, this would mean the speed of a water molecule is on the order of 15 µms-1 and not much faster due to benefits from concentration. Increased lateral speed of a water molecule much above ~35 µms-1 may make signal transduction occur too quickly.\nThe diffusion of solutes and macromolecules in aqueous cellular compartments such as the nucleosol within the nucleoplasm and the nucleus is required for numerous processes including metabolism, signaling and protein-protein interactions. Diffusion of small molecules through the cytosol is about fourfold slower than in pure water, due mostly to collisions with large numbers of macromolecules. Recent measurements have indicated unexpectedly high mobilities (µ) of small solutes and macromolecules.\nBy the Einstein relation,\n\\mu = \\frac{q}{k\\, T}D,\nthus, approximately, for water, solutes and macromolecules, mobilities are directly proportional to vrms:\n\\mu = \\frac{q}{2k\\, T}\\lambda \\,v_{\\rm rms}.\n\n【11】 # Miscible molecules\nMiscible molecules such as O2, CO2, N2, and NH3 occur in any bodily fluid. These molecules are mixed into the liquid, but not turned into ions. Water contains only 1/20 parts O2. N2 mixes into the bloodstream and body fats.\n\n【12】 # Inorganic ions\nThe inorganic ions in the nucleosol should be very similar in type and concentration to the cytosol as each sol is free to interdiffuse with the other.\nRelative to the outside of a cell, the concentration of Ca2+ is low. In addition to sodium and potassium ions the nucleosol also contains Mg2+. Some of these magnesium ions are associated with incoming ribonucleoside triphosphate (NTP) as they enter the catalytic center for transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP) II. The remaining typical ions found in any cytosol include chloride and bicarbonate.\nIntranuclear posttranscriptional modifications such as mRNA editing convert cytidine to uridine within some mRNA. This conversion by enzyme EC 3.5.4.5 though infrequent releases ammonia or produces ammonium (NH4+) in solution. This enzyme is Zn2+ dependent. The zinc ion in the active site plays a central role in the proposed catalytic mechanism, activating a water molecule to form a hydroxide ion (OH-) that performs a nucleophilic attack on the substrate.\nCells also maintain an intracellular iron ion (Fe2+) homeostasis. Cu2+ serves as a cofactor. Iron homeostasis involves interconversions of Fe2+ with Fe3+.\nWhen a nucleotide is incorporated into a growing DNA or RNA strand by a polymerase, pyrophosphate (PPi) is released. The pyrophosphate anion has the structure P2O74−, and is an acid anhydride of phosphate. It is unstable in aqueous solution and in the absence of enzymic catalysis hydrolyzes extremely slowly into inorganic phosphate HPO42− (orthophosphate, Pi) in all but highly acidic media.\nEnzyme EC 3.6.1.1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of PPi to Pi:\nPPi + H2O  2 Pi.\nThe enzyme is Mg2+ binding, occurs in the cytosol, has a 33 kDa form, and no NLS. The enzymes of EC 3.6.1.1, in general, exist as homooligomers.\nUnless otherwise noted, minor ion concentrations are from the List of human blood components.\n\n【13】 # Carbohydrates\nOf the carbohydrates, monosaccharides and oligosaccharides are water soluble. Polysaccharides on the other hand tend to be insoluble in water. As to alcohols, there are two opposing solubility trends: the tendency of the polar OH to promote solubility in water, and of the carbon chain to resist it. Thus, methanol, ethanol, and propanol are miscible in water because the hydroxyl group wins out over the short carbon chain. Butanol, with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble because of a balance between the two trends. Alcohols of five or more carbons (pentanol and higher) are effectively insoluble in water because of the hydrocarbon chain's dominance.\n\n【14】 # Fatty acids\nShort chain carboxylic acids such as formic acid and acetic acid are miscible with water and dissociate to form reasonably strong acids (pKa 3.77 and 4.76, respectively). Longer-chain fatty acids do not show a great change in pKa.  Nonanoic acid, for example, has a pKa of 4.96.  However, as the chain length increases the solubility of the fatty acids in water decreases very rapidly, so that the longer-chain fatty acids have very little effect on the pH of a solution.\nWhen the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream. The glycerol component can be converted to glucose by the liver and provides energy for cellular metabolism.\n\n【15】 # Amino acids\nThe average mass range for amino acids: 75 - 222 Da. By comparison a water molecule is 18 Da. In addition to the proteinogenic standard amino acids, there are a number of other amino acids (aa) involved in the synthesis of the proteinogenic aa: citrulline (Cit), cystathionine (Cth), homocysteine (Hcy), ornithine (Orn), sarcosine (Sar) and taurine (Tau), for example. As Tau does not contain a carboxyl group it is not an aa, but since in its place it does contain a sulfonate group, it may be called an amino sulfonic acid.\n\n【16】 # Nucleobases\nPurine (Pur) 120 Da is not a protein. The purines are the most widely distributed naturally occurring nitrogen-containing heterocycle. The purine nucleobases include adenine (A) 135 Da, hypoxanthine (Hx) 136 Da, guanine (G) 151 Da, and xanthine (Xan) 152 Da. The pyrimidines include pyrimidine (Pyr) 80 Da, also a heterocycle and naturally occurring, cytosine (C) 111 Da, uracil (U) 112 Da, thymine (T) 126 Da, and queuine (Q) 275 Da.\n\n【17】 # Nucleosides\nNucleosides are glycosylamines, a nucleobase linked to a ribose or deoxyribose ring. Examples include purines: adenosine (Ado) 267 Da, guanosine (Guo) 283 Da, and inosine (Ino) 268 Da, and pyrimidines: cytidine (Cyd) 243 Da, thymidine (Thd) 242 Da, uridine (Urd) 244 Da, and queuosine (Quo) 409 Da. When the nucleobase is attached to deoxyribose, a 'd' is placed in front of the abbreviation, e.g., dCyd is deoxycytidine 227 Da and the molar mass decreases by one oxygen from Cyd.\n\n【18】 # Nucleotides\nNucleotides such as orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) range in size from 176 Da (OMP) to 523 Da (GTP). The purine nucleotides involved in RNA or DNA synthesis include: inosine monophosphate (IMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The pyrimidine nucleotides involved include OMP, cytidine triphosphate (CTP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), and thymidine triphosphate (TTP) for DNA in place of UTP. Although rare, higher phosphates do occur such as adenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4) 587 Da. The deoxyribonucleotides have a 'd' in front, like dCTP, except for the thymidine deoxyribonucleotides.\n\n【19】 # Cofactors\nMany cofactors are involved in the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. They range in size from ascorbic acid (ASA) 176 Da and biotin (BIO) 244 Da, which are vitamins, to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) 744 Da and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) 785 Da.\nOne of the coenzymes essential for the synthesis of amino acids is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) 663 Da. Besides assembling NAD+ de novo from simple amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing nicotinamide. The three natural compounds containing the nicotinamide ring and used in these salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (Na), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). These compounds are also produced within cells, when the nicotinamide group is released from NAD+ in ADP-ribose transfer reactions. Indeed, the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the cell nucleus, which may compensate for the high level of reactions that consume NAD+ in this organelle. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase 1 (NMNAT1) (EC 2.7.7.1) catalyzes a key step of NAD synthesis. It has a nuclear localization signal (NLS). NMNAT1 may be a substrate for nuclear kinases.\n\n【20】 # Peptides\nPeptides are short polymers formed from the linking, in a defined order, of α-amino acids. Proteins are polypeptide molecules (or consist of multiple polypeptide subunits). The distinction is that peptides are short and polypeptides/proteins are long. The digestion of dietary proteins produces dipeptides which are absorbed more rapidly than aa. A dipeptide is a molecule consisting of two amino acids joined by a single peptide bond. Examples of dipeptides include carnosine (Car) 244 Da, of the amino acids β-alanine (β-Ala) and histidine (His), homocarnosine (Hcn) 258 Da consisting of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and His, and anserine (Ans) 240 Da.\n\n【21】 ## Oligopeptides\nSome tripeptides and tetrapeptides are synthesized in humans. Oligopeptides can range up to 40 aa (9 kDa) generally.\n\n【22】 ## Small proteins (polypeptides)\nDue to the size limitation of the nuclear pore, these polypeptides would range from 9 kDa to <70 kDa and not need or have a NLS. For example, emerin 18 kDa (no NLS) mediates inner nuclear membrane anchorage to the nuclear lamina, regulates the flux of beta-catenin into the nucleus, and interacts with nuclear actin.\nOn the other hand, LEMD1 (20.3 kDa) is involved in the glutamine (Gln) metabolic process and has a NLS.\nMany of the polypeptides are enzymes including peptidases and kinases.\n\n【23】 ## Proteases\nCarnosinase occurs as EC 3.4.13.3 (Xaa-His dipeptidase) with Zn2+ as cofactor, 3.4.13.18 (cytosol nonspecific dipeptidase) with Zn2+ as cofactor and Mn2+ activation, and 3.4.13.20 (beta-Ala-His dipeptidase), activated by Cd2+ and citrate, catalyzing the reaction\nCar + H2O  His + β-Ala.\nIt is intracellular to the cytosol and can occur in 14 kDa, 35 kDa, and 44 kDa sizes, often forming a homodimer. As a nonspecific dipeptidase, it degrades a number of dipeptides including Car, Ans and Hcn as EC 3.4.13.3 and EC 3.4.13.20 per the reaction:\nHcn + H2O  γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) + His.\nOligopeptides can be degraded by aminopeptidases such as EC 3.4.11.6 19-68 kDa forms (intracellular to the cytosol) with Zn2+ as cofactor and activation by Cl- per the reactions:\n-ligopeptide (n) + H2O  Lys + oligopeptide (n-1)\n\n【24】 ## Synthases\nEnzymes EC 2.3.1.37 (cofactor: pyridoxal phosphate, PLP) aminolevulinate, delta-, synthase 1 (ALAS1) and aminolevulinate, delta-, synthase 2 (ALAS2) anabolically synthesize glycine (Gly) from the amino acid 5-amino-4-oxovaleric acid (ALA) in the two-step reaction:\n5-aminolevulinate (C5H9NO3) (ALA) + CO2  2-amino-3-oxoadipate (C6H9NO5)\n2-amino-3-oxoadipate + CoA (C21H36N7O16P3S)  succinyl-CoA (C25H40N7O19P3S) + Gly\n5-aminolevulinate + CoA + CO2  succinyl-CoA + Gly\nThe mRNA for ALAS1 is 82 kDa, the intracellular precursor is a homodimer of 71 kDa, and the mitochondrial mature protein is 65 kDa. But, ALAS1 also occurs in a 30 kDa form.\nCTP synthase EC 6.3.4.2 is the final step in the de novo synthesis of CTP from UTP. As a monomer 67 kDa or dimer it is inactive because three monomers contribute to ligand binding at the active site. The active form is a homotetramer (a dimer of dimers), with no NLS, intracellular to the cytosol, for the following reactions.\nUTP + Gln + ATP + H2O  CTP + Glu + ADP + Pi\nATP + UTP + NH3  ADP + Pi + CTP\nThe reactions\n2 ATP + HCO3- + NH3  2 ADP + Pi + carbamoyl phosphate (multistep)\nGln + H2O  Glu + NH3\n2 ADP + Pi + Glu + carbamoyl phosphate  2 ATP + Gln + HCO3- + H2O\nare catalyzed by EC 6.3.5.5 carbamoyl-phosphate synthase II (CAD). It has no NLS, occurs as a homohexamer, uses Zn2+ as a cofactor and is intracellular to the nucleus. It does occur in a 22 kDa form.\n\n【25】 ## Kinases\nEC 3.6.1.5 (cofactor: Ca2+) catalyzes the following reactions:\nAMP + Pi  ADP + H2O\nAMP + 2 Pi  ATP + 2 H2O\nCDP + Pi  CTP + H2O\nCa2+ or Mg2+ can serve as activating ions. ENTPD1 (CD39) is a 56 kDa protein. CD39 associates with RanBPM (RANBP9). RANBP9 (90 kDa) binds Ran, a small GTP binding protein that is essential for the translocation of RNA and proteins through the nuclear pore complex. RanBPM localizes in the nucleus and cytoplasm, but RanBPM has no NLS. CANT1 (EC 3.6.1.6 and 3.6.1.5) 49 kDa catalyzes similar reactions:\na nucleotide + Pi  a nucleoside diphosphate + H2O,\nalso acting on IDP, GDP, UDP and on D-ribose 5-diphosphate. ENTPD7 (EC 3.6.1.-) occurs in the mouse nucleus.\nEnzymes 2.4.2.7 adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) 19.4 kDa (forms a dimer, 38.8 kDa) is intracellular (cytoplasm) and 2.4.2.8 hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) 24 kDa (forms a tetramer, 96 kDa) is intracellular (cytosolic) catalyze the following reaction:\nAdenine + 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP)  AMP + PPi\nNeither APRT nor HPRT1 has a NLS. APRT is a dimer in solution at pH 6.5, but a monomer at pH 8.0, and like HPRT1 needs Mg2+, or Mn2+.\nEnzymes EC 3.6.1.5 ATP pyrophosphohydrolase, ADPase/ADP synthase ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (ENTPD1) 56 kDa catalyzes the conversion of AMP into ADP . Cofactor: Ca2+. Ca2+ or Mg2+ can serve as activating ions. Also acts on ADP, and on other nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates.\nEnzymes EC 2.7.4.6 nucleoside-diphosphate kinases A, B, C, D (NDKA-D) catalyzes the following reaction inside the nucleosol as it is intracellular (nucleus) and each gene is translated as a 7-11 kDa particle. However, these kinases exist either as tetramers (28-44 kDa) in bacteria or hexamers (42-66 kDa). Once the hexamer has formed the particle may be too big to pass through the nuclear pores. NDKA has been shown to mediate transcription, associate with a promoter region of a gene, and be a member of the SET or INHAT complex which can modulate gene expression. Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase does form nuclear and cytoplasmic hexamers. NDKA-D do not have a NLS.\nADP + GTP  ATP + GDP\n\n【26】 ## Transaminases\nIn catabolic transamination, with PLP as a cofactor, EC 2.6.1.2 transfers the amine from glutamic acid (glutamate) (Glu) to alanine (Ala) via a two step reaction:\nPLP + Glu  pyridoxamine monophosphate (PMP) + α-ketoglutarate (2-oxoglutarate)\nPMP + pyruvate  PLP + Ala\npyruvate + Glu  Ala + 2-oxoglutarate.\nAlthough this enzyme has several different names, e.g., alanine transaminase, glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), or alanine aminotransferase, it can occur as a monomer of 55 kDa or homodimer of 101 kDa, and as either a cytosolic (GPT1), or mitochondrial form (GPT2).\n\n【27】 ## Synthetases\nThe reactions\nATP + Glu + NH3 (or NH4+)  ADP + Pi + Gln\nATP + Asp + NH4+  ADP + Pi + Asn\nare catalyzed by the enzyme EC 6.3.1.2 glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamine-ammonia ligase (GLUL). GLUL 42 kDa is intracellular, occurs as a homooctamer, also as 12 kDa and 22 kDa forms, and complexes with phosphate, ADP, and Mn2+.\n\n【28】 # Histone pools in the nucleosol\nHistones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 are in the nucleosol, and H2B, H3, and H4 are also in the cytosol.\n\n【29】 # Enzyme activity\nEC 2.4.1.101 (UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase) occurs and is active in the nuclesol.\nBriefly, any enzyme that can occur as a monomer small enough to pass through the nuclear pore complex before it becomes a dimer or larger oligomer or polymer can occur and act in the nucleosol, whether it has a NLS or not.\n\n【30】 # Exonucleosol proteins\nKeratin type II cytoskeletal 80 (KRT80) as a monomer is 51 kDa (variant 2) and thereby can diffuse into the nucleosol, variant 3 is 54 kDA, and variant 1 is 47 kDa. KRT80 is an intermediate filament protein that makes up one of the major structural fibers of epithelial cells.\nWhile keratin type I cytoskeletal 13 (KRT13) is usually paired with keratin type II cytoskeletal 4 (KRT4) 64 kDa, KRT13 has a 46 kDa variant 2 and a 39 kDA variant (KRT-13-201). Keratins only assemble as heteropolymers: a type I and a type II protein forming a heterodimer.\nPolo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) phosphorylizes KRT4 at serine 157. PLK1 27 kDa occurs in the nucleoplasm and cytosol, is ATP binding, and engages in protein amino acid phosphorylation. PLK1 associates with, binds to, and phosphorylates alpha-, beta- and gamma-tubulins in interphase independent of the microtubule polymerization state.\nIntermediate filaments (IFs) are composed of proteins (40-210 kDa) that self-assemble into complex cytoskeletal fibers. Inside an interphase cell, ~5% of the total intermediate filament protein exists in a soluble tetrameric form. Newly synthesized intermediate filament protein is soluble and self-assembly proceeds at concentrations >40-50 µg/ml.\nHomodimers of IF proteins can form and be added to already forming IFs but cannot assemble into IFs themselves.\n\n【31】 # History of the nucleosol\nWhile earlier articles or book sections may exist mentioning the term \"nucleosol\", a book from 1970 online refers to the nucleosol.\n\n【32】 The content on this page was first contributed by: Henry A.

The most reliable signs of severe acute liver injury are prolonged international normalized ratio ( ≥ 1.5) and any degree of hepatic encephalopathy, in patients without preexisting liver disease and the illness duration is less than 26 weeks.\nAcute liver failure was further classified depending on the interval between the onset of jaundice and the onset of encephalopathy into: \"Hyperacute \" (interval0-7 days), \"Acute\" (interval 8-28days), \"sub-acute\" (interval 29days to 12 weeks), \"late -onset\" (interval 12 -26 weeks).\n- Acute liver failure was further classified depending on the interval between the onset of jaundice and the onset of encephalopathy into: \"Hyperacute \" (interval0-7 days), \"Acute\" (interval 8-28days), \"sub-acute\" (interval 29days to 12 weeks), \"late -onset\" (interval 12 -26 weeks).\n- Chronic liver failure - When liver failure occurs as a result of cirrhosis. It usually means that the liver has been failing gradually for some time (more than 26 weeks), possibly for years. This is called chronic liver failure or End-stage Liver Disease (ESLD).\n- Acute on Chronic Liver Failure - when acute hepatic decompensation observed in patients with preexisting chronic liver disease within 4 weeks, characterized by one or more extrahepatic organ failures and with a significantly increased risk of death.\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\n- Hepatic injury results in hepatocyte necrosis which occurs due to ATP depletion causing cellular swelling and cell membrane disruptions. Most cases of Acute liver failure (except acute fatty liver of pregnancy and Reye syndrome) will have massive hepatocyte necrosis and/or apoptosis which ultimately result in liver failure. Secondary multi-organ failure occurs after hepatic failure.\nThe pathophysiology of ALF can be divided into cause‐specific liver injury pathophysiologies and pathophysiology related to the occurrence of secondary multi-organ failure.\n- Cause-specific pathophysiologies:\nImmune-mediated hepatocellular injury: :\nHepatotrophic virus family(HAV, HBV, HCV)\nDirect hepatocellular injury:\nToxic metabolites: Acetaminophen, metabolic disorders\nAcetaminophen is predominantly metabolized in the liver through glucuronidation and sulfation, with a small amount metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Its metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), generated via the P450 pathway is subsequently conjugated by glutathione. In the setting of acetaminophen overdose, glutathione stores may become depleted, resulting in direct hepatocyte injury via NAPQI\nToxins of Amanita phalloides(amatoxins, phallotoxins, and virotoxins) which inhibit RNA polymerases, cause necrosis of the liver, also partly in the kidney, with the cellular changes causing the fragmentation and segregation of all nuclear components.\nIschemic hepatocellular injury:\nShock\nSIRS\n- Immune-mediated hepatocellular injury: :\n- Hepatotrophic virus family(HAV, HBV, HCV)\n- Direct hepatocellular injury:\n- Toxic metabolites: Acetaminophen, metabolic disorders\n- Acetaminophen is predominantly metabolized in the liver through glucuronidation and sulfation, with a small amount metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Its metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), generated via the P450 pathway is subsequently conjugated by glutathione. In the setting of acetaminophen overdose, glutathione stores may become depleted, resulting in direct hepatocyte injury via NAPQI\n- Toxins of Amanita phalloides(amatoxins, phallotoxins, and virotoxins) which inhibit RNA polymerases, cause necrosis of the liver, also partly in the kidney, with the cellular changes causing the fragmentation and segregation of all nuclear components.\n- Ischemic hepatocellular injury:\n- SIRS\n- Secondary multiorgan failure is often a result of the initial massive proinflammatory response in reaction to pathogen‐specific molecular patterns (PAMPs) from heterotropic viruses as well as a response to damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as histones, DNA, and high mobility group box‐1 proteins released from injured cells upon hepatocyte death secondary to toxic etiologies which generating a systemic inflammatory response syndrome( SIRS) followed by a compensatory anti‐inflammatory response leading to immune cell dysfunction and sepsis. Dysregulation of systemic vascular tone leads to low systemic vascular resistance, causing hypotension and peripheral vasodilation results in poor pulmonary oxygen exchange, impaired tissue oxygen delivery, and lactic acidosis. Cerebrovascular and renovascular tone are most affected, resulting in cerebral hyperperfusion and hepatic encephalopathy along with functional renal failure. In the brain, altered blood-brain barrier occurs secondary to inflammatory mediators leading to microglial activation, accumulation of glutamine secondary to ammonia crossing the BBB, and subsequent oxidative stress leading to depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). This ultimately leads to astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema and hepatic encephalopathy.\n- To put it in the short statement,Acute liver failure results in hemodynamic instability. It is initially associated with hypovolemia due to a combination of poor oral intake and increased fluid loss. As Acute liver failure progresses, the release of circulatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators cause systemic vasodilation and worsens hypotension. The end results are low systemic vascular resistance, systemic hypotension, and increased cardiac output resembling septic shock. These hemodynamic changes lead to decreased peripheral tissue oxygenation and eventually multiorgan failure.\n- Chronic liver failure is the result of Cirrhosis which is is an advanced stage of liver fibrosis that is accompanied by distortion of the hepatic vasculature.\n- The pathogenesis of Acute-on-chronic liver failure is unclear but many theories are proposed in such as neutrophilic dysfunction that increases the risk of infections, circulating changes, oxidative stress, and toxin hypothesis.\n\n【5】 # Causes\nCauses for Acute liver failure:\n\n【6】 ## Drug-induced acute liver injury\n- Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is the most common cause of ALF in the U.S. and Europe. It results from excessive ingestion of acetaminophen either from suicidal ideations or inadvertent use of supratherapeutic doses for pain control. Increased production of the toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine causes hepatic injury. Acetaminophen toxicity is dose-related with typically at least 10 gram/day required to cause ALF.\n- Drug-induced liver injury is the cause of about 50% of ALF cases in the U.S. Many over-the-counter medications,  weight loss medications, and prescription medications can lead to acute liver injury. Liver injury from drugs could be dose-dependent and predictable (acetaminophen toxicity) or idiosyncratic and unpredictable (carbamazepine, valproate).\n\n【7】 ## Viral hepatitis\n- Viral hepatitis is the most common cause of acute liver failure worldwide and is the predominant cause of ALF in developing countries. The most common viruses are hepatitis A, B, and E infections as well as other rare viral causes including herpes simplex virus, epstein-barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and parvoviruses.\n\n【8】 ## Mushroom poisoning\n- Amanita phalloides is the most common mushroom to cause hepatotoxicity. History of recent mushroom ingestion should be obtained in patients who present with severe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Symptoms usually start within 6 to 12 hours of mushroom ingestion. The diagnosis of mushroom poisoning is made clinically because no blood test is available to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【9】 ## Causes of chronic liver failure\n- Chronic liver failure usually occurs in the context of cirrhosis. Cirrhosis must be differentiated from other causes of abnormal liver function tests. In patients with stable cirrhosis, decompensation may occur due to various causes:\n- Constipation\n- Infection\n- Increased alcohol intake\n- Medications\n- Bleeding from esophageal varices or dehydration\n\n【10】 # Differential Diagnosis\n- Acute liver failure is a distinctive syndrome that is not confused with other conditions. The major differential diagnosis is in the cause of acute liver failure, whether viral (hepatitis A, B, C, D or E), autoimmune, metabolic (Wilson disease), drug-induced or idiopathic.\n\n【11】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- Acute liver failure affects approximately 2,000–3,000 Americans each year.Acute liver failure was responsible for 3.3% of US liver transplants in 2017.Drug-induced hepatotoxicity occurs for more than 50% of acute liver failure cases including Acetaminophen toxicity (42%) and idiosyncratic drug reactions. Nearly 15% of cases remain of indeterminate etiology.\n- Chronic liver disease and Cirrhosis are the 12(th) leading cause of death in the United States.\n\n【12】 # Risk factors\n- Risk factors for acute liver failure\nChronic alcohol abuse\nPoor nutritional status\nFemale sex\nAge >40 years\nPregnancy\nChronic hepatitis B\nChronic pain and narcotic use\nComplementary and alternative medicine hepatotoxicity\nAcetaminophen and antidepressant therapy\nHIV and hepatitis C coinfection\n- Chronic alcohol abuse\n- Poor nutritional status\n- Female sex\n- Age >40 years\n- Chronic hepatitis B\n- Chronic pain and narcotic use\n- Complementary and alternative medicine hepatotoxicity\n- Acetaminophen and antidepressant therapy\n- HIV and hepatitis C coinfection\n\n【13】 # Screening\nNot applicable\n\n【14】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n\n【15】 ## Natural History\n- Patients who develop severe acute liver injury without preexisting chronic liver disease, often demonstrate significant liver dysfunction with coagulopathy (defined as an international normalized ratio (INR)≥1.5) and are designated as acute liver failure (ALF) when any degree of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is present.\n\n【16】 ## Clinical features in Hepatic failure and complications\n\n【17】 ## Brain\n- Hepatic encephalopathy\n- Cerebral edema\n- Intracranial hypertension\n- Seizures\n\n【18】 ## Liver\n- Loss of metabolic function\n- Hypoglycemia\n- Hyperammonemia\n- Coagulopathy\n- Lactic acidosis\n\n【19】 ## Kidney and adrenal\n- Hepatorenal syndrome\n- Electrolyte abnormalities\n\n【20】 ## System\n- Systemic inflammatory response\n- Immunosuppression\n- Catabolic state\n\n【21】 ## Heart\n- High output state\n- Subclinical myocardial injury\n- Hepatocardiac syndrome\n\n【22】 ## Pancreas\n- Pancreatitis\n\n【23】 ## Lungs\n- Acute lung injury\n- Acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS)\n- Hepatopulmonary syndrome\n\n【24】 ## Bone marrow\n- Frequent suppression\n- Anemia\n- Thrombocytopenia\n\n【25】 ## Prognosis\n\n【26】 ## prognosis of Acute liver failure\n- The prognosis in  patients with acute liver failure is highly variable and depends on the etiology, subtypes (hyperacute, acute,\\.), age, and the degree of coagulopathy. Determining the prognosis for these patients is vital. The overall mortality of ALF is currently between 30% to 40%. Liver transplantation has dramatically improved short-term survival in patients with acute liver failure. Still, 25% to 45% of patients will survive with medical treatment.\n- Identification of patients who will eventually require liver transplantation should be addressed through continuous medical assessment. The most widely accepted prognostic tool for patients who present with ALF is King's College Criteria (KCC) .Although his scoring system is generally quite accurate in predicting poor prognosis and, along with clinical judgment, is useful for ensuring timely transfer to a liver transplant center in adults, but  data suggest they may not reliably predict outcomes in the pediatric population.\n\n【27】 ## Prognosis of chronic liver failure\n- Patients with compensated cirrhosis have a median survival of 6–12 years. Decompensation and end stage liver disease occurs in 5%–7% annually; median survival then declines to 2 years.\n- Several retrospectives studies have reported in patients with end-stage liver disease, the MELD score to have similar predictive value to the king's college criteria for mortality associated with ALF.\n\n【28】 # Diagnosis\nHistory and Symptoms | Physical Examination | Laboratory Findings | Electrocardiogram | Chest X Ray | CT | MRI | Echocardiography or Ultrasound | Other Imaging Findings | Other Diagnostic Studies | Clinical prediction rules\n\n【29】 # History and symptoms\n\n【30】 ##

Imaging\n- Imaging is not required for diagnosis but it is useful in the correct clinical context, for example:\n- Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler to confirm portal and hepatic vein patency\n- CXR for evaluation of lungs\n- Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head for patients with Hepatic encephalopathy\n\n【51】 # Treatment\nThe most important part of the management of hepatic failure involves the timely diagnosis of it. Making a timely diagnosis in a patient who presents with liver dysfunction and an altered mental state remains the single most important management step for the clinician, as a delay can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. Although there is no proven therapy for ALF, understanding the progression of ALF, from loss of hepatocytes to the development of multiorgan failure, helps the clinician in disease-specific complication management.\n\n【52】 ## The management of Hepatic failure should involve\n- Specific Treatment\n- Supportive and symptomatic management\n- Management of complications\n- Emergency therapies\n- Liver transplantation\n\n【53】 # 1. Specific treatment:\n- Identification of the etiology and initiation of specific treatment.\n\n【54】 ## Acetaminophen intoxication\n- Oral NAC: 140 mg/kg loading dose, then 70 mg/kg every 4 hours until discontinued by hepatology or transplantation surgery attending physician\nOr\n- Or\n- IV NAC: 150 mg/kg loading dose, then 50 mg/kg IV over 4 hours, then 100 mg/kg IV over 16 hours as a continuous infusion until discontinued by hepatology or transplantation surgery attending physician\n\n【55】 ## Amanita phalloides(mushroom poisoning)\n- Charcoal: via NGT every 4 hours alternating with silymarin\n- Penicillin G: 1 g/kg/day IV and\n- NAC (Dosing as for acetaminophen overdose.),\n- Silymarin: 300 mg PO/NGT every 12 hours,\n- Legalon-SIL: 5 mg/kg/day IV (given in 4 divided doses) or 5 mg/kg IV loading dose followed by 20 mg/kg/day via continuous infusion\n\n【56】 ## Herpes simplex virus infection\n- Acyclovir: 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours (using IBW) adjusted for kidney function\n\n【57】 ## Cytomegalovirus infection\n- Ganciclovir: 5 mg/kg IV every 12 hours (using IBW) adjusted for kidney function\n\n【58】 ## Autoimmune hepatitis\n- Methylprednisolone\n\n【59】 ## Hepatitis B virus infection\n- Entecavir (taken on an empty stomach) or tenofovir at standard renal adjusted doses\n\n【60】 ## Acute fatty liver of pregnancy /HELLP\n- Delivery of the fetus\n\n【61】 # 2. Supportive and symptomatic management\n- Timely transfer to the critical care unit\n- Check clinical status continuously\n- Fluid restriction\n- IV H2 Blockers or PPI\n- Antibiotics\n- Prevention of hypoglycemia\n- Avoid sedation\n- 12 hourly electrolytes and coagulation studies\n\n【62】 # 3. Management of Complications:\n\n【63】 # Treatment of Hepatic encephalopathy:\nEven minimal hepatic encephalopathy may benefit from treatment.\n- Reduce protein intake:\nTraditionally it has been presumed that excessive protein intake leads to increased generation of ammonia, which, in the setting of severe liver impairment, will accumulate and worsen the hepatic encephalopathy. While very large protein loads (such as gastrointestinal hemorrhage, because blood is rich in protein) are known to precipitate encephalopathy, the need for patients with chronic liver disease patients to be protein restricted has been disproven. Indeed, because chronic liver disease is a catabolic state, a protein restricted diet would lead to protein malnutrition and a negative nitrogen balance.\n- Correction of hypokalemia:\nConcomitant hypokalemia should be corrected as hypokalemia increases renal ammonia production and may promote conversion of ammonium into ammonia which can cross the blood-brain barrier.\n- Lactulose:\nLactulose is a compound that will cause osmotic diarrhea, thus lessening the time available for intestinal bacteria to metabolize protein into ammonia within the bowel. Further, it acidifies the environment in the lumen of the bowel. This promotes the conversion of lumenal ammonia (NH3) to ammonium (NH4+) which, by which virtue of its net charge, should be less readily absorbed into the bloodstream from the bowel lumen. Despite this theoretical and appealing mechanism,  a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials by the international Cochrane Collaboration found benefit, but suggests there is little evidence for its preferred use to treat hepatic encephalopathy. Indeed, any drug (laxative) which speeds up transit through the bowel thereby lessening the time available for bacteria to metabolize protein into ammonia, works just as well.\n- Antibiotics:\nAntibiotics may be given to kill bacteria present in the bowel thereby decreasing bacterial conversion of protein to ammonia (and other toxic substances)  there. Although effective, neomycin, a non-absorbable aminoglycoside antibiotic, is essentially contraindicated; it has been found that a proportion of the ingested dose is indeed absorbed due to increased gut permeability, thus increasing the risk of renal failure and hearing loss (i.e. two of the potential side effects of neomycin). The former side-effect, in particular, is especially worrisome given the already increased likelihood of renal failure in cirrhosis and portal hypertension (i.e. hepatorenal syndrome). Metronidazole has also been studied.\n- Rifaximin:\nRifaximi. receieved orphan drug status in 2005 for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. In contrast to neomycin, its tolerability profile is comparable to placebo. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that rifaximin at a dose of 400 mg taken orally 3 times a day was as effective as lactulose or lactilol at improving hepatic encephalopathy symptoms. Similarly, rifaximin was as effective as neomycin and paromomycin. Rifaximin was better tolerated than both the cathartics and the other nonabsorbable antibiotics. A number of concerns remain regarding rifaximin's role in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. It remains to be determined if rifaximin can improve severe encephalopathy symptoms as rapidly as lactulose. There are also concerns regarding the cost-effectiveness of the medication.\n- Benzodiazepine receptor antagonists:\nA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials by the international cochrane collaboration found benefit from flumazenil. The doses of flumazenil varied around a median of 2 milligrams over 10 minutes: flumazenil was given as a continuous infusion (12 trials), preceded by bolus injections in two trials. One trial used only bolus injections. Patients received flumazenil at a total dose ranging from 0.2 to 19.5 milligram (median 2 milligram). The median duration of treatment was 10 minutes (range one minute to 72 hours)'. However, the benefit was short.\n- L-ornithine-L-aspartate:\nL-ornithine-L-aspartate stimulates the urea cycle, and has shown encouraging results in randomized controlled trials.\n\n【64】 ### Contraindicated medications\nHepatic coma is considered an absolute contraindication to the use of the following medications:\n- Bumetanide\n- Metolazone\n\n【65】 # Treatment of cerebral edema:\nThe goal in the management of ICH is to lower the ICP to less than 20 to 25 mm Hg and maintain the cerebral perfusion pressure above 50 to 60 mm Hg. This is mainly performed by increasing the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and decreasing the ICP by the methods mentioned below:\n- IV mannitol at the dose of 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg\n- Hypertonic saline delayed the development of ICH\n- Hyperventilation decreases ICP\n- Hypothermia decreases ICP\n- Seizure control\n- Avoid hyperthermia\n\n【66】 # Treatment of hepatorenal syndrome:\nBecause of the high mortality associated with hepatorenal syndrome, emphasis is on prevention in patients who are at risk for the condition. Strategies for avoiding hepatorenal syndrome include appropriate and non-aggressive use of diuretics, identification and early treatment of infection and hemorrhage, and avoidance of other toxins that can affect both the liver and kidney.\nThe definitive treatment for hepatorenal syndrome is liver transplantation, and all other therapies can best be described as bridges to transplantation. These treatment strategies include the following:\n\n【67】 ## Albumin\nAll major studies showing improvement in renal function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome have involved expansion of the volume of the plasma with albumin given intravenously  One regimen is 1 gm albumin per kg of body weight intravenously on day one followed by followed by 20-40 grams daily.\n\n【68】 ## Midodrine and octreotide\nMidodrine is an alpha-agonist and octreotide is an analog of somatostatin. The medications are respectively systemic vasoconstrictors and inhibitors of vasodilators, and were not found to be useful when used individually in the treatment of the hepatorenal syndrome. However, one study of 13 patients with hepatorenal syndrome showed significant improvement when the two were used together (with midodrine given orally, octreotide given subcutaneously and both dosed according to blood pressure), with three patients surviving to discharge. A nonrandomized, observational study used \"100 μg subcutaneously TID, with the goal to increase the dose to 200 μg subcutaneous TID\" and \"midodrine administration started at 5, 7.5, or 10 mg TID orally, with the goal to increase the dose to 12.5 or 15 mg if necessary\" and found that \"octreotide/midodrine treatment appears to improve 30-day survival\".\n\n【69】 ## Vasopressin analogues\nThe vasopressin analogue ornipressin was found in a number of studies to be useful in improvement of renal function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, but has been limited by ischemic complications. Terlipressin is a vasopressin analogue that has been found in one study to be useful for improving renal function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome with a lesser incidence of ischemia. Neither medication is available for use in North America.\n\n【70】 ## Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt\nTransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) involve decompression of the high pressures in the portal circulation by placing a small stent between a portal and hepatic vein.  They have also been shown to improve renal function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome.\n\n【71】 ## Liver dialysis\nLiver dialysis involves extracorporeal dialysis to remove toxins from the circulation.  The molecular adsorbents recirculation system (MARS) has shown some utility as a bridge to transplantation in patients with hepatorenal syndrome.\n\n【72】 ## Hemodialysis\nRenal replacement therapy may be required to 'bridge' the patient to liver transplantation, although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used.\n\n【73】 ## Other medications\nOther agents used in treatment include\n- Pentoxifylline,\n- Acetylcysteine,\n- Misoprostol.\n\n【74】 # Management of Coagulopathy\n- Routine correction of thrombocytopenia or elevated INR by plasma infusion, in the absence of bleeding, is not indicated in acute liver failure, because of the low incidence of bleeding manifestations in ALF and the risk of volume expansion with plasma replacement. In addition, INR is an important prognostic indicator in ALF, correction of coagulopathy would alter the INR and interfere in the assessment of prognosis.\n- Routine administration of vitamin K (5 to10 mg subcutaneously)\n- plasma or clotting factor replacement therapy in clinically significant bleeding or the need for a procedure with a high bleeding risk such as ICP monitor insertion. Recombinant activated factor VII is used if INR is still high to correct coagulopathy in these patients.\n- Patients with thrombocytopenia with platelet count less than 50,000 cells/mm3 with clinically significant bleeding should receive platelet transfusion.

No demonstrable heritable or viral factors were found for the disease, and a subsequent decline of ALS/PDC after 1955 on Guam, led to the search for responsible environmental agents. The use of cycad (Cycas circinalis) seeds in food and traditional medicine had decreased as the Chamorro population became more Americanized following World War II.\nIn addition to eating the seeds directly, BMAA may have found its way into human diets by way of biomagnification. Fruit bats, a Chamorro delicacy, may feed on cycad seeds and concentrate the toxin in their flesh. Three museum specimen bats, collected in Guam in the 1950s, contained hundreds of times more BMAA, gram for gram, than cycad seeds.\n\n【3】 ## BMAA neurotoxic effects\nDegenerative locomotor diseases had been described in animals grazing on cycad species, fueling interest in a possible link between the plant and the etiology of ALS/PDC .

Many coiled coil type proteins are involved in important biological functions such as the regulation of gene expression e.g. transcription factors. Notable examples are the proteins the oncoproteins c-fos and jun, and the muscle protein tropomyosin.\n\n【2】 # Molecular structure of coiled coils\nCoiled coils usually contain a repeated seven amino acid residue pattern called heptad repeats. The interacting surface between the helices often contain hydrophobic residues, such as leucine arranged in a so called leucine zipper. The most favorable way for such two helices to arrange them selves in the water-filled environment of the cytoplasm is to wrap the hydrophobic strands against each other sandwiched between the hydrophilic amino acids. It is thus the burial of hydrophobic surfaces, that provides the thermodynamic driving force for the dimerization.\nThe α-helices may be parallel or antiparallel, and usually adopt a left-handed super-coil .  Although disfavored, a few right-handed coiled coils have also been observed in nature and in designed proteins.\n\n【3】 # Biological roles of coiled coils\n\n【4】 ## Role of coiled coils in HIV infection\nA key step in the entry of HIV into human cells is the exposure of a trimeric, parallel coiled coil known as gp41.  The gp41 trimer is normally covered by another surface glycoprotein known as gp120, which protects it from antibodies.  Upon binding to the target cell, gp120 undergoes a conformational change that exposes the gp41 trimer, whose hydrophobic N-terminal tails enter the target cell membrane.  Three other helices of gp41 fold down into the grooves of the gp41 coiled coil trimer, forming a hexamer, and drawing the viral membrane and target-cell membrane close enough to fuse.  The virus then enters the cell and begins its replication.  Recently, inhibitors that bind in the gp41 grooves have been developed, such as Fuzeon.\n\n【5】 ## Coiled coils as dimerization tags\nBecause of their specific interaction coiled coils can be used as a dimerization \"tag\".\n\n【6】 # History of coiled coils\nThe possibility of coiled coils for α-keratin was proposed by Francis Crick in 1952 as well as mathematical methods for determining their structure.\n Remarkably this was soon after the structure of the alpha helix was suggested in 1951 by Linus Pauling and coworkers", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

A single cycle of treatment is 28 days (4 weeks) of continuous infusion. Each cycle of treatment is separated by a 14 day (2 week) treatment-free interval.\nPatients who experience complete remission after 2 treatment cycles may have up to 3 additional cycles of consolidation treatment, based on an individual benefits-risks assessment.\nBlinatumomab is administered at a dose of 9 micrograms per day for the first 7 days of the first cycle. All doses after that are 28 micrograms per day.\nPrice\nBlinatumomab costs £2,017 per 38.5‑microgram vial (excluding VAT, BNF online March 2017).\nThe company has agreed a patient access scheme with the Department of Health. This scheme provides a simple discount to the list price of blinatumomab, with the discount applied at the point of purchase or invoice. The level of the discount is commercial in confidence. The Department of Health considered that this patient access scheme does not constitute an excessive administrative burden on the NHS.# Evidence\n\n【3】 The appraisal committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of blinatumomab, having considered evidence on the nature of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and the value placed on the benefits of blinatumomab by people with the condition, those who represent them, and clinical experts. It also took into account the effective use of NHS resources.\n\n【4】 # Clinical management\nThe committee heard from a patient expert that living with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, particularly when the condition has failed to respond to first line chemotherapy, can have a profound effect on a person's physical and psychological wellbeing. The committee acknowledged that acute lymphoblastic leukaemia does not affect the patient in isolation, but also places emotional strain on their families and friends. The committee heard from the patient expert that patients whose disease responds to blinatumomab can live a relatively normal life during treatment, with minimal side effects. The clinical experts emphasised that the side effects of blinatumomab are much less severe than currently available therapies such as fludarabine, cytarabine and granulocyte stimulating factor (FLAG) based regimens.\nThe committee noted that the aim of treatment is to induce remission so that people who are fit enough can have allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which could cure the disease. Clinical experts advised that although the summary of product characteristics stipulates minimum inpatient treatment for 9 days in the first cycle and 2 days in subsequent cycles, in clinical practice blinatumomab is so well tolerated that most patients are treated as inpatients for only 4 days in cycle 1 and 2 days in cycle 2. This means that they can have treatment mostly in the outpatient setting, apart from attending hospital for the intravenous infusion bag to be changed every 4 days. The committee concluded that the availability of an effective treatment that could be delivered primarily in the outpatient setting was hugely beneficial to patients and would have a major impact on their quality of life.\nThe committee considered the most appropriate comparators for blinatumomab for treating relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and the likely position of blinatumomab in the treatment pathway. It heard from the patient expert and clinical experts that people with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia will have combination chemotherapy. In most cases this would be FLAG with idarubicin (FLAG-IDA), which involves prolonged hospitalisation for treatment and is associated with debilitating side effects. It heard that clofarabine is sometimes used instead, but noted that its marketing authorisation is only for children. The clinical experts stated that in clinical practice blinatumomab would be most useful at first relapse, before other salvage therapies that are poorly tolerated. The committee concluded that blinatumomab would be used before other salvage therapies and that FLAG-IDA was the most appropriate comparator for this appraisal.\n\n【5】 # Clinical effectiveness of blinatumomab\nThe clinical evidence for blinatumomab in people with relapsed or refractory precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is from 2 clinical trials, TOWER and Study MT103-211:\nTOWER (n=405) was a phase III randomised controlled trial, comparing blinatumomab with one of 4 different standard of care chemotherapy regimens.\nStudy MT103-211 was a phase II single-arm trial, assessing the safety and effectiveness of blinatumomab. The company used an historical cohort (Study 21020310) to allow comparison with 4 different standard of care chemotherapy regimens, which were similar to those in the control arm of TOWER.\n\n【6】 ## Generalisability of the trial results to the NHS\nThe committee noted that TOWER included patients with refractory precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that was refractory to primary induction therapy or relapsed within 12 months of first line chemotherapy, or after subsequent therapy, or after allogenic stem cell transplantation. The committee heard from the clinical experts that the trial specifically recruited people with a poor prognosis. People who relapsed 12 months or more after primary induction therapy were excluded from the trial, but would have a better prognosis than those who relapsed earlier. The committee also noted that TOWER compared blinatumomab with standard of care (FLAG with or without an anthracycline such as idarubicin, a high-dose methotrexate based regimen or high-dose cytarabine with or without anthracycline). Most people in the trial had FLAG-IDA, which is consistent with clinical practice in England. The committee noted that the marketing authorisation specifies a maximum of 5 cycles of blinatumomab, but some patients in TOWER had more than 5 cycles. The committee also considered the generalisability of Study MT103-211. Similarly to TOWER, patients were excluded if they had relapsed following a remission that lasted over 12 months. The committee concluded that the trial populations broadly correspond with those in clinical practice but reflect people with a relatively poor prognosis.\n\n【7】 ## Clinical effectiveness results – TOWER\nIn the trial, blinatumomab increased overall survival compared with standard of care chemotherapy (hazard ratio  0.71; 95% confidence interval  0.55 to 0.93). The committee noted that although blinatumomab was associated with improved overall survival up to 15 months, the Kaplan–Meier curves of the 2 treatment arms came together at this point. However it also noted that the data were immature and that there were very small numbers of patients alive at 15 months. The committee concluded that blinatumomab is clinically effective in improving overall survival compared with standard care in the short term, but there is uncertainty about the long-term overall survival benefit.\nResults of a pre-specified subgroup analysis suggested that blinatumomab is more effective in people who have had no, or only 1 salvage therapy. The committee noted that the study was not powered to detect differences in efficacy between these subgroups but it appeared that blinatumomab was more effective if given earlier, and it recalled the clinical experts' view that blinatumomab would be used as the first salvage therapy .\nThe committee noted that the rates of allogeneic stem cell transplants were similar in the blinatumomab and standard of care chemotherapy arms (24.0% compared to 23.9% respectively). The committee heard from the clinical experts that these may not be directly comparable because treatment decisions were made on an individual basis and may be affected by multiple factors. For example, some patients in the chemotherapy arm of TOWER may have had a stem cell transplantation despite not achieving a complete remission, which would not happen in the NHS. It also heard that that there may have been other confounding factors, such as a delay in offering transplantation to people who responded well to blinatumomab (time to transplant was longer in the blinatumomab than standard of care arm in the trial). The committee concluded that it was uncertain from the available evidence whether blinatumomab would enable more patients to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However given the higher rate of complete remission with blinatumomab than standard of care (33.6% compared with 15.7%) this would be expected.\nBlinatumomab was associated with fewer serious (grade 3 and above) adverse events than standard of care chemotherapy. The committee recalled hearing from the patient experts that the side effects of blinatumomab are minimal  and it concluded that blinatumomab would be well-tolerated compared with standard of care chemotherapy.\n\n【8】 ## Clinical effectiveness results – Study MT103-211\nThe committee noted that the ERG only regarded the comparison with the historical cohort as relevant and therefore it did not consider further the results of Study MT103-211 alone. To account for the different populations in the trial and the historical comparator, the company used 2 different methods to match patients based on their characteristics: a reweighted analysis and an inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis. The committee noted that the arms were not significantly different once matched, except for by region. The committee concluded that the matched analysis was appropriate for comparing blinatumomab with standard of care based on a historical cohort.\n\n【9】 # Cost effectiveness\nThe company used a 4-state partitioned-survival economic model, representing an initial pre-response state, a response state, a refractory/relapsed state and death. All clinical parameters in the model were derived from TOWER. The committee agreed that the model structure was appropriate.\nIn the model, patients had either blinatumomab or FLAG-IDA. The company used the results of the whole standard of care chemotherapy arm of TOWER to estimate the effectiveness of FLAG-IDA. The committee noted that clinical advisers to the ERG thought it plausible for the efficacy of the whole standard of care arm to be similar to FLAG-IDA, and that the trial was not powered to assess the relative clinical effectiveness of different chemotherapy regimens. It noted that FLAG-IDA was the most common chemotherapy regimen in the trial. The committee concluded that the chemotherapy arm of TOWER offered a reasonable representation of the clinical effectiveness of FLAG-IDA.\n\n【10】 ## Modelling of overall survival\nThe committee recalled that the data on overall survival from TOWER were immature . The company fitted parametric survival curves to the observed blinatumomab data and used a Gompertz distribution, based on clinical plausibility and visual inspection. The committee noted that the company's extrapolation of overall survival was subject to uncertainty because in TOWER the overall survival curves converged at around 15 months, which suggested that the proportional hazards assumption was not met. However the committee also noted that the number of patients at this time point in the trial was very small. It heard from the ERG that they were unable to identify a more clinically plausible survival curve for use in the economic model. The committee noted that the proportional hazards assumption did appear to be met in the first 12 months but there is uncertainty about the long-term extrapolation of overall survival. It concluded that the company's extrapolation was acceptable for the purposes of decision making.\nThe committee discussed the time point at which it is reasonable to assume a survivor is cured, which has a substantial impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). It noted that the company base case assumed 48 months, while the ERG argued that 60 months would be more appropriate. It heard from the clinical experts that the time point considered to be 'cure' was debatable, but would be much less than 48 months. The committee noted that the overall survival curves in the model appeared to plateau at around 36 months and that the sooner a cure was achieved, the lower the ICER. The committee concluded that the company's assumption of patients being cured at 48 months was potentially a conservative estimate.\n\n【11】 ## Utility values\nThe committee heard that the quality-of-life data was mapped from EORTC QLQ-C30 data collected in TOWER. It noted that the company had not adjusted for the baseline differences in utility between treatment arms. The committee concluded that although it would have preferred adjusted values, the utility estimates used in the model were acceptable.\n\n【12】 ## Cost of treatment in the model\nThe committee discussed the resource use assumed in the company's and the ERG's models. It noted that in both models the administration costs were assumed to be the same as in TOWER, in which patients had up to 9 cycles of blinatumomab. It heard from the clinical experts that although the marketing authorisation for blinatumomab recommends a maximum of 5 cycles, most people would have 2 cycles of treatment. If the disease responded, they would proceed to transplantation. If the disease responded after 2 cycles but a suitable donor match was not immediately available, or if stem cell transplantation was not appropriate, they might have more than 2 cycles. The company assumed hospitalisation requirements for blinatumomab as per the minimum specified in the marketing authorisation, while the ERG had assumed in their preferred base case that patients would be hospitalised for the entirety of the first 2 treatment cycles. The committee noted that the hospitalisation requirements would be considerably less than either of these assumptions in clinical practice . The committee also noted that the company assumed that intravenous bags were changed every 4 days, while the ERG assumed they were changed daily. It heard from the patient expert, clinical experts and NHS England that daily bag changes would be unlikely in clinical practice. The committee concluded that it preferred the company's assumptions for healthcare utilisation, but that these would overestimate the administration costs of blinatumomab.\n\n【13】 # End-of-life considerations\nThe committee considered the advice about life-extending treatments for people with a short life expectancy in NICE's final Cancer Drugs Fund technology appraisal process and methods. The committee concluded that the end-of-life criteria were met in the overall population based on the following discussions:\nThe committee discussed whether life expectancy without blinatumomab would be less than 24 months. It noted that life expectancy was 4 months for standard of care chemotherapy in TOWER and concluded that the short life-expectancy criterion was met.\nThe committee discussed whether a survival benefit of over 3 months can be expected for blinatumomab compared to its comparators. It noted that blinatumomab was associated with a median overall survival gain of 3.7 months over standard of care chemotherapy and concluded that the extension to life criterion was met.\n\n【14】 # Cost-effectiveness results\nThe committee considered the company's base case ICERs using the patient access scheme price for blinatumomab. It noted that the deterministic ICERs were £55,501 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for the overall population (probabilistic ICER of £57,600 per QALY gained) and £49,190 per QALY gained for people who had not had previous salvage therapy (probabilistic ICER of £58,900 per QALY gained). However, the committee considered these ICERs to have been overestimated. It was aware that the costs of blinatumomab were overestimated because up to 9 cycles of treatment had been modelled, when the marketing authorisation is for a maximum of 5 cycles. The committee also considered that the hospitalisation requirements in clinical practice  are less than those modelled, and the assumption that patients were cured at 48 months was potentially conservative . The committee considered the ICER for people who had not had previous salvage therapy to be most appropriate for the purposes of decision making, because it represents the treatment position in which blinatumomab will be used in clinical practice. As blinatumomab becomes established in clinical practice the number of people who have had previous salvage chemotherapy will diminish over time. The committee also noted that there is significant unmet clinical need for people with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, because of the shortcomings of existing regimens . The committee concluded that, despite substantial uncertainty, the ICER for blinatumomab is within the range normally considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources given that the end-of-life criteria apply .\n\n【15】 # Innovation\nThe committee considered whether blinatumomab is innovative. It heard from the patient and clinical experts that there is significant unmet need for people with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia because of the ineffective and toxic chemotherapy regimens currently available. It noted that the company considers blinatumomab to be an innovative treatment and a step-change in treatment of a very rare illness. The committee concluded that blinatumomab would be beneficial for patients, but it had not been presented with evidence of any additional benefits that were not captured in the measurement of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).\n\n【16】 # Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) 2014\nThe committee was aware of NICE's position statement on the PPRS 2014, and in particular the PPRS payment mechanism. It accepted the conclusion 'that the 2014 PPRS payment mechanism should not, as a matter of course, be regarded as a relevant consideration in its assessment of the cost effectiveness of branded medicines'. The committee heard nothing to suggest that there is any basis for taking a different view about the relevance of the PPRS to this appraisal. It therefore concluded that the PPRS payment mechanism was not relevant in considering the cost effectiveness of the technology in this appraisal.\n\n【17】 # Summary of appraisal committee's key conclusions\nTA450\nAppraisal title: Blinatumomab for previously treated Philadelphia-chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\nSection\nKey conclusion\nBlinatumomab is recommended within its marketing authorisation as an option for treating Philadelphia-chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in adults, only if the company provides it with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.\nThe committee considered the end-of-life criteria to be met because life expectancy in the standard of care arm in the TOWER trial was 4 months and blinatumomab was associated with an overall survival benefit of 3.7 months.\nThe deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for people who had not had previous salvage therapy was £49,190 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, when a patient access scheme was included. However the ICER is likely to be lower if the reduced hospitalisation requirements are taken into account, and is therefore likely to be within the range normally considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources.\nThe committee considered the ICER for people who had not had previous salvage therapy to be most appropriate for the purposes of decision making, because it represents the treatment position in which blinatumomab will be used in clinical practice. The committee concluded that, despite substantial uncertainty, the ICER for blinatumomab is within the range normally considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources given that the end-of-life criteria apply.\nCurrent practice\nClinical need of patients, including the availability of alternative treatments\nLiving with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, particularly when the condition has failed to respond to first line chemotherapy, can have a profound effect on a person's physical and psychological wellbeing. The clinical experts emphasised that the side effects of blinatumomab are much less severe than alternative therapies currently available such as fludarabine, cytarabine and granulocyte stimulating factor based regimens with idarubicin (FLAG-IDA). Blinatumomab can also be delivered mostly in the outpatient setting. The committee concluded that the availability of an effective treatment that could be delivered primarily in the outpatient setting was hugely beneficial to patients and would have a major impact on their quality of life.\nThe technology\nProposed benefits of the technology\nHow innovative is the technology in its potential to make a significant and substantial impact on health-related benefits?\nBlinatumomab was associated with a statistically significant overall survival gain of 3.7 months and an increase in the proportion of patients with complete remission, compared with standard of care chemotherapy in the TOWER trial. The committee concluded that the results of TOWER are generalisable to the UK population, and noted that blinatumomab appears to be more clinically effective in the subgroup of people who have not had previous salvage therapy. The committee heard from clinical experts that blinatumomab would be used as first salvage therapy because people would then be in a better positon to respond to allogenic stem cell transplantation. The committee concluded that people who have had no salvage therapy are the most relevant population for this appraisal.\nThe committee noted that the company considers blinatumomab to be innovative because it is a step-change in a very rare illness. However it concluded that it could not identify any specific health-related benefit that had not already been captured in the QALY calculations.\nto 4.8, 4.18, 4.19\nWhat is the position of the treatment in the pathway of care for the condition?\nClinical experts suggested that blinatumomab would be used as first salvage therapy in practice, noting the lack of alternative options.\nAdverse reactions\nBlinatumomab is associated with fewer adverse reactions than the standard of care chemotherapy regimens that are its comparators.\nEvidence for clinical effectiveness\nAvailability, nature and quality of evidence\nThe clinical evidence for blinatumomab compared with standard of care chemotherapy comes mainly from TOWER. The committee noted that the company presented data for the whole trial population and for a subgroup of people who had not had previous salvage therapy.\nRelevance to general clinical practice in the NHS\nPeople who relapsed 12 months or more after primary induction therapy (who have a better prognosis than those who relapsed earlier) were excluded from the trials. The committee concluded that the trial populations broadly correspond with those in clinical practice but reflect people with a relatively poor prognosis.\nUncertainties generated by the evidence\nThe committee noted that although in TOWER blinatumomab was associated with improved overall survival up to 15 months, the Kaplan–Meier curves of the 2 treatment arms came together at this point. The data were immature and there were very small numbers of patients alive at 15‑month follow-up. The committee concluded that blinatumomab is clinically effective in improving overall survival compared with standard care in the short term, but there is uncertainty about the long-term overall survival benefit.\nAre there any clinically relevant subgroups for which there is evidence of differential effectiveness?\nBlinatumomab appears to be more clinically effective in people who have not had previous salvage therapy.\nEstimate of the size of the clinical effectiveness including strength of supporting evidence\nBlinatumomab was associated with a statistically significant overall survival benefit of 3.7 months compared with standard of care chemotherapy.\nThe company submitted a partitioned-survival economic model, representing an initial pre-response state, a response state, a refractory/relapsed state and death. The committee agreed that the model structure was appropriate.\nUncertainties around and plausibility of assumptions and inputs in the economic model\nThe committee considered the following key areas of uncertainty:\nextrapolation of overall survival\ntime at which a patient is considered to be cured\nhealthcare utilisation costs.\nIncorporation of health-related quality-of-life benefits and utility values\nHave any potential significant and substantial health-related benefits been identified that were not included in the economic model, and how have they been considered?\nThe committee heard that the quality-of-life data was mapped from EORTC QLQ-C30 data collected in TOWER.\nThe company considers blinatumomab to be innovative because it is a step-change in treatment of a very rare illness. However the committee did not identify any specific health-related benefit that had not already been captured in the QALY calculation.\nAre there specific groups of people for whom the technology is particularly cost effective?\nBlinatumomab is more cost effective in people who have not had previous salvage therapy. This represents the expected position in which blinatumomab will be used in clinical practice in the NHS.\nWhat are the key drivers of cost effectiveness?\nThe key drivers of cost effectiveness in the company's model were the extrapolation of overall survival, the time at which a patient is considered to be cured and healthcare utilisation costs.\nMost likely cost-effectiveness estimate (given as an ICER)\nThe committee considered the ICER in people who had not had previous salvage therapy to be most appropriate for the purposes of decision making, because it represents the treatment position in which blinatumomab will be used in clinical practice.\nThe committee concluded that the most plausible ICER for blinatumomab compared with standard of care chemotherapy in the subgroup of people who had not had previous salvage therapy is likely to be lower than the company's base case ICER of £49,190 per QALY gained.\nAdditional factors taken into account\nPatient access schemes (PPRS)\nThe PPRS payment mechanism was not relevant in considering the cost effectiveness of the technology in this appraisal.\nEnd-of-life considerations\nThe committee concluded that the end-of-life criteria were met in the overall population:\nBlinatumomab met the short life-expectancy criteria (less than 24 months) because life expectancy in the standard of care chemotherapy arm of TOWER was 4 months.\nBlinatumomab was associated with a median overall survival gain of 3.7 months over standard of care chemotherapy and therefore met the criterion for extension to life of greater than 3 months.\nEqualities considerations and social value judgements\nNo equality issues were raised during the appraisal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "eee0c658-b9e5-4e64-93c1-80e967f1b31a", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Ranitidine (injection)\n- Content\n- Parenteral Administration\n- In some hospitalized patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions or intractable duodenal ulcers, or in patients who are unable to take oral medication, Ranitidine may be administered parenterally according to the following recommendations:\n- Intramuscular Injection: 50 mg (2 mL) every 6 to 8 hours. (No dilution necessary.)\n- Intermittent Intravenous Injection:\n- a. Intermittent Bolus: 50 mg (2 mL) every 6 to 8 hours. Dilute Ranitidine Injection, 50 mg, in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or other compatible IV solution  to a concentration no greater than 2.5 mg/mL (20 mL). Inject at a rate no greater than 4 mL/min (5 minutes).\n- b. Intermittent Infusion: 50 mg (2 mL) every 6 to 8 hours. Dilute Ranitidine Injection, 50 mg, in 5% dextrose injection or other compatible IV solution  to a concentration no greater than 0.5 mg/mL (100 mL). Infuse at a rate no greater than 5 to 7 mL/min (15 to 20 minutes).\n- In some patients it may be necessary to increase dosage. When this is necessary, the increases should be made by more frequent administration of the dose, but generally should not exceed 400 mg/day.\n- Continuous Intravenous Infusion: Add Ranitidine Injection to 5% dextrose injection or other compatible IV solution . Deliver at a rate of 6.25 mg/hour (e.g., 150 mg  of Ranitidine Injection in 250 mL of 5% dextrose injection at 10.7 mL/hour).\n- For Zollinger-Ellison patients, dilute Ranitidine Injection in 5% dextrose injection or other compatible IV solution  to a concentration no greater than 2.5 mg/mL. Start the infusion at a rate of 1.0 mg/kg/hour. If after 4 hours either a measured gastric acid output is >10 mEq/hour or the patient becomes symptomatic, the dose should be adjusted upward in 0.5-mg/kg/hour increments, and the acid output should be remeasured. Dosages up to 2.5 mg/kg/hour and infusion rates as high as 220 mg/hour have been used.\n- Dosage Adjustment for Patients With Impaired Renal Function\n- The administration of ranitidine as a continuous infusion has not been evaluated in patients with impaired renal function. On the basis of experience with a group of subjects with severely impaired renal function treated with Ranitidine, the recommended dosage in patients with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min is 50 mg every 18 to 24 hours. Should the patient's condition require, the frequency of dosing may be increased to every 12 hours or even further with caution. Hemodialysis reduces the level of circulating ranitidine. Ideally, the dosing schedule should be adjusted so that the timing of a scheduled dose coincides with the end of hemodialysis.\n- Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function\n- Stability\n- Undiluted, Ranitidine Injection tends to exhibit a yellow color that may intensify over time without adversely affecting potency. Ranitidine Injection is stable for 48 hours at room temperature when added to or diluted with most commonly used IV solutions, e.g., 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 5% dextrose injection, 10% dextrose injection, lactated ringer's injection, or 5% sodium bicarbonate injection.\n- Ranitidine Injection Premixed in flexible plastic containers is sterile through the expiration date on the label when stored under recommended conditions.\nNote: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration whenever solution and container permit.\n- Do not use if you are allergic to ranitidine or other acid reducers\n- Do not use if you have trouble or pain swallowing food, vomiting with blood, or bloody or black stools. These may be signs of a serious condition.\n- With other acid reducers\n- If you have kidney disease, except under the advice and supervision of a doctor\n- Ask a doctor before use if you have\n- Frequent chest pain\n- Frequent wheezing, particularly with heartburn unexplained weight loss\n- Nausea or vomiting\n- Stomach pain had heartburn over 3 months. This may be a sign of a more serious condition.\n- Heartburn with lightheadedness, sweating, or dizziness chest pain or shoulder pain with shortness of breath; sweating; pain spreading to arms, neck or shoulders; or lightheadedness\n- Stop use and ask a doctor if your heartburn continues or worsens you need to take this product for more than 14 days\n- If pregnant or breast-feeding, ask a health professional before use.\n- Keep out of reach of children.\n- Symptomatic response to therapy with Ranitidine does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.\n- Since Ranitidine is excreted primarily by the kidney, dosage should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function. Caution should be observed in patients with hepatic dysfunction since Ranitidine is metabolized in the liver.\n- In controlled studies in normal volunteers, elevations in SGPT have been observed when H2-antagonists have been administered intravenously at greater-than-recommended dosages for 5 days or longer. Therefore, it seems prudent in patients receiving IV ranitidine at dosages ≥100 mg 4 times daily for periods of 5 days or longer to monitor SGPT daily (from day 5) for the remainder of IV therapy.\n- Bradycardia in association with rapid administration of Ranitidine Injection has been reported rarely, usually in patients with factors predisposing to cardiac rhythm disturbances. Recommended rates of administration should not be exceeded .\n- Rare reports suggest that Ranitidine may precipitate acute porphyric attacks in patients with acute porphyria. Ranitidine should therefore be avoided in patients with a history of acute porphyria.\n- Transient pain at the site of IM injection has been reported. Transient local burning or itching has been reported with IV administration of Ranitidine.\n- The following have been reported as events in clinical trials or in the routine management of patients treated with oral or parenteral Ranitidine. The relationship to therapy with Ranitidine has been unclear in many cases. Headache, sometimes severe, seems to be related to administration of Ranitidine.\n- Central Nervous System\n- Rarely, malaise, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, and vertigo. Rare cases of reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression, and hallucinations have been reported, predominantly in severely ill elderly patients. Rare cases of reversible blurred vision suggestive of a change in accommodation have been reported. Rare reports of reversible involuntary motor disturbances have been received.\n- Cardiovascular\n- As with other H2-blockers, rare reports of arrhythmias such as tachycardia, bradycardia, asystole, atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular beats.\n- Gastrointestinal\n- Constipation, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal discomfort/pain, and rare reports of pancreatitis.\n- Hepatic\n- In normal volunteers, SGPT values were increased to at least twice the pretreatment levels in 6 of 12 subjects receiving 100 mg intravenously 4 times daily for 7 days, and in 4 of 24 subjects receiving 50 mg intravenously 4 times daily for 5 days. There have been occasional reports of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed hepatitis, with or without jaundice. In such circumstances, ranitidine should be immediately discontinued. These events are usually reversible, but in rare circumstances death has occurred. Rare cases of hepatic failure have also been reported.\n- Musculoskeletal\n- Rare reports of arthralgias and myalgias.\n- Hematologic\n- Blood count changes (leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia) have occurred in a few patients. These were usually reversible. Rare cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, sometimes with marrow hypoplasia, and aplastic anemia and exceedingly rare cases of acquired immune hemolytic anemia have been reported.\n- Endocrine\n- Controlled studies in animals and humans have shown no stimulation of any pituitary hormone by Ranitidine and no antiandrogenic activity, and cimetidine-induced gynecomastia and impotence in hypersecretory patients have resolved when Ranitidine has been substituted. However, occasional cases of impotence and loss of libido have been reported in male patients receiving Ranitidine, but the incidence did not differ from that in the general population. Rare cases of breast symptoms and conditions, including galactorrhea and gynecomastia, have been reported in both males and females.\n- Integumentary\n- Rash, including rare cases of erythema multiforme. Rare cases of alopecia and vasculitis.\n- Respiratory\n- A large epidemiological study suggested an increased risk of developing pneumonia in current users of histamine-2–receptor antagonists (H2RAs) compared to patients who had stopped H2RA treatment, with an observed adjusted relative risk of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.07–2.48). However, a causal relationship between use of H2RAs and pneumonia has not been established.\n- Other\n- Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., bronchospasm, fever, rash, eosinophilia), anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, acute interstitial nephritis, and small increases in serum creatinine.\n- Ranitidine has been reported to affect the bioavailability of other drugs through several different mechanisms such as competition for renal tubular secretion, alteration of gastric pH, and inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes.\n- Procainamide: Ranitidine, a substrate of the renal organic cation transport system, may affect the clearance of other drugs eliminated by this route. High doses of ranitidine (e.g., such as those used in the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) have been shown to reduce the renal excretion of procainamide and N-acetylprocainamide resulting in increased plasma levels of these drugs. Although this interaction is unlikely to be clinically relevant at usual ranitidine doses, it may be prudent to monitor for procainamide toxicity when administered with oral ranitidine at a dose exceeding 300 mg per day.\n- Warfarin: There have been reports of altered prothrombin time among patients on concomitant warfarin and ranitidine therapy. Due to the narrow therapeutic index, close monitoring of increased or decreased prothrombin time is recommended during concurrent treatment with ranitidine.\n- Ranitidine may alter the absorption of drugs in which gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability. This can result in either an increase in absorption (e.g., triazolam, midazolam, glipizide) or a decrease in absorption (e.g., ketoconazole, atazanavir, delavirdine, gefitinib). Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended.\n\n【1】 - Delavirdine: Delavirdine absorption may be impaired based on known interactions with other agents that increase gastric pH. Chronic use of H2-receptor antagonists with delavirdine is not recommended.\n- Gefitinib: Gefitinib exposure was reduced by 44% with the coadministration of ranitidine and sodium bicarbonate (dosed to maintain gastric pH above 5.0). Use with caution.\n- Glipizide: In diabetic patients, glipizide exposure was increased by 34% following a single 150-mg dose of oral ranitidine. Use appropriate clinical monitoring when initiating or discontinuing ranitidine.\n- Ketoconazole: Oral ketoconazole exposure was reduced by up to 95% when oral ranitidine was coadministered in a regimen to maintain a gastric pH of 6 or above. The degree of interaction with usual dose of ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) is unknown.\n- Midazolam: Oral midazolam exposure in 5 healthy volunteers was increased by up to 65% when administered with oral ranitidine at a dose of 150 mg twice daily. However, in another interaction study in 8 volunteers receiving IV midazolam, a 300 mg oral dose of ranitidine increased midazolam exposure by about 9%. Monitor patients for excessive or prolonged sedation when ranitidine is coadministered with oral midazolam.\n- Triazolam: Triazolam exposure in healthy volunteers was increased by approximately 30% when administered with oral ranitidine at a dose of 150 mg twice daily. Monitor patients for excessive or prolonged sedation.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Ranitidine (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions have not been established.\n- Limited data in neonatal patients (less than 1 month of age) receiving ECMO suggest that Ranitidine may be useful and safe for increasing gastric pH for patients at risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage.\n- This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, caution should be exercised in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function\n- The empirical formula is C13H22N4O3SHCl, representing a molecular weight of 350.87.\n- Ranitidine HCl is a white to pale yellow, granular substance that is soluble in water.\n- Ranitidine Injection is a clear, colorless to yellow, nonpyrogenic liquid. The yellow color of the liquid tends to intensify without adversely affecting potency. The pH of the injection solution is 6.7 to 7.3.\n- Sterile Injection for Intramuscular or Intravenous Administration\n- Each 1 mL of aqueous solution contains ranitidine 25 mg (as the hydrochloride); phenol 5 mg as preservative; and 0.96 mg of monobasic potassium phosphate and 2.4 mg of dibasic sodium phosphate as buffers.\n- In a group of 10 known hypersecretors, ranitidine plasma levels of 71, 180, and 376 ng/mL inhibited basal acid secretion by 76%, 90%, and 99.5%, respectively.\n- It appears that basal- and betazole-stimulated secretions are most sensitive to inhibition by Ranitidine, while pentagastrin-stimulated secretion is more difficult to suppress.\n- Effects on Other Gastrointestinal Secretions:\n- Pepsin: Ranitidine does not affect pepsin secretion. Total pepsin output is reduced in proportion to the decrease in volume of gastric juice.\n- Intrinsic Factor: Ranitidine has no significant effect on pentagastrin-stimulated intrinsic factor secretion.\n- Serum Gastrin: Ranitidine has little or no effect on fasting or postprandial serum gastrin.\n- Other Pharmacologic Actions:\n- Gastric bacterial flora―increase in nitrate-reducing organisms, significance not known.\n- Prolactin levels―no effect in recommended oral or IV dosage, but small, transient, dose-related increases in serum prolactin have been reported after IV bolus injections of 100 mg or more.\n- Other pituitary hormones―no effect on serum gonadotropins, TSH, or GH. Possible impairment of vasopressin release.\n- No change in cortisol, aldosterone, androgen, or estrogen levels.\n- No antiandrogenic action.\n- No effect on count, motility, or morphology of sperm.\n- Pediatrics: The ranitidine concentration necessary to suppress basal acid secretion by at least 90% has been reported to be 40 to 60 ng/mL in pediatric patients with duodenal or gastric ulcers.\n- In a study of 20 critically ill pediatric patients receiving ranitidine IV at 1 mg/kg every 6 hours, 10 patients with a baseline pH≥4 maintained this baseline throughout the study. Eight of the remaining 10 patients with a baseline of pH≤2 achieved pH≥4 throughout varying periods after dosing. It should be noted, however, that because these pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed in critically ill pediatric patients, the data should be interpreted with caution when dosing recommendations are made for a less seriously ill pediatric population.\n- In another small study of neonatal patients (n = 5) receiving ECMO, gastric pH4 after a 2-mg/kg dose and remained above 4 for at least 15 hours.\n- Absorption:\n- Ranitidine is absorbed very rapidly after intramuscular (IM) injection. Mean peak levels of 576 ng/mL occur within 15 minutes or less following a 50-mg IM dose. Absorption from IM sites is virtually complete, with a bioavailability of 90% to 100% compared with intravenous (IV) administration. Following oral administration, the bioavailability of Ranitidine Tablets is 50%.\n- Distribution:\n- The volume of distribution is about 1.4 L/kg. Serum protein binding averages 15%.\n- Metabolism:\n- In humans, the N-oxide is the principal metabolite in the urine; however, this amounts to <4% of the dose. Other metabolites are the S-oxide (1%) and the desmethyl ranitidine (1%). The remainder of the administered dose is found in the stool. Studies in patients with hepatic dysfunction (compensated cirrhosis) indicate that there are minor, but clinically insignificant, alterations in ranitidine half-life, distribution, clearance, and bioavailability.\n- Excretion:\n- Following IV injection, approximately 70% of the dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug. Renal clearance averages 530 mL/min, with a total clearance of 760 mL/min. The elimination half-life is 2.0 to 2.5 hours.\n- Four patients with clinically significant renal function impairment (creatinine clearance 25 to 35 mL/min) administered 50 mg of ranitidine intravenously had an average plasma half-life of 4.8 hours, a ranitidine clearance of 29 mL/min, and a volume of distribution of 1.76 L/kg. In general, these parameters appear to be altered in proportion to creatinine clearance\n- Geriatrics: The plasma half-life is prolonged and total clearance is reduced in the elderly population due to a decrease in renal function. The elimination half-life is 3.1 hours  .\n- Pediatrics:There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameter values for ranitidine in pediatric patients (from 1 month up to 16 years of age) and healthy adults when correction is made for body weight.\n- Plasma clearance in neonatal patients (less than 1 month of age) receiving ECMO was considerably lower (3 to 4 mL/min/kg) than observed in children or adults. The elimination half-life in neonates averaged 6.6 hours as compared to approximately 2 hours in adults and pediatric patients.\n- There was no indication of tumorigenic or carcinogenic effects in life-span studies in mice and rats at oral dosages up to 2,000 mg/kg/day.\n- Ranitidine was not mutagenic in standard bacterial tests (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) for mutagenicity at concentrations up to the maximum recommended for these assays.\n- In a dominant lethal assay, a single oral dose of 1,000 mg/kg to male rats was without effect on the outcome of 2 matings per week for the next 9 weeks.\n- In these studies, patients treated with oral Ranitidine reported a reduction in both daytime and nocturnal pain, and they also consumed less antacid than the placebo-treated patients.\n- Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions (such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome): Ranitidine inhibits gastric acid secretion and reduces occurrence of diarrhea, anorexia, and pain in patients with pathological hypersecretion associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, and other pathological hypersecretory conditions (e.g., postoperative, \"short-gut\" syndrome, idiopathic). Use of oral Ranitidine was followed by healing of ulcers in 8 of 19 (42%) patients who were intractable to previous therapy.\n- In a retrospective review of 52 Zollinger-Ellison patients given Ranitidine as a continuous IV infusion for up to 15 days, no patients developed complications of acid-peptic disease such as bleeding or perforation. Acid output was controlled to ≤10 mEq/h.\n- Avoid excessive heat or humidity\n- To relieve symptoms, swallow 1 tablet with a glass of water to prevent symptoms, swallow 1 tablet with a glass of water 30 to 60 minutes before eating food or drinking beverages that cause heartburn\n- Can be used up to twice daily (do not take more than 2 tablets in 24 hours)\n- TAMPER EVIDENT: DO NOT USE IF THE CARTON  PRINTED FOIL UNDER CAP IS OPEN  TORN.\nSynonyms / Brand Names: Ranitidine hydrochloride, Ranitidine HCL, Ranitidine Base, Rantidine HCL, Alquen, Alter-H2, Alvidina, Apo-Ranitidin, Artomil, Azuranit, Coralen, Digestosan, Ergan, Esofex, Fendibina, Gastrial, Gastridina, Gastrolav, Gastrosedol, Kuracid, Label, Lake, Logat, Melfax, Microtid, Mideran, Neugal, Noctone, Noktome, Normon, Novo-Radinine, Nu-Ranit, Pep-Rani, Ptinolin, Quadrin, Quantor, Radin, Ran H2, Ran Lich, Rani 2, Rani AbZ, Rani-BASF, Rani-Puren, Rani-Q, Rani-Sanorania, Rani-nerton, Raniben, Raniberl, Raniberta, Ranibloc, Ranic, Ranicux, Ranidil, Ranidin, Ranidine, Ranidura, Ranifur, Ranigasan, Ranigast, Ranigen, Ranilonga, Ranimerck, Raniogas, Raniplex, Ranisan, Ranitab, Ranitic, Ranitidin, Ranitidin 1A Pharma, Ranitidin AL, Ranitidin AWD, Ranitidin Arcana, Ranitidin Atid, Ranitidin Basics, Ranitidin Duncan, Ranitidin Dyna, Ranitidin Helvepharm, Ranitidin Heumann, Ranitidin Hexal, Ranitidin Merck, Ranitidin Millet, Ranitidin NM, Ranitidin Normon, Ranitidin PB, Ranitidin Stada, Ranitidin von ct, Ranitidin-Cophar, Ranitidin-Isis, Ranitidin-ratiopharm, Ranitidina Tamarang, Ranitidina predilu Grif, Ranitiget, Ranitin, Ranitine, Ranobel, Rantacid, Ranuber, Raticina, Regalil, Renatac, Rozon, Rubiulcer, Santanol, Serviradine, Sostril, Tanidina, Taural, Terposen, Toriol, Trigger, Ulcecur, Ulcex, Ulcirex, Ulcodin, Ulcolind Rani, Ulsaven, Ultidine, Viserul, Zandid, Ranitidine, Ranitidine 150, Ranitidine 75, Ranitidine In Plastic Container, Zantarac, Zantic", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

These diseases primarily cause low plasma LDL C and triglyceride levels less than in the 5th percentile of normal population. Clinical manifestations can vary from being completely asymptomatic to multiple features of vitamin deficiencies, and fat malabsorption. Clinical symptoms of vitamin E are seen early in the course of the disease as the amount of vitamin E is parallel to the total lipid level in the body. Failure to diagnose and to initiate timely vitamin supplementation results in the development of neurological symptoms. The mutations causing low LDL levels are widely studied as newer lipid lowering therapies are based on similar mechanisms of these diseases.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\n- In 1960, Salt reported absence of betalipoprotein in the plasma of a patient associated with very low cholesterol levels in the parents. Low cholesterol levels in the parents differentiates familial homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia from abetalipoproteinemia.\n- In 1961, Anderson suggested failure of formation of chylomicron and lipid malabsorption as a cause of severe steatorrhea in children. Patients did not have acanthocytes on the peripheral smear and neuro-ocular symptoms like familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. \n- Roy in 1987 and Kane in 1989 described chylomicron retention disease. \n- In 2003, the mutation in SAR1B gene was identified by jones.\n- Conklin identified the ANGPTL3 gene in 1999 and its function of inhibiting lipoprotein lipase was established in 2013 by Arca.\n\n【3】 # Pathophysiology\n\n【4】 ## Pathogenesis\nHypobetalipoproteinemias are caused by mutations in the genes involved in triglyceride transport and metabolism.\n- Cholesterol and triglycerides are insoluble in the plasma and they require a transport protein in the form of apolipoprotein B. These lipoproteins transport cholesterol and trigylcerides in spherical particles with cholesterol esters and triglyceride forming the central core.\n- Apolipoprotein B is the major carrier for triglycerides and cholesterol from the intestine and liver to the periphery.\n- Apolipoprotein B exits in two forms: apolipoprotein B48 and apolipoprotein B100.\n\n【5】 ## Genetics\nThe genetic defect, transmission and the result of the mutation in various diseases is described below:\n- Less common causes of familial hypobetalipoproteinemia are mutations in PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 S17X.\n- Mutations in loss of function of PCSK9 do not cause any clinical symptoms but are shown to be associated with decreasing cardiovascular disease risk.\n- Mutation in ANGPTL3 S17X causes low LDL C and triglyceride levels along with reduction in plasma glucose level by increasing insulin sensitivity which is secondary to the increased lipoprotien lipase activity.\n\n【6】 # Causes\nThe following are the list of causes of primary hypobetalipoproteinemia:\n- Abetalipoproteinemia\n- Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia\n- Chylomicron retention disease\n- PCSK9 deficiency\n- Familial combined hypolipidemia\n\n【7】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe prevalence of these diseases is as follows:\n\n【8】 # Natural History, complications and Prognosis\n\n【9】 # Diagnosis\n\n【10】 ## History, Symptoms and Physical Examination\nHypobetalipoproteinemias present with varying severity of similar symptoms based on the type of mutation as follows:\n\n【11】 ## Laboratory Results\nDefinitive gold standard for diagnosis is gene sequencing for APOB, MTTP, SAR1B, ANGPTL3 to see the exact mutation.\nLaboratory findings consistent with the diagnosis of hypobetalipoproteinemias include as follows:\n\n【12】 ## Approach to patient with Low LDL C\n\n【13】 # Treatment\n\n【14】 ## Medical Therapy\n- The mainstay of management of familial hypobetalipoproteinemia include early diagnosis and early initiation of low fat diet and fat soluble vitamin supplementation in all symptomatic patients, with yearly follow up to assess the growth and nutritional status, diet compliance, neurological function, lipid panel.\n- FHBL heterozygous patients with elevated liver enzyme, regular ultrasound imaging is recommended to monitor for progression of fatty liver to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n【15】 ### Chylomicron Retention Disease Management\n- If the patient is diagnosed early in the course of the disease diet modification and oral supplementation of vitamins improved outcomes.\nLow-fat diet\nVegetable oil enriched in essential fatty acids ± Enriched in medium-chain triglycerides\nVitamin E (hydrosoluble form): 50 IU/kg/d\nVitamin A: 15,000 IU/d (adjust according to plasma levels)\nVitamin D: 800-1200 IU/kg/d or 100,000 IU/2 month if  5 y old\nVitamin K: 15 mg/week (adjust according to INR and plasma levels)\n- Low-fat diet\n- Vegetable oil enriched in essential fatty acids ± Enriched in medium-chain triglycerides\n- Vitamin E (hydrosoluble form): 50 IU/kg/d\n- Vitamin A: 15,000 IU/d (adjust according to plasma levels)\n- Vitamin D: 800-1200 IU/kg/d or 100,000 IU/2 month if  5 y old\n- Vitamin K: 15 mg/week (adjust according to INR and plasma levels)\n- If patient is diagnosed late and with neurological disease, combined oral and parental supplementation is recommended:\nFatty acids-intralipid 20% 2g/kg/month\nVitamin E 4 to 6 mg/kg/month\nVitamin A 500 IU/kg/month once a month is recommended\n- Fatty acids-intralipid 20% 2g/kg/month\n- Vitamin E 4 to 6 mg/kg/month\n- Vitamin A 500 IU/kg/month once a month is recommended\n- Annual follow up to 10 years to assess the growth and nutritional status, diet compliance, neurological function, lipid profile.\n- Every 3 year follow up to check bone mineral density, liver function with ultrasound, ophthalmologic exam for fundus, color vision, visual evoked potentials and electroretinography after the age of 10years.\n- Echocardiography in adulthood.\n\n【16】 ## Surgical Therapy\n- No surgical options are available.\n\n【17】 # Prevention\n\n【18】 ## Primary Prevention\n- As the set of the diseases are rare there are no primary preventive measures.\n\n【19】 ## Secondary Prevention\n- Regular follow up to look for complications and strict adherence to therapy has shown to prevent progression of the disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

This condition is known as the \"epileptic heart.\" This concept was first described by Dr. Richard L. Verrier and his colleagues in 2020.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\n- Absence of cardiac activity during epileptic seizure was first described by Dr. A.E. Russell, an English physician, in 1906.\n- The epileptic heart was first described by Drs. Verrier, Pang, Nearing, and Schachter, in 2020.\n\n【3】 # Classification\n- There is no established system for the classification of the epileptic heart.\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\n- The exact mechanisms involved in the development of the epileptic heart are still being elucidated. However, the conceptual framework below provides helpful information on the development of heart disease in patients with epilepsy.\n\n【5】 ## Epilepsy and Cardiac Arrhythmia\nCardiac arrhythmias have long been observed in patients with epilepsy. Three different mechanisms explain this association:\n- Direct (causal) pathway\n- Co-existence of epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia in the context of genetic disorders:\nGenes involved in epilepsy: SCN1A, KCNA1, and SCN8A\nGenes involved in inherited arrhythmogenic heart diseases: KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, RYR2\n- Genes involved in epilepsy: SCN1A, KCNA1, and SCN8A\n- Genes involved in inherited arrhythmogenic heart diseases: KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, RYR2\n- Resultant association:\nCertain anti-epileptic medications with sodium channel blocking properties have been known to cause arrhythmia.\nSeizure may also cause arrhythmia.\nIctal phase may be associated with tachycardia, asystole, bradycardia, and AV block.\nPostictal phase may be associated with asystole, AV block, atrial flutter or fibrillation, and ventricular fibrillation.\n- Certain anti-epileptic medications with sodium channel blocking properties have been known to cause arrhythmia.\n- Seizure may also cause arrhythmia.\n- Ictal phase may be associated with tachycardia, asystole, bradycardia, and AV block.\n- Postictal phase may be associated with asystole, AV block, atrial flutter or fibrillation, and ventricular fibrillation.\n\n【6】 ## Epilepsy and Structural Heart Disease\nThree mechanisms have been suggested to explain the association between epilepsy and structural heart disease:\n- Direct (causal) pathway in which structural heart disease may result in  embolic stroke and subsequent epilepsy.\n- Common risk factors contribute to the development of both epilepsy and structural heart disease.\n- Resultant pathway:\nEpilepsy may stimulate myocardial ischemia and a Takotsubo-like syndrome.\nCertain anti-epileptic medications contribute to the development of arteriosclerosis, weight gain, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome and result in a poorer cardiovascular risk profile.\n- Epilepsy may stimulate myocardial ischemia and a Takotsubo-like syndrome.\n- Certain anti-epileptic medications contribute to the development of arteriosclerosis, weight gain, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome and result in a poorer cardiovascular risk profile.\n- On microscopic histopathological analysis of patients with epilepsy a range of pathologies has been reported. These changes include fibrosis, myofibrillar degeneration, ventricular hypertrophy, focal myocardial fibrosis, perivascular and interstitial myocardial fibrosis, and mild to moderate coronary atherosclerosis.\n\n【7】 # Causes\nEpileptic heart may be caused by the following:\n- Accelerated atherosclerotic process due to side effect of longstanding antiepileptic therapy such as carbamazepine, gabapentin on lipid profile \n- Increased occurrence of arrhythmia due to hyperadrenergic state in seizure episodes \n- Cardiac autonomic dysfunction due to repeated siezue episodes, a predisposing factor of arrhythmia \n- Arrhythmogenic effect of antiepileptic drugs due to blockage of sodium channels  on heart \n- Susceptibility  to ventricular fibrillation before or after seizure episodes \n- Structural myocardium damage due to repeated seizures, such as myocardial calcified lesions, myocardial stiffness, cardiomegaly, ventricular hypertrophy, left artial dilation \n- Neurogenic stunned myocardium similar to tukotsubo, a reversible cardiomyopathy after a seizure episode \n- Increased occurrence of atrial fibrillation  after seizure episode\n\n【8】 # Differentiating epileptic heart from other Diseases\n- Epileptic heart  must be differentiated from other diseases that cause  loss of consciousness or sudden death  such as:\n- Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy( SUDEP)\n- Convulsion syncope\n- Epileptic seizure\n\n【9】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n- The incidence of heart disease such as coronary artery disease, heart attack in patients with epilepsy is approximately 25600 per 100,000 individuals between 45-64 years old. This amount in patients without epilepsy is 11500 per 100,000 individuals between 45-64 years old. \n- In 2018, the incidence of sudden cardiac death  in epileptic patients was estimated to be 4400 cases per 100,000 individuals in the united states which was 4.5 fold of SUDEP cases. \n- The incidence of heart disease in patients with epilepsy was 9% higher than patients without epilepsy.\n\n【10】 ## Age\n- Sudden cardiac death associated with chronic epilepsy  is more commonly observed among patients older than 40 years old. \n- Cardiac diseases associated to the chronic epilepsy is more commonly observed among patients between 45-64 years old.\n\n【11】 ## Gender\n- Males are more commonly affected with the epileptic heart than females.\n\n【12】 ## Race\n- There is no racial predilection for epileptic heart.\n\n【13】 # Risk Factors\n- Common risk factors in the development of epileptic heart may include:\n- Low socioeconomic status \n- Long-standing antiepileptic therapy\n- Hypertension\n- Hyperlipidemia\n- Diabetes mellitus\n- Male sex\n- Smoking\n- Aging\n- Progression of underlying cardiac disease\n\n【14】 # Screening\nCurrently, there is no guideline statement that recommended routine cardiac evaluation of patients with epilepsy. However, a resting 12-lead EKG and/or ambulatory EKG patch recording may be useful in identifying the patients at risk of cardiac pathology and further follow the progression of their cardiac pathology.\n\n【15】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\n- Patients with epileptic heart suffer from chronic epilepsy and antiepileptic drug resistance for many years.\n- Early clinical features include manifestation related to cardiac involvement such as syncope, chest discomfort, exertional dyspnea, and palpitation.\n- Patients with chronic epilepsy may progress to develop complications of arrhythmia and myocardial ischemia.\n- Common complications of the epileptic heart include coronary artery disease, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death.\n- Prognosis is generally poor, and the 1-year mortality of patients with chronic epilepsy due to sudden cardiac death is approximately 4.4%.\n\n【16】 # Diagnosis\n\n【17】 ## Diagnostic Criteria\n- The diagnosis of the epileptic heart is made when the following  diagnostic criteria are met:\n- Resistant epilepsy\n- Longstanding use of antiepileptic drugs\n- Presence of  arrhythmia syncope and high level of T waves alternance  as a marker of repolarization abnormality and ventricular fibrillation on ECG\n- Presence of ischemic heart disease earlier than the common age\n- Evidence of myocardial injury such as  high level of troponin I\n\n【18】 ## Hisory and Symptoms\n- Symptoms of the epileptic heart may include the following:\n- Abrupt palpitation\n- Shortness of breath\n- Angina pectori\n- lightheadness\n- Dizziness\n- Falling\n- Near falling\n\n【19】 ## Physical Examination\n- Physical examination associated with epilepsy include:\n- Automatic behaviors\n- Upward eye-rolling\n- Unconsciousness\n- Drolling\n- Cyanosis\n- Tachycardia\n- Hypertension\n- Postictal drowsiness\n- Fever\n- Mydriasis\n- Nystagmus\n- Urine and fecal incontinence\n- Disorientation to person, place, time\n- Altered mental status\n- Syncope\n- Leg edema\n- Elevated JVP\n- S3,S4\n- Tachypnea\n- Pulsus alternans\n- Systolic murmur in heart apex\n- Irregular pulses\n\n【20】 ## Laboratory Findings\nCommon laboratory findings related to epileptic heart may include:\n- An elevated concentration of serum troponin I as the  marker of myocardial injury in patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizure \n- Increased CRP, lipid profile due to induction of cytochrome P450  by antiepileptic drugs such as carbamazepine, gabapentin\n\n【21】 ## Electrocardiogram\nAn ECG may be helpful in the diagnosis of epileptic heart. Findings on an ECG suggestive of effects of seizure on the heart include: \n- Bundle-branch block\n- ST-segment changes indicating  myocardial ischemia in 40% of seizures \n- T-wave inversion\n- Bradycardia, asystole due to hypoxia or respiratory disturbance in postictal phase\n- Sinus tachycardia in ictal phase due to sympathetic activity or reduction in vagal tone in 82% of cases\n- QT interval  prolongation\n- QT interval dispersion\n- Increased T wave alternance in preictal and post ictal phases of generalized tonic-clonic seizure indicating repolarization abnormality\n- Decreased heart rate variability indicating  decreased vagus nerve activity   during seizure\n- Sinus tachycardia, heart rate >150/min indicating sympathetic discharge\n- Common ECG markers associated sudden cardiac death include:\n- Increased T waves alternance\n- Decreased heart rate variability \n- Arrhythmia associated seizure include: \n- Ictal bradycardia\n- Ictal AV conduction block\n- Ictal asystole\n- Post ictal asystole\n- Post ictal AV conduction block\n- Post ictal atrial flutter\n- Ictal asystole, bradycardia, AV block were self limiting.\n- Post ictal arrhythmia such as asystole, AV block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation were associated with near SUDEP or convulsion syncope.\n\n【22】 ## X-ray\nA Chest-x-ray may be helpful in the diagnosis of atherosclerosis associated with chronic epilepsy. Findings on an CXR suggestive of heart involvement in epilepsy include:\n- Aortic arch calcification \n- Cardiomegaly\n- Pulmonary congestion\n- Left atrial enlargement\n- Left ventricle enlargement\n\n【23】 ## Echocardiography or Ultrasound\nEchocardiography  may be helpful in the diagnosis of epilectic heart. Findings on an echocardiography diagnostic of epileptic heart include: \n- Increased left ventricular filling pressures\n- Increased left atrial volume\n- Increase left ventricular end systolic diameter\n- Increased left ventricular end systolic volume 64,65,66\n\n【24】 ## CT scan\nCoronary CT angiography may be helpful in the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease in chronic epilepsy. Findings on coronary CTangiography suggestive of ischemic hear disease include:\n- Coronary artery calcification\n- Narrowing of the coronary arteries\n- Plaque morphology\n- Plaque burden\n\n【25】 ## MRI\nCardiac magnetic resonance angiograpgy (MRA) may be helpful in the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease in chronic epilepsy. Findings on MRA suggestive of high-risk patients include: \n- Severe coronary artery stenosis(>70%)\n- Plaque with thick lipid-rich core and a thin fibrous cap and intraplaque inflammation\n\n【26】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nThere are no other imaging findings associated with epileptic heart.\n\n【27】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\nHolter ECG 24-48 hours may be helpful in the diagnosis of the arrhythmia-related epileptic heart. Findings suggestive the probability of the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation  include: \n- Higher level of T waves alternance\n- Decrease heart rate variability\n- QT prolongation\n- Other diagnostic studies for epileptic include ECG patches which are worn for 14 days with a higher chance for detection of tachyarrhythmia compared with Holter ECG.\n\n【28】 # Treatment\n\n【29】 ## Medical Therapy\n- The mainstay of therapy for epileptic heart is autonomic modulation by increased parasympathetic activity, decreased sympathetic activity which is effective for reducing the seizure episodes and increased cardiac electrical stability by the following: \n- Changing the arrhythmogenic antiepileptic drugs to other types\n- vagus nerve stimulation therapy for reducing sympathetic activity which is a major risk factor for ventricular fibrillation\n\n【30】 ## Surgery\n- Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) can be used in resistance epilepsy by inserting a pacemaker under the skin in the chest and sending regular, mild pulses to the brain via the vagus nerve.\n\n【31】 ## Prevention\n- Primary prevention measures in epileptic heart include:\n- Screening risk factors of coronary artery disease in every patients diagnosed with epilepsy consisting obesity,hypertension, hyperlipidemia,diabetes mellitus,smoking\n- The role of ICD implantation for primary prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmia in patients with chronic epilepsy is unclear. \n- The strategy for secondary prevention in chronic epileptic patients who are at risk of arrhythmia include:\n- Changing  arrhythmogenic drugs  that block sodium channel such as carbamazepine, phenytoin to other types\n- Vagus Nerve Stimulation therapy (VNS) for a reduction in T wave alternans \n- Chronic epileptic patients should be followed up for detection of T waves alternans and finding the risk of ventricular fibrillation by: \n- 12 lead ECG\n- Holter ECG 24-48 hours\n- Wireless ECG patches(patient-friendly tool, worn for 14 days, increased chance for detection of arrhythmia compared  with Holter ECG)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Common adverse reactions include potassium intoxication (paresthesias of the extremities,listlessness, mental confusion, weakness and heaviness of the legs, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, heart block).\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【5】 ### Indications\n- Potassium Acetate Injection, USP, 40 mEq is indicated as a source of potassium, for the addition to large volume intravenous fluids, to prevent or correct hypokalemia in patients with restricted or no oral intake. It is also useful as an additive for preparing specific intravenous fluid formulas when the needs of the patient cannot be met by standard electrolyte or nutrient solutions\n- The solution is intended as an alternative to potassium chloride to provide potassium ion (K+) for addition to large volume infusion fluids for intravenous use.\n\n【6】 ### Dosage\n- Potassium Acetate Injection, USP, 40 mEq is administered intravenously only after dilution in a larger volume of fluid. The dose and rate of administration are dependent upon the individual needs of the patient. ECG and serum potassium should be monitored as a guide to dosage. Using aseptic technique, all or part of the contents of one or more vials may be added to other intravenous fluids to provide any desired number of milliequivalents (mEq) of potassium (K+) with an equal number of milliequivalents of acetate (CH3COO−).\n- Maximum infusion rate: The infusion rate should not exceed 1 mEq/kg/hr.\n- Normal daily requirements:\n- Intraosseous infusion can be an alternate route for drug administration when intravenous access is not readily available.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\n\n【7】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【8】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Potassium acetate in adult patients.\n\n【9】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Potassium acetate in adult patients.\n\n【10】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【11】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Potassium acetate in pediatric patients.\n\n【12】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【13】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Potassium acetate in pediatric patients.\n\n【14】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Potassium acetate in pediatric patients.\n\n【15】 # Contraindications\n- Potassium administration is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency or adrenal insufficiency and in diseases where high potassium levels may be encountered.\n\n【16】 # Warnings\n- Potassium Acetate Injection, USP, 40 mEq must be diluted before use.\n- To avoid potassium intoxication, infuse potassium-containing solutions slowly. Potassium replacement therapy should be monitored whenever possible by continuous or serial electrocardiography (ECG). Serum potassium levels are not necessarily dependable indicators of tissue potassium levels.\n- Solutions which contain potassium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with hyperkalemia, severe renal failure and in conditions in which potassium retention is present.\n- In patients with diminished renal function, administration of solutions containing potassium ions may result in potassium retention.\n- Solutions containing acetate ions should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis. Acetate should be administered with great care in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of this ion, such as severe hepatic insufficiency.\n- WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.\n- Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.\n\n【17】 ### Precautions\n- Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact. Discard unused portion.\n- Potassium replacement therapy should be guided primarily by ECG monitoring and secondarily by the serum potassium level.\n- High plasma concentrations of potassium may cause death by cardiac depression, arrhythmias or arrest.\n- Use with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly in digitalized patients or in the presence of renal disease.\n- Solutions containing acetate ion should be used with caution as excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.\n\n【18】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【19】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Adverse reactions involve the possibility of potassium intoxication. The signs and symptoms of potassium intoxication include paresthesias of the extremities, flaccid paralysis, listlessness, mental confusion, weakness and heaviness of the legs, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, electrocardiographic abnormalities such as disappearance of P waves, spreading and slurring of the QRS complex with development of a biphasic curve and cardiac arrest.\n\n【20】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Potassium acetate Postmarketing Experience in the drug label.\n\n【21】 # Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Potassium acetate Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【22】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【23】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with potassium acetate. It is also not known whether potassium acetate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Potassium acetate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Potassium acetate in women who are pregnant.\n\n【24】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Potassium acetate during labor and delivery.\n\n【25】 ### Nursing Mothers\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Potassium acetate with respect to nursing mothers.\n\n【26】 ### Pediatric Use\n- The safety and effectiveness of potassium acetate have been established in pediatric patients.\n\n【27】 ### Geriatic Use\n- An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n- Potassium ions are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n\n【28】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Potassium acetate with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【29】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Potassium acetate with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【30】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Potassium acetate in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【31】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Potassium acetate in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【32】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Potassium acetate in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【33】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Potassium acetate in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【34】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【35】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n- Potassium Acetate Injection, USP, 40 mEq is administered intravenously only after dilution in a larger volume of fluid. The dose and rate of administration are dependent upon the individual needs of the patient. ECG and serum potassium should be monitored as a guide to dosage. Using aseptic technique, all or part of the contents of one or more vials may be added to other intravenous fluids to provide any desired number of milliequivalents (mEq) of potassium (K+) with an equal number of milliequivalents of acetate (CH3COO−).\n- Intraosseous\n\n【36】 ### Monitoring\n- ECG and serum potassium should be monitored as a guide to dosage.\n- Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n\n【37】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Potassium acetate in the drug label.\n\n【38】 # Overdosage\n- In the event of overdosage, discontinue infusion containing potassium acetate immediately and institute corrective therapy as indicated to reduce elevated serum potassium levels and restore acid-base balance if necessary\n\n【39】 # Pharmacology\n\n【40】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- As the principal cation of the intracellular fluid, potassium plays an important role in fluid and electrolyte balance\n- Acetate (CH3COO−), a source of hydrogen ion acceptors, is an alternate source of bicarbonate (HCO3−) by metabolic conversion in the liver.\n\n【41】 ## Structure\n- Potassium acetate, USP is chemically designated CH3COOK, colorless crystals or white crystalline powder very soluble in water.\n- The semi-rigid vial is fabricated from a specially formulated polyolefin. It is a copolymer of ethylene and propylene. The safety of the plastic has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological standards for plastic containers. The container requires no vapor barrier to maintain the proper drug concentration.\n\n【42】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Potassium acetate in the drug label.\n\n【43】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- As the principal cation of the intracellular fluid, potassium plays an important role in fluid and electrolyte balance. The normal potassium concentration in the intracellular fluid compartment is about 160 mEq/liter. The normal serum potassium range is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter. The kidney normally regulates potassium balance but does not conserve potassium as well or as promptly as it conserves sodium. The daily turnover of potassium in the normal adult averages 50 to 150 mEq (milliequivalents) and represents 1.5 to 5% of the total potassium content of the body.\n- Acetate (CH3COO−), a source of hydrogen ion acceptors, is an alternate source of bicarbonate (HCO3−) by metabolic conversion in the liver. This has been shown to proceed readily, even in the presence of severe liver disease.\n\n【44】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Potassium acetate in the drug label.\n\n【45】 # Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Potassium acetate in the drug label.\n\n【46】 # How Supplied\n- Potassium Acetate Injection, USP, 40 mEq (2 mEq/mL) of K+ is supplied in a 20 mL partial-fill single-dose fliptop vial (List 8183).\n- Each container is partially filled to provide air space for complete vacuum withdrawal of the contents into the I.V. container.\n\n【47】 ## Storage\n- Store at 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F).\n\n【48】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n【49】 # Patient Counseling Information\nThere is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of Potassium acetate in the drug label.\n\n【50】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Potassium acetate interaction has not been established.

It includes the energy in all the chemical bonds, and the energy of the free, conduction electrons in metals.\nOne can also calculate the internal energy of electromagnetic or blackbody radiation. It is a state function of a system, and is an extensive quantity. The SI unit of energy is the joule although other historical, conventional units are still in use, such as the (small and large) calorie for heat.\n\n【1】 # Overview\nInternal energy does not include the translational or rotational kinetic energy of a body as a whole. It also does not include the relativistic mass-energy equivalent E = mc2. It excludes any potential energy a body may have because of its location in external gravitational or electrostatic field, although the potential energy it has in a field due to an induced electric or magnetic dipole moment does count, as does the energy of deformation of solids (stress-strain).\nThe principle of equipartition of energy in classical statistical mechanics states that each molecular quadratic degree of freedom receives 1/2 kT of energy,\na result which was modified when quantum mechanics explained certain anomalies; e.g., in the observed specific heats of crystals (when  hν > kT). For monoatomic helium and other noble gases, the internal energy consists only of the translational kinetic energy of the individual atoms. Monoatomic particles, of course, do not (sensibly) rotate or vibrate, and are not electronically excited to higher energies except at very high temperatures.\nFrom the standpoint of statistical mechanics, the internal energy is equal to the ensemble average of the total energy of the system.\n\n【2】 # Composition\nInternal energy – the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system.  It is related to the molecular structure and the degree of molecular activity and may be viewed as the sum of kinetic and potential energies of the molecules; it is comprised of the following types of energies:\n\n【3】 # The first law of thermodynamics\nThe internal energy is essentially defined by the first law of thermodynamics which states that energy is conserved:\nwhere\nThe first law may be stated equivalently in infinitesimal terms as:\nwhere the terms now represent infinitesimal amounts of the respective quantities. The d before the internal energy function indicates that it is an exact differential. In other words it is a state function or a value which can be assigned to the system. On the other hand, the δ's before the other terms indicate that they describe increments of energy which are not state functions but rather they are processes by which the internal energy is changed. \nFrom a microscopic point of view, the internal energy may be found in many different forms. For a gas it may consist almost entirely of the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. It may also consist of the potential energy of these molecules in a gravitational, electric, or magnetic field. For any material, solid, liquid or gaseous, it may also consist of the potential energy of attraction or repulsion between the individual molecules of the material.\n\n【4】 # Expressions for the internal energy\nThe internal energy may be expressed in terms of other thermodynamic parameters. Each term is composed of an intensive variable (a generalized force) and its conjugate infinitesimal extensive variable (a generalized displacement).\nFor example, for a non-viscous fluid, the mechanical work done on the system may be related to the pressure p and volume V. The pressure is the intensive generalized force, while the volume is the extensive generalized displacement:\nTaking the default direction of work, W, to be from the working fluid to the surroundings,\nTaking the default direction of heat transfer, q, to be into the working fluid and assuming a reversible process, we have\nThe above two equations in the first law of thermodynamics imply for a closed system:\nIf we also incude the dependence on the numbers of paticles in the system, the internal energy function may be written as U(S,V,N_{1}, N_{2},\\ldots) where the N_{j} are the numbers of particles of type j in the system.

In 1915, Bertram Sippy introduced a treatment for peptic ulcer disease which was an hourly mixture of milk and cream combined with alkaline powders. In 1923, the toxic effects of Sippy’s regimen were reported for the first time. With the introduction of histamine antagonists and decrease in antacid consumption since the 1970s, the incidence of milk-alkali syndrome has decreased significantly. However, since the 1990s, there has been an increase in milk-alkali syndrome due to an increase in calcium and vitamin D consumption in postmenopausal women for osteoporosis prevention. Treatment of milk-alkali syndrome is mostly supportive and mainly includes the withdrawal of the offending agent, hydration, and intravenous volume expansion. Prognosis of milk-alkali syndrome is generally good and early diagnosis and treatment, with the withdrawal of the offending agent and supportive therapy, usually resolve the symptoms and abnormalities in milk-alkali syndrome (hypercalcemia, alkalosis and renal insufficiency).\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\nIn 1915, Bertram Sippy introduced a treatment for peptic ulcer disease which was an hourly mixture of milk and cream combined with alkaline powders. In 1923, the toxic effects of Sippy’s regimen was reported for the first time. With the introduction of histamine antagonists and decrease in antacid consumption since the 1970s, the incidence of milk-alkali syndrome has decreased significantly. However, since the 1990s, there has been an increase in milk-alkali syndrome due to increase in calcium and vitamin D consumption in postmenopausal women for osteoporosis prevention.\n\n【3】 # Classification\nMilk-alkali syndrome may be classified as the following: acute (toxemic form), subacute (Cope's syndrome) and chronic (Burnett's syndrome).\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\nThe exact pathogenesis of milk-alkali syndrome is unknown. Hypercalcemia in milk-alkali syndrome involves several mechanisms including: intestinal absorption of calcium is increased, bone buffering of calcium becomes saturated, and renal excretion of calcium is decreased. Several factors that increase bicarbonate reabsorption and contribute to the alkalosis in milk-alkali syndrome include: volume depletion due to increased sodium and free water excretion caused by increased calcium intake, suppression of PTH, direct tubular effects of calcium and other factors that cause volume depletion or alkalosis such as vomiting or thiazide use.\n\n【5】 # Causes\nCurrently, the main cause of milk-alkali syndrome is calcium carbonate consumption, mostly in postmenopausal women for osteoporosis prevention or treatment or in patients on glucocorticoid therapy (for example in organ transplantation), and chronic renal disease. With the introduction of histamine antagonists and decrease in antacid consumption since the 1970s, the incidence of milk-alkali syndrome has decreased significantly. However, since the 1990s, there has been an increase in milk-alkali syndrome mostly due to increase in calcium and vitamin D consumption in postmenopausal women for osteoporosis prevention.\n\n【6】 # Differentiating Milk-alkali syndrome from other Diseases\nMilk-alkali syndrome should be differentiated from other disorders that cause hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism, malignancies, hyperthyroidism, immobilization, sarcoidosis and some drugs (thiazides, vitamin D, lithium and vitamin A toxicity)\n\n【7】 # Risk Factors\nPatients with the following conditions are more susceptible to milk-alkali syndrome: Older age, preexisting chronic renal disease, concurrent vomiting (bulimia nervosa  or hyperemesis gravidarum ) and use of certain drugs like thiazide, NSAIDs, and ACE inhibitors.\n\n【8】 # Screening\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for milk-alkali syndrome.\n\n【9】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nMost patients with milk-alkali syndrome are asymptomatic and may be incidentally diagnosed. Complications of milk-alkali syndrome may include: confusion, psychosis, renal insufficiency, pancreatitis, abnormalities in cardiac conduction, and metastatic calcification. Prognosis of milk-alkali syndrome is generally good and early diagnosis and treatment, with withdrawal of the offending agent and supportive therapy, usually resolve the symptoms and abnormalities in milk-alkali syndrome (hypercalcemia, alkalosis and renal insufficiency).\n\n【10】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\nThe exact incidence and prevalence of milk-alkali syndrome is not known.\nWith the introduction of histamine antagonists and decrease in antacid consumption since the 1970s, the incidence of milk-alkali syndrome has decreased significantly. However, since the 1990s, there has been an increase in milk-alkali syndrome due to increase in calcium and vitamin D consumption in postmenopausal women for osteoporosis prevention. Milk-alkali syndrome is the third most common cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients after primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancies.\n\n【11】 # Diagnosis\n\n【12】 ## Diagnostic Study of Choice\nMilk-alkali syndrome is diagnosed by a history of excessive calcium consumption, hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis and variable degrees of renal insufficiency.\n\n【13】 ## History and Symptoms\nIn patients with milk-alkali syndrome, there is a history of excessive calcium and absorbable alkali consumption. Symptoms of milk-alkali syndrome may inculde: dizziness, vertigo, confusion, apathy, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, distaste for milk, headache, anorexia, pruritus, polydipsia, polyuria, myalgia, tremor, psychosis, and abnormal calcifications (keratopathy, renal calcinosis).\n\n【14】 ## Physical Examination\nThe following should be considered in the physical examination of milk-alkali syndrome: vertigo, confusion, apathy, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, polydipsia, polyuria, myalgia, tremor, psychosis, and abnormal calcifications (keratopathy, renal calcinosis).\n\n【15】 ## Laboratory Findings\nThe following laboratory findings are usually seen in milk-alkali syndrome: hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, variable degrees of renal insufficiency, low or normal phosphorus, low Vitamin D, and low PTH.\n\n【16】 ## Electrocardiogram\nMilk-alkali syndrome causes hypercalcemia and hypercalcemia may cause the following findings on electrocardiogram (ECG): shortened QT interval (the most common finding), shortened ST segment, PR prolongation, increased amplitude of QRS complex, decreased amplitude of T wave, T wave notching, transient ST segment elevation, bradycardia, sinus arrest, and  ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n【17】 ## X-ray\nX-ray is not useful in the diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome. However, X-ray may be useful in excluding other causes of hypercalcemia. Renal calcium deposits are not seen on X-ray in milk-alkali syndrome.\n\n【18】 ## Echocardiography and Ultrasound\nEchocardiography is not useful in the diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome. Ultrasound is not useful in the diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome. However, ultrasound may be helpful in excluding other causes of hypercalcemia.\n\n【19】 ## CT Scan\nCT scan is not useful in the diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome. However, CT scan may be helpful in excluding other causes of hypercalcemia.\n\n【20】 ## MRI\nMRI is not useful in the diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome. However, MRI may be helpful in excluding other causes of hypercalcemia.\n\n【21】 ## Other Imaging Findings\nThere are no other imaging findings associated with milk-alkali syndrome.\n\n【22】 ## Other Diagnostic studies\nThere are no other diagnostic studies associated with milk-alkali syndrome.\n\n【23】 # Treatment\n\n【24】 ## Medical therapy\nTreatment of milk-alkali syndrome is mostly supportive and mainly includes withdrawal of the offending agent, hydration and intravenous volume expansion. However, other treatments such as therapy with calcium supplements (in temporary hypocalcemia) and hemodialysis (in acute or chronic irreversible renal insufficiency) may be required.\n\n【25】 ## Surgery\nSurgical intervention is not recommended for the routine management of milk-alkali syndrome.\n\n【26】 ## Primary Prevention\nEffective measures for the primary prevention of milk-alkali syndrome includes public education about the potential adverse effects of calcium supplements. Calcium intake less than 2 g/daily is usually safe, however, 1.2 to 1.5 g/daily of calcium intake should be taken by individuals with risk factors for milk-alkali syndrome.\n\n【27】 ## Secondary Prevention\nThere are no established measures for the secondary prevention of milk-alkali syndrome.\n\n【28】 ## Cost-Effectiveness of Therapy\nThere is insufficient evidence about the cost-effectiveness of therapy in milk-alkali syndrome.\n\n【29】 ## Future or Investigational Therapies\nNo further or investigational therapies have been suggested in milk-alkali syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The assessment of cardiac rhythm during follow-up varied between studies, and some patients were concomitantly treated with anti-arrhythmic medication. Evidence on safety shows a low incidence of serious complications but this is also based on a limited number of patients. Therefore the procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.\nClinicians wishing to undertake thoracoscopic epicardial radiofrequency ablation for AF should take the following actions.\nInform the clinical governance leads in their Trusts.\nEnsure that patients understand the uncertainty about the procedure's safety and efficacy, and provide them with clear written information. In addition, the use of NICE's information for patients ('Understanding NICE guidance') is recommended.\nPatient selection for thoracoscopic epicardial radiofrequency ablation for AF should involve a multidisciplinary team including a cardiologist and a cardiac surgeon, both with training and experience in the use of intraoperative electrophysiology.\nThe procedure should only be carried out by surgeons with specific training and experience in both thoracoscopic surgery and radiofrequency ablation.\nThe NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care runs the UK Central Cardiac Audit Database (CCAD), and is developing a database for this procedure. Clinicians should collect data on the procedure and submit them to the database when it becomes available.\nNICE encourages further comparative research into the treatment and management of AF, with clearly defined outcomes. NICE may review this procedure on publication of further evidence.# The procedure\n\n【2】 # Indications and current treatments\nAtrial fibrillation is irregular and rapid beating of the atria. It can be classified as paroxysmal, persistent or permanent, depending on the duration of episodes and patients' response to treatment. Atrial fibrillation can cause fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath and fainting. There is an increased risk of death and stroke.\nMedication for AF may aim either to maintain a normal cardiac rhythm or control the rate of the ventricular response, and to reduce the risk of thromboembolism (which may cause stroke). Ablation procedures are used when drug therapy is either not tolerated or is ineffective.\n\n【3】 # Outline of the procedure\nThoracoscopic epicardial radiofrequency ablation is carried out with the patient under general anaesthesia. Two or more small incisions are made in the chest wall. The right lung is deflated and the right pulmonary veins are accessed via blunt dissection. A bipolar radiofrequency device is inserted through a catheter and positioned around the atrium adjacent to the pulmonary veins. Radiofrequency energy is applied to create full thickness ablation in the myocardium, with the aim of electrically isolating the pulmonary veins. Intraoperative electrophysiological testing may be used to check whether isolation has been achieved. The procedure is repeated on the left pulmonary veins.\nThe left atrial appendage may be excised during the procedure, to minimise the risk of subsequent thromboembolic events.\nSections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes which were available in the published literature and which the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the overview.\n\n【4】 # Efficacy\nIn four case series of 70, 26, 22 and 20 patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF, 93% (65/70), 81% (21/26), 91% (20/22) and 90% (18/20) were in sinus rhythm at follow-up ranging from 6 to 18 months.\nIn the case series of 70 patients, 43%, 23% and 14% of patients with paroxysmal AF (n = 42) were using anti-arrhythmic medication at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively (absolute numbers not reported). In the same study, 61%, 26% and 38% of patients with persistent AF (n = 28) were using anti-arrhythmic medication at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively (absolute numbers not reported). In two case series of 27 and 26 patients, 65% (15 of the 23 patients with follow-up of at least 3 months) and 57% (12 of the 21 patients in sinus rhythm at 6-month follow-up), respectively, were no longer using anti-arrhythmic medication. In the case series of 22 and 20 patients, 91% (20/22) and 85% (17/20) were not using anti-arrhythmic medication at their last follow-up (mean follow-up 18 and 17 months, respectively).\nThe Specialist Advisers considered key efficacy outcomes to include reduced use of anti-arrhythmic medication and decreased burden of AF for patients with paroxysmal AF. One Specialist Adviser stated that the procedure's long-term efficacy was uncertain.\n\n【5】 # Safety\nThe case series of 70 patients reported two major complications: 1 patient required revision surgery 10 days postoperatively because of fistula formation between the left atrium and the oesophagus, and another required angioplasty and stent insertion for stenosis of the circumflex coronary artery 6 weeks after the procedure. The case series of 27 patients reported one case each of right pneumothorax and suspected pericarditis. In the case series of 26 patients, 1 patient required aspiration of pleural effusion.\nThe Specialist Advisers stated that theoretical and anecdotal adverse events included injury to the heart or adjacent structures, bleeding from the atrial appendage, coronary artery occlusion, pulmonary vein stenosis and increased risk of arrhythmias postoperatively.\n\n【6】 # Other comments\nThe fact that that some patients had concomitant excision of the left atrial appendage, and others did not, complicated interpretation of the evidence.# Further information\nNICE has published a clinical guideline on AF and interventional procedures guidance on a number of procedures for AF, with or without cardiac surgery. For more information go to our website.\n\n【7】 # Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers ('Understanding NICE guidance'). It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in mind.# About this guidance\nNICE interventional procedure guidance makes recommendations on the safety and efficacy of the procedure. It does not cover whether or not the NHS should fund a procedure. Funding decisions are taken by local NHS bodies after considering the clinical effectiveness of the procedure and whether it represents value for money for the NHS. It is for healthcare professionals and people using the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is endorsed by Healthcare Improvement Scotland for implementation by NHSScotland.\nThis guidance was developed using the NICE interventional procedure guidance process.\nWe have produced a summary of this guidance for patients and carers. Information about the evidence it is based on is also available.\nChanges since publication\nMay 2012: minor maintenance.\nYour responsibility\nThis guidance represents the views of NICE and was arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence.

{"seq_id": "a16c0149-cf6b-4859-a346-f0b377ea1e69", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Carbon monoxide detector\nA carbon monoxide detector is a device that detects the presence of the toxic gas carbon monoxide (CO), a colorless and odorless compound produced by incomplete combustion and lethal at high levels. If a high level of CO is detected, the device sounds an alarm, giving people in the area a chance to ventilate the area or safely leave the building.\nCO detectors do not serve as smoke detectors and vice versa. However, dual smoke/CO detectors are also sold. Smoke detectors detect the smoke generated by flaming or smoldering fires, whereas CO detectors can alarm people about faulty fuel burning devices. Carbon monoxide is produced from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. In the home CO can be formed, for example, by open flames, space heaters, blocked chimneys or running a car inside a garage.\nWhen an alarm sounds, action must be taken immediately. This may include evacuating the premise if experiencing CO poisoning symptoms (confusion, headaches, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, etc), ventilation of the premises, and contacting professionals to inspect CO emitting sources. If you suspect you have suffered CO poisoning, go outside immediately and call the emergency number. At high levels, breathing CO gas is fatal within minutes.\n\n【1】 # Installation\nThe devices, which retail for $20-$60USD and are widely available, can either be battery-operated or AC powered (with or without a battery backup). Batteries should be replaced regularly to guarantee proper operation.  (They generally last about a year; most detectors are designed to signal a low-battery condition.)\nIt is important to install the detector in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. CO detectors can be placed near the ceiling or near the floor as CO is very close to the same density as air. Detectors should be placed outside the bedrooms.\nSince CO is colorless and odorless (unlike smoke from a fire), detection in a home environment is impossible without such a warning device. In North America, some state, provincial and municipal governments require installation of CO detectors in new units - among them, the U.S. states of Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Vermont; the Canadian province of Ontario; and New York City.\nAll CO detectors have \"test\" buttons and, like smoke detectors, should be tested regularly (weekly or monthly).\nCommon modern  battery-powered models have a limited life (of about seven years), and are designed to signal a need to be replaced after that timespan.\n\n【2】 # Sensors\nEarly designs were basically a white or beige element which would fade to a brownish or blackish color if carbon monoxide were present. As carbon monoxide related deaths increased during the 1990s, audible alarms became standard.\nThe alarm points on carbon monoxide detectors are not a simple alarm level as in smoke detectors but are a concentration-time function.  At lower concentrations (eg 100 parts per million) the detector will not sound an alarm for many tens of minutes.  At 400 parts per million (PPM), the alarm will sound within a few minutes.  This concentration-time function is intended to mimic the uptake of carbon monoxide in the body while also preventing false alarms due to relatively common sources of carbon monoxide such as cigarette smoke.\nThere are three types of sensors available and they vary in cost, accuracy and speed of response.  However, since CO levels normally increase very slowly and there is a large ratio between safe and unsafe levels and levels that cause minor and severe symptoms, all three are entirely adequate for use.  All three types of sensor elements typically last from 3 to 5 years and should be replaced after that time.  At least one CO detector is available which includes a battery and sensor in a replaceable module.  Most CO detectors do not have replaceable sensors.\n\n【3】 ## Biomimetic\nA biomimetic (chem-optical or gel cell) sensor works with a form of synthetic  hemoglobin which darkens in the presence of CO, and lightens without it.  This can either be seen directly or connected to a light sensor and alarm.\n\n【4】 ## Electrochemical\nA type of fuel cell that instead of being designed to produce power, is designed to produce a current that is precisely related to the amount of the target gas (in this case carbon monoxide) in the atmosphere.  Measurement of the current therefore gives a measure of the concentration of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere.  Essentially the electrochemical cell consists of a container, 2 electrodes, connection wires and an electrolyte - typically sulfuric acid.  Carbon monoxide is oxidised at one electrode to carbon dioxide whilst oxygen is consumed at the other electrode.  For carbon monoxide detection, the electrochemical cell has advantages over the other technologies in that it has a highly accurate and linear output to carbon monoxide concentration, requires minimal power as it is operated at room temperature, and has a long lifetime (typically commercial available cells now have lifetimes of 5 years or greater).  Until recently, the cost of these cells and concerns about their long term reliability had limited uptake of this technology in the marketplace although these concerns are now largely overcome.\n\n【5】 ## Semiconductor\nThin wires of the semiconductor tin dioxide on an insulating ceramic base provide a sensor monitored by an integrated circuit. CO reduces resistance and so allows a greater current which if high enough will lead to the monitor triggering an alarm.\n\n【6】 # Digital\nAlthough all home detectors use an audible alarm signal as the primary indicator, some versions also offer a digital readout of the CO concentration, in ppm.  Typically, they can display both the current reading and a peak reading from memory of the highest level measured over a period of time.  These advanced models cost somewhat more but are otherwise similar to the basic models.\nThe digital models offer the advantage of being able to observe levels that are below the alarm threshold, learn about levels that may have occurred during an absence, and assess the degree of hazard if the alarm sounds.  They may also aid emergency responders in evaluating the level of past or ongoing exposure or danger.\n\n【7】 # Alarm Manufacturers\n- BRK Electronics (BRK Brands, Inc.)\n- Dicon Safety Products\n- DuPont\n- FireAngel (Sprue Aegis plc)\n- First Alert (BRK Brands, Inc.)\n- Kidde", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

On day 5, patients received cisplatin 150 mg/m over a 2 hour period with hydration.\n- 1 cycle of cisplatin 80 mg/m as a continuous 24-hour IV infusion within 7 days of diagnosis.\n\n【14】 # Contraindications\n- Cisplatin is contraindicated in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Cisplatin should not be employed in myelosuppressed patients, or in patients with hearing impairment.\n- Cisplatin is contraindicated in patients with a history of allergic reactions to cisplatin or other platinum-containing compounds.\n\n【15】 # Warnings\n- Cisplatin produces cumulative nephrotoxicity which is potentiated by aminoglycoside antibiotics. The serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine clearance, and magnesium, sodium, potassium, and calcium levels should be measured prior to initiating therapy, and prior to each subsequent course. At the recommended dosage, cisplatin should not be given more frequently than once every 3 to 4 weeks. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to nephrotoxicity.\n- There are reports of severe neuropathies in patients in whom regimens are employed using higher doses of cisplatin or greater dose frequencies than those recommended. These neuropathies may be irreversible and are seen as paresthesias in a stocking-glove distribution, areflexia, and loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to peripheral neuropathy.\n- Loss of motor function has also been reported.\n- Anaphylactic-like reactions to cisplatin have been reported. These reactions have occurred within minutes of administration to patients with prior exposure to cisplatin, and have been alleviated by administration of epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines.\n- Cisplatin can commonly cause ototoxicity which is cumulative and may be severe. Audiometric testing should be performed prior to initiating therapy and prior to each subsequent dose of drug.\n- Certain genetic variants in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) gene are associated with increased risk of ototoxicity in children administered conventional doses of cisplatin. Children who do not have one of these TPMT gene variants remain at risk for ototoxicity. All pediatric patients receiving cisplatin should have audiometric testing at baseline, prior to each subsequent dose, of drug and for several years post therapy.\n- Cisplatin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Cisplatin is mutagenic in bacteria and produces chromosome aberrations in animal cells in tissue culture. In mice cisplatin is teratogenic and embryotoxic. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.\n- The carcinogenic effect of cisplatin was studied in BD IX rats. Cisplatin was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to 50 BD IX rats for 3 weeks, 3 X 1 mg/kg body weight per week. Four hundred and fifty-five days after the first application, 33 animals died, 13 of them related to malignancies: 12 leukemias and 1 renal fibrosarcoma.\n- The development of acute leukemia coincident with the use of cisplatin has been reported. In these reports, cisplatin was generally given in combination with other leukemogenic agents.\n- Injection site reactions may occur during the administration of cisplatin. Given the possibility of extravasation, it is recommended to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration. A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time.\n\n【16】 ### Precautions\n- Peripheral blood counts should be monitored weekly. Liver function should be monitored periodically. Neurologic examination should also be performed regularly.\n\n【17】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【18】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Dose-related and cumulative renal insufficiency, including acute renal failure, is the major dose-limiting toxicity of cisplatin. Renal toxicity has been noted in 28% to 36% of patients treated with a single dose of 50 mg/m2. It is first noted during the second week after a dose and is manifested by elevations in BUN and creatinine, serum uric acid and/or a decrease in creatinine clearance. Renal toxicity becomes more prolonged and severe with repeated courses of the drug. Renal function must return to normal before another dose of cisplatin can be given. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to nephrotoxicity.\n- Impairment of renal function has been associated with renal tubular damage. The administration of cisplatin using a 6- to 8-hour infusion with intravenous hydration, and mannitol has been used to reduce nephrotoxicity. However, renal toxicity still can occur after utilization of these procedures.\n- Ototoxicity has been observed in up to 31% of patients treated with a single dose of cisplatin 50 mg/m2, and is manifested by tinnitus and/or hearing loss in the high frequency range (4000 to 8000 Hz). The prevelance of hearing loss in children is particularly high and is estimated to be 40-60%. Decreased ability to hear normal conversational tones may occur. Deafness after the initial dose of cisplatin has been reported. Ototoxic effects may be more severe in children receiving cisplatin.\n- Hearing loss can be unilateral or bilateral and tends to become more frequent and severe with repeated cisplatin doses. It is unclear whether cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is reversible. Vestibular toxicity has also been reported. Ototoxic effects may be related to the peak plasma concentration of cisplatin. Ototoxicity can occur during treatment or be delayed. Audiometric monitoring should be performed prior to initiation of therapy, prior to each subsequent dose, and for several years post therapy.\n- The risk of ototoxicity may increased by prior or simultaneous cranial irradiation, and may be more severe in patients less than 5 years of age, patients being treated with other ototoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycosides and vancomycin), and in patients with renal impairment. Variants in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene (TPMT) have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of ototoxicity in children treated with cisplatin.\n- Other genetic factors may also contribute to the cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.\n- Myelosuppression occurs in 25% to 30% of patients treated with cisplatin. The nadirs in circulating platelets and leukocytes occur between days 18 to 23 (range 7.5 to 45) with most patients recovering by day 39 (range 13 to 62). Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are more pronounced at higher doses (>50 mg/m2). Anemia (decrease of 2 g hemoglobin/100 mL) occurs at approximately the same frequency and with the same timing as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Fever and infection have also been reported in patients with neutropenia. Potential fatalities due to infection (secondary to myelosuppression) have been reported. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to myelosuppression.\n- In addition to anemia secondary to myelosuppression, a Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia has been reported. In the presence of cisplatin hemolytic anemia, a further course of treatment may be accompanied by increased hemolysis and this risk should be weighed by the treating physician.\n- The development of acute leukemia coincident with the use of cisplatin has been reported. In these reports, cisplatin was generally given in combination with other leukemogenic agents.\n- Marked nausea and vomiting occur in almost all patients treated with cisplatin, and may be so severe that the drug must be discontinued. Nausea and vomiting may begin within 1 to 4 hours after treatment and last up to 24 hours. Various degrees of vomiting, nausea and/or anorexia may persist for up to 1 week after treatment.\n- Delayed nausea and vomiting (begins or persists 24 hours or more after chemotherapy) has occurred in patients attaining complete emetic control on the day of cisplatin therapy.\n- Diarrhea has also been reported.\n- Vascular toxicities coincident with the use of cisplatin in combination with other antineoplastic agents have been reported. The events are clinically heterogeneous and may include myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, thrombotic microangiopathy (hemolytic-uremic syndrome ), or cerebral arteritis. Various mechanisms have been proposed for these vascular complications. There are also reports of Raynaud's phenomenon occurring in patients treated with the combination of bleomycin, vinblastine with or without cisplatin. It has been suggested that hypomagnesemia developing coincident with the use of cisplatin may be an added, although not essential, factor associated with this event. However, it is currently unknown if the cause of Raynaud's phenomenon in these cases is the disease, underlying vascular compromise, bleomycin, vinblastine, hypomagnesemia, or a combination of any of these factors.\n- Serum Electrolyte Disturbances\n- Hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia have been reported to occur in patients treated with cisplatin and are probably related to renal tubular damage. Tetany has been reported in those patients with hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Generally, normal serum electrolyte levels are restored by administering supplemental electrolytes and discontinuing cisplatin.\n- Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome has also been reported.\n- Hyperuricemia\n- Hyperuricemia has been reported to occur at approximately the same frequency as the increases in BUN and serum creatinine.\n- It is more pronounced after doses greater than 50 mg/m2, and peak levels of uric acid generally occur between 3 to 5 days after the dose. Allopurinol therapy for hyperuricemia effectively reduces uric acid levels.\n- Neurotoxicity\n- Neurotoxicity, usually characterized by peripheral neuropathies, has been reported. The neuropathies usually occur after prolonged therapy (4 to 7 months); however, neurologic symptoms have been reported to occur after a single dose. Although symptoms and signs of cisplatin neuropathy usually develop during treatment, symptoms of neuropathy may begin 3 to 8 weeks after the last dose of cisplatin. Cisplatin therapy should be discontinued when the symptoms are first observed. The neuropathy, however, may progress further even after stopping treatment. Preliminary evidence suggests peripheral neuropathy may be irreversible in some patients. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to peripheral neuropathy.\n- Lhermitte's sign, dorsal column myelopathy, and autonomic neuropathy have also been reported.\n- Loss of taste, seizures, leukoencephalopathy, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have also been reported.\n- Muscle cramps, defined as localized, painful, involuntary skeletal muscle contractions of sudden onset and short duration, have been reported and were usually associated in patients receiving a relatively high cumulative dose of cisplatin and with a relatively advanced symptomatic stage of peripheral neuropathy.\n- Ocular Toxicity\n- Optic neuritis, papilledema, and cerebral blindness have been reported in patients receiving standard recommended doses of cisplatin. Improvement and/or total recovery usually occurs after discontinuing cisplatin. Steroids with or without mannitol have been used; however, efficacy has not been established.\n- Blurred vision and altered color perception have been reported after the use of regimens with higher doses of cisplatin or greater dose frequencies than recommended in the package insert. The altered color perception manifests as a loss of color discrimination, particularly in the blue-yellow axis. The only finding on funduscopic exam is irregular retinal pigmentation of the macular area.\n- Anaphylactic-Like Reactions\n- Anaphylactic-like reactions have been reported in patients previously exposed to cisplatin. The reactions consist of facial edema, wheezing, tachycardia, and hypotension within a few minutes of drug administration. Reactions may be controlled by intravenous epinephrine with corticosteroids and/or antihistamines as indicated. Patients receiving cisplatin should be observed carefully for possible anaphylactic-like reactions and supportive equipment and medication should be available to treat such a complication.\n- Hepatotoxicity\n- Transient elevations of liver enzymes, especially SGOT, as well as bilirubin, have been reported to be associated with cisplatin administration at the recommended doses.\n- Other Events\n- Cardiac abnormalities, hiccups, elevated serum amylase, rash, alopecia, malaise, asthenia, and dehydration have been reported.\n- Local soft tissue toxicity has been reported following extravasation of cisplatin. Severity of the local tissue toxicity appears to be related to the concentration of the cisplatin solution. Infusion of solutions with a cisplatin concentration greater than 0.5 mg/mL may result in tissue cellulitis, fibrosis, necrosis, pain, edema, and erythema.\n\n【19】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Cisplatin in the drug label.\n\n【20】 # Drug Interactions\n- Plasma levels of anticonvulsant agents may become subtherapeutic during cisplatin therapy.\n- In a randomized trial in advanced ovarian cancer, response duration was adversely affected when pyridoxine was used in combination with altretamine (hexamethylmelamine) and cisplatin.\n\n【21】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【22】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA):\n- Pregnancy Category D\n- Cisplatin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Cisplatin is mutagenic in bacteria and produces chromosome aberrations in animal cells in tissue culture. In mice cisplatin is teratogenic and embryotoxic. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Cisplatin in women who are pregnant.\n\n【23】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Cisplatin during labor and delivery.\n\n【24】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Cisplatin has been reported to be found in human milk; patients receiving cisplatin should not breast-feed.\n\n【25】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Variants in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) gene are associated with an increased risk of ototoxicity in children treated with cisplatin.\n- All children should have audiometric monitoring performed prior to initiation of therapy prior to each subsequent dose, and for several years post therapy. Advanced testing methods may allow for earlier detection of hearing loss in an attempt to facilitate the rapid initiation of interventions that can limit the potential adverse impact of hearing impairment on a child's cognitive and social development.\n\n【26】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Insufficient data are available from clinical trials of cisplatin in the treatment of metastatic testicular tumors or advanced bladder cancer to determine whether elderly patients respond differently than younger patients. In four clinical trials of combination chemotherapy for advanced ovarian carcinoma, 1484 patients received cisplatin either in combination with cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel. Of these, 426 (29%) were older than 65 years. In these trials, age was not found to be a prognostic factor for survival. However, in a later secondary analysis for one of these trials, elderly patients were found to have shorter survival compared with younger patients. In all four trials, elderly patients experienced more severe neutropenia than younger patients. Higher incidences of severe thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were  In the two trials where nonhematologic toxicity was evaluated according to age, elderly patients had a numerically higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience suggests that elderly patients may be more susceptible to myelosuppression, infectious complications, and nephrotoxicity than younger patients.\n- Cisplatin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and is contraindicated in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and renal function should be monitored.\n\n【27】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Cisplatin with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【28】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Cisplatin with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【29】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Cisplatin in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【30】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Cisplatin in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【31】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Cisplatin in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【32】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Cisplatin in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【33】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【34】 ### Administration\n- Intravenous\n\n【35】 ### Monitoring\n- Peripheral blood counts should be monitored weekly. Liver function should be monitored periodically. Neurologic examination should also be performed regularly.\n\n【36】 # IV Compatibility\n- Preparation Precautions\n- Caution should be exercised in handling the aqueous solution. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be utilized. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. To minimize the risk of dermal exposure, always wear impervious gloves when handling vials and IV sets containing cisplatin.\n\n【37】 - Instructions for Preparation\n- The aqueous solution should be used intravenously only and should be administered by IV infusion over a 6- to 8-hour period.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\n- NOTE TO PHARMACIST: Exercise caution to prevent inadvertent cisplatin overdosage. Please call prescriber if dose is greater than 100 mg/m2 per cycle. Aluminum and flip-off seal of vial have been imprinted with the following statement:\n\n【38】 # Overdosage\n\n【39】 ## Acute Overdose\n\n【40】 ### Signs and Symptoms\n- Caution should be exercised to prevent inadvertent overdosage with cisplatin. Acute overdosage with this drug may result in kidney failure, liver failure, deafness, ocular toxicity (including detachment of the retina), significant myelosuppression, intractable nausea and vomiting and/or neuritis. In addition, death can occur following overdosage.\n\n【41】 ### Management\n- No proven antidotes have been established for cisplatin overdosage. Hemodialysis, even when initiated four hours after the overdosage, appears to have little effect on removing platinum from the body because of cisplatin's rapid and high degree of protein binding. Management of overdosage should include general supportive measures to sustain the patient through any period of toxicity that may occur.\n\n【42】 ## Chronic Overdose\nThere is limited information regarding Chronic Overdose of Cisplatin in the drug label.\n\n【43】 # Pharmacology\n\n【44】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Cisplatin possibly acts through cross-linking and by interference with the function of DNA. It is an alkylating agent and it is cell cycle phase- nonspecific.\n\n【45】 ## Structure\n- Cisplatin Injection infusion concentrate is a clear, colorless, sterile aqueous solution available in amber vials. Each 50 mL or 100 mL amber vial of infusion concentrate contains: 1 mg/mL cisplatin, 9 mg/mL sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide to approximate pH of 4.0, and water for injection to a final volume of 50 mL or 100 mL, respectively.\n- Cisplatin Injection infusion concentrate must be further diluted prior to administration.\n- The active ingredient, cisplatin, is a yellow to orange crystalline powder with the molecular formula PtCl2H6N2, and a molecular weight of 300.1. Cisplatin is a heavy metal complex containing a central atom of platinum surrounded by two chloride atoms and two ammonia molecules in the cis position. It is soluble in water or saline at 1 mg/mL and in dimethylformamide at 24 mg/mL. It has a melting point of 207° C.\n\n【46】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Cisplatin in the drug label.\n\n【47】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Plasma concentrations of the parent compound, cisplatin, decay monoexponentially with a half-life of about 20 to 30 minutes following bolus administrations of 50 or 100 mg/m2 doses. Monoexponential decay and plasma half-lives of about 0.5 hour are  After the latter, the total-body clearances and volumes of distribution at steady-state for cisplatin are about 15 to 16 L/h/m2 and 11 to 12 L/m2.\n- Due to its unique chemical structure, the chlorine atoms of cisplatin are more subject to chemical displacement reactions by nucleophiles, such as water or sulfhydryl groups, than to enzyme-catalyzed metabolism. At physiological pH in the presence of 0.1M NaCl, the predominant molecular species are cisplatin and monohydroxymonochloro cis-diammine platinum (II) in nearly equal concentrations. The latter, combined with the possible direct displacement of the chlorine atoms by sulfhydryl groups of amino acids or proteins, accounts for the instability of cisplatin in biological matrices. The ratios of cisplatin to total free (ultrafilterable) platinum in the plasma vary considerably between patients and range from 0.5 to 1.1 after a dose of 100 mg/m2.\n- Cisplatin does not undergo the instantaneous and reversible binding to plasma proteins that is characteristic of normal drug-protein binding. However, the platinum from cisplatin, but not cisplatin itself, becomes bound to several plasma proteins, including albumin, transferrin, and gamma globulin. Three hours after a bolus injection and two hours after the end of a three-hour infusion, 90% of the plasma platinum is protein bound. The complexes between albumin and the platinum from cisplatin do not dissociate to a significant extent and are slowly eliminated with a minimum half-life of five days or more.\n- Following cisplatin doses of 20 to 120 mg/m2, the concentrations of platinum are highest in liver, prostate, and kidney; somewhat lower in bladder, muscle, testicle, pancreas, and spleen; and lowest in bowel, adrenal, heart, lung, cerebrum, and cerebellum. Platinum is present in tissues for as long as 180 days after the last administration. With the exception of intracerebral tumors, platinum concentrations in tumors are generally somewhat lower than the concentrations in the organ where the tumor is located. Different metastatic sites in the same patient may have different platinum concentrations. Hepatic metastases have the highest platinum concentrations, but these are similar to the platinum concentrations in normal liver. Maximum red blood cell concentrations of platinum are reached within 90 to 150 minutes after a 100 mg/m2 dose of cisplatin and decline in a biphasic manner with a terminal half-life of 36 to 47 days.\n- Over a dose range of 40 to 140 mg cisplatin/m2 given as a bolus injection or as infusions varying in length from 1 hour to 24 hours, from 10% to about 40% of the administered platinum is excreted in the urine in 24 hours. Over five days following administration of 40 to 100 mg/m2 doses given as rapid, 2- to 3-hour, or 6- to 8-hour infusions, a mean of 35% to 51% of the dosed platinum is excreted in the urine. Similar mean urinary recoveries of platinum of about 14% to 30% of the dose are found following five daily administrations of 20, 30, or 40 mg/m2/day. Only a small percentage of the administered platinum is excreted beyond 24 hours post-infusion and most of the platinum excreted in the urine in 24 hours is excreted within the first few hours. Platinum-containing species excreted in the urine are the same as those found following the incubation of cisplatin with urine from healthy subjects, except that the proportions are different.\n- The parent compound, cisplatin, is excreted in the urine and accounts for 13% to 17% of the dose excreted within one hour after administration of 50 mg/m2. The mean renal clearance of cisplatin exceeds creatinine clearance and is 62 and 50 mL/min/m2 following administration of 100 mg/m2 as 2-hour or 6- to 7-hour infusions, respectively.\n- The renal clearance of free (ultrafilterable) platinum also exceeds the glomerular filtration rate indicating that cisplatin or other platinum-containing molecules are actively secreted by the kidneys. The renal clearance of free platinum is nonlinear and variable and is dependent on dose, urine flow rate, and individual variability in the extent of active secretion and possible tubular reabsorption.\n- There is a potential for accumulation of ultrafilterable platinum plasma concentrations whenever cisplatin is administered on a daily basis but not when dosed on an intermittent basis.\n- No significant relationships exist between the renal clearance of either free platinum or cisplatin and creatinine clearance.\n- Although small amounts of platinum are present in the bile and large intestine after administration of cisplatin, the fecal excretion of platinum appears to be insignificant.\n\n【48】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Cisplatin in the drug label.\n\n【49】 # Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Cisplatin in the drug label.\n\n【50】 # How Supplied\n- Cisplatin Injection is available as follows:\n- NDC 44567-509-01 Each multidose vial contains 50 mg of cisplatin\n\n【51】 ## Storage\nThere is limited information regarding Cisplatin Storage in the drug label.\n\n【52】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n【53】 # Patient Counseling Information\nThere is limited information regarding Patient Counseling Information of Cisplatin in the drug label.\n\n【54】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Cisplatin interaction has not been established.

Common adverse reactions include hypotension, hyperuricemia, hypochloremia, hypokalemia, nausea, and azotemia.\n\n【4】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【5】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Bumetanide tablets are indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. Almost equal diuretic.\n- Bumetanide tablets are indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. Almost equal diuretic response occurs after oral and parenteral administration of bumetanide. Therefore, if impaired gastrointestinal absorption is suspected or oral administration is not practical, bumetanide should be given by the intramuscular or intravenous route.\n- Successful treatment with bumetanide following instances of allergic reactions to furosemide suggests a lack of cross-sensitivity.\n- Dosage should be individualized with careful monitoring of patient response. Oral Administration - The usual total daily dosage of bumetanide is 0.5 to 2 mg.\n- Dosage should be individualized with careful monitoring of patient response.\n- The usual total daily dosage of bumetanide is 0.5 to 2 mg and in most patients is given as a single dose.\n- If the diuretic response to an initial dose of bumetanide is not adequate, in view of its rapid onset and short duration of action, a second or third dose may be given at 4- to 5-hour intervals up to a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. An intermittent dose schedule, whereby bumetanide is given on alternate days or for 3 to 4 days with rest periods of 1 to 2 days in between, is recommended as the safest and most effective method for the continued control of edema. In patients with hepatic failure, the dosage should be kept to a minimum, and if necessary, dosage increased very carefully. Because cross-sensitivity with furosemide has rarely been observed, bumetanide can be substituted at approximately a 1:40 ratio of bumetanide to furosemide in patients allergic to furosemide.\n- Bumetanide Injection may be administered parenterally (IV or IM) to patients in whom gastrointestinal absorption may be impaired or in whom oral administration is not practical.\n- Parenteral treatment should be terminated and oral treatment instituted as soon as possible.\n\n【6】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Bumetanide (oral) in adult patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Bumetanide (oral) in adult patients.\n\n【9】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【10】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding FDA-Labeled Use of Bumetanide (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【11】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【12】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Bumetanide (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Bumetanide (oral) in pediatric patients.\n\n【14】 # Contraindications\n- Bumetanide is contraindicated in anuria. Although bumetanide can be used to induce diuresis in renal insufficiency, any marked increase in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, or the development of oliguria during therapy of patients with progressive renal disease, is an indication for discontinuation of treatment with bumetanide. Bumetanide is also contraindicated in patients in hepatic coma or in states of severe electrolyte depletion until the condition is improved or corrected.\n- Bumetanide is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to this drug.\n\n【15】 # Warnings\n- Volume and Electrolyte Depletion - The dose of bumetanide should be adjusted to the patient’s need. Excessive doses or too frequent administration can lead to\nVolume and Electrolyte Depletion\n- The dose of bumetanide should be adjusted to the patient’s need. Excessive doses or too frequent administration can lead to profound water loss, electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction in blood volume and circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.\n- Hypokalemia can occur as a consequence of bumetanide administration. Prevention of hypokalemia requires particular attention in the following conditions: patients receiving digitalis and diuretics for congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, states of aldosterone excess with normal renal function, potassium-losing nephropathy, certain diarrheal states, or other states where hypokalemia is thought to represent particular added risks to the patient, i.e., history of ventricular arrhythmias.\n- In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, sudden alterations of electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma.\n- Treatment in such patients is best initiated in the hospital with small doses and careful monitoring of the patient’s clinical status and electrolyte balance.\n- Supplemental potassium and/or spironolactone may prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in these patients.\n- In cats, dogs and guinea pigs, bumetanide has been shown to produce ototoxicity. In these test animals bumetanide was 5 to 6 times more potent than furosemide and, since the diuretic potency of bumetanide is about 40 to 60 times furosemide, it is anticipated that blood levels necessary to produce ototoxicity will rarely be achieved. The potential exists, however, and must be considered a risk of intravenous therapy, especially at high doses, repeated frequently in the face of renal excretory function impairment. Potentiation of aminoglycoside ototoxicity has not been tested for bumetanide. Like other members of this class of diuretics, bumetanide probably shares this risk.\n- Patients allergic to sulfonamides may show hypersensitivity to bumetanide.\n- Since there have been rare spontaneous reports of thrombocytopenia from postmarketing experience, patients should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of thrombocytopenia.\n\n【16】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【17】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- The most frequent clinical adverse reactions considered probably or possibly related to bumetanide are muscle cramp. dizziness (1.1%), hypotension.\n- The most frequent clinical adverse reactions considered probably or possibly related to bumetanide are muscle cramp. dizziness (1.1%), hypotension (0.8%), headache (0.6%), nausea (0.6%), and encephalopathy (in patients with preexisting liver disease) (0.6%). One or more of these adverse reactions have been reported in approximately 4.1% of bumetanide-treated patients.\n- Serious skin reactions (i.e., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported in association with bumetanide use.\n- Less frequent clinical adverse reactions to bumetanide are impaired hearing (0.5%), pruritus (0.4%), electrocardiogram changes (0.4%), weakness (0.2%), hives (0.2%), abdominal pain (0.2%), arthritic pain (0.2%), musculoskeletal pain (0.2%), rash (0.2%), and vomiting (0.2%). One or more of these adverse reactions have been reported in approximately 2.9% of patients treated with bumetanide.\n- Other clinical adverse reactions, which have each occurred in approximately 0.1% of patients, are vertigo, chest pain, ear discomfort, fatigue, dehydration, sweating, hyperventilation, dry mouth, upset stomach, renal failure, asterixis, itching, nipple tenderness, diarrhea, premature ejaculation and difficulty maintaining an erection.\n- Laboratory abnormalities reported have included hyperuricemia (in 18.4% of patients tested), hypochloremia (14.9%), hypokalemia (14.7%), azotemia (10.6%), hyponatremia (9.2%), increased serum creatinine (7.4%), hyperglycemia (6.6%), and variations in phosphorus (4.5%), C02 content (4.3%), bicarbonate (3.1%) and calcium (2.4%). Although manifestations of the pharmacologic action of bumetanide, these conditions may become more pronounced by intensive therapy.\n- Also reported have been thrombocytopenia (0.2%) and deviations in hemoglobin (0.8%), prothrombin time (0.8%), hematocrit (0.6%), WBC (0.3%) and differential counts (0.1%). There have been rare spontaneous reports of thrombocytopenia from postmarketing experience.\n- Diuresis induced by bumetanide may also rarely be accompanied by changes in LDH (1.0%), total serum bilirubin (0.8%), serum proteins (0.7%), SGOT (0.6%), SGPT (0.5%), alkaline phosphatase (0.4%), cholesterol (0.4%) and creatinine clearance (0.3%). Increases in urinary glucose (0.7%) and urinary protein (0.3%) have also been seen.\n\n【18】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Postmarketing Experience of Bumetanide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【19】 # Drug Interactions\n- Especially in the presence of impaired renal function, the use of parenterally administered bumetanide in patients to whom aminoglycoside antibiotics are also being given should be avoided, except in life-threatening conditions.\n- There has been no experience with the concurrent use of bumetanide with drugs known to have a nephrotoxic potential. Therefore, the simultaneous administration of these drugs should be avoided.\n- Lithium should generally not be given with diuretics (such as bumetanide) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.\n- Pretreatment with probenecid reduces both the natriuresis and hyperreninemia produced by bumetanide. This antagonistic effect of probenecid on bumetanide natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of bumetanide. Thus, probenecid should not be administered concurrently with bumetanide.\n- Indomethacin blunts the increases in urine volume and sodium excretion seen during bumetanide treatment and inhibits the bumetanide-induced increase in plasma renin activity. Concurrent therapy with bumetanide is thus not recommended.\n- Bumetanide may potentiate the effect of various antihypertensive drugs, necessitating a reduction in the dosage of these drugs.\n- Interaction studies in humans have shown no effect on digoxin blood levels.\n- Interaction studies in humans have shown bumetanide to have no effect on warfarin metabolism or on plasma prothrombin activity.\n\n【20】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【21】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- Bumetanide is neither teratogenic nor embryocidal in mice when given in doses up to 3400 times the maximum human therapeutic dose. Bumetanide has been shown to be nonteratogenic, but it has a slight embryocidal effect in rats when given in doses of 3400 times the maximum human therapeutic dose and in rabbits at doses of 3.4 times the maximum human therapeutic dose. In one study, moderate growth retardation and increased incidence of delayed ossification of sternebrae were observed in rats at oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day, 3400 times the maximum human therapeutic dose. These effects were associated with maternal weight reductions noted during dosing. No such adverse effects were observed at 30 mg/kg/day (1000 times the maximum human therapeutic dose). No fetotoxicity was observed at 1000 to 2000 times the human therapeutic dose.\n- In rabbits, a dose-related decrease in litter size and an increase in resorption rate were noted at oral doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg/day (3.4 and 10 times the maximum human therapeutic dose). A slightly increased incidence of delayed ossification of sternebrae occurred at 0.3 mg/kg/day; however, no such adverse effects were observed at the dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day. The sensitivity of the rabbit to bumetanide parallels the marked pharmacologic and toxicologic effects of the drug in this species.\n- Bumetanide was not teratogenic in the hamster at an oral dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day (17 times the maximum human therapeutic dose). Bumetanide was not teratogenic when given intravenously to mice and rats at doses up to 140 times the maximum human therapeutic dose.\n- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. A small investigational experience in the United States and marketing experience in other countries to date have not indicated any evidence of adverse effects on the fetus, but these data do not rule out the possibility of harmful effects. Bumetanide should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Bumetanide (oral) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【22】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Bumetanide (oral) during labor and delivery.\n\n【23】 ### Nursing Mothers\nIt is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while the patient is on bumetanide since it may be excreted in human milk.\n\n【24】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established.\n- In vitro studies using pooled sera from critically ill neonates have shown bumetanide to be a potent displacer of bilirubin. The administration of bumetanide could present a particular concern if given to critically ill or jaundiced neonates at risk for kernicterus.\n\n【25】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Clinical studies of bumetanide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects.\n- Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n- This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n\n【26】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Bumetanide (oral) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【27】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Bumetanide (oral) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【28】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Bumetanide (oral) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【29】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Bumetanide (oral) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【30】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Bumetanide (oral) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【31】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Bumetanide (oral) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【32】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【33】 ### Administration\n- Oral\n\n【34】 ### Monitoring\n- Treatment in such patients is best initiated in the hospital with small doses and careful monitoring of the patient’s clinical status and electrolyte balance.\n- Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n- Treatment consists of replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses by careful monitoring of the urine and electrolyte output and serum electrolyte levels.\n- Dosage should be individualized with careful monitoring of patient response.\n\n【35】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Bumetanide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【36】 # Overdosage\n- Overdosage can lead to acute profound water loss, volume and electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction of blood volume and circulatory collapse with a possibility of vascular.\n- Treatment consists of replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses by careful monitoring of the urine and electrolyte output and serum electrolyte levels.\n\n【37】 # Pharmacology\n\n【38】 ## Mechanism of Action\nThere is limited information regarding Bumetanide (oral) Mechanism of Action in the drug label.\n\n【39】 ## Structure\n- Bumetanide is a loop diuretic, available as scored tablets, 0.5 mg (light green), 1 mg (yellow) and 2 mg (peach) for oral administration; each tablet also contains: anhydrous lactose.\n- Bumetanide is a loop diuretic, available as scored tablets, 0.5 mg (light green), 1 mg (yellow) and 2 mg (peach) for oral administration; each tablet also contains: anhydrous lactose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch and talc, with the following colorants: 0.5 mg (D&C Yellow No. 10 Aluminum Lake and FD&C Blue No. 1 Aluminum Lake); 1 mg (D&C Yellow No. 10 Aluminum Lake); 2 mg (Ferric oxide red).\n- Chemically, bumetanide is 3-(butylamino)-4-phenoxy-5-sulfamoyl-benzoic acid. It is a practically white powder. It is slightly soluble in water and soluble in alkaline solutions. It has the following structural formula:\n\n【40】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Bumetanide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【41】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Bumetanide is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg bumetanide has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg furosemide. The major site of bumetanide action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. Bumetanide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as shown by marked reduction of free-water clearance (CH2O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (TCH2O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by bumetanide, and bumetanide is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic.\n- Potassium excretion is also increased by bumetanide, in a dose-related fashion.\n- Bumetanide may have an additional action in the proximal tubule. Since phosphate reabsorption takes place largely in the proximal tubule, phosphaturia during bumetanide-induced diuresis is indicative of this additional action. This is further supported by the reduction in the renal clearance of bumetanide by probenecid, associated with diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumetanide does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.\n- Bumetanide decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Following oral administration of bumetanide the onset of diuresis occurs in 30 to 60 minutes. Peak activity is reached between 1 and 2 hours. At usual doses (1 to 2 mg) diuresis is largely complete within 4 hours; with higher doses, the diuretic action lasts for 4 to 6 hours. Diuresis starts within minutes following an intravenous injection and reaches maximum levels within 15 to 30 minutes.\n- Several pharmacokinetic studies have shown that bumetanide, administered orally or parenterally, is eliminated rapidly in humans, with a half-life of between 1 and 1 1/2 hours. Plasma protein-binding is in the range of 94% to 96%.\n- Oral administration of carbon-14 labeled bumetanide to human volunteers revealed that 81% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine, 45% of it as unchanged drug. Urinary and biliary metabolites identified in this study were formed by oxidation of the N-butyl side chain. Biliary excretion of bumetanide amounted to only 2% of the administered dose.\n- Elimination of bumetanide appears to be considerably slower in neonatal patients compared with adults, possibly because of immature renal and hepatobiliary function in this population. Small pharmacokinetic studies of intravenous bumetanide in preterm and full term neonates with respiratory disorders have reported an apparent half-life of approximately 6 hours with a range up to 15 hours and a serum clearance ranging from 0.2 to 1.1 mL/min/kg. In a population of neonates receiving bumetanide for volume overload, mean serum clearance rates were 2.17 mL/min/kg in patients less than 2 months of age and 3.8 mL/min/kg in patients aged 2 to 6 months. Mean serum half-life of bumetanide was 2.5 hours and 1.5 hours in patients aged less than 2 months and those aged 2 to 6 months, respectively. Elimination half-life decreased considerably during the first month of life, from a mean of approximately 6 hours at birth to approximately 2.4 hours at 1 month of age.\n- In preterm neonates, mean serum concentrations following a single 0.05 mg/kg dose ranged from 126 mcg/L at 1 hour to 57 mcg/L at 8 hours. In another study, mean serum concentrations following a single 0.05 mg/kg dose were 338 ng/mL at 30 minutes and 176 ng/mL after 4 hours.\n- A single dose of 0.1 mg/kg produced mean serum levels of 314 ng/mL at 1 hour, and 195 ng/mL at 6 hours. Mean volume of distribution in neonates and infants has been reported to range from 0.26 L/kg to 0.39 L/kg.\n- The degree of protein binding of bumetanide in cord sera from healthy neonates was approximately 97%, suggesting the potential for bilirubin displacement. A study using pooled sera from critically ill neonates found that bumetanide at concentrations of 0.5 to 50 mcg/mL, but not 0.25 mcg/mL, caused a linear increase in unbound bilirubin concentrations.\n- In 56 infants aged 4 days to 6 months, bumetanide doses ranging from 0.005 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg were studied for pharmacodynamic effect. Peak bumetanide excretion rates increased linearly with increasing doses of drug. Maximal diuretic effect was observed at a bumetanide excretion rate of about 7 mcg/kg/hr, corresponding to doses of 0.035 to 0.040 mg/kg. Higher doses produced a higher bumetanide excretion rate but no increase in diuretic effect. Urine flow rate peaked during the first hour after drug administration in 80% of patients and by 3 hours in all patients.\n- In a group of ten geriatric subjects between the ages of 65 and 73 years, total bumetanide clearance was significantly lower (1.8 ± 0.3 mL/minkg) compared with younger subjects (2.9 ± 0.2 mL/minkg) after a single oral bumetanide 0.5 mg dose. Maximum plasma concentrations were higher in geriatric subjects (16.9 ± 1.8 ng/mL) compared with younger sub­jects (10.3 ± 1.5 ng/mL). Urine flow rate and total excretion of sodium and potassium were increased less in the geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects, although potassium excretion and fractional sodium excretion were similar between the two age groups. Nonrenal clearance, bioavailability, and volume of distribution were not significantly different between the two groups.\n\n【42】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nonclinical Toxicology of Bumetanide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【43】 # Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Bumetanide (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【44】 # How Supplied\n- Bumetanide Tablets USP are available as light green, flat, round, bevel-edged tablets, debossed “0.5” on one side and bisected on the other side with company logo on the upper half and “4232” on the lower, containing 0.5 mg bumetanide, USP packaged in bottles of 100 tablets.

{"seq_id": "7ee65cce-aeb4-4b7a-a973-038d0956f242", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Morton's neuroma overview\n\n【1】 # Overview\nMorton's neuroma is a benign neuroma of the interdigital plantar nerve. Although it is labeled a \"neuroma\", many sources do not consider it a true tumor, but rather a thickening of existing tissue or a swollen, inflamed nerve located between the bones at the ball of the foot. The most common location of a Morton's neuroma is in either the second or the third spacing from the base of the big toe. It is characterised by numbness & pain, and relieved by removing footwear.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\nThe term neuroma originates from two Greek words, neuro- from the Greek word for nerve (νεῦρον), and -oma (-ωμα) from the Greek word for swelling. In 1876, neuroma was first described by Thomas Morton and Morton's neuroma was first correctly described by a chiropodist named Durlacher. In 2000, a small studyreviewed the medical records of 85 people who had their feet imaged with MRI, and it was found out that 33% of the patients had morton's neuroma without any pain.\n\n【3】 # Pathophysiology\nMorton's neuroma is associated with symptomatic collapse of the transverse arch by perineural fibrosis around a plantar digital nerve of the foot due to chronictraction and increased pressure/compression on the interdigital nerve. It is located at the third intermetatarsal space most commonly (between third and fourth metatarsals), and sometimes second or fourth interspaces or bifurcation of the fourth plantar digital nerve. Gross pathological features of morton's neuroma include adherent fibrofatty tissue, small, firm, oval, yellowish-white, slowly growing, palpable nodule on skin (no discoloration of skin on the top of nodule) and </=2cm in size. Histopathological analysis is characterized by extensive fibrosis around and within the nerve, digital artery, thrombosis, epineural and endoneural arterialthickening/vascular hyalinization, and degenerated/demyelinated axons. Possible tissue pathologies associated with interdigital pain of morton's neuroma include perineural fibrosis, endoneural edema, neurofibromata, angioneurofibromata, local demyelination, and local vascular degeneration.\n\n【4】 # Causes\nThe exact cause is unknown. However, morton's neuroma is believed to be associated with wearing tight shoes with tapered toe box or high heels, overpronation, abnormal positioning of toes, flat feet, forefoot problems such as bunions and hammer toes, and high foot arches.\n\n【5】 # Differentiating Morton's Neuroma from other diseases\nMorton's neuroma must be differentiated from other causes of pain in the forefoot such as metatarsophalangeal joint capsulitis, intermetatarsal bursitis, calluses, stress fractures, Freiberg's disease, osteomyelitis, localized vasculitis, ischemia of plantar digital artery, tarsal tunnel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, peripheral neuritis, synovitis, tendonitis, and avascular necrosis.\n\n【6】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\nMorton's neuroma is more common in women than men.\n\n【7】 # Risk Factors\nRisk factors for morton's neuroma include improper footwear/tight shoes with tapered toe box, abnormal positioning of toes, flat feet, forefoot problems such as bunions and hammer toes, high foot arches, high heels, overpronation, gait abnormalities, and high-impact sports such as rock-climbing, ballet dancing, jogging, running, snow skiing, racquet and court sports.\n\n【8】 # Natural History, Complications and Prognosis\nSymptoms of morton's neuroma begin gradually and initially occur only occasionally while wearing the narrow-toed shoes and performing certain aggravating activities. Symptoms may go away temporarily by removing the shoe, massaging the foot and avoiding the aggravating shoes/activities. Symptoms become even more intense & start to worsen progressively with time and may persist for several days or weeks. Ultimately, the temporary changes in the nerve become permanent if left untreated for prolonged periods of time. Common complications of morton's neuroma include difficult walking, trouble performing activities that putpressure on the foot (pressing the gas pedal of an automobile), and feet hurt with wearing certain types of shoes especially high-heels. Postoperative complicationsinclude permanent non-painful numbness, small risk of infection around toes after surgery, incisional soreness, scarring, & recurring stump neuromas. Non-surgicaltreatment is successful in 80% of the cases but does not always improve symptoms and surgery to remove the thickened tissue is successful in about 85% of cases.\n\n【9】 # History and Symptoms\nMorton's neuroma is most commonly located at the third intermetatarsal space, with other sites being involved including second or fourth interspaces, at the bifurcation of the fourth plantar digital nerve and fifth interspace rarely. Patient complaints of feeling like ''walking on a marble''. Most common symptom of morton's neuroma includes persistent pain on weight bearing affecting the contiguous halves of two toes, with the nature of pain being shooting, burning, stabbing, raw, gnawing or sickening sensations. Other symptoms may include numbness, parasthesia, dysesthesia, functional impairment and psychological distress associatedwith severe decrease in the quality of life.\n\n【10】 # Physical Examination\nPatients may have antalgic posture. Physical examination may be remarkable for tenderness to palpation, limitation of range of motion, dysesthetic pain and Mulder's sign which includes replication of symptoms or clicking sensations upon direct pressure between the metatarsal heads or compression of transverse arch in forefoot between the finger and thumb. Negative signs include no obvious deformities, erythema or signs of inflammation.\n\n【11】 # Laboratory Findings\nBlood tests are done to check for inflammation-related conditions, including certain forms of arthritis.\n\n【12】 # X-Ray\nA foot x-ray may be done to rule out bone pathologies such as arthritis or any stress fractures.\n\n【13】 # MRI\nMRI can successfully diagnose and assess the location, size, and soft tissue abnormalities associated with Morton's neuroma. As there's a 26% chance of morton's neuroma recurrence after surgery, hence, post-operative MR imaging can help rule out any recurrence. Morton's neuroma-like abnormalities are seen in asymptomatic and symptomatic intermetatarsal spaces on MRI after the resection of morton's neuroma. There's a significant difference in the appearance of morton's neuroma on MRI done in different positions such as prone, supine, or weight-bearing, with the morton's neuroma being best visible in the prone position.\n\n【14】 # Other Imaging Findings\nImaging findings on high-resolution ultrasound may help to find out or differentiate any soft tissue abnormalities from morton's neuroma. In 2000, a study was conducted in which ultrasound done on patients with morton's neuroma demonstrated to have 100% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity and 96.7% accuracy in detectingthe location of morton's neuroma. Symptomatic morton's neuroma is at least 5 mm in diameter on sonogram. A presumed plantar digital nerve identified in continuity with the mass on ultrasound leads to an improved diagnostic confidence of morton's neuroma.\n\n【15】 # Other Diagnostic Tests\nNerve testing such as electromyography cannot definitely diagnose Morton's neuroma, but may be used to rule out conditions that cause similar symptoms.\n\n【16】 # Medical Therapy\nNon-surgical treatment is instituted first for the treatment of morton's neuroma. Firstly, the conservative measures are used for the pain relief such as decreasing the pressure on metatarsal heads by using metatarsal support, bars, padded shoe insert just proximal to the metatarsal head, tapping the toe area, orthotics, specialized orthopedic shoes, shoes with wider toe boxes allowing spread of metatarsal heads, low heels, good arch support & stiff soles, determining proper shoewidth, physical therapy, massaging ball of the foot, strength exercises for intrinsic foot muscles, stretching exercises for foot tendons & ligaments, resting the foot, applying ice packs to the sore foot areas and weight loss in overweight patients. When conservative measures fail, medical therapy is used which includes tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, prolotherapy via Hackett-Hemwall technique which includes ultrasound-guidedinterdigital injection of nerve blocking agents such as steroids, local anaesthetics, dextrose, anti-inflammatory drugs or 4% alcohol sclerosing injections via dorsalapproach into the site of tenderness, oral or injectable anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers.\n\n【17】 # Surgery\nSurgery is the last resort in the treatment of morton's neuroma. In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove the thickened tissue/affected nerve in order to help release the pressure on the affected nerve, relieve the pain and improve foot function. Few complications after surgery are possible and include permanent nonpainful numbness if a portion of the affected nerve is removed, risk of postoperative infection around the toes, incisional soreness, scarring, and recurring stump neuromas. Morton's neuroma can be removed surgically either via dorsal or plantar approach, with each approach having its own merits and demerits. Dependingupon each individual case, different surgical procedures that can be used for the treatment of morton's neuroma include neurectomy, cryogenicsurgery/neuroablation, and decompression surgery.\n\n【18】 # Primary prevention\nPrimary preventive measures for morton's neuroma include avoiding ill-fitting shoes, high heels, narrow-toed shoes, overpronation, high-impact sports such as rock-climbing, ballet dancing, jogging, running, snow skiing, wearing comfortable shoes with wide toe box, low heels & good arch support and wearing athletic shoes (with enough padding in the soles) while running or playing sports.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Males are usually more severely affected than females, but the condition can range from very mild to severe in affected women. This condition is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. Males usually carry this disease more often than females because males only have one X chromosome, while females have two.\nMutations in the RPS6KA3 gene cause Coffin-Lowry syndrome. The RPS6KA3 gene makes a protein that is involved with signaling within cells. Researchers believe that the protein helps control the activity of other genes and may play an important role in the central nervous system. Mutations in the RPS6KA3 disturb the function of the protein, but it is not well understood how mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Some people with the features of Coffin-Lowry syndrome do not have identified mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene. In these cases, the cause is unknown.\nThis condition is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome (one of the two sex chromosomes). The inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the condition. In most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. A striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.\nA majority of boys with Coffin-Lowry syndrome have no history of the condition in their families. These cases are caused by new mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene. A new mutation means that neither parent has the altered gene, but the affected individual could pass it on to his children.\nThere is no cure and no standard course of treatment for Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and may include physical and speech therapy and educational services.\nThis article incorporates public domain text from The U.S. National Library of Medicine and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\n\n【3】 # Classification\n\n【4】 # Pathophysiology\n\n【5】 # Causes\n\n【6】 # Differentiating Coffin-Lowry syndrome from Other Diseases\n\n【7】 # Epidemiology and Demographics\n\n【8】 # Risk Factors\n\n【9】 # Screening\n\n【10】 # Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis\n\n【11】 # Diagnosis\n\n【12】 ## Diagnostic Criteria\n\n【13】 ## History and Symptoms\n\n【14】 ## Physical Examination\n\n【15】 ## Laboratory Findings\n\n【16】 ## Imaging Findings\n\n【17】 ## Other Diagnostic Studies\n\n【18】 # Treatment\n\n【19】 ## Medical Therapy\n\n【20】 ## Surgery\n\n【21】 ## Prevention", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Two fields associated with behavioral neurology are neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology.\n\n【2】 # Historical Perspective\nWhile descriptions of behavioral syndromes go back to the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, it was during the 19th century that behavioral neurology began to arise, first with the primitive localization theories of Franz Gall, followed in the mid 19th century by the first localizations in aphasias by Paul Broca and then Carl Wernicke.  Localizationist neurology and clinical descriptions reached a peak in the late 19th and early 20th century, with work extending into the clinical descriptions of dementias by Alois Alzheimer and Arnold Pick.  The work of Karl Lashley in rats for a time in the early to mid 20th century put a damper on localization theory and lesion models of behavioral function.  In the United States, the work of Norman Geschwind led to a renaissance of behavioral neurology.  Geschwind is famous for his work on disconnection syndromes and his legacy lives on through the generations of behavioral neurologists trained by Dr. Geschwind and his former fellows.  The advent of in vivo neuroimaging starting in the 1980s led to a further strengthing of interest in the cognitive neurosciences and provided a tool that allowed for lesion, structural, and functional correlations with behavioral dysfunction in living people.\n\n【3】 # Classification\nSyndromes and diseases commonly studied by behavioral neurology include but are not limited to:\n- Agraphia\n- Agnosias\n- Alexia\n- Anosognosia\n- Aphasias\n- Apraxias\n- Aprosodias\n- Dementias\n- Dyslexias\n- Epilepsy\n- Hemispatial Neglect\n- Stroke\n- Traumatic Brain Injury", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1,2 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of cefprozil powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:\nA report of “Susceptible” indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of “Intermediate” indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of “Resistant” indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.\nStandardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard cefprozil powder should provide the following MIC values:\nQuantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure3 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg cefprozil to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to cefprozil.\nReports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30 mcg cefprozil disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:\nInterpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for cefprozil.\nAs with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures.

Common adverse reactions include injection site reaction, lymphopenia, flu-like symptoms, myalgia, leukopenia, neutropenia, increased liver enzymes, headache, hypertonia, pain, rash, insomnia, abdominal pain, and asthenia.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【5】 ### Multiple Sclerosis\nBETASERON (interferon beta-1b) is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis to reduce the frequency of clinical exacerbations. Patients with multiple sclerosis in whom efficacy has been demonstrated include patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with multiple sclerosis.\n- Dosing Information\n- The recommended starting dose is 0.0625 mg (0.25 mL) subcutaneously every other day, with dose increases over a six week period to the recommended dose of 0.25 mg (1 mL) every other day\n\n【6】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Interferon Beta-1B in adult patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Interferon Beta-1B in adult patients.\n\n【9】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【10】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nSafety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n【11】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【12】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Interferon Beta-1B in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Interferon Beta-1B in pediatric patients.\n\n【14】 # Contraindications\nBETASERON is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta, Albumin (Human), or any other component of the formulation.\n\n【15】 # Warnings\nHepatic Injury\nSevere hepatic injury including cases of hepatic failure, some of which have been due to autoimmune hepatitis, has been rarely reported in patients taking BETASERON. In some cases, these events have occurred in the presence of other drugs or comorbid medical conditions that have been associated with hepatic injury. Consider the potential risk of BETASERON used in combination with known hepatotoxic drugs or other products (eg., alcohol) prior to BETASERON administration, or when adding new agents to the regimen of patients already on BETASERON. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury. Consider discontinuing BETASERON if serum transaminase levels significantly increase, or if they are associated with clinical symptoms such as jaundice.\nAsymptomatic elevation of serum transaminases is common in patients treated with BETASERON. In controlled clinical trials, elevations of SGPT to greater than five times baseline value were reported in 12% of patients receiving BETASERON (compared to 4% on placebo), and increases of SGOT to greater than five times baseline value were reported in 4% of patients receiving BETASERON (compared to 1% on placebo), leading to dose-reduction or discontinuation of treatment in some patients. Monitor liver function tests.\nAnaphylaxis and Other Allergic-Reactions\nAnaphylaxis has been reported as a rare complication of BETASERON use. Other allergic reactions have included dyspnea, bronchospasm, tongue edema, skin rash and urticaria. Discontinue BETASERON if anaphylaxis occurs.\nDepression and Suicide\nDepression and suicide have been reported to occur with increased frequency in patients receiving interferon beta products, including BETASERON. Advise patients to report any symptom of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their healthcare provider. If a patient develops depression, discontinuation of BETASERON therapy should be considered.\nIn randomized controlled clinical trials, there were three suicides and eight suicide attempts among the 1532 patients on BETASERON compared to one suicide and four suicide attempts among 965 patients on placebo.\nCongestive Heart Failure\nMonitor patients with pre-existing congestive heart failure (CHF) for worsening of their cardiac condition during initiation of and continued treatment with BETASERON. While beta interferons do not have any known direct-acting cardiac toxicity, cases of CHF, cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy with CHF have been reported in patients without known predisposition to these events, and without other known etiologies being established. In some cases, these events have been temporally related to the administration of BETASERON. Recurrence upon rechallenge was observed in some patients. Consider discontinuation of BETASERON if worsening of CHF occurs with no other etiology.\nInjection Site Necrosis and Reactions\nInjection site necrosis (ISN) was reported in 4% of BETASERON-treated patients in controlled clinical trials (compared to 0% on placebo) . Typically, ISN occurs within the first four months of therapy, although postmarketing reports have been received of ISN occurring over one year after initiation of therapy. The necrotic lesions are typically 3 cm or less in diameter, but larger areas have been reported. Generally the necrosis has extended only to subcutaneous fat, but has extended to the fascia overlying muscle. In some lesions where biopsy results are available, vasculitis has been reported. For some lesions, debridement, and/or skin grafting have been required. In most cases healing was associated with scarring.\nWhether to discontinue therapy following a single site of necrosis is dependent on the extent of necrosis. For patients who continue therapy with BETASERON after injection site necrosis has occurred, avoid administration of BETASERON into the affected area until it is fully healed. If multiple lesions occur, discontinue therapy until healing occurs.\nPeriodically evaluate patient understanding and use of aseptic self-injection techniques and procedures, particularly if injection site necrosis has occurred.\nIn controlled clinical trials, injection site reactions occurred in 78% of patients receiving BETASERON with injection site necrosis in 4%. Injection site inflammation (42%), injection site pain (16%), injection site hypersensitivity (4%), injection site necrosis (4%), injection site mass (2%), injection site edema (2%) and nonspecific reactions were significantly associated with BETASERON treatment. The incidence of injection site reactions tended to decrease over time. Approximately 69% of patients experienced injection site reactions during the first three months of treatment, compared to approximately 40% at the end of the studies.\nLeukopenia\nIn controlled clinical trials, leukopenia was reported in 18% of patients receiving BETASERON (compared to 6% on placebo), leading to a reduction of the dose of BETASERON in some patients . Monitoring of complete blood and differential white blood cell counts is recommended. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts.\nFlu-like Symptom Complex\nIn controlled clinical trials, the rate of flu-like symptom complex for patients on BETASERON was 57% . The incidence decreased over time, with 10% of patients reporting flu-like symptom complex at the end of the studies. The median duration of flu-like symptom complex in Study 1 was 7.5 days . Analgesics and/or antipyretics on treatment days may help ameliorate flu-like symptoms associated with BETASERON use.\nSeizures\nSeizures have been temporally associated with the use of beta interferons in clinical trials and postmarketing safety surveillance. It is not known whether these events were related to a primary seizure disorder, the effects of multiple sclerosis alone, the use of beta interferons, other potential precipitants of seizures (eg., fever), or to some combination of these.\nMonitoring for Laboratory Abnormalities\nIn addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, complete blood and differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts and blood chemistries, including liver function tests, are recommended at regular intervals (one, three, and six months) following introduction of BETASERON therapy, and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms.\n\n【16】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【17】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nThe following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more details in other sections of labeling:\n- Hepatic Injury\n- anaphylaxis and Other Allergic-Reactions\n- depression and Suicide\n- Congestive Heart Failure\n- Injection Site Necrosis and Reactions\n- Leukopenia\n- flu-like Symptom Complex\n- Seizures\nClinical Trials Experience\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and over varying lengths of time, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of BETASERON cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of other drugs, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nAmong 1407 patients with MS treated with BETASERON 0.25 mg every other day (including 1261 patients treated for greater than one year), the most commonly reported adverse reactions (at least 5% more frequent on BETASERON than on placebo) were injection site reaction, lymphopenia, flu-like symptoms, myalgia, leukopenia, neutropenia, increased liver enzymes, headache, hypertonia, pain, rash, insomnia, abdominal pain, and asthenia. The most frequently reported adverse reactions resulting in clinical intervention (for example, discontinuation of BETASERON, adjustment in dosage, or the need for concomitant medication to treat an adverse reaction symptom) were depression, flu-like symptom complex, injection site reactions, leukopenia, increased liver enzymes, asthenia, hypertonia, and myasthenia.\nTable 2 enumerates adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities that occurred among patients treated with 0.25 mg of BETASERON every other day by subcutaneous injection in the pooled placebo-controlled trials (Study 1-4) at an incidence that was at least 2% more than that observed in the placebo-treated patients.\nIn addition to the Adverse Reactions listed in Table 2, the following adverse reactions occurred more frequently on BETASERON than on placebo, but with a difference smaller than 2%: alopecia, anxiety, arthralgia, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspepsia, dysmenorrhea, leg cramps, menorrhagia, myasthenia, nausea, nervousness, palpitations, peripheral vascular disorder, prostatic disorder, tachycardia, urinary frequency, vasodilatation, and weight increase.\nLaboratory Abnormalities\nIn the four clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4), leukopenia was reported in 18% and 6% of patients in BETASERON- and placebo-treated groups, respectively. No patients were withdrawn or dose reduced for neutropenia in Study 1. Three percent (3%) of patients in Studies 2 and 3 experienced leukopenia and were dose-reduced. Other abnormalities included increase of SGPT to greater than five times baseline value (12%), and increase of SGOT to greater than five times baseline value (4%). In Study 1, two patients were dose reduced for increased hepatic enzymes; one continued on treatment and one was ultimately withdrawn. In Studies 2 and 3, 1.5% of BETASERON patients were dose-reduced or interrupted treatment for increased hepatic enzymes. In Study 4, 1.7% of patients were withdrawn from treatment due to increased hepatic enzymes, two of them after a dose reduction. In Studies 1-4, nine (0.6%) patients were withdrawn from treatment with BETASERON for any laboratory abnormality, including four (0.3%) patients following dose reduction.\nImmunogenicity\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Serum samples were monitored for the development of antibodies to BETASERON during Study 1. In patients receiving 0.25 mg every other day 56/124 (45%) were found to have serum neutralizing activity at one or more of the time points tested. In Study 4, neutralizing activity was measured every 6 months and at end of study. At individual visits after start of therapy, activity was observed in 17% up to 25% of the BETASERON-treated patients. Such neutralizing activity was measured at least once in 75 (30%) out of 251 BETASERON patients who provided samples during treatment phase; of these, 17 (23%) converted to negative status later in the study. Based on all the available evidence, the relationship between antibody formation and clinical safety or efficacy is not known.\nThese data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to BETASERON using a biological neutralization assay that measures the ability of immune sera to inhibit the production of the interferon-inducible protein, MxA. Neutralization assays are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of neutralizing activity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to BETASERON with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.\nAnaphylactic reactions have been reported with the use of BETASERON.\n\n【18】 ## Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of BETASERON. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nBlood and lymphatic system disorders: Anemia, Thrombocytopenia\nEndocrine disorders: Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism, Thyroid dysfunction\nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: Triglyceride increased, Anorexia, Weight decrease, Weight increase\nPsychiatric disorders: Anxiety, Confusion, Emotional lability\nNervous system disorders: Convulsion, Dizziness, Psychotic symptoms\nCardiac disorders: Cardiomyopathy, Palpitations, Tachycardia\nVascular disorders: Vasodilatation\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Bronchospasm\nGastrointestinal disorders: Diarrhea, Nausea, Pancreatitis, Vomiting\nHepatobiliary disorders: Hepatitis, Gamma GT increased\nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Alopecia, Pruritus, Skin discoloration, Urticaria\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Arthralgia\nReproductive system and breast disorder: Menorrhagia\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Fatal capillary leak syndrome1\n1The administration of cytokines to patients with a pre-existing monoclonal gammopathy has been associated with the development of this syndrome.\n\n【19】 # Drug Interactions\nNo formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with BETASERON.\n\n【20】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【21】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\nPregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; however, spontaneous abortions while on treatment were reported in four patients participating in the BETASERON RRMS clinical trial. BETASERON should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nWhen BETASERON (doses ranging from 0.028 to 0.42 mg/kg/day) was administered to pregnant rhesus monkeys throughout the period of organogenesis (gestation days 20 to 70), a dose-related abortifacient effect was observed. The low-effect dose is approximately 3 times the recommended human dose of 0.25 mg on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. A no-effect dose for embryo-fetal developmental toxicity in rhesus monkeys was not established.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Interferon beta-1b in women who are pregnant.\n\n【22】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Interferon beta-1b during labor and delivery.\n\n【23】 ### Nursing Mothers\nIt is not known whether BETASERON is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from BETASERON, a decision should be made to either discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of drug to the mother.\n\n【24】 ### Pediatric Use\nSafety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n【25】 ### Geriatic Use\nClinical studies of BETASERON did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients.\n\n【26】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Interferon beta-1b with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【27】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Interferon beta-1b with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【28】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Interferon beta-1b in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【29】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Interferon beta-1b in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【30】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Interferon beta-1b in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【31】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Interferon beta-1b in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【32】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【33】 ### Administration\nThe recommended starting dose is 0.0625 mg (0.25 mL) subcutaneously every other day, with dose increases over a six week period to the recommended dose of 0.25 mg (1 mL) every other day .\nIf a dose of BETASERON is missed, then it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers or is able to take it. The patient should not take BETASERON on two consecutive days. The next injection should be taken about 48 hours (two days) after that dose. If the patient accidentally takes more than their prescribed dose, or takes it on two consecutive days, they should be instructed to call their healthcare provider immediately.\nReconstitution of the Lyophilized Powder\n(a) Prior to reconstitution, verify that the vial containing lyophilized BETASERON is not cracked or damaged. Do not use cracked or damaged vials.\n(b) To reconstitute lyophilized BETASERON for injection, attach the pre-filled syringe containing the diluent (Sodium Chloride, 0.54% Solution) to the BETASERON vial using the vial adapter.\n(c) Slowly inject 1.2 mL of diluent into the BETASERON vial.\n(d) Gently swirl the vial to dissolve the lyophilized powder completely; do not shake. Foaming may occur during reconstitution or if the vial is swirled or shaken too vigorously. If foaming occurs, allow the vial to sit undisturbed until the foam settles.\n(e) 1 mL of reconstituted BETASERON solution contains 0.25 mg of interferon beta-1b.\n(f) After reconstitution, if not used immediately, refrigerate the reconstituted BETASERON solution at 35°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C) and use within three hours. Do not freeze.\nImportant Administration Instructions\n(a) Perform the first BETASERON injection under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare professional. If patients or caregivers are to administer BETASERON, train them in the proper subcutaneous injection technique and assess their ability to inject subcutaneously to ensure the proper administration of BETASERON.\n(b) Visually inspect the reconstituted BETASERON solution before use; discard if it contains particulate matter or is discolored.\n(c) Keeping the syringe and vial adapter in place, turn the assembly over so that the vial is on top. Withdraw the appropriate dose of BETASERON solution. Remove the vial from the vial adapter before injecting BETASERON.\n(d) Use safe disposal procedures for needles and syringes.\n(e) Do not re-use needles or syringes.\n(f) Advise patients and caregivers to rotate sites for subcutaneous injections to minimize the likelihood of severe injection site reactions, including necrosis or localized infection.\nPremedication for Flu-like Symptoms\nConcurrent use of analgesics and/or antipyretics on treatment days may help ameliorate flu-like symptoms associated with BETASERON use.\nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nFor injection: 0.3 mg lyophilized powder in a single use vial for reconstitution.\n\n【34】 ### Monitoring\nMonitor for the following conditions:\n- Hepatic Injury: Monitor liver function tests and signs and symptoms of hepatic injury; consider discontinuing BETASERON if serious hepatic injury occurs.\n- anaphylaxis and Other Allergic Reactions: Discontinue if anaphylaxis occurs.\n- depression and Suicide: Advise patients to immediately report any symptom of depression and/or suicidal ideation; consider discontinuation of BETASERON if depression occurs.\n- Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Monitor patients with CHF for worsening of cardiac symptoms; consider discontinuation of BETASERON if worsening of CHF occurs.\n- Injection Site Necrosis and Reactions: Do not administer BETASERON into affected area until fully healed; if multiple lesions occur, discontinue BETASERON until healing of skin lesions.\n- Leukopenia: Monitor complete blood count.\n- flu-like Symptom Complex: Consider analgesics and/or antipyretics on injection days.\n\n【35】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Interferon beta-1b and IV administrations.\n\n【36】 # Overdosage\nThere is limited information regarding Interferon beta-1b overdosage.  If you suspect drug poisoning or overdose, please contact the National Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) immediately.\n\n【37】 # Pharmacology\n\n【38】 ## Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of BETASERON (interferon beta-1b) in patients with multiple sclerosis is unknown.\n\n【39】 ## Structure\nThere is limited information regarding Interferon beta-1b Structure in the drug label.\n\n【40】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nInterferons (IFNs) are a family of naturally occurring proteins, produced by eukaryotic cells in response to viral infection and other biologic agents. Three major types of interferons have been defined: type 1 (IFN-alpha, beta, epsilon, kappa and omega), type II (IFN–gamma) and type III (IFN-lambda). Interferon-beta is a member of the type I subset of interferons. The type I interferons have considerably overlapping but also distinct biologic activities. The bioactivities of all IFNs, including IFN-beta, are induced via their binding to specific receptors on the membranes of human cells. Differences in the bioactivities induced by the three major subtypes of IFNs likely reflect differences in the signal transduction pathways induced by signaling through their cognate receptors.\nInterferon beta-1b receptor binding induces the expression of proteins that are responsible for the pleiotropic bioactivities of interferon beta-1b. A number of these proteins (including neopterin, β2-microglobulin, MxA protein, and IL-10) have been measured in blood fractions from BETASERON-treated patients and BETASERON-treated healthy volunteers. Immunomodulatory effects of interferon beta-1b include the enhancement of suppressor T cell activity, reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, down-regulation of antigen presentation, and inhibition of lymphocyte trafficking into the central nervous system. It is not known if these effects play an important role in the observed clinical activity of BETASERON in multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\n【41】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nBecause serum concentrations of interferon beta-1b are low or not detectable following subcutaneous administration of 0.25 mg or less of BETASERON, pharmacokinetic information in patients with MS receiving the recommended dose of BETASERON is not available.\nFollowing single and multiple daily subcutaneous administrations of 0.5 mg BETASERON to healthy volunteers (N=12), serum interferon beta-1b concentrations were generally below 100 IU/mL. Peak serum interferon beta-1b concentrations occurred between one to eight hours, with a mean peak serum interferon concentration of 40 IU/mL. Bioavailability, based on a total dose of 0.5 mg BETASERON given as two subcutaneous injections at different sites, was approximately 50%.\nAfter intravenous administration of BETASERON (0.006 mg to 2 mg), similar pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained from healthy volunteers (N=12) and from patients with diseases other than MS (N=142). In patients receiving single intravenous doses up to 2 mg, increases in serum concentrations were dose proportional. Mean serum clearance values ranged from 9.4 mL/minkg-1 to 28.9 mL/minkg-1 and were independent of dose. Mean terminal elimination half-life values ranged from 8 minutes to 4.3 hours and mean steady-state volume of distribution values ranged from 0.25 L/kg to 2.88 L/kg. Three-times-a-week intravenous dosing for two weeks resulted in no accumulation of interferon beta-1b in sera of patients. Pharmacokinetic parameters after single and multiple intravenous doses of BETASERON were comparable.\nFollowing every other day subcutaneous administration of 0.25 mg BETASERON in healthy volunteers, biologic response marker levels (neopterin, β2- microglobulin, MxA protein, and the immunosuppressive cytokine, IL-10) increased significantly above baseline six-twelve hours after the first BETASERON dose. Biologic response marker levels peaked between 40 and 124 hours and remained elevated above baseline throughout the seven-day (168-hour) study. The relationship between serum interferon beta-1b levels or induced biologic response marker levels and the clinical effects of interferon beta-1b in multiple sclerosis is unknown.\nDrug Interaction Studies:\nNo formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with BETASERON.\n\n【42】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n\n【43】 ### Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\nBETASERON has not been tested for its carcinogenic potential in animals.\nMutagenesis\nBETASERON was not genotoxic in the in vitro Ames bacterial test or the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. BETASERON treatment of mouse BALBc- 3T3 cells did not result in increased transformation frequency in an in vitro model of tumor transformation.\nImpairment of Fertility\nAdministration of BETASERON (doses of up to 0.33 mg/kg/day) to normally cycling female rhesus monkeys had no apparent adverse effects on either menstrual cycle duration or associated hormonal profiles (progesterone and estradiol) when administered over three consecutive menstrual cycles. The highest dose tested is approximately 30 times the recommended human dose of 0.25 mg on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. The potential for other effects on fertility or reproductive performance was not evaluated.\n\n【44】 # Clinical Studies\nThe clinical effects of BETASERON were studied in four randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4).\nPatients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis\nThe effectiveness of BETASERON in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) was evaluated in a double blind, multiclinic, randomized, parallel, placebo controlled clinical study of two years duration (Study 1). The study enrolled MS patients, aged 18 to 50, who were ambulator. exhibited a relapsing-remitting clinical course, met Poser’s criteria for clinically definite and/or laboratory supported definite MS and had experienced at least two exacerbations over two years preceding the trial without exacerbation in the preceding month. The EDSS score is a method of quantifying disability in patients with MS and ranges from 0 (normal neurologic exam) to 10 (death due to MS). Patients who had received prior immunosuppressant therapy were excluded.\nAn exacerbation was defined as the appearance of a new clinical sign/symptom or the clinical worsening of a previous sign/symptom (one that had been stable for at least 30 days) that persisted for a minimum of 24 hours.\nPatients selected for study were randomized to treatment with either placebo (N=123), 0.05 mg of BETASERON (N=125), or 0.25 mg of BETASERON (N=124) self-administered subcutaneously every other day. Outcome based on the 372 randomized patients was evaluated after two years.\nPatients who required more than three 28-day courses of corticosteroids were removed from the study. Minor analgesics (acetaminophen, codeine), antidepressants, and oral baclofen were allowed ad libitum, but chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was not allowed.\nThe primary protocol-defined outcome measures were 1 frequency of exacerbations per patient and 2 proportion of exacerbation free patients. A number of secondary clinical and magnetic resonance imaging  measures were also employed. All patients underwent annual T2 MRI imaging and a subset of 52 patients at one site had MRIs performed every six weeks for assessment of new or expanding lesions.\nThe study results are shown in Table 3.\nOf the 372 RRMS patients randomized, 72 (19%) failed to complete two full years on their assigned treatments.\nOver the two-year period in Study 1, there were 25 MS-related hospitalizations in the 0.25 mg BETASERON-treated group compared to 48 hospitalizations in the placebo group. In comparison, non-MS hospitalizations were evenly distributed among the groups, with 16 in the 0.25 mg BETASERON group and 15 in the placebo group. The average number of days of MS-related steroid use was 41 days in the 0.25 mg BETASERON group and 55 days in the placebo group (p=0.004).\nMRI data were also analyzed for patients in this study. The median percent change in MRI area for the 0.25 mg group was -1.1%, which was significantly smaller than the 16.5% observed for the placebo group (p=0.0001).\nIn an evaluation of frequent MRI scans (every six weeks) on 52 patients at one site in Study 1, the percent of scans with new or expanding lesions was 29% in the placebo group and 6% in the 0.25 mg treatment group (p=0.006).\nThe exact relationship between MRI findings and clinical status of patients is unknown. Changes in lesion area often do not correlate with changes in disability progression. The prognostic significance of the MRI findings in this study has not been evaluated.\nPatients with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis\nStudies 2 and 3 were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials conducted to assess the effect of BETASERON in patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Study 2 was conducted in Europe and Study 3 was conducted in North America. Both studies enrolled patients with clinically definite or laboratory-supported MS in the secondary progressive phase, and who had evidence of disability progression (both Study 2 and 3) or two relapses (Study 2 only) within the previous two years. Baseline Kurtzke expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores ranged from 3.0 to 6.5. Patients in Study 2 were randomized to receive BETASERON 0.25 mg (N=360) or placebo (N=358). Patients in Study 3 were randomized to BETASERON 0.25 mg (N=317), BETASERON 0.16 mg/m2 of body surface area (N=314, mean assigned dose 0.3 mg), or placebo (N=308). Test agents were administered subcutaneously, every other day for three years.\nThe primary outcome measure was progression of disability, defined as a 1.0 point increase in the EDSS score, or a 0.5 point increase for patients with baseline EDSS ≥ 6.0. In Study 2, time to progression in EDSS was longer in the BETASERON treatment group (p=0.005), with estimated annualized rates of progression of 16% and 19% in the BETASERON and placebo groups, respectively. In Study 3, the rates of progression did not differ significantly between treatment groups, with estimated annualized rates of progression of 12%, 14%, and 12% in the BETASERON fixed dose, surface area-adjusted dose, and placebo groups, respectively.\nMultiple analyses, including covariate and subset analyses based on sex, age, disease duration, clinical disease activity prior to study enrollment, MRI measures at baseline and early changes in MRI following treatment were evaluated in order to interpret the discordant study results. No demographic or disease-related factors enabled identification of a patient subset where BETASERON treatment was predictably associated with delayed progression of disability.\nIn Studies 2 and 3, like Study 1, a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of relapses associated with BETASERON treatment was demonstrated. In Study 2, the mean annual relapse rates were 0.42 and 0.63 in the BETASERON and placebo groups, respectively (p<0.001). In Study 3, the mean annual relapse rates were 0.16, 0.2, and 0.28, for the fixed dose, surface area-adjusted dose, and placebo groups, respectively (p<0.02).\nMRI endpoints in both Study 2 and Study 3 showed smaller increases in T2 MRI lesion area and decreased number of active MRI lesions in patients in the BETASERON groups compared to the placebo group. The exact relationship between MRI findings and the clinical status of patients is unknown. Changes in MRI findings often do not correlate with changes in disability progression. The prognostic significance of the MRI findings in these studies is not known.\nPatients with an Isolated Demyelinating Event and Typical MS Lesions on Brain MRI\nIn Study 4, 468 patients who had recently  or placebo (N= 176) subcutaneously every other day (ratio 5:3). The primary outcome measure was time to development of a second exacerbation with involvement of at least two distinct anatomical regions. Secondary outcomes were brain MRI measures, including the cumulative number of newly active lesions, and the absolute change in T2 lesion volume. Patients were followed for up to two years or until they fulfilled the primary endpoint.\nEight percent of subjects on BETASERON and 6% of subjects on placebo withdrew from the study for a reason other than the development of a second exacerbation. Time to development of a second exacerbation was significantly delayed in patients treated with BETASERON compared to patients treated with placebo (p<0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the percentage of patients developing an exacerbation within 24 months were 45% in the placebo group and 28% of the BETASERON group . The risk for developing a second exacerbation in the BETASERON group was 53% of the risk in the placebo group (Hazard ratio= 0.53; 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.73).\nIn Study 4, patients treated with BETASERON demonstrated a lower number of newly active lesions during the course of the study. A significant difference between BETASERON and placebo was not seen in the absolute change in T2 lesion volume during the course of the study.\nSafety and efficacy of treatment with BETASERON beyond three years are not known.\n\n【45】 # How Supplied\nBETASERON is supplied as a lyophilized powder in a clear glass, single-use vial (3 mL capacity).

There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.\nWhat is the most important information I should know about BETASERON?\nBETASERON can cause serious side effects, including:\n- liver problems including liver failure. Symptoms of liver problems may include\n- yellowing of your eyes\n- itchy skin\n- feeling very tired\n- flu-like symptoms\n- nausea or vomiting\n- bruising easily or bleeding problems\nYour healthcare provider will do blood tests to check for these problems while you take BETASERON.\n- serious allergic reactions. Serious allergic reactions can happen quickly and may happen after your first dose of BETASERON or after you have taken BETASERON many times. Symptoms may include:\n- difficulty breathing or swallowing\n- swelling of the mouth or tongue\n- rash, itching, or skin bumps\n- depression or suicidal thoughts. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:\n- thoughts about suicide or dying\n- new or worse depression\n- new or worse anxiety\n- trouble sleeping (insomnia)\n- acting aggressive, being angry, or violent\n- acting on dangerous impulses\n- hallucinations\n- other unusual changes in behavior or mood\nWhat is BETASERON?\nBETASERON is a prescription medicine used to reduce the number of relapses in people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This includes people who have had their first symptoms of multiple sclerosis and have an MRI consistent with multiple sclerosis. BETASERON is similar to certain interferon proteins that are produced in the body. It will not cure your MS but may decrease the number of flare-ups of the disease.\nIt is not known if BETASERON is safe and effective in children.\nWho should not take BETASERON?\n\n【52】 What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking BETASERON?\nBefore you take BETASERON, tell your healthcare provider if you:\n- have or have had depression (sinking feeling or sadness), anxiety (feeling uneasy, nervous, or fearful for no reason) or trouble sleeping\n- have or have had liver problems\n- have or have had blood problems such as bleeding or bruising easily, low red blood cells (anemia) or low white blood cells\n- are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. BETASERON can harm your unborn baby. BETASERON may cause you to lose your baby (miscarry). If you become pregnant while taking BETASERON call your healthcare provider right away. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you should continue to take BETASERON.\n- are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if BETASERON passes into your breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take BETASERON or breastfeed. You should not do both.\nTell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.\nKnow the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.\nHow should I take BETASERON?\n\n【53】 - BETASERON is given by injection under your skin (subcutaneous injection) every other day.\n- Take BETASERON exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take it.\n- If your healthcare provider feels that you or someone else may give you the injections then you or the other person should be trained by your healthcare provider in how to give an injection.\n- Do not try to give yourself or have another person give you injections until you or both of you understand and are comfortable with how to prepare your dose and give the injection.\n- You may be started on a lower dose when you first start taking BETASERON. Your healthcare provider will tell you what dose of BETASERON to use.\n- Your healthcare provider may change your dose of BETASERON. You should not change your dose without talking to your healthcare provider.\n- If you miss a dose, you should take your next dose as soon as you remember or are able to take it. Your next injection should be taken about 48 hours (2 days) after that dose. Do not take BETASERON on 2 consecutive days. If you accidentally take more than your prescribed dose, or take it on 2 consecutive days, call your healthcare provider right away.\n- Always use a new, unopened vial of BETASERON and pre-filled diluent syringe for each injection. Throw away any unused medicine. Do not re-use any vials, syringes, or needles.\n- It is important for you to change your injection site each time you inject BETASERON. This will lessen the chance of you having a serious skin reaction at the site where you inject BETASERON. Avoid injecting BETASERON into an area of skin that is sore, reddened, infected or has other problems.\nWhat are the possible side effects of BETASERON?\nBETASERON may cause serious side effects. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the serious side effects of BETASERON including:\n\n【54】 - heart problems. BETASERON may worsen heart problems including congestive heart failure. Symptoms of heart problems may include:\n- swollen ankles\n- shortness of breath\n- decreased ability to exercise\n- fast heartbeat\n- tightness in chest\n- increased need to urinate at night\n- not being able to lay flat in bed\n- injection site problems. Serious skin reactions can happen in some people including areas of severe damage to skin and the tissue below the skin (necrosis). These reactions can happen anywhere you inject BETASERON. Symptoms of injection site problems may include:\n- swelling, redness, or pain at the injection site\n- fluid drainage from the injection site\n- breaks in your skin or blue-black skin discoloration\n- flu-like symptoms. BETASERON can cause flu-like symptoms including:\n- fever\n- chills\n- tiredness\n- sweating\n- muscle aches when you first start to use it\nThese symptoms may decrease over time. Taking medicines for fever and pain relief on the days you are using BETASERON may help decrease these symptoms.\n- seizures. Some people have had seizures while taking BETASERON, including people who have never had seizures before. It is not known if the seizures were related to their MS, to BETASERON, or to a combination of both. If you have a seizure after taking BETASERON call your healthcare provider right away.\nThe most common side effects of BETASERON include:\n- low white blood cell count\n- increases in your liver enzymes\n- headache\n- pain\n- rash\n- problems sleeping\n- stomach pain\n- weakness\nTell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.\nThese are not all the possible side effects of BETASERON. \nCall your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.\n- Before mixing, store BETASERON at room temperature between 68°F to 77°F (20°C to 25°C).\n- Before mixing, BETASERON may be stored for up to 3 months between 59°F to 86°F (15°C to 30°C).\n- After mixing, you can refrigerate BETASERON for up to 3 hours before using. Your BETASERON must be used within 3 hours of mixing even if refrigerated.\n- Do not freeze.\nKeep BETASERON and all medicines out of the reach of children.\nGeneral information about the safe and effective use of BETASERON.\nMedicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Medication Guide. Do not use BETASERON for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give BETASERON to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them.\nThis Medication Guide summarizes the most important information about BETASERON. If you would like more information, talk with your healthcare provider. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about BETASERON that is written for health professionals.\n\n【55】 What are the ingredients in BETASERON?\nActive ingredient: interferon beta-1b\nInactive ingredients: albumin (human), mannitol\nDiluent contains sodium chloride solution.\nInstructions for Use\n\n【56】 ### BETASERON\n(bay-ta-seer-on)\ninterferon beta-1b\n(in-ter-feer-on beta-one-be)\nRead the Instructions for Use that come with your BETASERON before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Before you use BETASERON for the first time, make sure your healthcare provider shows you the right way to use it.\nSupplies needed for your BETASERON Injection .\n- 1 single-use carton containing:\n- A vial of BETASERON\n- A pre-filled diluent syringe\n- A vial adapter with a 30-gauge needle attached (in the blister pack)\n- 2 alcohol prep pads\nStep 1: Preparing for Your BETASERON Injection\n- Place the supplies you will need on a clean, flat surface in a well-lit area.\n- Check the expiration date on the single-use carton to make sure that it has not expired. Do not use it if the medication has expired.\n- Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n- Open the single-use carton and take out all the contents. Make sure the blister pack containing the vial adapter is sealed. Check to make sure the plastic cap on the pre-filled diluent syringe is firmly attached.\n- Remove the tray from the single-use carton and place it on a flat surface.\n- Place the BETASERON vial in the well (vial holder) and place the pre-filled diluent syringe in the U-shaped trough .\nStep 2: Mixing BETASERON\n- Remove the BETASERON vial from the well (vial holder) and take the cap off the vial.\n- Place the vial back into the well (vial holder).\n- Use an alcohol prep pad to clean the top of the vial. Move the alcohol prep pad in 1 direction. Leave the alcohol prep pad on top of the vial.\n- Peel the label off the blister pack with the vial adapter in it. The vial adapter is sterile. Do not remove or touch the vial adapter.\n- Remove the alcohol prep pad from the top of the BETASERON vial. Pick up the vial adapter in the blister pack. Turn over the blister pack keeping the vial adapter inside. Put the adapter on top of the BETASERON vial. Push down on the adapter until it pierces the rubber top of the BETASERON vial and snaps in place . Remove the blister packaging from the vial adapter.\n- Twist the plastic cap from the pre-filled diluent syringe. Throw away the plastic cap. \n- Keep the vial adapter attached to the vial and remove the vial from the well (vial holder). Be careful not to pull the vial adapter off the top of the vial.\n- Connect the pre-filled diluent syringe to the vial adapter by turning clockwise until resistance is felt and the attachment is secure. This forms the syringe assembly .\n- Slowly push the plunger of the pre-filled diluent syringe all the way in. This will transfer all of the liquid from the syringe into the BETASERON vial . The plunger may return to its original position after you release it.\n- Gently swirl the vial to completely dissolve the white powder of BETASERON. Do not shake. Shaking and even gentle mixing can cause foaming of the medicine. If there is foam, let the vial sit until the foam settles before using it.\n- After the powder dissolves, look closely at the solution in the vial. Do not use the solution if it is cloudy or contains particles. It should be clear and colorless.\n- Do not use cracked or damaged BETASERON vials. If your vial is cracked or damaged, get a new single-use carton containing a BETASERON vial, pre-filled diluent syringe, vial adapter and 2 alcohol prep pads. Repeat the steps to prepare your BETASERON dose.\n- Contact BETAPLUS, the BETASERON patient support program, at 1-800-788-1467 to obtain a replacement product.\nStep 3: Preparing the Injection\nYou have completed the steps to prepare your BETASERON and are ready for the injection. The injection should be given immediately after mixing and allowing any foam in the solution to settle. If you must wait to give yourself the injection, you may refrigerate the solution and use within 3 hours of mixing your BETASERON. Do not freeze.\n- Push the plunger in and hold it there; then turn the syringe assembly so that the syringe is horizontal and the vial is on top.\n- Slowly pull the plunger back to withdraw all the liquid from the BETASERON vial into the syringe .\n- NOTE: The syringe barrel is marked with numbers from 0.25 mL to 1 mL . If the solution in the vial cannot be drawn up to the 1 mL mark, discard the vial and syringe and start over with a new single-use carton containing a BETASERON vial, pre-filled diluent syringe, vial adapter and alcohol prep pads.\n- Turn the syringe assembly so that the needle end is pointing up. Remove any air bubbles by tapping the outside of the syringe with your fingers. Slowly push the plunger to the 1 mL mark on the syringe or to the mark that matches the amount of BETASERON prescribed by your healthcare provider . If too much solution is pushed into the vial, repeat Step 3.\n- Turn the syringe assembly so that the vial is at the bottom. Remove the vial adapter and the vial from the syringe by twisting the vial adapter. This will remove the vial adapter and the vial from the syringe, but will leave the needle on the syringe .\nStep 4. Choosing an Injection Site\n- BETASERON (interferon beta-1b) is injected under the skin and into the fat layer between the skin and the muscles (subcutaneous tissue). The best areas for injection are where the skin is loose and soft and away from the joints, nerves, and bones. Do not use the area near your navel or waistline. If you are very thin, use only the thigh or outer surface of the arm for injection.\n- Choose a different site each time you give yourself an injection. Do not inject in the same area for 2 injections in a row. Keep a record of your injections to help make sure you change (rotate) your injection sites. You should decide where you will inject BETASERON before you prepare your medicine for injection. If there are any sites that are difficult for you to reach, you can ask someone who has been trained to give the injection to help you.\n- Do not inject BETASERON in a site where the skin is red, bruised, infected, or scabbed, has broken open, or has lumps, bumps, or pain. Tell your healthcare provider if you find skin conditions like the ones mentioned here or any other unusual looking areas where you have been given injections.\n- Using a circular motion, clean the injection site with an alcohol prep pad, starting at the injection site and moving outward. Let the skin area air dry.\n- Remove the cap from the needle. Hold the syringe like a pencil or dart in 1 hand.\n- Gently pinch the skin around the site with the thumb and forefinger of the other hand . Insert the needle straight up and down into your skin at a 90° angle with a quick, dart-like motion.\n- Slowly push the plunger all the way in until the syringe is empty .\n- Remove the needle from the skin. Place a dry cotton ball or gauze pad over the injection site. Gently massage the injection site for a few moments with the dry cotton ball or gauze pad. Throw away the syringe in your puncture-proof disposal container.\nStep 6: Disposing of used syringes, needles, and vials\n- To prevent needle-stick injury and spread of infection, do not try to re-cap the needle.\n- Place used needles, syringes, and vials in a closeable, puncture-resistant container. You may use a sharps container (such as a red biohazard container), hard plastic container (such as a detergent bottle), or metal container (such as an empty coffee can). Do not use glass or clear plastic containers. Ask your healthcare provider for instructions on the right way to throw away (dispose of) the container. There may be state and local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes.\n- Do not throw used needles, syringes, or vials in your household trash or recycle.\n- Throw away any unused medicine. Do not save any unused BETASERON for a future dose.\n- Keep the disposal container, needles, syringes, and vials of BETASERON out of the reach of children.\nThis Medication Guide and Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nManufactured for:\nBayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nWhippany, NJ 07981\nManufactured in Germany\nU.S. License No. 1778\n 2014 Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc.

{"seq_id": "41a2a65a-2e83-476d-a51f-75cc22831b31", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Fostamatinib for treating refractory chronic immune thrombocytopenia\n\n【1】 Evidence-based recommendations on fostamatinib (Tavlesse) for chronic refractory chronic immune thrombocytopenia in adults.\n\n【2】 # Recommendations\nFostamatinib is recommended as an option for treating refractory chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults, only if:\nthey have previously had a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO‑RA), or a TPO‑RA is unsuitable\nthe company provides fostamatinib according to the commercial arrangement.\nThis recommendation is not intended to affect treatment with fostamatinib that was started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People having treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this guidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\nWhy the committee made these recommendations\nTreatment options for refractory chronic ITP include TPO‑RAs, which are mostly followed by rituximab or mycophenolate. Fostamatinib is licensed for treating refractory chronic ITP, but the company has only provided evidence for using fostamatinib after a TPO‑RA, or when they are not suitable. Fostamatinib would be used at the same point in the treatment pathway as rituximab or mycophenolate.\nClinical evidence shows that fostamatinib is effective compared with placebo. There is no clinical trial evidence directly comparing fostamatinib with rituximab or mycophenolate. An indirect comparison shows that fostamatinib works better than rituximab at increasing the number of platelets in the blood (cells that help the blood to clot).\nThe cost-effectiveness estimates for fostamatinib compared with rituximab are within what NICE normally considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. So, fostamatinib is recommended.# Information about fostamatinib\n\n【3】 # Marketing authorisation indication\nFostamatinib (Tavlesse, Grifols) is indicated 'for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments'.\n\n【4】 # Dosage in the marketing authorisation\nThe dosage schedule is available in the summary of product characteristics for fostamatinib.\n\n【5】 The list prices of fostamatinib are:\n£3,090 per 60‑tablet pack, each tablet contains 100 mg of fostamatinib (excluding VAT; BNF online, accessed August 2022)\n£4,635 per 60‑tablet pack, each tablet contains 150 mg of fostamatinib (excluding VAT; BNF online, accessed August 2022).The company has a commercial arrangement. This makes fostamatinib available to the NHS with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the company's responsibility to let relevant NHS organisations know details of the discount.# Committee discussion\n\n【6】 # The condition\n\n【7】 ## People with chronic ITP and clinicians would welcome an additional treatment option\nChronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune condition characterised by platelet destruction, leading to a low number of platelets circulating in the blood. Platelets are a type of cell involved in blood clotting. Thrombocytopenia is usually defined as having a platelet count lower than 100x109 per litre. Signs and symptoms include bruising easily, the appearance of red spots under the skin (petechiae), fatigue and bleeding. Frequency and severity of bleeding may differ in people with similar platelet counts. Some have no bleeding, some bleed from the skin, nose, or urinary tract, and others have more serious intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeding. Because of the risk of bleeding, people may become stressed or depressed. A particular concern is a sudden drop in platelets, which can lead to life‑threatening bleeds. Although treatments called thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO‑RAs) are available, they do not work for everyone and some people cannot take them. The patient and clinical experts explained that some of the treatment options suppress the immune system, and increase the risk of infection. The committee concluded that people with chronic ITP and clinicians would welcome an additional treatment option.\n\n【8】 # Treatment pathway\n\n【9】 ## The treatment pathway includes TPO-RAs followed mostly by rituximab and mycophenolate\nInitial treatment for ITP involves high-dose oral corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIgG). Later treatments include:\nTPO‑RAs \nrituximab\nsurgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy)\nazathioprine, mycophenolate, cyclosporine, dapsone and danazol.The clinical experts explained that the choice of treatment after corticosteroids or IVIgG depends on time to relapse, but clinicians are most likely to offer TPO‑RAs. They noted that clinicians avoid offering splenectomy in the first year after diagnosis and are unlikely to offer it as a second line of treatment. After TPO‑RAs, rituximab and mycophenolate are the most common treatments, but azathioprine is offered to people who want to conceive. Cyclosporine is rarely used because of adverse effects, and dapsone is used as a last resort. The committee understood that danazol is no longer available in the UK. For people with platelet counts higher than 30x109 per litre and at low risk of bleeding, clinicians may adopt a 'watch and rescue' approach. A patient expert explained that once his platelet count had stabilised after treatment with IVIgG, he went onto a watch and rescue approach for 15 years. The committee concluded that the treatment pathway after TPO‑RAs includes many treatments, most commonly rituximab and mycophenolate.\n\n【10】 ## Treatment decisions are based on more than platelet count\nThe clinical experts highlighted that they and people with ITP make treatment decisions based on platelet count and other risk factors for bleeding, such as age and use of anti‑platelet treatment. They explained that the objective of treatment is a platelet count higher than 30x109 per litre to reduce the risk of bleeding. Platelet counts higher than 50x109 per litre may be used as a target for maintenance treatment, to avoid fluctuating platelet levels and minimise the chance of counts dropping below 30x109 per litre. The committee appreciated that treatment aims to achieve platelet counts lower than those used to define thrombocytopenia. It concluded that treatment decisions were based on more than platelet count.\n\n【11】 ## The company's positioning of fostamatinib in the treatment pathway is broadly appropriate\nFostamatinib has a marketing authorisation for treating chronic ITP after previous treatments. The company proposed that fostamatinib is used after a TPO‑RA (for example, romiplostim or eltrombopag) or when TPO‑RAs are not suitable. This is narrower than the marketing authorisation. The clinical experts considered the company's proposed positioning to be reasonable. They noted that other treatments such as rituximab and mycophenolate may be used after TPO‑RAs at the point where the company proposed using fostamatinib. The clinical experts noted that rituximab is considered more effective for young women and people with other autoimmune conditions. However, some people may be concerned about rituximab's immunosuppressive effects so would prefer an alternative treatment. The clinical experts also highlighted that for people at risk of blood clots, TPO‑RAs may not be suitable so fostamatinib could be considered instead. They also noted that other treatments such as rituximab and mycophenolate may be used after TPO‑RAs, but before fostamatinib. The committee acknowledged that treatment is individualised. They also noted that people may be cautious about using immunosuppressive drugs during the COVID‑19 pandemic. It concluded that the company's positioning of fostamatinib in the treatment pathway was narrower than the marketing authorisation but broadly appropriate.\n\n【12】 ## Rituximab and mycophenolate are relevant comparators for fostamatinib\nAs relevant comparators, NICE's final scope included the TPO‑RAs romiplostim and eltrombopag, rituximab, splenectomy, cytotoxic agents, dapsone, danazol and 'watch and rescue'. However, the company excluded romiplostim and eltrombopag based on its positioning of fostamatinib after a TPO‑RA, or when TPO‑RAs are unsuitable. The company selected rituximab as the only comparator. For all other comparators, the company argued that there was little evidence to support comparisons with fostamatinib. The clinical experts agreed that many treatments used in practice do not have robust clinical trial data. They also noted that rituximab and mycophenolate are often used in clinical practice at the same point in the treatment pathway as the company proposed for fostamatinib . The committee concluded that the relevant comparators for fostamatinib are rituximab and mycophenolate.\n\n【13】 # Clinical effectiveness\n\n【14】 ## Fostamatinib is effective at increasing platelet count compared with placebo, based on the FIT trials\nFIT1 and FIT2 are multinational, double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trials of the same design comparing fostamatinib with placebo. Both trials included adults with persistent or chronic ITP that had not responded to at least 1 treatment. Their average platelet count was less than 30x109 per litre. The primary endpoint in both trials was stable platelet response. This was defined as a platelet count of 50x109 per litre or more in at least 4 out of 6 assessments between week 14 and week 24. Secondary outcomes included:\nthe percentage of people with a platelet count higher than 50x109 per litre at week 12 and week 24\nthe percentage of people with a platelet count higher than 30x109 per litre and an increase of at least 20x109 per litre from baseline at week 12 and week 24, after a platelet count of less than 15x109 per litre at baseline\nbleeding frequency and severity, measured by the Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura Bleeding Scale and World Health Organization bleeding scores.People randomised to fostamatinib had 100 mg twice a day initially. This could be increased to 150 mg twice a day at week 4 if platelet count remained below 50x109 per litre and fostamatinib was well tolerated. Rescue treatments were allowed as needed in both treatment arms. People in FIT1 and FIT2 were invited to take part in FIT3, a 5‑year open-label extension study, if they:\ncompleted the full 24 weeks of treatment or\nstopped the trials after at least 12 weeks of double-blind treatment because of lack of efficacy (including at least 4 weeks at the 150 mg dose of fostamatinib or placebo).In FIT3, the initial fostamatinib dose was the dose that produced a platelet response in FIT1 and FIT2. If there was no platelet response in FIT1 and FIT2, the initial dose was 100 mg twice a day.Pooled results from FIT1 and FIT2 showed that rates of stable response were higher in the fostamatinib arm (18%) than in the placebo arm (2%). Fostamatinib led to greater improvements than placebo for all secondary outcomes, but these benefits appeared to decrease over time. For example, the pooled percentage of people with a platelet count higher than 50x109 per litre at week 12 in the fostamatinib arm was 23% compared with 16% at week 24. The committee concluded that fostamatinib increased platelet levels, but only about 1 in 5 people had a platelet response, which may decrease over time.\n\n【15】 ## The criteria for non-response and stopping treatment in the FIT trials do not reflect NHS clinical practice\nStarting from week 12, the criteria used to define non-response in FIT1, FIT2 and the FIT3 extension study were:\na platelet count of less than 50x109 per litre or\nan increase of less than 20x109 per litre for people with baseline platelet counts of less than 15x109 per litre.People with non-response could withdraw from the study. The clinical experts explained that less stringent definitions of response are typically used in practice. This is because platelet counts can vary because of infections or other clinical characteristics and may not affect the overall response to treatment. They noted that they generally consider platelet counts higher than 30x109 per litre and doubling of platelet counts from the treatment starting point as an acceptable response . They would recommend stopping treatment if:\nresponse was not acceptable\nadverse effects were intolerable or\nplatelet counts dropped to baseline levels or below 20x109 to 30x109 per litre.The committee concluded that the criteria for non-response and stopping treatment in the FIT trials did not reflect clinical practice.\n\n【16】 ## The results of the FIT clinical trials are likely to be generalisable to NHS clinical practice\nThe average age at baseline in FIT1 and FIT2 was between 53 and 54 years. The ERG was concerned that people enrolled in these trials were about 10 years younger than in clinical practice and had a lower risk of bleeding, which increases with age. The clinical experts highlighted that fostamatinib is likely to work equally well in clinical practice regardless of age. The committee concluded that the results of the FIT clinical trials are likely to be generalisable to NHS practice, but the absolute benefit may differ from the trials.\n\n【17】 ## Network meta-analyses 2 and 3 have limitations but are considered for decision making\nThe committee recalled that there was no evidence directly comparing fostamatinib with rituximab or mycophenolate. The company's base case discussed at the first committee meeting included rituximab as the only relevant comparator. Clinical efficacy data for rituximab was based on clinical expert opinion, rather than published literature. After consultation, the company did a network meta-analysis comparing fostamatinib with rituximab, with an outcome of overall platelet response. The definition of overall platelet response varied across studies included within the meta-analysis, so the company did 3 separate analyses:\nAnalysis 1 was based on the primary definition of response in each study and included FIT1, FIT2 and 4 rituximab studies.\nAnalysis 2 used alternative definitions for response. Each focused on platelet counts greater than 30x109 per litre and at least doubling from baseline. However, timepoints for measurement and the use of rescue treatments differed. It included the same studies as analysis 1.\nAnalysis 3 used the definition of response as an increase in platelet count greater than 30x109 per litre, at least doubling from baseline and without rescue treatment at 4 weeks. It included only FIT1, FIT2 and the Ghanima et al.  study for rituximab.The company preferred analysis 2 because the endpoints varied less than in analysis 1. The ERG noted that analysis 2 included both randomised and non-randomised evidence, which the Cochrane Handbook (11.3.4, version 6.2, 2021) does not recommend because of bias. The ERG preferred analysis 3, which included only randomised studies. The analyses showed that fostamatinib was more effective than rituximab, and rituximab was no better than placebo. The committee noted that the size of benefit differed between analyses. Analysis 2 showed a 4‑fold increase in the odds of having a response with fostamatinib compared with rituximab, whereas analysis 3 showed a 3‑fold increase. Analyses 1 and 2 included 4 different dosages of rituximab:\nmg/m2 body surface area per week for 4 weeks\nmg fixed dose per week for 4 weeks\nmg/m2 per week for 2 weeks in people with early response and for 4 weeks in the others and\nmg/m2 perweek for 2 weeks.Analysis 3 included only the rituximab dosage of 375 mg/m2 per week for 4 weeks. The ERG clinical adviser noted that 375 mg/m2 per week for 4 weeks and the 100 mg fixed dose are used in clinical practice and are the most relevant . The committee noted that the non-randomised study  was the only study that included the rituximab 100 mg fixed dose. The ERG explained that when the company used analysis 2 in its model, it did not use the estimates from Zaja et al. to inform the efficacy of the rituximab 100 mg dose. Instead, the company assumed that the efficacy of rituximab 100 mg was the same as that of rituximab 375 mg/m2. The ERG advised that this likely favoured rituximab, although it expected the size of bias to be small. When using analysis 3, the company and the ERG also assumed that both doses of rituximab had the same efficacy. The committee noted that analysis 2 also included Arnold et al. a randomised controlled trial comparing 375 mg/m2 rituximab with placebo. It noted that the company could have done an additional analysis comparing the FIT trials with only the Ghanima et al. and Arnold et al. trials, because both assessed the efficacy of rituximab 375 mg/m2. The committee agreed that analysis 1 was the least relevant because the endpoint definitions varied most across studies. It concluded that it would consider both analyses 2 and 3 in its decision making but noted they both had limitations.\n\n【18】 ## The clinical efficacy of mycophenolate is uncertain\nThe company excluded mycophenolate from its network meta-analysis because it did not identify any randomised trials of mycophenolate being used after TPO-RAs. It noted that mycophenolate does not have a marketing authorisation for ITP. The company presented data from the UK ITP registry and a panel of clinical experts, who revealed that a substantial proportion of people do have mycophenolate after TPO-RAs. (The exact proportion is confidential and cannot be reported here.) The committee noted that this further supports its use in NHS clinical practice. The ERG confirmed the lack of evidence for mycophenolate. The committee noted that relevant comparators are selected based on their routine use in NHS clinical practice, regardless of whether they have a marketing authorisation for that indication. It also noted that rituximab does not have a marketing authorisation for ITP, but the company included it as a relevant comparator. The committee maintained that both rituximab and mycophenolate are relevant comparators for fostamatinib . But it acknowledged that there is no published evidence showing how well mycophenolate works for people with ITP.\n\n【19】 # The company's economic model\n\n【20】 ## The company's approach to merging partial and complete response health states has limitations but best reflects clinical practice\nThe company used a Markov cohort state transition model to estimate the cost effectiveness of fostamatinib compared with rituximab. The model cohort was split into 2 groups based on whether a person had intracranial bleeding. The company's original model included 3 health states in each group:\nresponse (platelet count higher than 50x109 per litre)\npartial response (platelet count of 30x109 to 50x109 per litre) and\nnon-response (platelet count lower than 30x109 per litre).The company explained that its thresholds were informed by the latest ITP consensus  and the approach taken in previous NICE submissions for eltrombopag and romiplostim. The company estimated the probability of being in each state on pooled data from FIT1, FIT2 and the FIT3 extension study. The model included a lifetime time horizon. The clinical experts noted that intracranial bleeding is a rare event, but it is associated with substantial disability and morbidity, which may also affect carers' quality of life. The clinical experts explained that health states split into non-response (platelet count lower than 30x109 per litre) and response (platelet count higher than 30x109 per litre) would better reflect clinical practice . After consultation, the company merged partial and complete response into a single response health state. That is, the company's revised model included only 2 health states, non-response (platelet count lower than 30x109 per litre) and response (platelet count higher than 30x109 per litre). The company did a scenario analysis using the original health states, noting that it had a small impact on cost effectiveness. The ERG agreed that a model with 2 health states better reflected clinical practice than the 3‑health state model. But it had concerns with the company's methodology because the revised model continued to follow a 3‑state structure. The company simply set most inputs for partial response to be equal to the full response health state. The ERG noted that the company should have recalculated how likely people are to move between the 2 health states using data from the FIT trials. Instead, the company used the probabilities of moving between 3 health states from its original model. The ERG explained that these probabilities were based on a low number of events in the FIT trials so were uncertain. These uncertainties were further increased when extrapolating the probabilities over the model's lifetime time horizon and by the approach taken to apply the network meta-analysis results. The committee acknowledged the limitations of the company's approach to merging the health states. But it agreed that it preferred the merged 2‑health state structure because it better reflected clinical practice than the 3‑health state model.\n\n【21】 ## The company's corrected method for calculating the costs of rescue treatment is appropriate\nFor the rapid review, the company submitted an updated model which corrected an error in the calculation of the cost of rescue treatment. The error resulted in the total acquisition cost of rescue treatment being underestimated. This error had a significant impact on the cost‑effectiveness results. The ERG reviewed the amended model and was satisfied with the company's approach for correcting this error. The committee concluded that the company's corrected method for calculating the cost of rescue treatments was appropriate and it would use the amended model for its decision making in the rapid review.\n\n【22】 ## The revised model criteria for non-response and stopping treatment are in line with NHS practice but should be applied at 12 weeks\nThe committee recalled that the criteria for non-response and stopping treatment in the FIT trials were not in line with clinical practice . The company's original model followed the stopping rule from the FIT trials. However, after consultation, for the second committee meeting, the company changed the stopping rule in its economic model to a platelet count lower than 30 x 109 per litre, in line with clinical practice. The ERG explained that the model applied this stopping rule at 12 weeks, with a half-cycle correction. Applying a half-cycle correction effectively means that treatment would be stopped 2 weeks earlier, at 10 weeks, if a platelet count of 30x109 per litre or more was not reached. The company noted this was a conservative assumption because a clinical expert panel advised that treatment could be stopped earlier, by 8 weeks, if platelet response was not reached. The committee noted that fostamatinib's marketing authorisation includes a 12‑week stopping rule if platelet count is 'not sufficient'. The ERG explained that removing the half-cycle correction applied to the stopping rule increased the cost-effectiveness estimates. This was because treatment costs for people whose disease does not respond to treatment are incurred for longer. The committee concluded that the revised criteria for non-response and stopping were in line with clinical practice but should be applied at 12 weeks, without a half-cycle correction.\n\n【23】 ## The company's revised approach to modelling subsequent treatments is acceptable\nIn the company's original submission, people who had fostamatinib moved to watch and rescue treatment if their platelet count fell below 30x109 per litre (non-response). However, people who had rituximab did not move to watch and rescue treatment. Instead, they remained in the lower than 30x109 per litre health state and could never have a platelet count higher than 30x109 per litre after cycle 4 in the model. This led to a worse modelled outcome than was seen with placebo in the fostamatinib clinical trials. The company explained that its clinical experts had advised that in clinical practice, people do not have other treatments at the same time as rituximab. The clinical experts at the first committee meeting agreed but noted that rituximab is used only for a short time. After that, treatment is offered to raise platelet counts to a level higher than 30x109 per litre. The committee also noted that some people who do not have a response to fostamatinib may get rituximab, instead of watch and rescue treatment. At its first meeting, the committee concluded that subsequent treatments should be modelled consistently between arms and include all relevant sequences. After consultation, at the second committee meeting, the company updated its base case to allow watch and rescue treatment after rituximab, when platelet count is lower than 30x109 per litre. The ERG confirmed that the company applied the change correctly. The committee noted that the company's revised approach did not include all relevant treatment sequences. For example, it did not include an option of having rituximab after fostamatinib. The ERG explained that modelling a full treatment sequence across the pathway was difficult because of evidence limitations. This was a key model limitation and contributed to the overall uncertainty. The committee concluded that the company's revised approach to modelling subsequent treatments had limitations but was acceptable for decision making.\n\n【24】 ## It is not appropriate to assume that people can taper or stop treatment without any loss of clinical benefit\nThe company explained that its base case did not include tapering dosages or stopping treatment in people with a sustained platelet response. It assumed that those people remain on the full treatment dose until loss of response or death. However, the company stated that tapering was common with other ITP treatments and was likely with fostamatinib. The company did a scenario analysis in which it assumed that 40% of people with a sustained platelet response to fostamatinib (platelet counts above 30x109 per litre after 1 year) stop active treatment, but maintain the full clinical benefit. This scenario improved fostamatinib's cost-effectiveness estimates, as did an ERG scenario in which only people with a sustained platelet count higher than 50x109 per litre taper treatment. But, the company recognised that it did not have data to support tapering or stopping fostamatinib without losing benefit. The committee recognised that maintaining treatment benefit after tapering or stopping treatment was speculative. It also noted that fostamatinib's marketing authorisation does not include treatment tapering or stopping in people with a sustained platelet response. The committee concluded that it is not appropriate to assume that people with sustained platelet response can taper or stop treatment without losing clinical benefit.\n\n【25】 ## The benefits of fostamatinib may decrease over time and the amount of decline is a source of uncertainty in the model\nAs outlined in section 3.6, the pooled results from FIT1 and FIT2 showed that the benefits of fostamatinib may decrease over time. The company's model captured loss of response for the first 24 weeks by the probabilities of transitioning to the 'no response' health states which were informed by the FIT1 and FIT2 data. The level of sustained response beyond 24 weeks was informed by the extension study (FIT3). The ERG considered the company's approach to inform the loss of fostamatinib response over time was conservative, but noted that it was a source of uncertainty. The committee noted that the model included a stopping rule to reflect the marketing authorisation of fostamatinib. If the condition stopped responding to fostamatinib, that is platelet count was lower than 30x109 per litre, treatment would stop. The committee acknowledged that the model reflects available clinical evidence for fostamatinib over the long term and that people would stop treatment if they were no longer benefiting. But they concluded that any loss of benefit and the timing of any loss of benefit is a source of uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness results.\n\n【26】 ## Basing the use of rescue treatment on UK ITP registry data is likely to reflect clinical practice\nIn its original base case, the company used FIT trials data to inform the frequency and type of rescue treatments. After consultation, it used the UK ITP registry data instead. The use of rescue treatments in the UK ITP registry depended on platelet count and included IVIgG, intravenous methylprednisolone, platelet transfusion, oral prednisolone, and oral dexamethasone. The company justified using the UK ITP registry because:\nthe FIT trials included locations outside the UK\nin the trials, people had their platelet counts measured more often than expected in clinical practice and\nthe trial populations had a relatively lower risk of bleeding.In its base case, the company applied frequency and type of rescue treatments separately for each health state defined by platelet count. The non-response health state had greater costs, driven by the increased frequency of events needing rescue treatments and increased use of IVIgG compared with oral prednisolone. The ERG accepted that the UK ITP registry data is likely generalisable to NHS clinical practice and used this source in its base case. However, the ERG was concerned that the company did not provide data comparing the populations in the UK ITP registry and FIT trials. The company explained that it could not get demographic information from the UK ITP registry. But it noted that everyone included in the analysis had previously had treatment with TPO-RAs, consistent with the company's positioning of fostamatinib in the treatment pathway . The ERG was concerned about using different data sources to inform different parts of the model. For example, using the UK ITP registry for frequency and type of rescue treatment, and the company's network meta-analysis for the probability of reaching platelet response with watch and rescue. To address this, the ERG did a scenario analysis using the FIT trial data to inform all inputs for rescue treatments and for prophylaxis before surgery . The committee acknowledged the limitations of the company's approach. But it concluded that the UK ITP registry was likely to reflect use of rescue treatment in NHS clinical practice.\n\n【27】 ## In clinical practice, 2 doses of rituximab are used and both should be included in the model\nThe committee recalled that the trials included 2 doses of rituximab . In the 2014 NICE evidence summary for rituximab in ITP, most studies included the higher dose of 375 mg/m2 per week. Some used a fixed dose of 100 mg per week. International guidelines for ITP recognised that 100 mg per week is an alternative dosing schedule. Statements from several NHS clinical commissioning groups recommended only the lower dose. One clinical expert explained that they offer a dose of 100 mg per week. They noted that ITP registry data suggested that the effects of this dose are equivalent to the 375 mg/m2 per week dose. The other clinical expert noted that they use the higher dose in practice. After consultation, the company analysed the use of rituximab in the UK ITP registry in people who had prior treatment with TPO‑RAs. It found that both doses were used (exact usage is confidential and cannot be reported here). The company updated its base case to include a mean dose of rituximab calculated from the UK ITP registry. It also did a scenario analysis using the 100 mg rituximab dose. The ERG was concerned that the company may have underestimated the mean rituximab dose in the UK ITP registry. The ERG corrected this, which led to a small increase in the mean dose. However, it explained that it preferred to use the lower, fixed 100 mg dose which was increasingly recommended for use in NHS clinical practice. The committee considered the clinical advice and UK ITP registry data and agreed that both rituximab doses are used in NHS clinical practice. Therefore, it concluded that both doses are relevant and should be included in the model.\n\n【28】 ## The company's revised approach to modelling prophylaxis before surgery reflects clinical practice\nPeople who have a platelet count below 30x109 per litre may need prophylactic treatment to increase platelet count before surgery. In its original submission, the company assumed that prophylactic treatments were the same as rescue treatments. These include IVIgG, intravenous methylprednisolone and platelet transfusions, but not oral prednisolone. At the first committee meeting, the ERG explained that only 1 course of treatment is used, and this is based on the type of surgery (minor or major). It suggested that IVIgG was used for major surgery, which the ERG's clinical expert estimated accounts for 44% of people having surgery. Oral prednisolone was used for minor surgery in the remaining 56% of people. This affected the cost-effectiveness estimates because prednisolone costs much less than IVIgG. The clinical experts explained that oral prednisolone is used in clinical practice, contrary to the company's assumption. Also, they emphasised that the use of prophylaxis before surgery depends on the timing of the surgery. For example, IVIgG works more quickly than oral prednisolone. After consultation, the company asked a panel of 8 clinical experts about which treatments are used as prophylaxis before surgery in NHS clinical practice. Oral prednisolone was the most frequently used treatment for both minor (average use 54% ) and major surgery (62% ). This was followed by IVIgG for both minor (45% ) and major (49% ) surgery. The company assumed the same proportions of minor (56%) and major (44%) surgery as the ERG. The ERG agreed with the company's approach to estimating the use of prophylaxis before surgery and noted it was consistent with its expert opinion. The committee was satisfied that the revised company base case was in line with NHS clinical practice.\n\n【29】 ## The company's revised approach to modelling adverse events is acceptable\nThe company's base case discussed at the first committee meeting used pooled data from FIT1 and FIT2 for people 65 years and over to estimate the rate of adverse events for fostamatinib. This age group was considered more relevant because it is in line with the starting age in the model. This group had a higher rate of adverse events than the younger people in the trial. The company assumed that the rate of adverse events with rituximab was the same as with fostamatinib. At its first meeting, the committee concluded that adverse events with fostamatinib and rituximab were different and should be modelled separately. After consultation, the company agreed that rituximab was associated with fewer adverse events than fostamatinib and watch and rescue treatments. In its revised base case, adverse events with rituximab were based on a randomised controlled trial comparing 375 mg/m2 rituximab with placebo (Ghanima et al.). The ERG was satisfied with the company's revised approach but noted some limitations. Rituximab can cause very rare fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which the company excluded from its analysis. The median age in the Ghanima et al. trial was 46 years, compared with the starting age in the model of 65 years. Adverse events in older people are likely to be more frequent, as seen with fostamatinib in the FIT trials. The committee noted that these assumptions likely favoured rituximab. The ERG explained that the rate of adverse events with the 100 mg weekly dose was likely to be lower than with the higher dose. The committee recalled that at its first meeting, a clinical expert explained that the 100 mg per week dose is well tolerated. The committee noted that assuming equal rates of adverse events with both doses favours fostamatinib. The ERG also explained that the company applied adverse events for rituximab for as long as response was maintained, even though it is only taken for 4 weeks . However, the ERG advised that this likely has a small impact on the cost-effectiveness estimates, because cycle-specific costs and disutilities of adverse events with watch and rescue are similar to rituximab. In terms of modelling adverse events with fostamatinib, the company applied the same rate of adverse events for the full duration of treatment when in the response health state. The ERG noted that the company could instead have used the longest available data from the FIT3 extension study to model long-term adverse events with fostamatinib. However, the company explained that this data was not yet available. But it noted that new long-term safety issues were unlikely to emerge because fostamatinib's long-term safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis was consistent with the earlier data for that disease. The committee acknowledged the limitations of the company's approach to modelling adverse events with fostamatinib and rituximab. It noted that overall, it was not clear if this approach favoured rituximab or fostamatinib. However, it concluded that the company's approach was acceptable for decision making.\n\n【30】 ## The company's revised base case overestimates the risk of dying from ITP\nIn the company's original base case, it estimated the risk of dying in the non-response health state from the General Practice Research Database  and 1.0 in the complete response health state. The 2-health state model used a hazard ratio for mortality of 4.2 in the non-response health state and 1.0 in the merged response health state. The ERG had concerns with the new sources:\nPortielje et al. reported hazard ratios for mortality specifically in people with platelet counts below 30 x 109 per litre but had a small sample size and was not based in the UK.\nAdelborg et al. was a larger study but reported hazard ratios for everyone with a platelet count less than 50x109 per litre.The clinical experts agreed with the ERG that using Adelborg et al. for the partial response (30x109 to 50x109 per litre) health state was not appropriate. This was because most deaths in people with platelet counts below 50x109 per litre could be a result of deaths in people with a platelet count below 30x109 per litre. This meant that the model may overestimate mortality in the partial response state. The committee discussed the 3 potential sources of mortality data, noting that all have limitations. It recalled clinical expert advice that many factors influence the risk of dying from ITP, including platelet count, bleeding, age and treatment. It also recalled advice that treatment had changed over time, and the risk of dying from ITP is now lower than in the past. In the past, deaths related to infection were as high as for bleeding, and likely reflected higher use of splenectomy and heavy immunosuppression. But since the introduction of TPO-RAs, it is rare for people to have chronic platelet counts below 20x109 to 30x109 per litre, and rare to have deaths from ITP treatments. The committee agreed that Portielje et al. may overestimate the current risk of dying from ITP because of the progress in treatment for this disease. It also noted that the risk of dying from intracranial bleeding is already accounted for in the model. So, using hazard ratios for mortality from Portielje et al. would overestimate mortality in people without intracranial bleeding. Also, the committee discussed that the company did not provide any evidence that fostamatinib reduces the risk of dying from ITP. The model predicts such a reduction, based on less time spent in the non-response health state compared with rituximab. But the committee noted that without any evidence to support this, the effect of fostamatinib on the risk of dying was uncertain. It also noted that mortality assumptions have the biggest effect on the cost-effectiveness estimates. The committee concluded that the company's revised approach overestimates the risk of dying from ITP. It preferred the company's original approach, using estimates from the General Practice Research Database (Schoonen et al.).\n\n【31】 ## The utility values in the model are appropriate, including those for carers\nThe company used utility values for the model health states from published literature because of the low number of responses to the quality-of-life questionnaire used in the FIT clinical trials (SF‑36). The committee noted that the company used utility values for the health states of the group without intracranial bleeding from NICE's technology appraisal guidance on romiplostim. The company's original base case applied a lower utility value for people in the partial and no response health states than in the response health state. This was because the romiplostim appraisal used different utility values for people with platelet counts of 50x109 per litre or more (response) and those with platelet counts below 50x109 per litre (non-response). In its revised base case after consultation, the company applied different utility values to the response (platelets 30x109 per litre or more) and the non-response health states (platelets below 30x109 per litre). The committee acknowledged that people with platelet counts below 30x109 per litre would be unlikely to feel worse than people with platelet counts of 30x109 per litre or above. But if a person knows that they are at higher risk of bleeding, this could cause anxiety and affect their daily life if they avoid their usual activities. For the group who had severe intracranial bleeding and for their carers, the company used published utility values. The ERG noted that because intracranial bleeding is rare, including carer quality of life affected the cost-effectiveness estimates minimally. The company also applied a transient disutility for people with other bleeds, adverse events or when needing rescue treatment. The committee concluded that the utility values in the model, including those for carers of people who had severe intracranial bleeding, were appropriate.\n\n【32】 ## The ERG's exploratory analysis for mycophenolate assumes equal efficacy and safety to rituximab, which is uncertain\nThe ERG did an analysis for mycophenolate as a comparator, assuming equal efficacy and safety to rituximab. It assumed that mycophenolate is taken twice a day as a 500 mg tablet and stopped at 12 weeks if platelet response is not reached, or later if this response is lost. The analysis predicted that median treatment duration is 12 to 16 weeks, which is longer than the median duration of mycophenolate treatment in the UK ITP registry (exact figures are confidential and cannot be reported here). The model predicted that mycophenolate had higher total treatment costs than 100 mg rituximab at its list price, but lower than 375 mg/m2 rituximab at its list price. The ERG highlighted that this analysis is exploratory, because assuming equal efficacy of rituximab and mycophenolate is uncertain. It noted that there were lower complete and partial responses to mycophenolate in Taylor et al.  compared with responses to rituximab in Ghanima et al. The ERG emphasised that this comparison was highly uncertain because it reflects a naive comparison between 2 different studies, and Taylor et al. was a small, non-randomised, retrospective study. Clinical experts confirmed that assuming equal efficacy of mycophenolate and rituximab is uncertain. They explained that there are no head-to-head comparisons between these 2 treatments, but they expect their efficacy and safety to differ. The 2 drugs are used for different groups of people. Mycophenolate is generally well tolerated and taken as a tablet, so it does not cause infusion-related reactions. The committee agreed that mycophenolate was unlikely to have the same efficacy and safety as rituximab and this was a limitation of the exploratory analysis. It concluded that it would focus on the comparison of fostamatinib with rituximab in its decision making.\n\n【33】 # Cost-effectiveness estimates\n\n【34】 ## The most likely cost-effectiveness estimates are within what NICE normally considers an acceptable use of NHS resources\nThe company revised its base case after consultation. The committee noted that it attempted to address its preferences from the first meeting. For the rapid review, the company's revised base case included the committee's preferred assumptions from the time of the original guidance, namely:\nusing clinical effectiveness estimates for the comparators from a network meta-analysis \nstopping fostamatinib at 12 weeks if platelet response had not been reached \nmodelling subsequent treatments consistently between arms \nusing prophylactic treatments before surgery in line with clinical practice, that is, including both IVIgG and oral prednisolone \nincluding treatment-specific adverse event rates \nusing lower hazard ratios reflecting the association between the non-response health state and mortality \nmerging the partial response and response health states \nconsidering a scenario analysis with 100 mg rituximab \ncorrecting the error in the calculation of rescue treatment .For the rapid review, the committee referred to its preferred assumptions from the time of the original guidance including:\nusing both network meta-analysis 2 and 3 results \nusing both doses of rituximab used in clinical practice .The committee recognised that the lack of data increased the uncertainty with modelling chronic ITP that is refractory to other treatments. This is because there were limitations to the indirect treatment comparison and difficulty with modelling a full treatment pathway. Applying confidential discounts for fostamatinib and rituximab, and considering its preferences, the committee noted that all the cost-effectiveness estimates were within what NICE normally considers an acceptable use of NHS resources when either network meta-analysis 2 or 3 were used and when either dose of rituximab was applied.\n\n【35】 # Other factors\n\n【36】 ## Fostamatinib has a novel mechanism of action but the benefits are captured in the cost-effectiveness analysis\nThe patient and clinical experts value individualised treatment. The committee noted fostamatinib's novel mechanism of action and the lack of immunosuppression associated with it. This is important because the clinical experts highlighted that the rates of death from infection and from bleeding are similar in people with ITP. This is particularly relevant during the COVID‑19 pandemic because clinicians are being careful about using anti‑CD20 antibody treatments like rituximab which may make people more susceptible to infection. Additionally, treatment options are limited for people who cannot have TPO‑RAs. The committee concluded that while the benefits of treatment are captured in the mode. having alternative treatment options that do not suppress the immune system and could be used when TPO‑RAs are not suitable would be highly beneficial.\n\n【37】 # Conclusion\n\n【38】 ## Fostamatinib is recommended after a thrombopoietin receptor agonist or when they are not suitable\nThe committee recognised that people with refractory chronic ITP have benefited from fostamatinib and that the treatment has advantages over other available treatments. It acknowledged that fostamatinib improves outcomes compared with rituximab, but that there are uncertainties over the size of the benefit and its duration. The committee noted that fostamatinib was not compared with mycophenolate, a relevant comparator. But they acknowledged the evidence limitations which underpinned this decision. The committee considered the remaining sources of uncertainty in the model, and also the benefits of fostamatinib which may not be captured in the cost-effectiveness results. The committee concluded that the most plausible ICERs using its preferred modelling assumptions were within the range that NICE normally considers to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources. So, it recommended fostamatinib for treating refractory chronic ITP after TPO‑RAs or when they are not suitable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Common adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, headache.\n\n【3】 # Adult Indications and Dosage\n\n【4】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Adult)\n- Fluconazole Injection is indicated for the treatment of:\n- Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. In open noncomparative studies of relatively small numbers of patients, fluconazole was also effective for the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.\n- Cryptococcal meningitis. Before prescribing fluconazole for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Studies comparing fluconazole to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted.\n- Prophylaxis:\n- Fluconazole is also indicated to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.\n- Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n【5】 ### Dosage\n- Dosage and Administration in Adults:\n- Multiple Dose\n- SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF FLUCONAZOLE IS THE SAME FOR ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.\n- The daily dose of fluconazole for the treatment of infections should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.\n- Oropharyngeal candidiasis:\n- The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.\n- Esophageal candidiasis:\n- The recommended dosage of fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms.\n- Systemic Candida infections:\n- For systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia, optimal therapeutic dosage and duration of therapy have not been established. In open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients, doses of up to 400 mg daily have been used.\n- Urinary tract infections and peritonitis:\n- For the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections and peritonitis, daily doses of 50 to 200 mg have been used in open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients.\n- Cryptococcal meningitis:\n- The recommended dosage for treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis is 400 mg on the first day, followed by 200 mg once daily. A dosage of 400 mg once daily may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10 to 12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. The recommended dosage of fluconazole for suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS is 200 mg once daily.\n- Prophylaxis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation: The recommended fluconazole daily dosage for the prevention of candidiasis of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation is 400 mg, once daily. Patients who are anticipated to have severe granulocytopenia (less than 500 neutrophils per cu mm) should start Fluconazole prophylaxis several days before the anticipated onset of neutropenia, and continue for 7 days after the neutrophil count rises above 1000 cells per cu mm.\n- Dosage In Patients With Impaired RenalFunction:\n- Fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug. In patients with impaired renal function who will receive multiple doses of Fluconazole Injection, an initial loading dose of 50 to 400 mg should be given. After the loading dose, the daily dose (according to indication) should be based on the following table:\n- These are suggested dose adjustments based on pharmacokinetics following administration of multiple doses. Further adjustment may be needed depending upon clinical condition.\n- When serum creatinine is the only measure of renal function available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) should be used to estimate the creatinine clearance in adults:\n- Although the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole has not been studied in children with renal insufficiency, dosage reduction in children with renal insufficiency should parallel that recommended for adults. The following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance in children:\n\n【6】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【7】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Fluconazole (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【8】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Fluconazole (injection) in adult patients.\n\n【9】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【10】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\n- The following dose equivalency scheme should generally provide equivalent exposure in pediatric and adult patients:\n- Experience with fluconazole in neonates is limited to pharmacokinetic studies in premature newborns. Based on the prolonged half-life seen in premature newborns (gestational age 26 to 29 weeks), these children, in the first two weeks of life, should receive the same dosage (mg/kg) as in older children, but administered every 72 hours. After the first two weeks, these children should be dosed once daily. No information regarding fluconazole pharmacokinetics in full-term newborns is available.\n- Oropharyngeal candidiasis:\n- The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis in children is 6 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 3 mg/kg once daily. Treatment should be administered for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.\n- Esophageal candidiasis:\n- For the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, the recommended dosage of fluconazole in children is 6 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 3 mg/kg once daily. Doses up to 12 mg/kg/day may be used based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy.\n- Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least 2 weeks following the resolution of symptoms.\n- Systemic Candida infections:\n- For the treatment of candidemia and disseminated Candida infections, daily doses of 6 to 12 mg/kg/day have been used in an open, noncomparative study of a small number of children.\n- Cryptococcal meningitis:\n- For the treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis, the recommended dosage is 12 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 6 mg/kg once daily. A dosage of 12 mg/kg once daily may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10 to 12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. For suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in children with AIDS, the recommended dose of Fluconazole Injection is 6 mg/kg once daily.\n\n【11】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【12】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Fluconazole (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Fluconazole (injection) in pediatric patients.\n\n【14】 # Contraindications\n- Fluconazole is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to fluconazole or to any of its excipients. There is no information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between fluconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used in prescribing fluconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.\n- Coadministration of terfenadine is contraindicated in patients receiving fluconazole at multiple doses of 400 mg or higher based upon results of a multiple dose interaction study. *Coadministration of other drugs known to prolong the QT interval and which are metabolized via the enzyme CYP3A4 such as cisapride, astemizole, erythromycin, pimozide, and quinidine are contraindicated in patients receiving fluconazole.\n\n【15】 # Warnings\n- Hepatic injury:\n- Fluconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatic toxicity, including fatalities primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions. In cases of fluconazole -associated hepatotoxicity, no obvious relationship to total daily dose, duration of therapy, sex or age of the patient has been observed. Fluconazole hepatotoxicity has usually, but not always, been reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during fluconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Fluconazole should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to fluconazole.\n- Anaphylaxis:\n- In rare cases, anaphylaxis has been reported.\n- Dermatologic:\n- Exfoliative skin disorders during treatment with Fluconazole have been reported. Fatal outcomes have been reported in patients with serious underlying diseases. Patients with deep seated fungal infections who develop rashes during treatment with Fluconazole should be monitored closely and the drug discontinued if lesions progress. Fluconazole should be discontinued in patients treated for superficial fungal infection who develop a rash that may be attributed to fluconazole.\n- Use in Pregnancy:\n- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Fluconazole in pregnant women. Available human data do not suggest an increased risk of congenital anomalies following a single maternal dose of 150 mg. A few published case reports describe a rare pattern of distinct congenital anomalies in infants exposed in utero to high dose maternal fluconazole (400–800 mg/day) during most or all of the first trimester. These reported anomalies are similar to those seen in animal studies. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus\n\n【16】 ### Precautions\n- Some azoles, including fluconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes in patients taking fluconazole. Most of these reports involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as structural heart disease, electrolyte abnormalities and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Fluconazole should be administered with caution to patients with these potentially proarrhythmic conditions.\n- Concomitant use of fluconazole and erythromycin has the potential to increase the risk of cardiotoxicity (prolonged QT interval, torsade de pointes) and consequently sudden heart death. This combination should be avoided.\n- Fluconazole should be administered with caution to patients with renal dysfunction.\n- Fluconazole is a potent CYP2C9 inhibitor and a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. Fluconazole treated patients who are concomitantly treated with drugs with a narrow therapeutic window metabolized through CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 should be monitored.\n\n【17】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【18】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Fluconazole is generally well tolerated.\n- In some patients, particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as AIDS and cancer, changes in renal and hematological function test results and hepatic abnormalities have been observed during treatment with fluconazole and comparative agents, but the clinical significance and relationship to treatment is uncertain.\n- In Patients Receiving Multiple Doses for Other Infections:\n- Sixteen percent of over 4000 patients treated with fluconazole in clinical trials of 7 days or more experienced adverse events. Treatment was discontinued in 1.5% of patients due to adverse clinical events and in 1.3% of patients due to laboratory test abnormalities.\n- Clinical adverse events were reported more frequently in HIV infected patients (21%) than in non-HIV infected patients (13%); however, the patterns in HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients were similar. The proportions of patients discontinuing therapy due to clinical adverse events were similar in the two groups (1.5%).\n- The following treatment-related clinical adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in 4048 patients receiving fluconazole for 7 or more days in clinical trials: nausea 3.7%, headache 1.9%, skin rash 1.8%, vomiting 1.7%, abdominal pain 1.7%, and diarrhea 1.5%.\n- Hepatobiliary:\n- In combined clinical trials and marketing experience, there have been rare cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with fluconazole.  The spectrum of these hepatic reactions has ranged from mild transient elevations in transaminases to clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities. Instances of fatal hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly AIDS or malignancy) and often while taking multiple concomitant medications. Transient hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. In each of these cases, liver function returned to baseline on discontinuation of fluconazole.\n- In two comparative trials evaluating the efficacy of fluconazole for the suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis, a statistically significant increase was observed in median AST (SGOT) levels from a baseline value of 30 IU/L to 41 IU/L in one trial and 34 IU/L to 66 IU/L in the other. The overall rate of serum transaminase elevations of more than 8 times the upper limit of normal was approximately 1% in fluconazole-treated patients in clinical trials. These elevations occurred in patients with severe underlying disease, predominantly AIDS or malignancies, most of whom were receiving multiple concomitant medications, including many known to be hepatotoxic. The incidence of abnormally elevated serum transaminases was greater in patients taking fluconazole concomitantly with one or more of the following medications: rifampin, phenytoin, isoniazid, valproic acid, or oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents.\n\n【19】 ### Adverse Reactions in Children:\n- The pattern and incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities recorded during pediatric clinical trials are comparable to those seen in adults.\n- In Phase II/III clinical trials conducted in the United States and in Europe, 577 pediatric patients, ages 1 day to 17 years were treated with fluconazole at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day for up to 1,616 days. Thirteen percent of children experienced treatment related adverse events. The most commonly reported events were vomiting (5%), abdominal pain (3%), nausea (2%), and diarrhea (2%). Treatment was discontinued in 2.3% of patients due to adverse clinical events and in 1.4% of patients due to laboratory test abnormalities. The majority of treatment-related laboratory abnormalities were elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase.\n\n【20】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- In addition, the following adverse events have occurred during postmarketing experience.\n- Immunologic: In rare cases, anaphylaxis (including angioedema, face edema and pruritus) has been reported.\n- Body as a Whole: Asthenia, fatigue, fever, malaise.\n- Cardiovascular: QT prolongation, torsade de pointes.\n- Central Nervous System: Seizures, dizziness.\n- Dermatologic: Exfoliative skin disorders including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysi. alopecia.\n- Hematopoietic and Lymphatic: Leukopenia, including neutropenia and agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia.\n- Metabolic: Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypokalemia.\n- Gastrointestinal: Cholestasis, dry mouth, hepatocellular damage, dyspepsia, vomiting.\n- Other Senses: Taste perversion.\n- Musculoskeletal System: myalgia.\n- Nervous System: Insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, tremor, vertigo.\n- Skin and Appendages: Acute generalized exanthematous-pustulosis, drug eruption, increased sweating, exfoliative skin disorders including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysi. alopecia.\n\n【21】 # Drug Interactions\n- Clinically or potentially significant drug interactions between fluconazole and the following agents/classes have been observed. These are described in greater detail below:\n- Oral hypoglycemics\n- Coumarin-type anticoagulants\n- Phenytoin\n- Cyclosporine\n- Rifampin\n- Theophylline\n- Terfenadine\n- Cisapride\n- Astemizole\n- Voriconazole\n- Tacrolimus\n- Short-acting benzodiazepines\n- Tofacitinib\n- Triazolam\n- Oral Contraceptives\n- Pimozide\n- Quinidine\n- Hydrochlorothiazide\n- Alfentanil\n- Amitriptyline, nortriptyline\n- Amphotericin B\n- Azithromycin\n- Carbamazepine\n- Calcium Channel Blockers\n- Celecoxib\n- Cyclophosphamide\n- Fentanyl\n- Halofantrine\n- HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors\n- Losartan\n- Methadone\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n- Prednisone\n- Saquinavir\n- Sirolimus\n- Vinca Alkaloids\n- Vitamin A\n- Zidovudine\n- Clinically significant hypoglycemia may be precipitated by the use of fluconazole with oral hypoglycemic agents; one fatality has been reported from hypoglycemia in association with combined fluconazole and glyburide use. Fluconazole reduces the metabolism of tolbutamide, glyburide, and glipizide and increases the plasma concentration of these agents. When fluconazole is used concomitantly with these or other sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents, blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and the dose of the sulfonylurea should be adjusted as necessary.\n- Prothrombin time may be increased in patients receiving concomitant fluconazole and coumarin-type anticoagulants. In post-marketing experience, as with other azole antifungals, bleeding events (bruising, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and melena) have been reported in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving fluconazole concurrently with warfarin. Careful monitoring of prothrombin time in patients receiving fluconazole and coumarin-type anticoagulants is recommended. Dose adjustment of warfarin may be necessary.\n- Fluconazole increases the plasma concentrations of phenytoin. Careful monitoring of phenytoin concentrations in patients receiving fluconazole and phenytoin is recommended.\n- Fluconazole may significantly increase cyclosporine levels in renal transplant patients with or without renal impairment. Careful monitoring of cyclosporine concentrations and serum creatinine is recommended in patients receiving fluconazole and cyclosporine.  This combination may be used by reducing the dosage of cyclosporine depending on cyclosporine concentration.\n- Rifampin enhances the metabolism of concurrently administered fluconazole. Depending on clinical circumstances, consideration should be given to increasing the dose of fluconazole when it is administered with rifampin.\n- Fluconazole increases the serum concentrations of theophylline. Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving fluconazole and theophylline is recommended.\n- Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine, interaction studies have been performed. One study at a 200-mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval. Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that fluconazole taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly. The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated. The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored.\n- There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered. A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval. The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated.\n- Concomitant administration of fluconazole with astemizole may decrease the clearance of astemizole. Resulting increased plasma concentrations of astemizole can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsade de pointes. Coadministration of fluconazole and astemizole is contraindicated.\n- Rifabutin:\n- There have been reports that an interaction exists when fluconazole is administered concomitantly with rifabutin, leading to increased serum levels of rifabutin up to 80%. There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered. Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored.\n- Avoid concomitant administration of voriconazole and fluconazole. Monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to voriconazole is recommended; especially, if voriconazole is started within 24 h after the last dose of fluconazole.\n- Fluconazole may increase the serum concentrations of orally administered tacrolimus up to 5 times due to inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism through CYP3A4 in the intestines. No significant pharmacokinetic changes have been observed when tacrolimus is given intravenously. Increased tacrolimus levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. Dosage of orally administered tacrolimus should be decreased depending on tacrolimus concentration.\n- Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects. This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously. If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored.\n- Systemic exposure to tofacitinib is increased when tofacitinib is coadministered with fluconazole, a combined moderate CYP3A4 and potent CYP2C19 inhibitor. Reduce the dose of tofacitinib when given concomitantly with fluconazole (i.e., from 5 mg twice daily to 5 mg once daily as instructed in the XELJANZ  label).\n- Fluconazole increases the AUC of triazolam (single dose) by approximately 50%, Cmax by 20–32%, and increases t½ by 25–50 % due to the inhibition of metabolism of triazolam. Dosage adjustments of triazolam may be necessary.\n- Two pharmacokinetic studies with a combined oral contraceptive have been performed using multiple doses of fluconazole. There were no relevant effects on hormone level in the 50 mg fluconazole study, while at 200 mg daily, the AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were increased 40% and 24%, respectively. Thus, multiple dose use of fluconazole at these doses is unlikely to have an effect on the efficacy of the combined oral contraceptive.\n- Although not studied in vitro or in vivo, concomitant administration of fluconazole with pimozide may result in inhibition of pimozide metabolism. Increased pimozide plasma concentrations can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsade de pointes. Coadministration of fluconazole and pimozide is contraindicated.\n- Although not studied in vitro or in vivo, concomitant administration of fluconazole with quinidine may result in inhibition of quinidine metabolism. Use of quinidine has been associated with QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes. Coadministration of fluconazole and quinidine is contraindicated.\n- In a pharmacokinetic interaction study, coadministration of multiple dose hydrochlorothiazide to healthy volunteers receiving fluconazole increased plasma concentrations of fluconazole by 40%. An effect of this magnitude should not necessitate a change in the fluconazole dose regimen in subjects receiving concomitant diuretics.\n- A study observed a reduction in clearance and distribution volume as well as prolongation of T½ of alfentanil following concomitant treatment with fluconazole. A possible mechanism of action is fluconazole's inhibition of CYP3A4. Dosage adjustment of alfentanil may be necessary.\n- Fluconazole increases the effect of amitriptyline and nortriptyline. 5- nortriptyline and/or S-amitriptyline may be measured at initiation of the combination therapy and after one week. Dosage of amitriptyline/nortriptyline should be adjusted, if necessary.\n- Concurrent administration of fluconazole and amphotericin B in infected normal and immunosuppressed mice showed the following results: a small additive antifungal effect in systemic infection with C. albicans, no interaction in intracranial infection with Cryptococcus neoformans, and antagonism of the two drugs in systemic infection with A. fumigatus. The clinical significance of results obtained in these studies is unknown.\n- An open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study in 18 healthy subjects assessed the effect of a single 1200 mg oral dose of azithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 800 mg oral dose of fluconazole as well as the effects of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin. There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between fluconazole and azithromycin.\n- Fluconazole inhibits the metabolism of carbamazepine and an increase in serum carbamazepine of 30% has been observed. There is a risk of developing carbamazepine toxicity. Dosage adjustment of carbamazepine may be necessary depending on concentration measurements/effect.\n- Certain dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (nifedipine, isradipine, amlodipine, and felodipine) are metabolized by CYP3A4. Fluconazole has the potential to increase the systemic exposure of the calcium channel antagonists. Frequent monitoring for adverse events is recommended.\n- During concomitant treatment with fluconazole (200 mg daily) and celecoxib (200 mg), the celecoxib Cmax and AUC increased by 68% and 134%, respectively. Half of the celecoxib dose may be necessary when combined with fluconazole.\n- Combination therapy with cyclophosphamide and fluconazole results in an increase in serum bilirubin and serum creatinine. The combination may be used while taking increased consideration to the risk of increased serum bilirubin and serum creatinine.\n- One fatal case of possible fentanyl fluconazole interaction was reported. The author judged that the patient died from fentanyl intoxication. Furthermore, in a randomized crossover study with 12 healthy volunteers it was shown that fluconazole delayed the elimination of fentanyl significantly. Elevated fentanyl concentration may lead to respiratory depression.\n- Fluconazole can increase halofantrine plasma concentration due to an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4.\n- The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis increases when fluconazole is coadministered with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors metabolized through CYP3A4, such as atorvastatin and simvastatin, or through CYP2C9, such as fluvastatin. If concomitant therapy is necessary, the patient should be observed for symptoms of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis and creatinine kinase should be monitored. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be discontinued if a marked increase in creatinine kinase is observed or myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is diagnosed or suspected.\n- Fluconazole inhibits the metabolism of losartan to its active metabolite (E-31 74) which is responsible for most of the angiotensin Il-receptor antagonism which occurs during treatment with losartan. Patients should have their blood pressure monitored continuously.\n- Fluconazole may enhance the serum concentration of methadone. Dosage adjustment of methadone may be necessary.\n- The Cmax and AUC of flurbiprofen were increased by 23% and 81%, respectively, when coadministered with fluconazole compared to administration of flurbiprofen alone. Similarly, the Cmax and AUC of the pharmacologically active isomer  were increased by 15% and 82%, respectively, when fluconazole was coadministered with racemic ibuprofen (400 mg) compared to administration of racemic ibuprofen alone.\n- Although not specifically studied, fluconazole has the potential to increase the systemic exposure of other NSAIDs that are metabolized by CYP2C9 (e.g., naproxen, lornoxicam, meloxicam, diclofenac). Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to NSAIDs is recommended. Adjustment of dosage of NSAIDs may be needed.\n- There was a case report that a liver-transplanted patient treated with prednisone developed acute adrenal cortex insufficiency when a three month therapy with fluconazole was discontinued. The discontinuation of fluconazole presumably caused an enhanced CYP3A4 activity which led to increased metabolism of prednisone. Patients on long-term treatment with fluconazole and prednisone should be carefully monitored for adrenal cortex insufficiency when fluconazole is discontinued.\n- Fluconazole increases the AUC of saquinavir by approximately 50%, Cmax by approximately 55%, and decreases clearance of saquinavir by approximately 50% due to inhibition of saquinavir's hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 and inhibition of P-glycoprotein. Dosage adjustment of saquinavir may be necessary.\n- Fluconazole increases plasma concentrations of sirolimus presumably by inhibiting the metabolism of sirolimus via CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. This combination may be used with a dosage adjustment of sirolimus depending on the effect/concentration measurements.\n- Although not studied, fluconazole may increase the plasma levels of the vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine) and lead to neurotoxicity, which is possibly due to an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4.\n- Based on a case report in one patient receiving combination therapy with all-trans-retinoid acid (an acid form of vitamin A) and fluconazole, CNS related undesirable effects have developed in the form of pseudotumour cerebri, which disappeared after discontinuation of fluconazole treatment. This combination may be used but the incidence of CNS related undesirable effects should be borne in mind.\n- Fluconazole increases Cmax and AUC of zidovudine by 84% and 74%, respectively, due to an approximately 45% decrease in oral zidovudine clearance. The half-life of zidovudine was likewise prolonged by approximately 128% following combination therapy with fluconazole. Patients receiving this combination should be monitored for the development of zidovudine-related adverse reactions. Dosage reduction of zidovudine may be considered.\n- Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not been conducted, but such interactions may occur.\n\n【22】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【23】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): D\n- All other indications:\n- A few published case reports describe a rare pattern of distinct congenital anomalies in infants exposed in utero to high dose maternal fluconazole (400–800 mg/day) during most or all of the first trimester. These reported anomalies are similar to those seen in animal studies. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus.\n- Human Data\n- Several published epidemiologic studies do not suggest an increased risk of congenital anomalies associated with low dose exposure to fluconazole in pregnancy (most subjects received a single oral dose of 150 mg). A few published case reports describe a distinctive and rare pattern of birth defects among infants whose mothers received high-dose (400–800 mg/day) fluconazole during most or all of the first trimester of pregnancy. The features seen in these infants include: brachycephaly, abnormal facies, abnormal calvarial development, cleft palate, femoral bowing, thin ribs and long bones, arthrogryposis, and congenital heart disease. These effects are similar to those seen in animal studies.\n- Animal Data\n- Fluconazole was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis in two studies at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg and at 5, 25, and 75 mg/kg, respectively. Maternal weight gain was impaired at all dose levels (approximately 0.25 to 4 times the 400 mg clinical dose based on BSA), and abortions occurred at 75 mg/kg (approximately 4 times the 400 mg clinical dose based on BSA); no adverse fetal effects were observed.\n- In several studies in which pregnant rats received fluconazole orally during organogenesis, maternal weight gain was impaired and placental weights were increased at 25 mg/kg. There were no fetal effects at 5 or 10 mg/kg; increases in fetal anatomical variants (supernumerary ribs, renal pelvis dilation) and delays in ossification were observed at 25 and 50 mg/kg and higher doses. At doses ranging from 80 to 320 mg/kg (approximately 2 to 8 times the 400 mg clinical dose based on BSA), embryolethality in rats was increased and fetal abnormalities included wavy ribs, cleft palate, and abnormal cranio-facial ossification. These effects are consistent with the inhibition of estrogen synthesis in rats and may be a result of known effects of lowered estrogen on pregnancy, organogenesis, and parturition\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Fluconazole (injection) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【24】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThere is no FDA guidance on use of Fluconazole (injection) during labor and delivery.\n\n【25】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Fluconazole is secreted in human milk at concentrations similar to plasma concentrations. Caution should be exercised when Fluconazole is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【26】 ### Pediatric Use\n- An open-label, randomized, controlled trial has shown fluconazole to be effective in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in children 6 months to 13 years of age.\n- The use of fluconazole in children with cryptococcal meningitis, Candida esophagitis, or systemic Candida infections is supported by the efficacy shown for these indications in adults and by the results from several small noncomparative pediatric clinical studies. In addition, pharmacokinetic studies in children  have established a dose proportionality between children and adults.\n- In a noncomparative study of children with serious systemic fungal infections, most of which were candidemia, the effectiveness of fluconazole was similar to that reported for the treatment of candidemia in adults. Of 17 subjects with culture-confirmed candidemia, 11 of 14 (79%) with baseline symptoms (3 were asymptomatic) had a clinical cure; 13/15 (87%) of evaluable patients had a mycologic cure at the end of treatment but two of these patients relapsed at 10 and 18 days, respectively, following cessation of therapy.\n- The efficacy of fluconazole for the suppression of cryptococcal meningitis was successful in 4 of 5 children treated in a compassionate-use study of fluconazole for the treatment of life-threatening or serious mycosis. There is no information regarding the efficacy of fluconazole for primary treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in children.\n- The safety profile of fluconazole in children has been studied in 577 children ages 1 day to 17 years who received doses ranging from 1 to 15 mg/kg/day for 1 to 1,616 days.\n- Efficacy of fluconazole has not been established in infants less than 6 months of age.  A small number of patients  ranging in age from 1 day to 6 months have been treated safely with fluconazole.\n\n【27】 ### Geriatic Use\n- In non-AIDS patients, side effects possibly related to fluconazole treatment were reported in fewer patients aged 65 and older (9%, n =339) than for younger patients (14%, n=2240). However, there was no consistent difference between the older and younger patients with respect to individual side effects. Of the most frequently reported (>1%) side effects, rash, vomiting and diarrhea occurred in greater proportions of older patients. Similar proportions of older patients (2.4%) and younger patients (1.5%) discontinued fluconazole therapy because of side effects. In post-marketing experience, spontaneous reports of anemia and acute renal failure were more frequent among patients 65 years of age or older than in those between 12 and 65 years of age. Because of the voluntary nature of the reports and the natural increase in the incidence of anemia and renal failure in the elderly, it is however not possible to establish a casual relationship to drug exposure.\n- Controlled clinical trials of fluconazole did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to evaluate whether they respond differently from younger patients in each indication. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.\n- Fluconazole is primarily cleared by renal excretion as unchanged drug. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken to adjust dose based on creatinine clearance. It may be useful to monitor renal function.\n\n【28】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Fluconazole (injection) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【29】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Fluconazole (injection) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【30】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Fluconazole (injection) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【31】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Fluconazole (injection) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【32】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Fluconazole (injection) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【33】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Fluconazole (injection) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【34】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【35】 ### Administration\n- Fluconazole may be administered either orally or by intravenous infusion. Fluconazole injection has been used safely for up to fourteen days of intravenous therapy. The intravenous infusion of fluconazole should be administered at a maximum rate of approximately 200 mg/hour, given as a continuous infusion.\n- Fluconazole injections in glass and plastic containers are intended only for intravenous administration using sterile equipment.\n- Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.\n- Do not use if the solution is cloudy or precipitated or if the seal is not intact.\n- Directions for IV Use of Fluconazole in Plastic Containers:\n- Do not remove unit from overwrap until ready for use. The overwrap is a moisture barrier. The inner bag maintains the sterility of the product.\n- CAUTION: Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed.\n- To Open:\n- Tear overwrap down side at slit and remove solution container. Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed. This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety. The opacity will diminish gradually. After removing overwrap, check for minute leaks by squeezing inner bag firmly. If leaks are found, discard solution as sterility may be impaired.\n- DO NOT ADD SUPPLEMENTARY MEDICATION\n- Suspend container from eyelet support.\n- Remove plastic protector from outlet port at bottom of container.\n- Attach administration set. \n\n【36】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Monitoring of Fluconazole (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【37】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Fluconazole (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【38】 # Overdosage\n- There have been reports of overdose with fluconazole accompanied by hallucination and paranoid behavior.\n- In the event of overdose, symptomatic treatment (with supportive measures and gastric lavage if clinically indicated) should be instituted.\n- Fluconazole is largely excreted in urine. A three-hour hemodialysis session decreases plasma levels by approximately 50%.\n- In mice and rats receiving very high doses of fluconazole, clinical effects in both species included decreased motility and respiration, ptosis, lacrimation, salivation, urinary incontinence, loss of righting reflex and cyanosis; death was sometimes preceded by clonic convulsions.\n\n【39】 # Pharmacology\n\n【40】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Fluconazole is a highly selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-α-demethylase. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The subsequent loss of normal sterols correlates with the accumulation of 14-α-methyl sterols in fungi and may be responsible for the fungistatic activity of fluconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is much less sensitive to fluconazole inhibition.\n- Fluconazole resistance may arise from a modification in the quality or quantity of the target enzyme (lanosterol 14-α-demethylase), reduced access to the drug target, or some combination of these mechanisms. Point mutations in the gene (ERG11) encoding for the target enzyme lead to an altered target with decreased affinity for azoles. Overexpression of ERG11 results in the production of high concentrations of the target enzyme, creating the need for higher intracellular drug concentrations to inhibit all of the enzyme molecules in the cell.\n- The second major mechanism of drug resistance involves active efflux of fluconazole out of the cell through the activation of two types of multidrug efflux transporters; the major facilitators (encoded by MDR genes) and those of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (encoded by CDR genes). Upregulation of the MDR gene leads to fluconazole resistance, whereas, upregulation of CDR genes may lead to resistance to multiple azoles.\n- Resistance in Candida glabrata usually includes upregulation of CDR genes resulting in resistance to multiple azoles. For an isolate where the MIC is categorized as Intermediate (16 to 32 µg/mL), the highest fluconazole dose is recommended.\n- Candida krusei should be considered to be resistant to fluconazole. Resistance in C. krusei appears to be mediated by reduced sensitivity of the target enzyme to inhibition by the agent.\n- There have been reports of cases of superinfection with Candida species other than C. albicans, which are often inherently not susceptible to Fluconazole (e.g., Candida krusei). Such cases may require alternative antifungal therapy.\n- Activity In Vitro and In Clinical Infections\n- Fluconazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections.\n- Candida albicans\n- Candida glabrata (Many strains are intermediately susceptible)\n- Candida parapsilosis\n- Cryptococcus neoformans\n- In a majority of the studies, fluconazole MIC90 values against C. For resistant isolates alternative therapy is recommended.\n- The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.\n- Fluconazole exhibits in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC values) of 8 μg/mL or less against most (≥90%) strains of the following microorganisms, however, the safety and effectiveness of fluconazole in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well controlled trials.\n- Candida dubliniensis\n- Candida guilliermondii\n- Candida kefyr\nSusceptibility Testing Methods\n- Candida species:\n- Broth Dilution Techniques:\n- Quantitative methods are used to determine antifungal minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs).\n- Diffusion Techniques:\n- Qualitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of Candida spp.\n- The susceptible category implies that isolates are inhibited by the usually achievable concentrations of antifungal agent tested when the recommended dosage is used. The intermediate category implies that an infection due to the isolate may be appropriately treated in body sites where the drugs are physiologically concentrated or when a high dosage of drug is used. The resistant category implies that isolates are not inhibited by the usually achievable concentrations of the agent with normal dosage schedules and clinical efficacy of the agent against the isolate has not been reliably shown in treatment studies.\n- Quality Control\n- Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of quality control organisms to control the technical aspects of the test procedures.\nNOTE: Quality control microorganisms are specific strains of organisms with intrinsic biological properties relating to resistance mechanisms and their genetic expression within fungi; the specific strains used for microbiological control are not clinically significant.\n\n【41】 ## Structure\n- Fluconazole, the first of a new subclass of synthetic triazole antifungal agents, is available as a sterile solution for intravenous use in glass and in plastic containers.\n- Fluconazole is designated chemically as 2,4-difluoro-α,α1-bis(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl) benzyl alcohol with an empirical formula of C13H12F2N6O and molecular weight 306.3. The structural formula is:\n- Fluconazole is a white crystalline solid which is slightly soluble in water and saline.\n- Fluconazole injection is an iso-osmotic, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of fluconazole in a sodium chloride or dextrose diluent. Each mL contains 2 mg of fluconazole and 9 mg of sodium chloride or 56 mg of dextrose, hydrous. The pH ranges from 4.0 to 8.0 in the sodium chloride diluent and from 3.5 to 6.5 in the dextrose diluent. Injection volumes of 100 mL and 200 mL are packaged in glass and in plastic containers\n- The plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride. The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period, e.g., di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), up to 5 parts per million. However, the suitability of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies.\n\n【42】 ## Pharmacodynamics\nThere is limited information regarding Pharmacodynamics of Fluconazole (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【43】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism:\n- The pharmacokinetic properties of fluconazole are similar following administration by the intravenous or oral routes. In normal volunteers, the bioavailability of orally administered fluconazole is over 90% compared with intravenous administration. Bioequivalence was established between the 100 mg tablet and both suspension strengths when administered as a single 200 mg dose.\n- Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) in fasted normal volunteers occur between 1 and 2 hours with a terminal plasma elimination half-life of approximately 30 hours (range: 20 to 50 hours) after oral administration.\n- In fasted normal volunteers, administration of a single oral 400 mg dose of fluconazole leads to a mean Cmax of 6.72 μg/mL (range: 4.12 to 8.08 μg/mL) and after single oral doses of 50 to 400 mg, fluconazole plasma concentrations and AUC (area under the plasma concentration-time curve) are dose proportional.\n- The Cmax and AUC data from a food-effect study involving administration of Fluconazole tablets to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that exposure to the drug is not affected by food. Therefore, Fluconazole may be taken without regard to meals.\n- Administration of a single oral 150 mg tablet of fluconazole to ten lactating women resulted in a mean Cmax of 2.61 μg/mL (range: 1.57 to 3.65 μg/mL).\n- Steady-state concentrations are reached within 5 to 10 days following oral doses of 50 to 400 mg given once daily. Administration of a loading dose (on day 1) of twice the usual daily dose results in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day. The apparent volume of distribution of fluconazole approximates that of total body water. Plasma protein binding is low (11 to 12%).\n- Following either single-or multiple-oral doses for up to 14 days, fluconazole penetrates into all body fluids studied . In normal volunteers, saliva concentrations of fluconazole were equal to or slightly greater than plasma concentrations regardless of dose, route, or duration of dosing. In patients with bronchiectasis, sputum concentrations of fluconazole following a single 150 mg oral dose were equal to plasma concentrations at both 4 and 24 hours post dose. In patients with fungal meningitis, fluconazole concentrations in the CSF are approximately 80% of the corresponding plasma concentrations.\n- A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 27 patients penetrated into vaginal tissue, resulting in tissue: plasma ratios ranging from 0.94 to 1.14 over the first 48 hours following dosing.\n- In normal volunteers, fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion, with approximately 80% of the administered dose appearing in the urine as unchanged drug. About 11% of the dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites.\n- The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are markedly affected by reduction in renal function. There is an inverse relationship between the elimination half-life and creatinine clearance. The dose of fluconazole may need to be reduced in patients with impaired renal function.  A 3-hour hemodialysis session decreases plasma concentrations by approximately 50%.\n- In normal volunteers, fluconazole administration (doses ranging from 200 mg to 400 mg once daily for up to 14 days) was associated with small and inconsistent effects on testosterone concentrations, endogenous corticosteroid concentrations, and the ACTH-stimulated cortisol response.\n- In children, the following pharmacokinetic data {Mean (%cv)} have been reported:\n- Clearance corrected for body weight was not affected by age in these studies. Mean body clearance in adults is reported to be 0.23 (17%) mL/min/kg.\n- In premature newborns (gestational age 26 to 29 weeks), the mean (%cv) clearance within 36 hours of birth was 0.180 (35%, N=7) mL/min/kg, which increased with time to a mean of 0.218 (31%, N=9) mL/min/kg six days later and 0.333 (56%, N=4) mL/min/kg 12 days later. Similarly, the half-life was 73.6 hours, which decreased with time to a mean of 53.2 hours six days later and 46.6 hours 12 days later.\n- A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 22 subjects, 65 years of age or older receiving a single 50 mg oral dose of fluconazole. Ten of these patients were concomitantly receiving diuretics. The Cmaxwas 1.54 mcg/mL and occurred at 1.3 hours post dose. The mean AUC was 76.4+ 20.3 mcg∙h/mL, and the mean terminal half-life was 46.2 hours. These pharmacokinetic parameter values are higher than analogous values reported for normal young male volunteers. Coadministration of diuretics did not significantly alter AUC or Cmax. In addition, creatinine clearance (74 mL/min), the percent of drug recovered unchanged in urine (0 to 24 hr, 22%) and the fluconazole renal clearance estimates (0.124 mL/min/kg) for the elderly were generally lower than those of younger volunteers. Thus, the alteration of fluconazole disposition in the elderly appears to be related to reduced renal function characteristic of this group.\n- A plot of each subject's terminal elimination half-life versus creatinine clearance compared with the predicted half-life – creatinine clearance curve derived from normal subjects and subjects with varying degrees of renal insufficiency indicated that 21 of 22 subjects fell within the 95% confidence limit of the predicted half-life – creatinine clearance curves. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that higher values for the pharmacokinetic parameters observed in the elderly subjects compared with normal young male volunteers are due to the decreased kidney function that is expected in the elderly.\n- Oral contraceptives:\n- Oral contraceptives were administered as a single dose both before and after the oral administration of fluconazole 50 mg once daily for 10 days in 10 healthy women. There was no significant difference in ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel AUC after the administration of 50 mg of fluconazole. The mean increase in ethinyl estradiol AUC was 6% (range: –47 to 108%) and levonorgestrel AUC increased 17% (range: –33 to 141%).\n- In a second study, twenty-five normal females received daily doses of both 200 mg fluconazole tablets or placebo for two, ten-day periods. The treatment cycles were one month apart with all subjects receiving fluconazole during one cycle and placebo during the other. The order of study treatment was random. Single doses of an oral contraceptive tablet containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol were administered on the final treatment day (day 10) of both cycles. Following administration of 200 mg of fluconazole, the mean percentage increase of AUC for levonorgestrel compared to placebo was 25% (range: -12 to 82%) and the mean percentage increase for ethinyl estradiol compared to placebo was 38% (range: -11 to 101%). Both of these increases were statistically significantly different from placebo.\n- A third study evaluated the potential interaction of once weekly dosing of fluconazole 300 mg to 21 normal females taking an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone. In this placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover study carried out over three cycles of oral contraceptive treatment, fluconazole dosing resulted in small increases in the mean AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone compared to similar placebo dosing. The mean AUCs of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone increased by 24% (95% C.I. range 18 to 31%) and 13% (95% C.I. range 8 to 18%), respectively relative to placebo. Fluconazole treatment did not cause a decrease in the ethinyl estradiol AUC of any individual subject in this study compared to placebo dosing. The individual AUC individual values of norethindrone decreased very slightly (<5%) in 3 of the 21 subjects after fluconazole treatment.\n- Cimetidine:\n- Fluconazole 100 mg was administered as a single oral dose alone and two hours after a single dose of cimetidine 400 mg to six healthy male volunteers. After the administration of cimetidine, there was a significant decrease in fluconazole AUC and Cmax. There was a mean ± SD decrease in fluconazole AUC of 13% ± 11% (range: –3.4 to –31%) and Cmax decreased 19% ± 14% (range: –5 to –40%). However, the administration of cimetidine 600 mg to 900 mg intravenously over a four-hour period (from one hour before to 3 hours after a single oral dose of fluconazole 200 mg) did not affect the bioavailability or pharmacokinetics of fluconazole in 24 healthy male volunteers.\n- Antacid:\n- Administration of Maalox (20 mL) to 14 normal male volunteers immediately prior to a single dose of fluconazole 100 mg had no effect on the absorption or elimination of fluconazole.\n- Hydrochlorothiazide:\n- Concomitant oral administration of 100 mg fluconazole and 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide for 10 days in 13 normal volunteers resulted in a significant increase in fluconazole AUC and Cmax compared to fluconazole given alone. There was a mean ± SD increase in fluconazole AUC and Cmax of 45% ± 31% (range: 19 to 114%) and 43% ± 31% (range: 19 to 122%), respectively. These changes are attributed to a mean ± SD reduction in renal clearance of 30% ± 12% (range: –10 to –50%).\n- Rifampin:\n- Administration of a single oral 200 mg dose of fluconazole after 15 days of rifampin administered as 600 mg daily in eight healthy male volunteers resulted in a significant decrease in fluconazole AUC and a significant increase in apparent oral clearance of fluconazole. There was a mean ± SD reduction in fluconazole AUC of 23% ± 9% (range: –13 to –42%). Apparent oral clearance of fluconazole increased 32% ± 17% (range: 16 to 72%). Fluconazole half-life decreased from 33.4 ± 4.4 hours to 26.8 ± 3.9 hours\n- Warfarin:\n- There was a significant increase in prothrombin time response (area under the prothrombin time-time curve) following a single dose of warfarin (15 mg) administered to 13 normal male volunteers following oral fluconazole 200 mg administered daily for 14 days as compared to the administration of warfarin alone. There was a mean ± SD increase in the prothrombin time response (area under the prothrombin time-time curve) of 7% ± 4% (range: –2 to 13%).  Mean is based on data from 12 subjects as one of 13 subjects experienced a 2-fold increase in his prothrombin time response.\n- Phenytoin:\n- Phenytoin AUC was determined after 4 days of phenytoin dosing (200 mg daily, orally for 3 days followed by 250 mg intravenously for one dose) both with and without the administration of fluconazole (oral fluconazole 200 mg daily for 16 days) in 10 normal male volunteers. There was a significant increase in phenytoin AUC. The mean ± SD increase in phenytoin AUC was 88% ± 68% (range: 16 to 247%). The absolute magnitude of this interaction is unknown because of the intrinsically nonlinear disposition of phenytoin.\n- Cyclosporine:\n- Cyclosporine AUC and Cmax were determined before and after the administration of fluconazole 200 mg daily for 14 days in eight renal transplant patients who had been on cyclosporine therapy for at least 6 months and on a stable cyclosporine dose for at least 6 weeks. There was a significant increase in cyclosporine AUC, Cmax, Cmin (24-hour concentration), and a significant reduction in apparent oral clearance following the administration of fluconazole. The mean ± SD increase in AUC was 92% ± 43% (range: 18 to 147%). The Cmax increased 60% ± 48% (range: –5 to 133%). The Cmin increased 157% ± 96% (range: 33 to 360%). The apparent oral clearance decreased 45% ± 15% (range: –15 to –60%).\n- Zidovudine:\n- Plasma zidovudine concentrations were determined on two occasions (before and following fluconazole 200 mg daily for 15 days) in 13 volunteers with AIDS or ARC who were on a stable zidovudine dose for at least two weeks. There was a significant increase in zidovudine AUC following the administration of fluconazole. The mean ± SD increase in AUC was 20% ± 32% (range: –27 to 104%). The metabolite, GZDV, to parent drug ratio significantly decreased after the administration of fluconazole, from 7.6 ± 3.6 to 5.7 ± 2.2.\n- Theophylline:\n- The pharmacokinetics of theophylline were determined from a single intravenous dose of aminophylline (6 mg/kg) before and after the oral administration of fluconazole 200 mg daily for 14 days in 16 normal male volunteers. There were significant increases in theophylline AUC, Cmax, and half-life with a corresponding decrease in clearance. The mean ± SD theophylline AUC increased 21% ± 16% (range: –5 to 48%). The Cmax increased 13% ± 17% (range: –13 to 40%). Theophylline clearance decreased 16% ± 11% (range: –32 to 5%). The half-life of theophylline increased from 6.6 ± 1.7 hours to 7.9 ± 1.5 hours.\n- Terfenadine:\n- Six healthy volunteers received terfenadine 60 mg BID for 15 days. Fluconazole 200 mg was administered daily from days 9 through 15. Fluconazole did not affect terfenadine plasma concentrations. Terfenadine acid metabolite AUC increased 36% ± 36% (range: 7 to 102%) from day 8 to day 15 with the concomitant administration of fluconazole. There was no change in cardiac repolarization as measured by Holter QTc intervals. Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that fluconazole taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly.\n- Quinidine:\n- Although not studied in vitro or in vivo, concomitant administration of fluconazole with quinidine may result in inhibition of quinidine metabolism. Use of quinidine has been associated with QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes. Coadministration of fluconazole and quinidine is contraindicated.\n- Oral hypoglycemics:\n- The effects of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of the sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents tolbutamide, glipizide, and glyburide were evaluated in three placebo-controlled studies in normal volunteers. All subjects received the sulfonylurea alone as a single dose and again as a single dose following the administration of fluconazole 100 mg daily for 7 days. In these three studies 22/46 (47.8%) of fluconazole treated patients and 9/22 (40.1%) of placebo-treated patients experienced symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia.\n- Tolbutamide:\n- In 13 normal male volunteers, there was significant increase in tolbutamide (500 mg single dose) AUC and Cmax following the administration of fluconazole. There was a mean ± SD increase in tolbutamide AUC of 26% ± 9% (range: 12 to 39%). Tolbutamide Cmax increased 11% ± 9% (range: –6 to 27%).\n- Glipizide:\n- The AUC and Cmax of glipizide (2.5 mg single dose) were significantly increased following the administration of fluconazole in 13 normal male volunteers. There was a mean ± SD increase in AUC of 49% ± 13% (range: 27 to 73%) and an increase in Cmax of 19% ± 23% (range: –11 to 79%).\n- Glyburide:\n- The AUC and Cmax of glyburide (5 mg single dose) were significantly increased following the administration of fluconazole in 20 normal male volunteers. There was a mean ± SD increase in AUC of 44% ± 29% (range: –13 to 115%) and Cmax increased 19% ± 19% (range: –23 to 62%). Five subjects required oral glucose following the ingestion of glyburide after 7 days of fluconazole administration.\n- There have been published reports that an interaction exists when fluconazole is administered concomitantly with rifabutin, leading to increased serum levels of rifabutin.\n- Tacrolimus:\n- Cisapride:\n- A placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple-dose study examined the potential interaction of fluconazole with cisapride. Two groups of 10 normal subjects were administered fluconazole 200 mg daily or placebo. Cisapride 20 mg four times daily was started after 7 days of fluconazole or placebo dosing. Following a single dose of fluconazole, there was a 101% increase in the cisapride AUC and a 91% increase in the cisapride Cmax. Following multiple doses of fluconazole, there was a 192% increase in the cisapride AUC and a 154% increase in the cisapride Cmax. Fluconazole significantly increased the QTc interval in subjects receiving cisapride 20 mg four times daily for 5 days.\n- Midazolam:\n- The effect of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam was examined in a randomized, cross-over study in 12 volunteers. In the study, subjects ingested placebo or 400 mg fluconazole on Day 1 followed by 200 mg daily from Day 2 to Day 6. In addition, a 7.5 mg dose of midazolam was orally ingested on the first day, 0.05 mg/kg was administered intravenously on the fourth day, and 7.5 mg orally on the sixth day. Fluconazole reduced the clearance of IV midazolam by 51%. On the first day of dosing, fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and Cmax by 259% and 150%, respectively. On the sixth day of dosing, fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and Cmax by 259% and 74%, respectively. The psychomotor effects of midazolam were significantly increased after oral administration of midazolam but not significantly affected following intravenous midazolam.\n- A second randomized, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in three phases was performed to determine the effect of route of administration of fluconazole on the interaction between fluconazole and midazolam. In each phase the subjects were given oral fluconazole 400 mg and intravenous saline; oral placebo and intravenous fluconazole 400 mg; and oral placebo and IV saline. An oral dose of 7.5 mg of midazolam was ingested after fluconazole/placebo. The AUC and Cmax of midazolam were significantly higher after oral than IV administration of fluconazole. Oral fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and Cmax by 272% and 129%, respectively. IV fluconazole increased the midazolam AUC and Cmax by 244% and 79%, respectively. Both oral and IV fluconazole increased the pharmacodynamic effects of midazolam.\n- Azithromycin:\n- An open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study in 18 healthy subjects assessed the effect of a single 800 mg oral dose of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of a single 1200 mg oral dose of azithromycin as well as the effects of azithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole. There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between fluconazole and azithromycin.\n- Voriconazole:\n- Voriconazole is a substrate for both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes. Concurrent administration of oral Voriconazole (400 mg Q12h for 1 day, then 200 mg Q12h for 2.5 days) and oral fluconazole (400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg Q24h for 4 days) to 6 healthy male subjects resulted in an increase in Cmax and AUCτ of voriconazole by an average of 57% (90% CI: 20%, 107%) and 79% (90% CI: 40%, 128%), respectively. In a follow-on clinical study involving 8 healthy male subjects, reduced dosing and/or frequency of voriconazole and fluconazole did not eliminate or diminish this effect. Concomitant administration of voriconazole and fluconazole at any dose is not recommended. Close monitoring for adverse events related to voriconazole is recommended if voriconazole is used sequentially after fluconazole, especially within 24 h of the last dose of fluconazole.\n- Tofacitinib:\n- Co-administration of fluconazole (400 mg on Day 1 and 200 mg once daily for 6 days ) and tofacitinib (30 mg single dose on Day 5) in healthy subjects resulted in increased mean tofacitinib AUC and Cmax values of approximately 79% (90% CI: 64% – 96%) and 27% (90% CI: 12% – 44%), respectively, compared to administration of tofacitinib alone.\n\n【44】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\n- Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility:\n- Fluconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice and rats treated orally for 24 months at doses of 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/ kg/day (approximately 2 to 7x the recommended human dose). Male rats treated with 5 and 10 mg/kg/day had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas.\n- Fluconazole, with or without metabolic activation, was negative in tests for mutagenicity in 4 strains of S. typhimurium, and in the mouse lymphoma L5178Y system. Cytogenetic studies in vivo (murine bone marrow cells, following oral administration of fluconazole) and in vitro (human lymphocytes exposed to fluconazole at 1000 μg/mL) showed no evidence of chromosomal mutations.\n- Fluconazole did not affect the fertility of male or female rats treated orally with daily doses of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg or with parenteral doses of 5, 25 or 75 mg/kg, although the onset of parturition was slightly delayed at 20 mg/kg PO. In an intravenous perinatal study in rats at 5, 20 and 40 mg/kg, dystocia and prolongation of parturition were observed in a few dams at 20 mg/kg (approximately 5 to 15x the recommended human dose) and 40 mg/kg, but not at 5 mg/kg. The disturbances in parturition were reflected by a slight increase in the number of still-born pups and decrease of neonatal survival at these dose levels. The effects on parturition in rats are consistent with the species specific estrogen-lowering property produced by high doses of fluconazole. Such a hormone change has not been observed in women treated with fluconazole.\n\n【45】 # Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Clinical Studies of Fluconazole (injection) in the drug label.\n\n【46】 # How Supplied\n- Fluconazole Injections: Fluconazole injections for intravenous infusion administration are formulated as sterile iso-osmotic solutions containing 2 mg/mL of fluconazole.

Discard any unused contents.\n- Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor should be administered at a rate not exceeding 0.08 mL/kg body weight/minute. If adverse events occur, the rate should be reduced or the infusion interrupted until the symptoms subside. The infusion may then be resumed at a rate tolerated by the subject.\n\n【5】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Adult)\n\n【6】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor in adult patients.\n\n【7】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor in adult patients.\n\n【8】 # Pediatric Indications and Dosage\n\n【9】 ## FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric)\nThere is limited information regarding Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor FDA-Labeled Indications and Dosage (Pediatric) in the drug label.\n\n【10】 ## Off-Label Use and Dosage (Pediatric)\n\n【11】 ### Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Guideline-Supported Use of Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor in pediatric patients.\n\n【12】 ### Non–Guideline-Supported Use\nThere is limited information regarding Off-Label Non–Guideline-Supported Use of Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor in pediatric patients.\n\n【13】 # Contraindications\n- Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor is contraindicated in IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA, due to the risk of severe hypersensitivity.\n\n【14】 # Warnings\n- Because alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor is derived from pooled human plasma, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) agent. Stringent procedures designed to reduce the risk of adventitious agent transmission have been employed in the manufacture of this product, from the screening of plasma donors and the collection and testing of plasma through the application of viral elimination/reduction steps such as ethanol fractionation, PEG precipitation, solvent detergent treatment, and nanofiltration. Despite these measures, such products can still potentially transmit disease; therefore, the risk of infectious agents cannot be totally eliminated. ALL infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer at 1-800-423-2090 (US). The physician should weigh the risks and benefits of the use of this product and should discuss these with the patient.\n- Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor  may contain trace amounts of IgA. Patients with known antibodies to IgA, which can be present in patients with selective or severe IgA deficiency, have a greater risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor is contraindicated in patients with antibodies against IgA due to risk of severe hypersensitivity.\n- The rate of administration should be closely followed, at least until the physician has had sufficient experience with a given patient. Vital signs should be monitored continuously and the patient should be carefully observed throughout the infusion. IF ANAPHYLACTIC  SEVERE ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS OCCUR, THE INFUSION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED IMMEDIATELY. Epinephrine and other appropriate supportive therapy should be available for the treatment of any acute anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction.\n\n【15】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【16】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\nThere is limited information regarding Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor Clinical Trials Experience in the drug label.\n\n【17】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- The safety of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor was evaluated with alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor after a single dose IV infusion in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical PK comparability study (Study 460501). The number of subjects with one or more adverse events, regardless of causality, was 23 of 25 (92%) when receiving alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor and 19 of 25 (76%) when receiving alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 8 of 25 subjects (32%) for alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor and 7 of 25 subjects (28%) for alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor. Of a total of 61 adverse events reported for alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, 43 (70%) were mild, 16 (26%) moderate, and 2 (3%) severe. Seventeen of 61 (28%) adverse events were deemed possibly or probably related to alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor of which 14 (82%) were mild and 3 (18%) were moderate. Of a total of 60 adverse events reported for alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, 45 (75%) were mild, 12 (20%) moderate, and 3 (5%) severe. Eleven of 60 (18%) adverse events were deemed possibly or probably related to alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor of which 8 (73%) were mild and 3 (27%) were moderate. No serious adverse events or deaths were reported in the study. No clinically significant changes in the peri-infusion vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate) were reported. The most common adverse events deemed related to alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor included: headache (4 of 61  events) and musculoskeletal discomfort (4 of 61  events). These adverse events, as well as most of the other adverse events, were also reported in subjects treated with alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor.\n- In Clinical Study ATC 97-01, alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor was evaluated for up to 96 weeks in 27 subjects with a congenital deficiency of α1–PI and clinically evident emphysema. The number of subjects with an adverse event, regardless of causality, was 22 of 27 (81.5%). The number of subjects with an adverse event deemed possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug was 7 of 27 (25.9%).\n- The frequency of infusions associated with an adverse event, regardless of causality, was 108 of 1127 (9.6%) infusions administered per protocol. The most common symptoms were pharyngitis (1.6%), headache (0.7%), and increased cough (0.6%). Symptoms of bronchitis, sinusitis, pain, rash, back pain, viral infection, peripheral edema, bloating, dizziness, somnolence, asthma, and rhinitis were each associated with ≥0.2% but < 0.6% of infusions. All symptoms were mild to moderate in severity.\n- The overall frequency of adverse events deemed to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug was 15 of 1127 (1.3%) infusions. The most common symptoms included headache (0.3%) and somnolence (0.3%). Symptoms of chills and fever, vasodilation, dizziness, pruritus, rash, abnormal vision, chest pain, increased cough, and dyspnea were each associated with one (0.1%) infusion. Five  of 27 (18.5%) subjects experienced eight  serious adverse reactions during the study. None of these serious adverse events were considered to be causally related to the administration of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor.\n- Twenty-six  of 27 (96.3%) subjects experienced a total of 94 upper and lower respiratory-tract infections during the 96-week study (median: 3.0; range: 1 to 8; mean ± SD: 3.6 ± 2.3 infections). Twenty-eight (29.8%) of the respiratory infections occurred in 19 (70.4%) subjects during the first 24 weeks of the 96-week study suggesting that the risk of infection did not change with time on alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor. In a post-hoc analysis, subjects experienced a range of 0 to 8 exacerbations of COPD over the 96-week study with a median of less than one exacerbation per year (median: 0.61; mean ± SD: 0.83 ± 0.87 exacerbations per year).\n- Treatment-emergent elevations (> two times the upper limit of normal) in aminotransferases (ALT or AST), up to 3.7 times the upper limit of normal, were noted in 3 of 27 (11.1%) subjects. Elevations were transient lasting three months or less. No subject developed any evidence of viral hepatitis or hepatitis seroconversion while being treated with alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, including 13 evaluable subjects who were not vaccinated against hepatitis B.\n- No clinically relevant alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, or body temperature occurred during infusion of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor. Mean hematology and laboratory parameters were little changed over the duration of the study, with individual variations not clinically meaningful.\n- During the initial 10 weeks of the study, subjects were randomized to receive either alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor or a commercially available preparation of α1-PI (Prolastin). The overall frequency, severity and symptomatology of adverse reactions were similar in both the alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor groups. There were two serious adverse events in the alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor group, both of which were considered to be possibly related to alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor.\n- These included chest pain, dyspnea and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in one individual that withdrew from the study prematurely following an unscheduled bronchoscopy to remove a foreign body and the other, a positive seroconversion to Parvovirus B-19. There were no serious adverse events or seroconversions reported for the alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor group during the 96 week study period. No subject developed an antibody to α1–PI.\n\n【18】 # Drug Interactions\nThere is limited information regarding Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor Drug Interactions in the drug label.\n\n【19】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【20】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\nAnimal reproduction studies have not been conducted with alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor.

If you suspect drug poisoning or overdose, please contact the National Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) immediately.\n\n【36】 # Pharmacology\n\n【37】 ## Mechanism of Action\n- Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor functions in the lungs to inhibit serine proteases such as neutrophil elastase (NE), which is capable of degrading protein components of the alveolar walls and which is chronically present in the lung. In the normal lung, α1–PI is thought to provide more than 90% of the anti–NE protection in the lower respiratory tract\n\n【38】 ## Structure\n- Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor NP is a sterile, stable, lyophilized preparation of purified human alpha1–proteinase inhibitor (α1–PI), also known as alpha1–antitrypsin.1 alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor NP is a similar product to alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, containing the same active components of plasma α1-PI with identical formulations.\n- Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor is prepared from large pools of human plasma by using the cold ethanol fractionation process, followed by purification steps including polyethylene glycol and zinc chloride precipitations and ion exchange chromatography. All U.S. licensed α1-PI plasma derived products contain chemical modifications which arise during manufacturing and occur in varying levels from product to product.11 alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor contains approximately 2% α1-PI with truncated C-terminal lysine (removal of Lys394), whereas alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor contains approximately 67% α1-PI with the C-terminal lysine truncation.12 No known data suggest influence of these structural modifications on the functional activity and immunogenicity of α1-PI.13\n- To reduce the risk of viral transmission, the manufacturing process includes treatment with a solvent detergent (S/D) mixture  to inactivate enveloped viral agents such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV).2\n\n【39】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- α1–PI deficiency is an autosomal, co-dominant, hereditary disorder characterized by low serum and lung levels of α1–PI. Severe forms of the deficiency are frequently associated with slowly progressive, moderate-to-severe panacinar emphysema that most often manifests in the third to fourth decades of life, resulting in a significantly lower life expectancy. However, an unknown percentage of individuals with severe α1–PI deficiency are not diagnosed with or may never develop clinically evident emphysema during their lifetimes.\n- Individuals with α1–PI deficiency have little protection against NE released by a chronic, low–level of neutrophils in their lower respiratory tract, resulting in a protease:protease inhibitor imbalance in the lung. The emphysema associated with severe α1–PI deficiency is typically worse in the lower lung zones. It is believed to develop because there are insufficient amounts of α1–PI in the lower respiratory tract to inhibit NE. This imbalance allows relatively unopposed destruction of the connective tissue framework of the lung parenchyma.\n- There are a large number of phenotypic variants of this disorder. Individuals with the PiZZ variant typically have serum α1–PI levels less than 35% of the average normal level. Individuals with the Pi(null) variant have undetectable α1–PI protein in their serum. Individuals with these low serum α1-PI levels, i.e., less than 11 µM, have an increased risk of developing emphysema over their lifetimes. In addition, PiSZ individuals, whose serum α1-PI levels range from approximately 9 to 23 μΜ14, are considered to have moderately increased risk for developing emphysema, regardless of whether their serum α1-PI levels are above or below 11 μΜ. Two Registry studies have shown 54% and 72% of α1-PI deficient individuals had emphysema and pulmonary symptoms such as cough, phlegm, wheeze, breathlessness, and chest colds, respectively.9,10 The risk of accelerated development and progression of emphysema in individuals with severe α1–PI deficiency is higher in smokers than in ex-smokers or non-smokers.\n- Not all individuals with severe genetic variants of α1-PI deficiency have emphysema. Augmentation therapy with Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor (Human) is indicated only in patients with congenital α1-PI deficiency who have clinically evident emphysema.\n- Augmenting the levels of functional α1-proteinase inhibitor by intravenous infusion is an approach to therapy for patients with α1-PI deficiency. However, the efficacy of augmentation therapy in affecting the progression of emphysema has not been demonstrated in randomized, controlled clinical trials. The intended theoretical goal is to provide protection to the lower respiratory tract by correcting the imbalance between neutrophil elastase and protease inhibitors. Whether augmentation therapy with alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor actually protects the lower respiratory tract from progressive emphysematous changes has not been evaluated. Although the maintenance of blood serum levels of α1-PI (antigenically measured) above 11 µM has been historically postulated to provide therapeutically relevant anti-neutrophil elastase protection, this has not been proven. Individuals with severe α1-PI deficiency have been shown to have increased neutrophil and neutrophil elastase concentrations in lung epithelial lining fluid compared to normal PiMM individuals, and some PiSZ individuals with α1-PI above 11 µM have emphysema attributed to α1-PI deficiency. These observations underscore the uncertainty regarding the appropriate therapeutic target serum level of α1-PI during augmentation therapy. The clinical benefit of the increased blood levels of  Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor at the recommended dose has not been established.\n- The clinical efficacy of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor in influencing the course of pulmonary emphysema or the frequency, duration, or severity of pulmonary exacerbations has not been demonstrated in randomized, controlled clinical trials.\n\n【40】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- The pharmacokinetics of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor were compared with alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor in a multicenter, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical study (Study 460501).\n- Twenty-five subjects with congenital α1-PI deficiency received a single intravenous (IV) infusion of 60 mg/kg alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor. The 90% confidence intervals for Cmax and AUC 0 inf/dose were well within the pre-defined acceptance limits of 80 to 125%.The pharmacokinetics of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor were compared with alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor in a multicenter, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical study (Study 460501). Twenty-five subjects with congenital α1-PI deficiency received a single intravenous (IV) infusion of 60 mg/kg alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor.\n- The 25 subjects in this study were between 20 and 75 years old, with a median age of 59. Plasma α1-PI concentrations were measured using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n- Figure 1 shows that the mean ± standard deviation (SD) plasma α1-PI concentration-time profiles after a single IV infusion of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor at 60 mg/kg were comparable. The 90% confidence intervals for Cmax and AUC 0 inf/dose were well within the pre-defined acceptance limits of 80 to 125%.\n- A clinical study (ATC 97-01) was conducted to compare alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor to a commercially available preparation of α1–PI (alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, manufactured by Bayer Corporation). All subjects were to have been diagnosed as having congenital α1–PI deficiency and emphysema but no α1–PI augmentation therapy within the preceding six months.\n- Twenty-eight subjects were randomized to receive either alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, 60 mg/kg intravenously per week, for 10 consecutive weeks. Two subjects withdrew from the study prematurely: 1 subject receiving alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor withdrew consent after 6 infusions; 1 subject receiving alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor withdrew after 1 infusion due to pneumonia following unscheduled bronchoscopy to remove a foreign body. Trough levels of α1–PI (antigenic determination) and anti–NE capacity (functional determination) were measured prior to treatment at Weeks 8 through 11. Following their first 10 weekly infusions, the subjects who were receiving alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor were switched to alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor while those who already were receiving alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor continued to receive it. Maintenance of mean serum α1–PI trough levels was assessed prior to treatments at Weeks 12 through 24.\n- Bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) were performed on subjects at baseline and prior to treatment at Week 7. The epithelial lining fluid (ELF) from each BAL meeting acceptance criteria was analyzed for the α1–PI level and anti–NE capacity.\n- With weekly augmentation therapy with alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, a gradual increase in peak and trough serum α1–PI levels was noted, with stabilization after several weeks.\n- The metabolic half–life of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor was 5.9 days. Serum anti–NE capacity trough levels rose substantially in all subjects by Week 2, and by Week 3, serum anti–NE capacity trough levels exceeded 11 µM in the majority of subjects. With few exceptions, levels remained above this recommended threshold level in individual subjects for the duration of the period Weeks 3 through 24 on study. Although only five of fourteen subjects (35.7%) receiving alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor had BALs meeting acceptance criteria for analysis at both baseline and Week 7, a statistically significant increase in the antigenic level of α1–PI in the ELF was observed. No statistically significant increase in the anti-NE capacity in the ELF was detected.\n- Viral serology of all subjects was determined periodically throughout the study, including testing for antibodies to hepatitis A (HAV) and C (HCV), presence of circulating HBsAg, and presence of antibodies to HIV–1, HIV–2, and Parvovirus B–19.\n- Subjects who were seronegative to parvovirus B–19 at enrollment were retested by PCR at Week 2. There were no seroconversions in subjects treated with alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor through Week 24. None of the subjects became HBsAg positive during the study, although five of 13 (38%) evaluable subjects treated with alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor and eight of 13 (62%) treated with Prolastin had not been vaccinated to hepatitis B. No patient developed antibodies against α1–PI.\n- It was concluded that at a dose of 60 mg/kg administered intravenously once weekly, alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor and Prolastin had similar effects in maintaining target serum α1–PI trough levels and increasing antigenic levels of α1–PI in epithelial lining fluid (ELF) with maintenance augmentation therapy.\n\n【41】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor Nonclinical Toxicology in the drug label.\n\n【42】 # Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n\n【43】 # How Supplied\n- Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor is supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, lyophilized powder in single–dose vials.

Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients.\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated as prophylactic analgesic before any major surgery.\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with advanced renal impairment or in patients at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion.\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in labor and delivery because, through its prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory effect, it may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions, thus increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage.\n- Ketorolac tromethamine inhibits platelet function and is, therefore, contraindicated in patients with suspected or confirmed cerebrovascular bleeding, hemorrhagic diathesis, incomplete hemostasis and those at high risk of bleeding.\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients currently receiving aspirin or NSAIDs because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events.\n- The concomitant use of ketorolac tromethamine and probenecid is contraindicated.\n\n【16】 # Warnings\n- \n- The total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine tablets and IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days in adults. Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients.\n- The most serious risks associated with ketorolac tromethamine are:\n- Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with previously documented peptic ulcers and/or GI bleeding. Ketorolac tromethamine can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration and perforation, of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with ketorolac tromethamine.\n- Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Minor upper gastrointestinal problems, such as dyspepsia, are common and may also occur at any time during NSAID therapy. The incidence and severity of gastrointestinal complications increases with increasing dose of, and duration of treatment with, ketorolac tromethamine. Do not use ketorolac tromethamine for more than five days. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. In addition to past history of ulcer disease, other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.\n- To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of ketorolac tromethamine until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.\n- NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.\nHemorrhage\n- Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis and NSAIDs affect platelet aggregation as well, use of ketorolac tromethamine in patients who have coagulation disorders should be undertaken very cautiously, and those patients should be carefully monitored. Patients on therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (e.g., heparin or dicumarol derivatives) have an increased risk of bleeding complications if given ketorolac tromethamine concurrently; therefore, physicians should administer such concomitant therapy only extremely cautiously. The concurrent use of ketorolac tromethamine and therapy that affects hemostasis, including prophylactic low-dose heparin (2500 to 5000 units q12h), warfarin and dextrans have not been studied extensively, but may also be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Until data from such studies are available, physicians should carefully weigh the benefits against the risks and use such concomitant therapy in these patients only extremely cautiously. Patients receiving therapy that affects hemostasis should be monitored closely.\n- In postmarketing experience, postoperative hematomas and other signs of wound bleeding have been reported in association with the peri-operative use of IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine. Therefore, peri-operative use of ketorolac tromethamine should be avoided and postoperative use be undertaken with caution when hemostasis is critical.\nRenal Effects\n- Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.\n- Ketorolac tromethamine and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys, which, in patients with reduced creatinine clearance, will result in diminished clearance of the drug. Therefore, ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function and such patients should be followed closely. With the use of ketorolac tromethamine, there have been reports of acute renal failure, interstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome.\nImpaired Renal Function\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine concentrations indicating advanced renal impairment . Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function or a history of kidney disease because it is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Because patients with underlying renal insufficiency are at increased risk of developing acute renal decompensation or failure, the risks and benefits should be assessed prior to giving ketorolac tromethamine to these patients.\nAnaphylactoid Reactions\n- As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without a known previous exposure or hypersensitivity to ketorolac tromethamine. Ketorolac tromethamine should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Anaphylactoid reactions, like anaphylaxis, may have a fatal outcome. Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.\nCardiovascular Effects\nCardiovascular Thrombotic Events\n- Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.\n- There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events . Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke .\nHypertension\n- NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.\nCongestive Heart Failure and Edema\n- Fluid retention, edema, retention of NaCl, oliguria, elevations of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine have been reported in clinical trials with ketorolac tromethamine. Therefore, ketorolac tromethamine should be used only very cautiously in patients with cardiac decompensation, hypertension or similar conditions.\nSkin Reactions\n- NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash, mucosal lesions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity.\nPregnancy\n- In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, ketorolac tromethamine should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.\n\n【17】 ### PRECAUTIONS\nGeneral\n- Ketorolac tromethamine cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.\n- The pharmacological activity of ketorolac tromethamine in reducing inflammation may diminish the utility of this diagnostic sign in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.\nHepatic Effect\n- Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or a history of liver disease. Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including ketorolac tromethamine. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.\n- A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with ketorolac tromethamine. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), ketorolac tromethamine should be discontinued.\n- Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving ketorolac tromethamine who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.\nPreexisting Asthma\n- Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, ketorolac tromethamine should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.\nLaboratory Tests\n- Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, ketorolac tromethamine should be discontinued.\n\n【18】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【19】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Adverse reaction rates increase with higher doses of ketorolac tromethamine. Practitioners should be alert for the severe complications of treatment with ketorolac tromethamine, such as GI ulceration, bleeding and perforation, postoperative bleeding, acute renal failure, anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions and liver failure. These NSAID-related complications can be serious in certain patients for whom ketorolac tromethamine is indicated, especially when the drug is used inappropriately.\n- In patients taking ketorolac tromethamine or other NSAIDs in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse experiences in approximately 1% to 10% of patients are:\n- Additional adverse experiences reported occasionally (< 1% in patients taking ketorolac tromethamine or other NSAIDs in clinical trials) include:\n- Body as a Whole: fever, infections, sepsis\n- Cardiovascular: congestive heart failure, palpitation, pallor, tachycardia, syncope\n- Dermatologic: alopecia, photosensitivity, urticaria\n- Gastrointestinal: anorexia, dry mouth, eructation, esophagitis, excessive thirst, gastritis, glossitis, hematemesis, hepatitis, increased appetite, jaundice, melena, rectal bleeding\n- Hemic and Lymphatic: ecchymosis, eosinophilia, epistaxis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia\n- Metabolic and Nutritional: weight change\n- Nervous System: abnormal dreams, abnormal thinking, anxiety, asthenia, confusion, depression, euphoria, extrapyramidal symptoms, hallucinations, hyperkinesis, inability to concentrate, insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence, stupor, tremors, vertigo, malaise\n- Reproductive, female: infertility\n- Respiratory: asthma, cough, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, rhinitis\n- Special Senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, blurred vision, hearing loss\n- Urogenital: cystitis, dysuria, hematuria, increased urinary frequency, interstitial nephritis, oliguria/polyuria, proteinuria, renal failure, urinary retention\n- Other rarely observed reactions (reported from postmarketing experience in patients taking ketorolac tromethamine or other NSAIDs) are:\n- Body as a Whole: angioedema, death, hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, laryngeal edema, tongue edem. myalgia\n- Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, bradycardia, chest pain, flushing, hypotension, myocardial infarction, vasculitis\n- Dermatologic: exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Lyell’s syndrome, bullous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis\n- Gastrointestinal: acute pancreatitis, liver failure, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease)\n- Hemic and Lymphatic: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, postoperative wound hemorrhage (rarely requiring blood transfusion - see BoxedWARNING, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS)\n- Metabolic and Nutritional: hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia\n- Nervous System: aseptic meningitis, convulsions, coma, psychosis\n- Respiratory: bronchospasm, respiratory depression, pneumonia\n- Special Senses: conjunctivitis\n- Urogenital: flank pain with or without hematuria and/or azotemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome\n\n【20】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- A large postmarketing observational, nonrandomized study, involving approximately 10,000 patients receiving ketorolac tromethamineIV/IM, demonstrated that the risk of clinically serious gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was dose-dependent . This was particularly true in elderly patients who received an average daily dose greater than 60 mg/day of ketorolac tromethamineIV/IM .\n\n【21】 # Drug Interactions\n- Ketorolac is highly bound to human plasma protein (mean 99.2%). There is no evidence in animal or human studies that ketorolac tromethamine induces or inhibits hepatic enzymes capable of metabolizing itself or other drugs.\nWarfarin, Digoxin, Salicylate, and Heparin\n- The in vitro binding of warfarin to plasma proteins is only slightly reduced by ketorolac tromethamine (99.5% control vs 99.3%) when ketorolac plasma concentrations reach 5 to 10 mcg/mL. Ketorolac does not alter digoxin protein binding. In vitro studies indicate that, at therapeutic concentrations of salicylate (300 mcg/mL), the binding of ketorolac was reduced from approximately 99.2% to 97.5%, representing a potential twofold increase in unbound ketorolac plasma levels. Therapeutic concentrations of digoxin, warfarin, ibuprofen, naproxen, piroxicam, acetaminophen, phenytoin and tolbutamide did not alter ketorolac tromethamine protein binding.\n- In a study involving 12 adult volunteers, ketorolac tromethamine tablets were coadministered with a single dose of 25 mg warfarin, causing no significant changes in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. In another study, ketorolac tromethamine dosed IV or IM was given with two doses of 5000 U of heparin to 11 healthy volunteers, resulting in a mean template bleeding time of 6.4 minutes (3.2 to 11.4 min) compared to a mean of 6 minutes (3.4 to 7.5 min) for heparin alone and 5.1 minutes (3.5 to 8.5 min) for placebo. Although these results do not indicate a significant interaction between ketorolac tromethamine and warfarin or heparin, the administration of ketorolac tromethamine to patients taking anticoagulants should be done extremely cautiously, and patients should be closely monitored .\n- The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs, in general, on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than the users of either drug alone.\nAspirin\n- When ketorolac tromethamine is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free ketorolac tromethamine is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of ketorolac tromethamine and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.\nDiuretics\n- Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that ketorolac tromethamine can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.\nProbenecid\n- Concomitant administration of ketorolac tromethamine tablets and probenecid resulted in decreased clearance and volume of distribution of ketorolac and significant increases in ketorolac plasma levels (total AUC increased approximately threefold from 5.4 to 17.8 mcg/h/mL) and terminal half-life increased approximately twofold from 6.6 to 15.1 hours. Therefore, concomitant use of ketorolac tromethamine and probenecid is contraindicated.\nLithium\n- NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.\nMethotrexate\n- NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.\nACE Inhibitors/Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists\n- Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists may increase the risk of renal impairment, particularly in volume-depleted patients.\n- Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nAntiepileptic Drugs\n- Sporadic cases of seizures have been reported during concomitant use of ketorolac tromethamine and antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine).\nPsychoactive Drugs\n- Hallucinations have been reported when ketorolac tromethamine was used in patients taking psychoactive drugs (fluoxetine, thiothixene, alprazolam).\nPentoxifylline\n- When ketorolac tromethamine is administered concurrently with pentoxifylline, there is an increased tendency to bleeding.\nNondepolarizing Muscle Relaxants\n- In postmarketing experience there have been reports of a possible interaction between ketorolac tromethamineIV/IM and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants that resulted in apnea. The concurrent use of ketorolac tromethamine with muscle relaxants has not been formally studied.\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)\n- There is an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are combined with NSAIDs. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with SSRIs.\n\n【22】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【23】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): \n- Reproduction studies have been performed during organogenesis using daily oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine at 3.6 mg/kg (0.37 times the human AUC) in rabbits and at 10 mg/kg (1 times the human AUC) in rats. Results of these studies did not reveal evidence of teratogenicity to the fetus. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response.\nNonteratogenic Effects\n- Because of the known effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided. Oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine at 1.5 mg/kg (0.14 times the human AUC), administered after gestation Day 17, caused dystocia and higher pup mortality in rats.\n- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ketorolac tromethamine in pregnant women. Ketorolac tromethamine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n- Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) Pregnancy Category\n- There is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Ketorolac tromethamine (oral) in women who are pregnant.\n\n【24】 ### Labor and Delivery\n- The use of ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in labor and delivery because, through its prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory effect, it may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions, thus increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage .\nEffects on Fertility\n- The use of ketorolac tromethamine, as with any drug known to inhibit cyclooxygenase/prostaglandin synthesis, may impair fertility and is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. In women who have difficulty conceiving or are undergoing investigation of infertility, withdrawal of ketorolac tromethamine should be considered.\n\n【25】 ### Nursing Mothers\n- Limited data from one published study involving 10 breastfeeding women 2 to 6 days postpartum showed low levels of ketorolac in breast milk. Levels were undetectable (less than 5 ng/mL) in 4 of the patients. After a single administration of 10 mg of ketorolac tromethamine tablets, the maximum milk concentration observed was 7.3 ng/mL, and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.037. After 1 day of dosing (10 mg every 6 hours), the maximum milk concentration was 7.9 ng/mL, and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.025. Assuming a daily intake of 400 to 1,000 mL of human milk per day and a maternal body weight of 60 kg, the calculated maximum daily infant exposure was 0.00263 mg/kg/day, which is 0.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose.\n- Exercise caution when ketorolac is administered to a nursing woman. Available information has not shown any specific adverse events in nursing infants; however, instruct patients to contact their infant's health care provider if they note any adverse events.\n\n【26】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of ketorolac tromethamine tablets in pediatric patients below the age of 17 have not been established.\n\n【27】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Because ketorolac tromethamine may be cleared more slowly by the elderly  who are also more sensitive to the dose-related adverse effects of NSAID. extreme caution, reduced dosage. and careful clinical monitoring must be used when treating the elderly with ketorolac tromethamine.\n\n【28】 ### Gender\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Ketorolac tromethamine (oral) with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【29】 ### Race\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Ketorolac tromethamine (oral) with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【30】 ### Renal Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Ketorolac tromethamine (oral) in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【31】 ### Hepatic Impairment\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Ketorolac tromethamine (oral) in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【32】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\n- There is no FDA guidance on the use of Ketorolac tromethamine (oral) in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【33】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\n- There is no FDA guidance one the use of Ketorolac tromethamine (oral) in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【34】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【35】 ### Administration\n- Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ketorolac tromethamine tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use ketorolac tromethamine tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. In adults, the combined duration of use of IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine and ketorolac tromethamine tablets is not to exceed 5 days. In adults, the use of ketorolac tromethamine tablets is only indicated as continuation therapy to IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine.\n- Transition from IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine (single- or multiple-dose) to multiple-dose ketorolac tromethamine tablets:\n- Patients age 17 to 64: 20 mg PO once followed by 10 mg q4 to 6 hours prn not > 40 mg/day\n- Patients age ≥ 65, renally impaired, and/or weight  40 mg/day\n- Note:\n- Oral formulation should not be given as an initial dose.\n- Use minimum effective dose for the individual patient.\n- Do not shorten dosing interval of 4 to 6 hours.\n- Total duration of treatment in adult patients: the combined duration of use of IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine and ketorolac tromethamine tablets is not to exceed 5 days.\n- The following table summarizes ketorolac tromethamine tablet dosing instructions in terms of age group:\n\n【36】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Ketorolac tromethamine (oral) Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【37】 # IV Compatibility\n- There is limited information regarding IV Compatibility of Ketorolac tromethamine (oral) in the drug label.\n\n【38】 # Overdosage\nSymptoms and Signs\n- Symptoms following acute NSAID overdoses are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.\nTreatment\n- Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAIDs overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 g to 100 g in adults, 1 g/kg to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large oral overdose (5 to 10 times the usual dose). Forced diuresis, alkalization of urine, hemodialysis or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\n- Single overdoses of ketorolac tromethamine have been variously associated with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hyperventilation, peptic ulcers and/or erosive gastritis and renal dysfunction which have resolved after discontinuation of dosing.\n\n【39】 # Pharmacology\n\n【40】 ## Mechanism of Action\n\n【41】 ## Structure\n- Ketorolac Tromethamine Tablets USP are a member of the pyrrolo-pyrrole group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The chemical name for ketorolac tromethamine, USP is (±)-5-benzoyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-1-carboxylic acid, compound with 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (1:1). The structural formula is:\n- C15H13NO3 .C4H11NO3 M.W. 376.40\n- Ketorolac tromethamine, USP is a racemic mixture of S and R ketorolac tromethamine, USP. Ketorolac tromethamine, USP may exist in three crystal forms. All forms are equally soluble in water. Ketorolac tromethamine, USP has a pKa of 3.5 and an n-octanol/water partition coefficient of 0.26.\n- Ketorolac Tromethamine Tablets USP are white, round, convex, unscored, film coated tablets. Each tablet, for oral administration, contains 10 mg ketorolac tromethamine, USP, the active ingredient. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\n\n【42】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits analgesic activity in animal models. The mechanism of action of ketorolac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. The biological activity of ketorolac tromethamine is associated with the S-form. Ketorolac tromethamine possesses no sedative or anxiolytic properties.\n- The peak analgesic effect of ketorolac tromethamine occurs within 2 to 3 hours and is not statistically significantly different over the recommended dosage range of ketorolac tromethamine. The greatest difference between large and small doses of ketorolac tromethamine is in the duration of analgesia.\n\n【43】 ## Pharmacokinetics\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is a racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomeric forms, with the S-form having analgesic activity.\nComparison of IV, IM and Oral Pharmacokinetics\n- The pharmacokinetics of ketorolac tromethamine, following IV and IM doses of ketorolac tromethamine and oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine, are compared in Table 1. In adults, the extent of bioavailability following administration of the ORAL form of ketorolac tromethamine and the IM form of ketorolac tromethamine was equal to that following an IV bolus.\nLinear Kinetics\n- In adults, following administration of single ORAL doses of ketorolac tromethamine or IM or IV doses of ketorolac tromethamine in the recommended dosage ranges, the clearance of the racemate does not change. This implies that the pharmacokinetics of ketorolac tromethamine in adults, following single or multiple IM or IV doses of ketorolac tromethamine or recommended oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine, are linear. At the higher recommended doses, there is a proportional increase in the concentrations of free and bound racemate.\nAbsorption\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is 100% absorbed after oral administration . Oral administration of ketorolac tromethamine after a high-fat meal resulted in decreased peak and delayed time-to-peak concentrations of ketorolac tromethamine by about 1 hour. Antacids did not affect the extent of absorption.\nDistribution\n- The mean apparent volume (Vß) of ketorolac tromethamine following complete distribution was approximately 13 liters. This parameter was determined from single-dose data. The ketorolac tromethamine racemate has been shown to be highly protein bound (99%). Nevertheless, plasma concentrations as high as 10 mcg/mL will only occupy approximately 5% of the albumin binding sites. Thus, the unbound fraction for each enantiomer will be constant over the therapeutic range. A decrease in serum albumin, however, will result in increased free drug concentrations.\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is excreted in human milk .\nMetabolism\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is largely metabolized in the liver. The metabolic products are hydroxylated and conjugated forms of the parent drug. The products of metabolism, and some unchanged drug, are excreted in the urine.\nExcretion\n- The principal route of elimination of ketorolac and its metabolites is renal.\n- The half-life of the ketorolac tromethamine S-enantiomer was approximately 2.5 hours (SD ± 0.4) compared with 5 hours (SD ± 1.7) for the R-enantiomer. In other studies, the half-life for the racemate has been reported to lie within the range of 5 to 6 hours.\nAccumulation\n- Ketorolac tromethamine administered as an IV bolus every 6 hours for 5 days to healthy subjects (n = 13), showed no significant difference in Cmax on Day 1 and Day 5. Trough levels averaged 0.29 mcg/mL (SD ± 0.13) on Day 1 and 0.55 mcg/mL (SD ± 0.23) on Day 6. Steady state was approached after the fourth dose.\n- Accumulation of ketorolac tromethamine has not been studied in special populations (geriatric, pediatric, renal failure or hepatic disease patients).\nKinetics in Special Populations\nGeriatric Patients\n- Based on single-dose data only, the half-life of the ketorolac tromethamine racemate increased from 5 to 7 hours in the elderly (65 to 78 years) compared with young healthy volunteers (24 to 35 years) . There was little difference in the Cmax for the two groups (elderly, 2.52 mcg/mL ± 0.77; young, 2.99 mcg/mL ± 1.03) .\nPediatric Patients\n- Limited information is available regarding the pharmacokinetics of dosing of ketorolac tromethamine in the pediatric population. Following a single intravenous bolus dose of 0.5 mg/kg in 10 children 4 to 8 years old, the half-life was 5.8 ± 1.6 hours, the average clearance was 0.042 ± 0.01 L/hr/kg, the volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vβ) was 0.34 ± 0.12 L/kg and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 0.26 ± 0.08 L/kg. The volume of distribution and clearance of ketorolac in pediatric patients was higher than those observed in adult subjects . There are no pharmacokinetic data available for administration of ketorolac tromethamine by the IM route in pediatric patients.\nRenal Insufficiency\n- Based on single-dose data only, the mean half-life of ketorolac tromethamine in renally impaired patients is between 6 and 19 hours and is dependent on the extent of the impairment. There is poor correlation between creatinine clearance and total ketorolac tromethamine clearance in the elderly and populations with renal impairment (r = 0.5).\n- In patients with renal disease, the AUC∞ of each enantiomer increased by approximately 100% compared with healthy volunteers. The volume of distribution doubles for the S-enantiomer and increases by 1/5th for the R-enantiomer. The increase in volume of distribution of ketorolac tromethamine implies an increase in unbound fraction.\n- The AUC∞-ratio of the ketorolac tromethamine enantiomers in healthy subjects and patients remained similar, indicating there was no selective excretion of either enantiomer in patients compared to healthy subjects .\nHepatic Insufficiency\n- There was no significant difference in estimates of half-life, AUC∞ and Cmax in 7 patients with liver disease compared to healthy volunteers.\nRace\n- Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified.\nIV Administration\n- In normal adult subjects (n = 37), the total clearance of 30 mg IV-administered ketorolac tromethamine was 0.030 (0.017 to 0.051) L/h/kg. The terminal half-life was 5.6 (4 to 7.9) hours .\n\n【44】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n- An 18 month study in mice with oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine at 2 mg/kg/day (0.9 times the human systemic exposure at the recommended IM or IV dose of 30 mg qid, based on area-under-the-plasma-concentration curve ), and a 24 month study in rats at 5 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the human AUC) showed no evidence of tumorigenicity.\n- Ketorolac tromethamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, unscheduled DNA synthesis and repair, and in forward mutation assays. Ketorolac tromethamine did not cause chromosome breakage in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. At 1590 mcg/mL and at higher concentrations, ketorolac tromethamine increased the incidence of chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovarian cells.\n- Impairment of fertility did not occur in male or female rats at oral doses of 9 mg/kg (0.9 times the human AUC) and 16 mg/kg (1.6 times the human AUC) of ketorolac tromethamine, respectively.\n\n【45】 # Clinical Studies\nAdult Patients\n- In a postoperative study, where all patients received morphine by a PCA device, patients treated with ketorolac tromethamineIV as fixed intermittent boluses (e.g., 30 mg initial dose followed by 15 mg q3h), required significantly less morphine (26%) than the placebo group. Analgesia was significantly superior, at various postdosing pain assessment times, in the patients receiving ketorolac tromethamineIV plus PCA morphine as compared to patients receiving PCA-administered morphine alone.\nPediatric Patients\n- There are no data available to support the use of ketorolac tromethamine tablets in pediatric patients.\n\n【46】 # How Supplied\n- Ketorolac Tromethamine Tablets USP are available as follows:\n- 10 mg: White, round, convex, unscored, film coated tablets, debossed \"93\" on one side and \"314\" on the other side. They are available in bottles of 100 tablets.\n\n【47】 ## Storage\n- Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) .\n- Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP, with a child-resistant closure (as required).\n- PROTECT FROM LIGHT AND EXCESSIVE HUMIDITY.\n- KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATIONS OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.\n\n【48】 ## Package and Label Display Panel\n\n【49】 # Patient Counseling Information\nInformation for Patients\n- Ketorolac tromethamine is a potent NSAID and may cause serious side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding or kidney failure, which may result in hospitalization and even fatal outcome.\n- Physicians, when prescribing ketorolac tromethamine, should inform their patients or their guardians of the potential risks of ketorolac tromethamine treatmen. instruct patients to seek medical advice if they develop treatment-related adverse events, and advise patients not to giveketorolac tromethamine tablets to other family members and to discard any unused drug.\n- Remember that the total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine tablets and IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days in adults. Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients.\n- Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.\n- Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up .\n- Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up .\n- Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.\n- Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians.\n- Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.\n- Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help .\n- In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, ketorolac tromethamine should be avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.\n\n【50】 # Precautions with Alcohol\n- Alcohol-Ketorolac tromethamine (oral) interaction has not been established.

Fatal strangling typically occurs in cases of violence, accidents, and as the mechanism of suicide in hangings. Strangling does not have to be fatal; limited or interrupted strangling is practiced in erotic asphyxia, in the choking game, and is an important technique and in many combat sports and self-defense systems .\nStrangling can be divided into three general types according to the mechanism used:\n- Hanging — Suspension from a cord wound around the neck \n- Ligature strangulation — Strangulation without suspension using some form of cord-like object\n- Manual strangulation — Strangulation using the fingers or other extremity\n\n【2】 # General\nStrangling involves one or several mechanisms that interfere with the normal flow of oxygen into the brain:\n- Compression of the carotid arteries and jugular veins — causing cerebral ischemia.\n- Compression of the laryngopharynx, larynx, or trachea — causing asphyxia.\n- Stimulation of the carotid sinus reflex — causing brachycardia, hypotension, or both.\nDepending on the particular method of strangling, one or several of these typically occur in combination, but vascular obstruction is usually the main mechanism. Complete obstruction of blood flow to the brain is associated with irreversible neurological damage and death, but during strangulation there is still unimpeded blood flow in the vertebral arteries. Estimations have been made that significant occlusion of the carotid arteries and jugular veins occurs with a pressure of around 3.4 N/cm², while the trachea demands six times more at approximately 22 N/cm². As in all cases of strangulation, the rapidity of death can be affected by the susceptibility to carotid sinus stimulation.  Carotid sinus reflex death is sometimes considered a mechanism of death in cases of strangulation, but it remains highly disputed. The reported time from application to unconsciousness varies from 7-14 seconds if effectively applied.  chokeholds to one minute in some other cases, with death occurring minutes after unconsciousness.\n\n【3】 # Manual strangulation\nManual strangulation (also known as \"throttling\" in the UK) refers to strangling with the hands, fingers, or other extremities (sometimes also with blunt objects such as batons). In violence, this type of strangling is mostly done by men against women rather than against another man, because it generally requires a large disparity in physical strength between the assailant and the victim and also because men can be over twice as big as a woman in general. Depending on how the strangling is performed, it may compress the airway, interfere with the flow of blood in the neck, or work as a combination of the two. Consequently, manual strangulation may damage the larynx, and fracture the hyoid or other bones in the neck. In cases of airway compression, manual strangling leads to the frightening sensation of air hunger and may induce violent struggling. More technical variants of manual strangulation are referred to as chokeholds, and are extensively practiced and used in various martial arts, combat sports, self-defense systems, and in military hand-to-hand combat application.\nIt is a mistake to  Choke means having the windpipe blocked entirely or partly by some foreign object like food.\n\n【4】 # Ligature strangulation\nLigature strangulation refers to strangling with some form of cord or cloth such as rope, wire, or shoe laces, either partially or fully circumferencing the neck. Even though the mechanism of strangulation is similar, it is usually distinguished from hanging by the strangling force being something other than the person's own bodyweight. Incomplete occlusion of the carotid arteries is expected, and in cases of homicide, the victim may struggle for a period of time, with unconsciousness typically occurring in 10 to 15 seconds. Cases of ligature strangulation generally involve homicides of women, children, and the elderly, but accidents and suicides occur as well. Suicide by ligature strangulation requires that the constriction around the neck be held even after loss of consciousness, which can be accomplished with complicated knots.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

In vertebrates, the signal passes through the neuromuscular junction via the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\n\n【1】 # Anatomy\nWhen a motor neuron enters a muscle, it loses its myelin sheath and splits into many terminal branches. Motor neuron (efferent) axons originating in the spinal cord enter muscle fibers, where they split into many unmyelinated branches. These terminal fibers run along the myocytes to end at the neuromuscular junction, which occupies a depression in the sarcolemma. Each motor neuron can innervate from one to over 2000  muscle fibers, but each muscle fiber receives inputs from only one motor neuron.\nIn the terminal bouton of the motor nerve, structures known as presynaptic active zones accumulate synaptic vesicles filled with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\nOn the muscle side of the junction, the muscle fiber is folded into grooves called postjunctional folds that mirror the presynaptic active zones, the spaces between the folds contain acetylcholine receptors.\nThe muscle surface is covered by the synaptic basal lamina. Postjunctional folds are characteristic of skeletal muscle, particularly in fast muscle fibers.\n\n【2】 # Mechanism of Action\nUpon the arrival of an action potential at the axon terminal, voltage-dependent calcium channels open and Ca2+ ions flow from the extracellular fluid into the motor neuron's cytosol. This influx of Ca2+ triggers excitation-contraction coupling, a biochemical cascade that causes neurotransmitter-containing vesicles to fuse to the motor neuron's cell membrane and release acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft.\nAcetylcholine diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that dot the motor end plate.\nThe receptors are Ligand-gated ion channels, and when bound by acetylcholine, they open, allowing sodium and potassium ions to flow in and out of the muscle's cytosol, respectively.\nBecause of the differences in electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane, more sodium moves in than potassium out, producing a local depolarization of the motor end plate known as an end plate potential (EPP).\nThis depolarization spreads across the surface of the muscle fiber into transverse tubules, eliciting the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus initiating muscle contraction.\nThe action of acetylcholine is terminated when the enzyme acetylcholinesterase degrades the neurotransmitter.\n\n【3】 # Development of the Neuromuscular junction\nThe formation of the neuromuscular junction during embryonic development is well understood.\nDuring development, the growing end of motor neuron axons secrete a protein known as agrin.\nThis protein binds to several receptors on the surface of skeletal muscle.\nThe receptor which seems to be required for formation of the neuromuscular junction is called the MuSK protein (Muscle specific kinase).\nMuSK is a receptor tyrosine kinase - meaning that it induces cellular signaling by causing the addition of phosphate molecules to particular tyrosines on itself, and on proteins which bind the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor.\nUpon activation by its ligand agrin, MuSK signals via two proteins called \"Dok-7\" and \"rapsyn\", to induce \"clustering\" of acetylcholine receptors (AChR).\nIn addition to the AChR and MuSK, other proteins are then gathered, to form the endplate to the neuromuscular junction.  The nerve terminates onto the endplate, forming the NMJ.\n\n【4】 ## Knockout studies\nThese findings were demonstrated in part by mouse \"knockout\" studies.  In mice which are deficient for either agrin or MuSK, the neuromuscular junction does not form. Further, mice deficient in Dok-7 did not form either acetylcholine receptor clusters or neuromuscular synapses.\nMany other proteins also comprise the NMJ, and are required to maintain its integrity.\n\n【5】 # Neuromuscular junction disorders\nIn diseases such as myasthenia gravis, the EPP fails to effectively activate the muscle fiber due to an autoimmune reaction against acetylcholine receptors, resulting in muscle weakness and fatigue. \nVarious toxins, such as botulinum toxin prevent the release of acetylcholine, resulting in muscle paralysis. Myasthenia gravis is caused most commonly by auto-antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor.\nIt has recently been realized that a second category of gravis is due to auto-antibodies against MuSK.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Kangesan for his contributions in proofreading, editing and review processes.\n- The Royal College of Anaesthetists and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) for its support, particularly with the illustrations in Chapters 11, 20, 21, 22 and 28.\n- Industry partners Teleflex, Diamedica and FUJIFILM SonoSite, Inc. for their contributions to the handbook, particularly in the chapters indicated below:\n- Teleflex: Chapter 9 - Diamedica: Chapters 12 and 24 - FUJIFILM SonoSite, Inc.: Chapters 13 and 25\n\n【1】 # A. INTRODUCTION\nAND STANDARDS\n\n【2】 # INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this handbook is to provide guidance for trained anaesthetists working for the ICRC and to offer advice in areas where practice will differ from that in their home country. It is designed to supplement the practical training given in ICRC war-surgery seminars and to support the work of the ICRC in war surgery.\nAnaesthetists working in austere environments will generally be expected carry out a far broader range of tasks than at home. For example, they will often need to help with the triage and clinical management of patients in the emergency room and on the ward, as well as preoperatively assess and optimize all patients for surgery. As team members, they need to be prepared to assist in decisions regarding the limits of treatment for patients, given the capacities of the staff, the workload and the available resources. At various times they may also find themselves acting as theatre runners, porters, lab technicians and assistants in sterilization services! Even in the most austere of conditions it is imperative to realize that anaesthesia is always a significant medical intervention and some basic rules must be adhered to:\n- General anaesthesia is the sole responsibility of a practitioner, who is independent of the surgeon.\n- The anaesthetist must be a qualified, registered specialist with a current licence to practice, which will be validated in the ICRC recruitment process.\n- Minimum standards in respect of preparation, conduct and monitoring of anaesthesia/analgesia must be met. 1 Limiting factors will be related to the infrastructure, including the availability of equipment, intravenous fluids and essential drugs. For example, blood transfusion services often require the support of local organizations and supplies are therefore frequently rationed. In addition, hospital infrastructure may provide very little shelter from the natural environment, particularly in the case of very high or low ambient temperatures. The patient population can also present difficulties, which may be summarized as follows:\n- Immediate versus delayed presentation. The latter group can be significantly dehydrated with neglected and or infected wounds.\n- Cultural and language difficulties, making assessment of past and current medical history difficult, including uncertain \"nil by mouth\" details.\n- Patients with non-trauma pathologies, e.g. obstetrics and paediatrics. Alcohol and drug intoxication may also feature.\nPatient history is best assessed using the AMPLE method:\n- Allergies - Medications - Past medical history - Last meal/fluids - Events leading to admission Safety can be improved by non-technical processes such as the World Health Organization (WHO) checklist. 2 Wherever possible, deployed teams should take the opportunity to create and rehearse emergency drills and \"what if\" scenarios.\nThe subsequent chapters elaborate on every consideration listed here, with the emphasis always on safety and simplicity. Flexibility is a key requirement.\nThe ICRC follows many of the principles and guidelines established by the World Health Organization. These documents are often updated and revised and ICRC anaesthetists are therefore advised to consult the updated versions prior to deployment. 3 The ICRC's equipment and drugs kits are rigorously studied and scrutinized on a regular basis and therefore subject to change, particularly in response to the need to adapt them to different mission settings. ICRC anaesthetists should therefore ensure that they have the most recent version of the related documents prior to deployment.\nRegardless of the skills that you exercise in your practice at home, it is important to always consider the context in which you are working and to understand that the success and safety of many procedures that are generally taken for granted (e.g. the use of central venous catheters, regional block catheters, post-operative ventilation, etc.) depend on the presence of well-trained ward staff and of a support team, neither of which will be present in the austere environment. It is vital to remember that having the skills to pursue a particular course of action does not necessarily mean that you should do so.\n- Anaesthesia always entails a degree of risk.\n- Despite the constraints of the austere environment, minimum standards of conduct and monitoring must be followed. - Patient presentation, history and examination may be varied and difficult.\n- Anaesthetic techniques may need to be adapted to the prevailing circumstances.\n- Regional anaesthesia should be encouraged but strict adherence to safety principles is required.\n\n【3】 # STANDARDS AND STANDARD EQUIPMENT\n\n【4】 # MINIMUM STANDARDS\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) document Classification and Minimum Standards for Foreign Medical Teams in Sudden Onset Disasters 1 and the publication International Standards for a Safe Practice of Anaesthesia 2010 2 discuss the minimum standards required of medical practitioners and other staff involved in the safe delivery of anaesthesia. The two documents also discuss the levels of care provided at different hospitals.\nInternational Standards for a Safe Practice of Anaesthesia 2010 also reviews the anaesthetic equipment that would be expected to be available within hospitals, depending on the level of service that a hospital provides. It lists highly recommended standards that are regarded as minimum and mandatory for the safe conduct of elective anaesthesia. It recognizes that in some situations these standards may not be met due to limited resources. In such situations any operations should be restricted to emergency surgery in order to save life or limb.\nTeams from the ICRC with equipment kits provided by the ICRC should be able to achieve these minimum standards.\nThe following equipment lists and minimum standards for anaesthesia are adapted from the aforementioned documents, with adaptations made for ICRC work in an area of conflict or disaster: 1. Anaesthetic practitioners must be trained professionals and currently licensed to perform autonomous anaesthetics. 2. Records of each anaesthetic given, including preoperative assessment, must be made and stored with each patient's medical record. 3. Appropriate anaesthetic and resuscitation equipment should be present for every anaesthetic given (general and regional). 4. The WHO checklist must be used for every surgical case. 5. Preoperative safety checks of all anaesthetic equipment must be carried out prior to any anaesthetic. This may be daily or before each case, depending on the equipment. 6. An assistant must be available to assist the anaesthetist during all anaesthetics. 7. Supplemental oxygen should be available for all surgical cases. 8. Ideal minimum monitoring during every anaesthetic should include oxygen saturations, electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure and end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring for all those under general anaesthesia. 9. Monitoring alarms, including saturation monitoring and the ventilator disconnection alarm, should always be used and set to appropriate limits. 10. Post operatively patients should be monitored until they have recovered consciousness.\n- Despite the difficult environment, teams deployed by the ICRC must meet certain minimum standards as defined by WHO and others. - Failure to maintain these standards should only be tolerated in extreme emergencies.\n\n【5】 # STANDARD EQUIPMENT\nPre-op -all General anaesthesia The ICRC constantly reviews the drugs available to ICRC field projects. An up-to-date drug list can be made available on request.\nOther kit to consider\n\n【6】 # HYGIENE AND STERILIZATION\nAt home in the Western world anaesthetists rarely have to think about cleaning and sterilizing equipment; items are either single use or another member of the theatre team takes care of that aspect of the work. However, in the field it is the anaesthetist's responsibility to ensure that the anaesthetics department is organized properly, the cupboards stocked and the items cleaned and disinfected or sterilized.\nThe ICRC has produced a publication on this issue, the Sterilization Guidelines. 1 If possible, you should read and be familiar with this document so that you are ready to support the hospital project manager and the head nurse in implementing the guidelines at the hospital.\n\n【7】 # KEY TERMS\nThere are a few key terms of which you should be aware:\nCleaning: the physical removal of contamination without necessarily destroying infectious agents.\nLow-level disinfection: the elimination of most pathogens apart from spores, some fungi and viruses.\nHigh-level disinfection: the elimination of all pathogens except spores.\nSterilization: the elimination of all forms of microbial life so that there is a < 1 /1000,000 chance of an infectious organism surviving.\n\n【8】 # STANDARD ICRC PRECAUTIONS\n- All staff must wash their hands between patients.\n- Non-sterile gloves must be used when staff have physical contact with patients.\n- Staff must change their gloves between patients.\n- Instruments or consumables that come into contact with bodily secretions must not be used on more than one patient.\n- A separate syringe must be used for each drug and each patient.\n- Needles must not be recapped.\n- Use the proper sharp disposal systems.\n- Treat all patients as if they are a high risk for transmitting infection.\n\n【9】 # TECHNIQUES\n\n【10】 # PRE-DISINFECTION\n- All items must be disassembled and then covered with disinfectant (Hexanios 0.5%) for 15 minutes.\n\n【11】 # CLEANING\n- After pre-disinfection, all items must be cleaned before disinfection and sterilization. Brushes should be used for tubing, etc.\n- Wash all items thoroughly with Hexanios 0.5%.\n- Rinse all items with water.\n- Dry the item before its next use or before the disinfection or sterilization process.\n\n【12】 # DISINFECTION\n- Place the item in a Hexanios solution for 15 minutes, then rinse with water.\n- Dry the item before its next use.\n\n【13】 # STERILIZATION\n- This process is performed in an autoclave. Please see the ICRC's Sterilization Guidelines 1 for details.\n\n【14】 # WHICH TECHNIQUE SHOULD BE USED?\nThe risk of contamination depends on the item and its use. As a general guide, the Spaulding classification is used; it describes three categories of risk.\n\n【15】 # CRITICAL\n- The item enters sterile tissue or the vascular system.\n- The item requires sterilization.\n\n【16】 # SEMI-CRITICAL\n- The item will come into contact with mucous membranes and non-intact skin.\n- The item requires high-level disinfection or sterilization.\n\n【17】 # NON-CRITICAL\n- The item comes into contact with healthy skin only.\n- The item requires cleaning and low-level disinfection.\nThe AAGBI (Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has produced standards for the decontamination of anaesthetic equipment. You should try to meet these standards whenever possible; deviation may be acceptable in life-threatening or limb-threatening situations.\n\n【18】 # Item AAGBI standard Alternative suggestion\nOperating theatre Visible contamination with blood or other bodily materials must be disinfected with sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and then cleaned with detergent and water.\nThe theatre floors should be disinfected at the end of each session.\nMinimize traffic in and out of the theatre.\nSchedule the most heavily contaminated patients at the end of the list.\n\n【19】 # Anaesthetic machine surfaces\nLow-level disinfection of all surfaces daily or immediately if visible contamination.\nWipe down with 0.05% sodium hypochlorite (1 in 10 dilution of bleach).  - Sterilization and decontamination of equipment is another aspect of perioperative care for which the ICRC anaesthetist will have to assume responsibility. - Wherever possible, recognized guidelines should be rigorously applied.\n\n【20】 # B. ADMINISTERING ANAESTHESIA\n\n【21】 # RUNNING A RESUSCITATION TEAM\nIrrespective of the location or the composition of the resuscitation or trauma team, human factors and non-technical skills will play an important role in the management of a critically ill casualty. A matrix for non-technical anaesthetics skills has been drawn up and covers the domains of task management, team working, situational awareness and decision making 1 ; there is also a matrix for surgeons 2 . This chapter outlines ideal practice. In resource-constrained environments, individuals will need to undertake several of the roles outlined here.\n\n【22】 # BEFORE THE PATIENT ARRIVES\nThe ICRC team needs to understand how they will be summoned to the hospital. Use may be made of walkie-talkies, mobile telephones or even runners if team members do not live far from the hospital. Lists of names, addresses and contact details of team members should be displayed in the emergency room and operating theatre as well as in the ICRC delegation's office.\nThere may be no formal warning that a casualty is on the way and team members need to be attuned to signals such as explosions and/or gunfire, indicating that casualties may arrive soon. Indeed, a car horn being sounded as the casualty is driven through the hospital gate may be the only warning received.\n\n【23】 # TEAM BRIEFING 3,4\n- The team leader informs the team why they are called to action. It is important to remember that the team is likely to be multilingual and you will very rarely have an interpreter.\n- This will be followed by a description of their \"mental model\" of the sequence of events. (A \"mental model\" describes someone's idea of how something works in the real world.)\n- Members of the team introduce themselves.\n- Roles are allocated.\n- If the type of casualty is known, this is a good opportunity to remind everyone of any possible limitations to the level of care being provided (e.g. for severe burns or severe head injuries).\nTeam leader\n\n【24】 # Trauma surgeon\n- Carries out surgical procedures as necessary, e.g. chest drain advice on surgical plan\n\n【25】 # PREPARING THE RESUSCITATION AREA 5\n- Equipment is checked.\n- Drugs are drawn up or made readily available.\n- Resuscitation room equipment (as a minimum):\n- Airway equipment: facemask, Guedel airway, bougie, Magill forceps, endotracheal tubes, laryngoscope, surgical airway kit, self-inflating bag or a Mapleson C waters' circuit, suction device, stethoscope\n\n【26】 # WHEN THE PATIENT ARRIVES\nThe patient should be handed over by the pre-hospital team in a \"sterile manner\" (minimal additional noise). Unless there is evidence of catastrophic haemorrhage or airway compromise, the team should stand still and listen to the handover. One suitable system for the handover of trauma casualties is \"MIST\" 6 : In the ICRC environment the handover may very likely be carried out by a family member or a volunteer ambulance driver -usually without any medical training. It will often require the use of an interpreter, who should be involved in any team preparation at an early stage. The interpreter will probably be another member of the medical team, i.e. a member of the nursing staff.\nM\nOnce the handover is complete, resuscitation should be carried out in accordance with the airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure system. In trauma cases, a primary survey should begin. It is important for the team to know who is leading the resuscitation as this ensures that all activities are coordinated and that horizontal activity (the simultaneous occurrence of all components of the primary survey; a shift from traditional teaching) is achieved, allowing a decision to be made on the next steps of treatment. In trauma the paradigm changes to ABC, where  represents control of catastrophic haemorrhage. 7 During this time it is important for the team to communicate directly with the team leader and for noise levels to remain low.\nWhen the primary survey or acute A-E assessment and resuscitation has been completed, the team leader should summarizes what has taken place. This ensures that the team maintains situational awareness. A guide for the duration of this summary is a 10-second summary for 10 minutes of clinical management, 8 although shorter intervals might be required at the start of the trauma call.\nOnce the initial assessment and resuscitation have been completed and initial treatment commenced, a decision should take place as to the next stage of treatment and location. Depending on the facility, one of the following options will be chosen: 1. Remain in the resuscitation area for a further period of time for treatment, e.g. medical management or blood transfusion, and subsequently make a new decision. 2. Transfer to operating room. 3. Transfer to ward. 4. Transfer to a medical unit with better facilities, if available.\nIt is important for a decision to be made and communicated to the team.\n- Human factors are increasingly recognized as crucial to safe surgery in developed nations. - This recognition is even more relevant to the ICRC situation -maintaining a team structure requires no special resources and can be a way of offsetting latent failure.\n\n【27】 # PRACTICAL RESUSCITATION\nThe key objective is to respect ABC principles to manage the lethal triad of acidosis, coagulopathy and hypothermia. ABC refers to control of massive external haemorrhage  followed by airway, breathing and circulation.\nResuscitation is not a \"stand alone\" procedure but part of a damage control philosophy which dictates early control of haemorrhage and wound contamination. It is contemporaneous with damage control surgery, the objective being to restore physiology, deferring definitive wound repair until later. The particular challenges for the ICRC practitioner in a resource-constrained environment are the restrictions resulting from the following: 1. Non-availability or restricted supplies of blood and blood products. 2. Limited equipment to assist with resuscitation techniques, e.g. pressurized fluid infusions, patient warming, etc.\nICRC patients are often self-selecting, many of them having travelled large distances from the point of injury. However, recent conflicts have demonstrated that catastrophic incidents do occur at the hospital's \"front door\". Two points are of immediate importance: 1. Delayed patients will often be severely dehydrated and will respond to, and benefit from, intravenous crystalloid infusion prior to anaesthesia and surgery. 2. The immediate injured can receive life-saving intervention by: a Tranexamic acid -1 gram given IV within 3 hours of injury, followed (if practical) by 1 further gram given over 8 hours. b Control of massive external limb haemorrhage by tourniquet. Traditionally, the ICRC has rejected the application of tourniquets because of the disadvantages. Indeed, tourniquets applied to delayed injuries or for prolonged periods have led to significant morbidity. However, when faced with an exsanguinating casualty, military experience has clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. It is appropriate to acknowledge that a tourniquet is only necessary when pressure dressings are failing or patently non-applicable at the outset. The staff member applying a tourniquet should have received appropriate training in the technique. Once a tourniquet is applied, the casualty needs to get to medical care quickly as the longer the tourniquet remains in place, the higher the risk of damage to the limb. The time at which the tourniquet is applied must therefore be recorded. Two hours is often stated as the maximum time a tourniquet can be left in place. However, the actual time to limb damage can be much shorter, depending on the extent of the injury and the condition of the limb before the injury. c Likewise, faced with the possibility of a pelvic fracture, the application of an improvised pelvic binder will minimize the potential for continued bleeding. N.B. Long bone fractures must be splinted to reduce further blood loss.\n\n【28】 # AIRWAY (SEE CHAPTER 8)\nIn the obtunded patient with a blunt injury above the level of the clavicles, the airway is managed with consideration given to a potential cervical spine injury. Concern over a possible cervical spine injury must never detract from the act of establishing an airway by whatever means necessary.\nWhen simple airway manoeuvres, adjuncts and/or endotracheal intubation fail to secure the airway, the ICRC's standard position is surgical cricothyroidotomy with a cuffed tracheostomy tube or appropriately sized/cuffed ET tube.\n\n【29】 # BREATHING\nIn modern trauma anaesthesia or intensive care, considerable resources are applied to managing a casualty's respiratory status and/or complications. In a typical ICRC environment, the advanced techniques are likely to include needle decompression and subsequent intercostal tube drainage of tension pneumothorax or large simple pneumothoraces. Analgesia for chest injury may include intercostal local anaesthesia blocks.\nProlonged post-operative ventilation will very rarely be an option and this consideration will influence difficult treatment decisions.\n\n【30】 # CIRCULATION\nThe largest adverse factor is the difficulty of organizing and administering a blood transfusion. The rationale of transfusion in an ICRC setting is to sustain the minimally acceptable oxygen carriage -not to restore normal haemoglobin values.\nWhen blood is in limited supply, crystalloid resuscitation must proceed carefully as large volumes of saline can produce acidosis and will dilute critical clotting factors. Use Ringers lactate, which is available in ICRC hospital projects.\nLess is more -titrate to a radial pulse. This approach (permissive hypotension) is acceptable for a short period (there is evidence to support use for up to an hour) before surgical control of haemorrhage. The exception is head injury, where it is important to maintain normotension and hence cerebral perfusion pressure. Circulatory access may require intraosseous techniques which are described in Chapter 9.\n\n【31】 # DISABILITY AND EXPOSURE/ ENVIRONMENT\nEven in hot climates hypovolaemic patients will become hypothermic and the lethal triad \"initiated\". Warm the patient by every means possible -including covering all parts of the patients which are not included in the surgical field and warming intravenous fluids (put the intravenous drip tubing into a bottle of warm water or saline, pre-warm fluid in a bucket of hot water). If there are ways to increase the ambient temperature of a cold operating room, do so.\n\n【32】 # RESUSCITATION OUTCOMES\nWhere possible, aim to monitor blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature and capillary refill. If measuring urine output, the target is 0.5-1 ml/kg/hour. After surgery, careful attention should be paid to the patient's level of consciousness; in the absence of pain or hypoxia, confusion and/or agitation are classic signs of hypovolaemia.\n- Resuscitation is one aspect of the damage control philosophy that will often be an inherent part of ICRC surgery. - In treating the lethal triad, ICRC anaesthetists will need to be prepared to adjust the accepted management of ABC.\n\n【33】 # FASTING RULES\nIn this environment, assessing fasting time in patients can be difficult, especially in breast-fed babies. Make things very clear to your interpreter -in some cultures, people who are asked when they last ate will not consider a small snack or a bowl of gruel as being \"eating\"! Standard guidelines are set out below. 1\n\n【34】 # ADULTS\nElective surgery -the \"2-6 rule\"\n- Water and other clear fluids: up to 2 hours before induction of anaesthesia.\n- Food (solids, milk and milk-containing drinks): up to 6 hours before induction.\n- Consider further interventions for patients at higher risk of regurgitation and aspiration.\nPost-operative resumption of oral intake in healthy adults\n- Patients should be encouraged to drink when ready, provided that there are no contra-indications.\n\n【35】 # CHILDREN\nPreoperative fasting in children undergoing elective surgery -the \"2-4-6 rule\"\n- Water and other clear fluids: up to 2 hours before induction of anaesthesia.\n- Breast milk: up to 4 hours before induction.\n- Formula milk, cow's milk or solids: up to 6 hours before induction.\n- Consider further interventions for children at higher risk of regurgitation and aspiration.\nPost-operative resumption of oral intake in healthy children:\n- Oral fluids can be offered to children when they are fully awake after anaesthesia, provided that there are no contra-indications.\nEmergency surgery, trauma, vomiting and bowel obstruction: treat as full stomach and use rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia (RSI) if general anaesthetic is required.\nRealistically, most acutely war-injured patients will need an RSI.\n- Fasting guidelines require careful management to ensure that they are not misinterpreted in the prevailing cultural context!\n\n【36】 # ANAESTHESIA IN THE ICRC ENVIRONMENT\n\n【37】 # OVERVIEW\nAnaesthetists working within the ICRC environment are likely to have to deal with problems and situations that are far removed from those experienced in conventional hospital practice. The following is a set of principles that lay the foundation for more specialized material presented later in this handbook.\nGreater flexibility is required of anaesthetists of working in austere conditions. More importantly, they will also need to go back to the basic principles of anaesthesia and decide what is really important and appropriate in each situation.\n\n【38】 # PREPARATION\nThe ICRC environment is no place for the ill-prepared. This handbook highlights the fact that anaesthetists must be fully trained, registered specialists with a licence to practice . Moreover, anaesthesia cannot be conducted without a minimum of apparatus, drugs, patient monitoring and recording.\n\n【39】 # TEAM STRUCTURE\nICRC anaesthetists will need to develop a very close working relationship with their surgical counterparts. In turn, surgeons will need a good working knowledge of basic anaesthetic considerations. This relationship can be optimized by constant adherence to the WHO safety checklist and respect for principles of human factors in general.\n\n【40】 # CONVENTIONAL CLINICAL STANDARDS VS REALITY\nThere will be occasions when environmental or logistical considerations will require that \"gold standard\" clinical care may need to be abbreviated or ignored, e.g. giving a spontaneously breathing anaesthetic for a head injury. While this may be regarded as an extreme example, other issues occur frequently. In particular, post-operative care must be in line with operative delivery and this imposes restrictions on extensive surgical procedures that would otherwise require post-operative ventilation or other prolonged critical care.\n\n【41】 # CHOICE OF ANAESTHESIA\nFor good pharmacological and practical reasons, the ICRC has traditionally regarded ketamine as the general anaesthetic of choice. That philosophy is upheld in this handbook but attention is also drawn to the increasing role of regional anaesthesia in acute trauma. The use of ultrasound for peripheral nerve blocks has extended regional options beyond the conventional concept of \"regional means spinal\". Like spinals, peripheral nerve blocks have the advantage of \"built-in\" post-operative analgesia. Spinal and regional anaesthesia must always be conducted with the same attention to detail and monitoring as for general anaesthesia.\n\n【42】 # CONCLUSION\nICRC work will often entail difficulties that far exceed those faced by anaesthetists working in a teaching hospital or the equivalent in their own countries. Their clinical expertise has to be combined with a careful appreciation and analysis of the context in which they are working.\n- Ketamine has traditionally been the anaesthetic of choice for the ICRC. It is still of central importance but there is increasing appreciation of the potential to expand regional techniques.\n\n【43】 # KETAMINE\nThe ICRC has designated ketamine as the anaesthetic of choice for major surgery in conditions in which limited resources are available. 1\n\n【44】 # ADVANTAGES\n- Deemed to be a \"safe drug\" in comparison to other induction agents, ketamine can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly.\n- It causes a state of dissociative anaesthesia in which both amnesia and profound analgesia are delivered.\n- Under ketamine, the eyes may remain open, airway reflexes are relatively intact and infrequent purposeful movements, not associated with painful stimulus, may be made. 2\n- Unlike most other induction agents, Ketamine has a unique set of cardiovascular effects, which include an increase in:\n- blood pressure;\n- heart rate; and - subsequent cardiac output.\nThese effects can be very useful in the haemodynamically compromised patient. 2\n- Swallow, cough, sneeze and gag reflexes remain intact.\n- Ketamine is a bronchodilator and can be used as part of the treatment for status asthmaticus. 3\n\n【45】 # DISADVANTAGES\nTwo key disadvantages\n- Ketamine can be associated with excessive salivation, which can be particularly problematic in paediatric cases. This effect can be offset by premedication with glycopyrrolate or atropine, or simply by gentle suction at the corner of the mouth.\n- It has the propensity to cause vivid dreams and hallucinations 2,4 ; to offset these, a benzodiazepine can also be administered.\n\n【46】 # Other disadvantages\n- In the limited-resource environment, some problems may occur that are related to the use of benzodiazepines:\n- Respiratory depression: where recovery facilities are limited, caution should therefore be exercised.\n- Midazolam may be available in ICRC-supported hospitals with deployed war surgery kits. Diazepam may also be available but is extremely painful when given intravenously; it should be well diluted to prevent thrombophlebitis and preferably given after ketamine. Both midazolam and diazepam may be subject to locally controlled drug procedures.\n- It is possible to use ketamine without benzodiazepines but there is then an increased incidence of hypertension, movement and hallucinations.\n- Laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) are rarely available in ICRC environments and should not be used with ketamine, as airway reflexes are maintained.\n- Cases in which surgery lasts less than an hour can be managed with ketamine and a spontaneously breathing patient without any airway adjunct, while cases lasting more than an hour should be intubated.\n- Ketamine is generally safe to use for people who have essential hypertension. However, ketamine should be avoided for people who are hyperthyroid or taking supplemental thyroxine as, in such cases, ketamine will worsen hypertension.\n- Ketamine should be avoided for patients with schizophrenia or other delusional disorders as there is some evidence that it makes these disorders worse.\n- Ketamine should be administered carefully in ischaemic heart disease because of the induced hypertension and tachycardia.\n- When using ketamine for a caesarean section, it should be borne in mind that it crosses the placenta and that newborns may have residual effects resulting from its use. Prior preparation for potential newborn resuscitation is therefore advised if ketamine is used.\n- Traditionally, ketamine was avoided in cases of head injuries owing to fears of increases in intracranial pressure (ICP). However, recent evidence, particularly with regard to traumatic head injury, has shown that, overall, ketamine has benefits in use for head-injured patients. The effect of maintaining blood pressure and therefore cerebral perfusion pressure outweighs any small transient rise in ICP. 5\n\n【47】 # PRESENTATION\n- Ketamine was initially presented as a racemic mixture.\nThe R(-) optical isomer is believed to be responsible for many of the drug's unwanted effects.\n- Ketamine in its purely S(+) optical isomeric is becoming widely available. The S(+) form is more potent and has a faster recovery time than the original form, allowing for lower doses with reduced psychological side effects. 2\n- If S(+) ketamine is used, approximately half the dose of the racemic mixture should be used.\n- Whenever ketamine is used, it is crucial that the vial be checked for the type of ketamine and the concentration presented  and the appropriate dose be calculated.\n\n【48】 # CONCLUSION\nKetamine has been shown to have several benefits in limited-resource environments. These include ease of administration, maintenance of airway control and provision of both anaesthesia and profound analgesia. Furthermore, in exceptional circumstances the use of ketamine allows the anaesthesia-provider to be freed up for other duties. 1,3,4,6 - Ketamine is an essential drug as defined by WHO.\n- The ICRC regards ketamine as the general anaesthetic of choice.\n- Ketamine is unique in providing dose-related profound analgesia and/or general anaesthesia. - The drug has a high safety profile in both adult and paediatric populations and \"emergence\" issues are readily managed with benzodiazepines. Ketamine -either IM or IV -is the anaesthesia of choice for short procedures. 4 IV ketamine recipes - Ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV: produces dissociative anaesthesia; patient maintains own airway. 6,9 - Midazolam 5 mg or diazepam 2-5 mg IV with a small dose of morphine IV, followed by ketamine 80-100 mg IV (1-2 mg/kg) as a slow IV bolus over at least 20 seconds.\n\n【49】 # KETAMINE REGIMES\n-Intermittent boluses of ketamine IV, one-quarter of the induction dose, every 15 minutes. -Doses of benzodiazepines or opioids added as necessary in response to increasing vocalization or purposeful movements with surgical stimuli. 7 - Midazolam 0.07mg/kg IV, followed 2 minutes later by ketamine 1 mg/kg IV. 8 IM ketamine recipes - Bolus dose of ketamine 4-6 mg/kg IM, depending on depth of anaesthesia required. 1,8 This may be very useful in a mass casualty scenario. - Ketamine 10 mg/kg IM with anaesthesia given over 5-10 minutes for surgery lasting 12-25 minutes. 9\nIV ketamine recipe for sedation in short procedures - For very short procedures such as changing burns dressings or splinting trapped limbs using 10 mg/ml IV boluses of 10-20 mg (1-2 ml) ketamine. 9\n\n【50】 # IV infusions bags\n- \"The ICRC way\": ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/ml ketamine in 1 litre of normal saline) titrated to effect following IV ketamine bolus induction. 4 - Ketamine infusion (500 mg ketamine in 500 ml dextrose or saline). Via a standard 15 drop/ml non-micro chamber, drip initiated at 2 drops/kg/min until an adequate level of anaesthesia is attained (usually takes 2 minutes). Drip rate is then reduced to 1 drop/kg/min. Patients will awaken 10 minutes after the drip is stopped. 1\n\n【51】 # Analgesia\n- Ketamine doses of less than 1 mg/kg IV. 1 - Ketamine as an IV infusion should be dosed at 60-180 mcg/kg/hr. For an adult, put 50 mg in a 500 ml bag of saline and administer at 40-80 mls/hr. - Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg IM. 8 IM: intra muscular IV: intravenous\n\n【52】 # AIRWAY MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES\nWhen limited resources are available, it is important to ensure that basic airway manoeuvres are performed well.\nWhen managing an acutely unwell patient with airway compromise, basic manoeuvres to open the airway include the following:\n- Head tilt and chin lift (if no concerns about cervical spine injury);\n- Jaw thrust;\n- Good head position, achieved by combining lower cervical spine flexion, head extension at the atlanto-occipital joint, and positioning the ears anterior to the sternum (\"sniffing the morning air\").\nTo maintain a patent airway a number of devices can also be used:\n- Oropharyngeal airway (Guedel airway); - Nasopharyngeal airway; - Laryngeal mask airway;\n- Endotracheal tube, if indicated.\n\n【53】 # WHEN IS A SECURE AIRWAY (ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION  A SURGICAL AIRWAY) NEEDED?\nIt is important to differentiate between \"ideal\" practice and the realities of a resource-constrained austere environment.\nThe limits placed on care and likely triage decisions need to be worked through by the team in advance as this will vary from one deployment to another.\nThere is unlikely to be access to post-operative or intensive care ventilation and even if the machine is available, the personnel who know how to use it may not be there.\nOxygen may not be available 24 hours a day since power is needed for oxygen concentrators. The safety of stored oxygen in a war zone is a major concern. Oxygen stored in cylinders or manifolds can add to the explosive potential of any live ammunition.\nIntubation should only be carried out if there is a clear, short-term, reversible problem or the opportunity to transfer the patient to another, better equipped, facility, e.g. respiratory arrest secondary to drugs would be intubated but respiratory arrest secondary to pneumonia or COPD would not. Head injuries may be intubated if they can be transferred to an appropriate centre or burr holes can be made at the receiving facility; otherwise they are managed with simple airways (even if the GCS is less than 8).\nUnstable mandible/maxillary fractures or other upper airway compromise may be intubated initially but the patient must then undergo tracheostomy or cricothyroidotomy followed by tracheostomy.\nA large flail chest segment would be intubated in a Western hospital but it is likely that in an austere environment, no more than intercostal blocks and CPAP are used. CPAP machines are unlikely to be available in the ICRC setting and anaesthetists are therefore advised to consider alternative methods that would allow a CPAP effect to be achieved.\nOropharyngeal burns would only be intubated in the short term, prior to tracheostomy.\n\n【54】 # GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR IMPROVING AIRWAY MANAGEMENT\n- Train your assistants before they have to manage a difficult airway. Check what equipment is available, teach them what each item is for and rehearse the process so they know what to pass to you and when. If intubation is likely, rehearse the procedure for RSI, including use of the bougie and the process for managing a failed intubation.\n- Undertake appropriate airway assessment and planning if difficulty is predicted. This should not be restricted to assessing only the ease of laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. It must also evaluate the ease/difficulty of bag mask ventilation, supraglottic airway ventilation and performing a surgical airway.\n- Positioning .\n- Preoxygenation, for three minutes. Most preoxygenation will be performed through a drawover circuit using an oxygen concentrator. The best concentrators currently have a maximum output of 8 l/min; if vital capacity breathing is used with this system, preoxygenation cannot be performed effectively.\n- Maintain oxygenation with mask ventilation if difficult intubation is encountered.\n- Plan for anticipated and unanticipated difficult airway, including use of supraglottic airways 1 and front-of-neck surgical access. 2\n\n【55】 # SURGICAL AIRWAYS\nThe need for a surgical airway should be identified at an early stage and performed quickly. This may be the primary airway (e.g. with maxillo-facial injuries, wounds to the neck involving the larynx or pharynx or haematoma accumulation) or following failure of endotracheal intubation.\nCricothyroidotomy is preferred to tracheostomy in emergency situations as it is generally quicker and there is less risk of complications such as bleeding.\n\n【56】 # ELECTIVE  SEMI-ELECTIVE AIRWAY MANAGEMENT\nThere are four basic ventilation techniques that may be used alone or in combination in order to ensure adequate gas exchange: 1. Bag mask ventilation (BMV); 2. Endotracheal tube and positive pressure ventilation; 3. Supraglottic airway devices (laryngeal mask airway) and spontaneous ventilation; 4. Surgical airways.\n- Airway management follows established principles but careful consideration must be given to the post-operative course as prolonged ventilation will rarely be an option. - Surgical cricothyroidotomy is the definitive emergency airway when endotracheal intubation is not possible.\n\n【57】 # VASCULAR AND INTRAOSSEOUS ACCESS\n\n【58】 # VASCULAR ACCESS\nVascular access is crucial for:\n- fluid or blood product resuscitation;\n- delivery of medication, which includes anaesthetic drugs for induction and infusions for anaesthesia maintenance;\n- fluid maintenance.\nICRC kits include the equipment for peripheral venous cannulation, intraosseous access and venous cut-down.\nCentral venous access has limited use in austere environments because:\n- personnel lack the skills to handle it correctly;\n- many drugs which normally need central delivery (e.g. noradrenaline) are not available in the field;\n- parenteral feeding is not available on most deployments.\nA number of peripheral gauges are included in the kits.\n\n【59】 # INTRAOSSEUS ACCESS\nIntraosseous (IO) access has become a quick and effective mode of attaining early access for delivery of drugs, fluid and blood product boluses until intravascular (IV) access is successfully achieved. IO should be considered in the trauma or resuscitation scenario if IV access is considered to be too difficult or initial attempts have failed. The standard ICRC kit currently includes the IO drill that is often referred to by its commercial name, \"EZ-IO\" (EZ-IO Teleflex). An EZ-IO can be sited in the proximal humerus, the proximal tibia, the distal tibia or the distal femur, the first two being the preferred sites. In adults, the proximal humerus is the primary site, whereas in small children or infants, the proximal tibia is preferred, and the distal tibia or distal femur may be considered.\n- The EZ-IO needle is 15 gauge and comes in three different needle lengths:\n- 15 mm (pink hub: 3-39 kg weight range)\n- 25 mm (blue hub: 40 kg or over)\n- 45 mm (yellow hub: 40 kg or over and excessive soft tissue).\n- The EZ-IO catheter is marked with a black line 5 mm from the hub.\n- If the EZ-IO needle is inserted through the soft tissue and does not reach the bone or the 5 mm needle mark from the hub is not visible above the skin, a longer needle or alternate site should be chosen prior to penetration of the bone cortex.\n- Adults\n- A 45 mm needle is recommended for the proximal humerus site in most adults.\n- A 25 mm needle is used for tibial access.\n- Once inserted, the IO access may remain in situ for a maximum of 72 hours; best practice is to have it removed once sufficient, stable IV access has been established.\n- The aspirated marrow from the IO access can be used for blood tests and group and save sampling.\n- To achieve adequate flow through an IO access, the infusion needs to be pressurized. This may be achieved by injecting fluid boluses through a syringe or applying pressure bags to IV infusions.\n\n【60】 - Fracture in targeted bone - Excessive tissue or absence of adequate anatomical landmarks - Infection in the area of the insertion site - Previous, significant orthopaedic procedure at the site (e.g. prosthetic limb/joint) - IO access in targeted bone in the past 48 hours 1.

Complications are rare:\n- Extravasation of fluid is the most common complication with IO infusions.\n- Compartment syndrome can result if a large extravazation goes undetected.

These call for different types of fluid (depending on availability). Initial patient assessment is important when managing fluid requirements, but can be deceptive in healthy trauma patients.\n\n【74】 # ADULTS\nRESUSCITATION Undertake a ABC assessment for hypovolaemia using clinical parameters and injury mechanism to determine fluid resuscitation. If appropriate, 500 ml boluses of a balanced salt solution such as Ringers lactate should be administered. If the patient is deemed to be at risk of major haemorrhage, a damage control resuscitative approach should be taken using blood products (where available).\n\n【75】 # TRAUMA/MAJOR HAEMORRHAGE 1\nDamage control resuscitation: aim to control bleeding points and base initial resuscitation on a strategy of permissive hypovolaemia (hypotension) involving fluid resuscitation administered to increase blood pressure without reaching normotension.\nThe aim is for cerebration in awake patients, or a systolic blood pressure of 70-80 mm Hg in penetrating trauma and 90 mm Hg in blunt trauma, using blood product resuscitation if available without depleting the blood supplies.\nThis period of hypovolaemia (hypotension) should be kept to a minimum, with rapid transfer to the operating theatre for definitive care.\nTranexamic acid administered intravenously within three hours of injury improves mortality in trauma patients who are thought to be bleeding. 2\n\n【76】 # REPLACEMENT 3\nEstimate deficits or excesses . Add to or subtract from routine maintenance, adjusting for all other sources of fluid and electrolytes (oral, enteral and drug prescriptions). - 25-30 ml/kg/day water - 1 mmol/kg/day sodium, potassium, chloride - 50-100 g/day glucose (e.g. glucose 5% contains 5 g/100ml)\n- Calories: minimum 400 calories (i.e. 100g dextrose)\nEncourage oral fluids and stop IV fluids when no longer needed.\nNasogastric fluids or enteral feeding is preferable when maintenance needs are for more than three days.\nAvoid dextrose-containing solutions in head injuries.\n\n【77】 # CHILDREN 5\n\n【78】 # RESUSCITATION\nThe same principles of fluid resuscitation for trauma apply for children as for adults.\nInitially assess the possibility of using the ABC approach and use physiological parameters including heart rate, capillary refill time and mental state to determine if the patient is hypovolaemic. If a fluid bolus is required, use 10 ml/kg fluid boluses of 0.9% NaCl, other isotonic crystalloids or blood if available and reassess the patient after each bolus.\nDamage control resuscitation: aim to control bleeding as soon as possible. In uncontrolled bleeding do not aim for normalization of blood pressure until surgical control is achieved as this may disrupt any clot that has formed and could increase bleeding. Use 10ml/kg fluid boluses and reassess the patient after each bolus, repeating as necessary. 6 Tranexamic acid (15mg/kg) should be used in children with bleeding caused by trauma and given within three hours of the injury. 7\nPaediatric trauma patients are at risk of hypoglycaemia and a blood sugar should always be checked. If the patient is hypoglycaemic, give a bolus of 2ml/kg of 10% glucose 6 and repeat the measurement to ensure a response.\n\n【79】 # MAINTENANCE\nPost operatively all children should be encouraged to take fluid orally if possible or given oral fluids via NG where this can be achieved.\nIf this is not possible, for IV daily maintenance use 0.45% saline with 5% glucose. Using the 4:2:1 ml/kg formula based on the child's weight will calculate IV fluid rates in ml/hr:\n- 4 ml/kg/hr for the first 10 kg - 2 ml/kg/hr for the next 10 kg - 1 ml/kg/hr for the remaining kgs K+ levels should be checked in children on IV fluids and levels corrected appropriately.\nIf the child has significant insensible fluid losses, e.g. from drains or diarrhoea, the volume of these losses should be measured and this volume given as fluid replacement in addition to their daily maintenance volume. This additional fluid may be Ringer's lactate or in cases where sodium may be lost, 0.9% saline. The sodium levels in these children should be monitored closely.\n- The requirement for intravenous fluids must be balanced against the patient's presentation and actual volume / electrolyte deficit. - Dehydrated patients should always receive intravenous fluids before surgery.\n- Avoid dextrose-containing solutions in head injury and do not use 0.18% dextrose saline for children.\n\n【80】 # BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS\nSupplies of blood in the field are usually extremely limited. All efforts must therefore be made to minimize blood loss:\nPrehospital and emergency room\n\n【81】 # PREPARING FOR TRANSFUSION\n\n【82】 # WHO TO TRANSFUSE?\nThe baseline haemoglobin of the local population is often lower than in the populations of developed countries as a result of a mixture of malaria, intestinal parasites and malnutrition. The decision to transfuse should always be a clinical one based on the relative risks and benefits of a unit of blood in your institution. However there are some broad guidelines for transfusion thresholds.\nFor otherwise healthy individuals with chronic anaemia WHO suggests a transfusion threshold of 5 g/dl unless there are signs of decompensation. In perioperative patients where further bleeding is expected, or for the critically ill, a transfusion threshold of 7 g/dl is suggested. 1 Be aware that in major trauma the initial haemoglobin may well be normal as there has not yet been time for haemodilution. Indeed, some patients who have been transferred in very hot conditions may well be very dehydrated and a falsely high haemoglobin may be measured.\nBesides major trauma, the other two groups of patients who frequently have major blood loss in theatre are women undergoing caesarean sections and large burn debridements. Blood should always be crossmatched preoperatively in these cases.\nBe very alert for insidious severe anaemia in ward patients who have returned to the theatre for multiple debridements of relatively small infected soft tissue injuries and who have open wounds. They can develop unrecognized severe anaemia over a couple of weeks and suffer sudden decompensation either on the ward or under anaesthesia.\nAlways check haemoglobin on these patients both before and after the operation. This can be done formally if you have laboratory facilities or by using capillary blood and a HemoCue machine.\n\n【83】 # HAEMOGLOBIN MEASUREMENT\nThis is performed with a HemoCue machine. Always check which HemoCue machine you are using  and make sure that you use the appropriate cuvettes for the machine that you have.\n\n【84】 # BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND MONITORING\nBlood must be given using a blood transfusion set.2 shows that the patient is A+ and is being given an O+ unit. Patients should have their heart rate, blood pressure and temperature measured every 5 minutes for the first 15 minutes and then every 30 minutes until the transfusion is finished. Transfusion complications are managed in accordance with standard protocols but limitations may be imposed by available resources.\n\n【85】 # SOURCES OF BLOOD AND TESTING\nWhole blood is the most common form (rather than packed cells) in the ICRC setting. The ICRC field hospital blood bank should seek to use solar powered blood bank/vaccine refrigerators as available.\n\n【86】 # SOURCES OF BLOOD\n\n【87】 # External blood banks\nExternal blood banks are run either by the local government or by other NGOs. Their advantage is that collection, storage and testing of the blood is done for you if a verbal or formal pre-agreement is in place.\nThe disadvantages are that it is difficult to find out what quality control processes are in place for crossmatch and infection testing. Often only packed cells are supplied without the possibility of conducting any other component therapy. In addition, these banks are usually open only during \"office hours\", in which case, a supply of O negative blood would ideally also be stored at the field hospital.\n\n【88】 # Field hospital blood bank\nWhere external blood banks are not available, it may be possible to set up a blood bank at the field hospital. 2 It is important to make sure that it is legal for you to do so as some countries have very strict regulations in this respect. Discussions with local and religious leaders may be required. Acquiring blood donors -even for family members -can be difficult in some countries, depending on the prevailing culture and religion. Coordination with local leaders can help to improve donation rates.\nThe advantage of a field hospital blood bank is that a supply of whole blood is available at all hours. The disadvantages are that all testing has to be done by field hospital staff, which requires training and time. In addition, it is necessary to have a secure enough power supply to ensure that the blood bank refrigerator can maintain its temperature at all times.\n\n【89】 # \"Walking\" blood banks\nAn alternative to keeping a supply of blood at the field hospital is to have a supply of donors who have been pretested for infection and blood group. This resolves storage problems but is only possible where there are good communication systems that allow the donors to be called to the hospital as and when required.\n\n【90】 # Family donation\nThis is probably the most common method. Family and friends of the injured person are asked to donate blood and are tested for infection and compatibility. The disadvantages of this approach are that in some cultures people may be extremely reluctant to donate, they may not be compatible or, in areas with high infectious disease rates, there may be problems with HIV and hepatitis.\n\n【91】 # Cell salvage\nSalvage of red cells is possible from a haemothorax.3 can be used. The equipment required is a chest drain with drainage bottle or bag system and connecting tubing, a standard blood collection bag (as used in blood donation) and a clamp. The tube connecting the drain to the drainage bottle is clamped. The needle of the blood collection bag is pushed into the connecting tubing above the clamp, which enables the blood collection bag to fill. Once the bag is full, the needle is removed and the small hole in the connecting tubing covered with a piece of tape (alternatively a further blood bag can be connected). The ICRC often combines a limited field hospital blood bank with a \"walking\" blood bank and family donations.\n\n【92】 # TESTING THE BLOOD\nIt is possible to test for a wide range of infectious diseases including HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, malaria and syphilis. Furthermore, many of these tests produce a quick result that is readily available to clinicians in the field. Blood is also tested for antibodies prior to transfusion. In the field it is only possible to test for ABO and rhesus antibodies. It is more complicated to test for other antibodies such as Kell, Kidd and Duffy, which, although less common, can still cause significant transfusion reactions. For this reason it is important for the patient's serum to be tested against the donor blood (a crossmatch) to reduce the risk of one of these uncommon transfusion reactions occurring.\n\n【93】 # OTHER BLOOD COMPONENTS\nBlood component therapy is not usually available in the field. Fresh whole blood (collected within the preceding four hours and not refrigerated) contains, in addition to red cells, active clotting factors and platelets. It is also warm and not acidotic. This makes it the unit of choice in major haemorrhage, DIC and other coagulopathy.\nOnce blood has been refrigerated, the platelets aggregate and their activity is lost. Blood continues to have active clotting factors for the first 72 hours after refrigeration. After that time their activity rapidly falls off. Blood that has been stored for less than 72 hours is therefore the next preferred option in major haemorrhage and patients at risk of coagulopathy.\nWhole blood can be stored for up to 28 days and is suitable for replacing red cells only. Whole blood can be stored for up to 35 days when using CPDA 1 anticoagulant and for up to 42 days when using SAGM. Packed cells are sometimes preferable in patients who are otherwise at risk of fluid overload, e.g. children (especially those who are malnourished or have severe malaria). Unfortunately, packed cells are often unavailable.\n- Restrictions on blood and blood products is one of the greatest challenges faced by an ICRC surgical team. - Fresh whole blood is extremely useful.\n- Consider obtaining units of blood for patients who may need it at a later date.\nIn practice, permissive anaemia may have to be tolerated while \"local\" efforts are made to organize and deploy a limited supply of blood.\n\n【94】 # DRAWOVER ANAESTHESIA 1\nThe following favourable characteristics of drawover anaesthesia, particularly with modern systems, are important for an ICRC mission:\n- It can be used without supplementary oxygen;\n- It does not require an electricity supply;\n- It is modular, compact and easy to transport;\n- It is very robust;\n- It is simple to operate after appropriate training;\n- It can be used in extremes of temperature and air pressure;\n- It can use a variety of volatile agents;\n- It can be used on adults and children;\n- It is easy to service and maintain - It is economical\n\n【95】 # PRINCIPLES\n- Compressed gases are often unavailable in limited-resource environments.\n- In the absence of compressed gases, conventional continuous flow machines cannot function.\n- In drawover systems the carrier gas is air, with oxygen supplementation if available, prior to the gas entering the vaporizer.\n- The agent concentration is achieved by controlling the proportion of gas flow passing through the vaporizing chamber.\n- Volatile gas is drawn through by a pressure drop generated either by:\n- the patient's inspiration (spontaneous ventilation);\n- a self-inflating bag (manual assisted ventilation);\n- a ventilator (IPPV).\n- The system can be operated in drawover mode when the patient's respiratory effort exceeds the flow rate of the carrier gas flow. The Diamedica DPA system will shift to continuous flow mode if the flow rate of the carrier gas is increased above the patient's minute volume.\n- Inhalation induction is possible with the system:\n- A close-fitting mask with a tight seal is required so that room air is not entrained. If room air is entrained rather than the gas flow, the inspired concentration of anaesthetic agent will be reduced and inhalational induction becomes impossible.\n\n【96】 # PARTS\nA basic drawover system comprises the following five parts: 1. Reservoir 2. Vaporizer 3. Self-inflating bag 4. Non-rebreathing valve 5. Scavenging tube\n\n【97】 # RESERVOIR\n- In its simplest form the reservoir is a piece of corrugated tubing.\n- If a sidearm for supplementary oxygen is present, it can be from\n- an oxygen concentrator; or - an oxygen cylinder, if available.\n- When the patient exhales, the reservoir fills with the carrier gas, e.g. an oxygen and air mix, primed ready for the next breath. - Depending on the patient's minute volume,1 l/min O 2 will produce an FiO 2 of 30-40%; 5 l/min will produce an FiO 2 of 60-80%.\n\n【98】 # VAPORIZER\n- Unlike conventional vaporizers, a drawover vaporizer must have minimal resistance to allow spontaneous ventilation.\n- The same vaporizer may be used for halothane or isoflurane since they have nearly the same saturated vapour pressure.\nHalothane is provided in the ICRC kits. You need to make sure that you know which agent is in the vaporizer.\n- Never allow the vaporizer to tip or fall over when filled as agent can spill directly into the circuit, resulting in an overdose.\n\n【99】 # SELF-INFLATING BAG\n- For controlled or assisted ventilation.\n\n【100】 # NON-REBREATHING VALVE\n- A unidirectional (one-way) valve must be present to ensure that the anaesthetic mix is fully directed towards the patient.\n- The unidirectional valve ensures that no rebreathing occurs and that the cleanliness of the system is maintained. However, a bacterial filter is still recommended if available.\n\n【101】 # SCAVENGING TUBE\n- In order to scavenge exhaled gases, a tube can be attached to the expiratory limb from the non-rebreathing valve.\nThe ICRC currently uses the Diamedica system, which is presented in Chapter 24.\n- Drawover anaesthesia has advantages for ICRC and other limited-resource environments.\n- The system will facilitate spontaneous or controlled ventilation and is not dependent on an oxygen supply. - Safe use requires familiarization with the equipment and close attention to vaporizer contents.\n13. ULTRASOUND-GUIDED REGIONAL ANAESTHESIA\n13.1 GENERIC PRINCIPLES\n- Regional blocks are a valuable addition to aid with anaesthesia for surgery as well as a useful tool in a multimodal analgesic regime.\n- In limited-resource environments the techniques are safe and require minimal equipment and drugs.\n- Regional techniques offer a number of important advantages:\n- Very effective analgesia;\n- Increased patient cooperation;\n- Physiological advantages with attenuation of the sympathetic nervous system-driven stress response;\n- The necessity for general anaesthesia and the associated risks can be avoided;\n- Opiate sparing -in an environment where opiate availability may be limited, especially in the post-operative period. The ICRC strives to ensure that opiates are available in supported hospital structures but it is important to note that difficulties may be encountered with the importation, supply and use of opiates as a result of regulations enforced by local authorities;\n- Potential prevention of chronic pain syndromes.\n- The following contraindications and risks are relative and contextual. Their relevance in individual cases should be discussed by the surgical team and anaesthetist:\n- Coagulopathy;\n- Blocking nerves which may have already been damaged as part of the injury;\n- Risk of masking the features of acute compartment syndrome;\n- Allergy to local anaesthesia.\n- The following general preparations should be carried out before undertaking any regional block:\n- Patient consent and explanation, especially with regard to the length of the block and the \"sensations\" that occur during the onset and offset of the block;\n- Preparation of and access to resuscitation equipment;\n- Non-invasive monitoring to include ECG, BP and pulse oximetry;\n- \"Stop before you block\", i.e. check that the proposed anatomical block site matches the proposed surgical procedure. The subsequent patient position will vary according to the specific block.\n- Ultrasound machine preparation\n- Select the most suitable position for the ultrasound machine, which should be in the operator's line of vision. The ultrasound machine is often placed opposite to the operator and thus on the opposite side of the patient.\n- Set the most appropriate depth for the block, e.g.\naxillary block 3-6 cm.\n- Equipment preparation\n- Regional needles, e.g. short bevelled, 40 mm or 75 mm-long stimulating 22-G block needle, depending on the block. Other lengths tend not to be available in the field;\n- Local anaesthetic for skin infiltration in a 5 ml syringe with 1% lidocaine;\n- Local anaesthetic for the block itself, e.g. 20-30 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine.\n\n【102】 - A nerve stimulator can be used, but directly visualizing the nerves and the needle-tip with ultrasound guidance, and a careful injecting technique is thought to potentially decrease the risk of nerve damage and intravascular injection (never inject against resistance, always ensure gentle negative aspiration before injecting, visualize the nerve, needle tip and LA deposition and spread).\n- A portable ultrasound device is suitable for regional anaesthetic techniques.\n- There is increasing evidence that that ultrasound-guided blocks increase success rates while decreasing the potential for complications. - As with all regional anaesthesia, attention to detail is important. - In the ICRC environment single-shot techniques are appropriate but postoperative nerve catheters are rarely suitable because of safety constraints.\n\n【103】 # Further reading\n1. The New York School of Regional Anesthesia (NYSORA), Ultrasound-Guided Techniques, website, available at / ultrasound-guided-techniques/.\n\n【104】 # ULTRASOUND MACHINE\nThe ICRC now works with the FUJIFULM SonoSite, Inc.1 shows the machine and its key functions. The ultrasound machine has a high frequency (6-13 MHz) linear array probe, which is the most suitable for the regional blocks discussed in Chapter 25, which include:\n- Axillary brachial plexus block; - Femoral nerve block;\n- Popliteal nerve block. 14. PAIN MANAGEMENT\n\n【105】 # INTRODUCTION\nPain has multiple negative effects on a casualty, whose pain \"experience\" will not necessarily be related to the degree of physical insult sustained.\nPain is treated by the three Ps: psychology (humanitarian), physical methods (surgical fixation, physiotherapy) and pharmacology (drugs). The best outcomes are achieved by a balance of these approaches. There is good evidence that effective management of acute pain reduces the development of persistent pain syndromes.\nThe key principles for treating acute pain are as follows:\n- Pain needs to be assessed (scored) and treated and the response to analgesia assessed and re-scored.\n- Treating pain is a proactive process -anticipated surgical pain is easier to manage than established pain. Analgesia should be regular but once the acute situation has passed, dosing should be switched to an \"as required\" basis prior to cessation.\n- Optimum results are achieved using a multimodal approach combing different drugs and/or regional analgesic techniques to modulate the pain pathways at different anatomical and pharmacological levels.\n- The classic approach of a step-wise escalation of pain therapy as described by the WHO pain ladder derives from treating cancer pain. Acute pain is best treated using the \"reverse WHO\" concept, i.e. utilizing a combination therapy as per step 3 of the WHO ladder and then de-escalating therapy as acute pain is controlled. - Regional analgesia provided by peripheral nerve blocks or spinal anaesthesia can be very successful in the acute post-operative period and may be considered as an adjunct at every level of the WHO pain ladder.\n- Severe trauma (in particular, amputation) is often associated with nerve damage, which requires specific prospective anti-neuropathic medication.\n- Historically the \"gold standard\" of analgesia is morphine.\nOpioids may only be administered by trained personnel in patient-monitored environments so that oversedation or respiratory depression can be detected and treated. Naloxone must be available in any area in which opioids are used.\n- IV opioid administration should be confined to the operating theatre or recovery area.\n- Acute analgesic failure in the recovery area can be treated using bolus ketamine (0.1 -0.3 mg/kg IV) as discussed in Chapter 7.\n\n【106】 # SCORING PAIN\nPain needs to be reported by the patient using a simple scale, bearing in mind that communication may be problematic, e.g. children or language issues. Various scales can be used but a pragmatic verbal scale for adults is: Pain should be scored at least as frequently as other patient observations.\n\n【107】 # OPIOID SEDATION / OVERDOSE\nSedation precedes respiratory depression. A simple system is suggested for us in ICRC settings:    Unresponsive patients (sedation score: 3) with a respiratory rate of < 8bpm should be given Naloxone.\n- Adults: one ampoule (= 0.4 mg), dilute to 8 ml (= 0.05 mg/ ml) and inject IV 1 ml incrementally until the patient responds.\n- The contents of one ampoule (0.4 mg) may be repeated up to a maximum of 4 mg.\n- After treatment the patient must be observed closely as the effects of Naloxone are short-lived. Naloxone as an infusion (1-5 µg/kg/hour) is an alternative.\n- Children under 12 years of age: dose = 100 µg/kg (diluted and incrementally dosed) repeated up to a maximum of 2 mg.\n- Acute pain requires proactive multimodal treatment utilizing a \"reverse WHO\" approach. - Neuropathic pain requires additional drugs.\n- Good pain relief is not only a humanitarian consideration. It may also limit persistent pain syndromes and is vital for physiotherapy and successful rehabilitation.\n\n【108】 # PAIN MEDICATION\nAppropriate analgesic dosing for adults and children is indicated in the following tables.\n\n【109】 # Drug\nRoute / dose Comment Paracetamol\n\n【110】 # Gabapentin\n(Note: Gabapentin is not currently provided in ICRC kits and is therefore unlikely to be available in the field.)\nUsually introduced as 300 mg PO od, increasing daily to 300 mg tds. On rare occasions starting dose is 300 mg tds. Max. 3.6 g per day.\nUse for neuropathic pain and prospectively with amputation surgery.\n\n【111】 # Gabapentin\n(Note: Gabapentin is not currently provided in ICRC kits and is therefore unlikely to be available in the field.)\nInitially 10 mg/kg od, then increase to 10 mg/kg bd and then to 10 mg/kg tds. If tolerated, this increase can be made daily. However, if side effects develop, the increase of doses should take place over one to two weeks. Following the increase, this would give a 30 mg/kg total dose.\nNot normally recommended in children but is used in conflict zones characterized by significant paediatric amputee casualties.\n\n【112】 # C. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND EMERGENCIES\n\n【113】 # BURN MANAGEMENT\n\n【114】 When faced with a major burn, it is important for the limits of what treatment is possible in your context to have been discussed in advance and to be clear to the team. Options for severe burns requiring prolonged intensive support may include palliation or transfer, depending on the geographical and cultural context.\n\n【115】 # SOME CRUCIAL ELEMENTS\n- Acute aggressive resuscitation: IV crystalloid fluid, calculated with a modified Parkland formula \n- Early surgical debridement and life-critical interventions such as escharotomies\n- Ongoing and repeated surgical intervention - Potential major blood loss requiring massive blood transfusion, particularly during debridement of burns >15% body surface area (BSA)\n- Analgesia: pain can be severe or chronic and associated with complex neuropathic features, requiring early multimodal treatment\n- Preventive measures:\n- Tetanus prophylaxis - Infection: increased risk of infection due to both reduced natural barriers and the SIRS response to the burn injury\n- Venous thromboembolism: caused by immobility and the SIRS response\n- Hypothermia - Hypermetabolic state: burns injuries result in a hypercatabolic state and an increased calorie requirement\n- Management of inhalation injury:\n- Associated with a high mortality 27.6% 1 - Noxious gases: carbon monoxide (CO) or cyanide poisoning. The diagnosis for CO poisoning is usually made with arterial blood sampling using a CO-oximeter, although this is unlikely to be a resource available in the ICRC environment. However, for both these states clinical suspicion based on the mechanism of the burn is crucial, e.g. prolonged exposure in a confined area, along with symptoms such as low GCS, headache and seizures should provide suspicion for diagnosis. This is particularly important in limited-resource environments. For example, oxygen is a precious commodity, which may only be driven by oxygen concentrators, but remains the primary management tool for CO poisoning. Furthermore, hyperbaric treatment is not possible.\n- Upper airway heat injury: direct heat injury causes swelling to the pharynx, epiglottis and glottis. Signs and symptoms include stridor, change in voice and soft tissue swelling.\n- Lower airway injury: this does not occur as a result of direct heat as this has often been dissipated before breaching the glottis. The exposure of the lower airway mucosa to toxic, noxious elements causes damage to the epithelium, releasing inflammatory triggers with mucus hypersecretion, production of carbonaceous sputum and airway obstruction.\n\n【116】 # ABCDE\nPatients with burns should be treated as any other trauma casualty, i.e. catastrophic haemorrhage, airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure. The burn injury may be severe but should not divert attention from other major life-critical injuries such as a major compressible bleed or tension pneumothorax.\n\n【117】 # BURN DETAILS\nThe following must be ascertained:\n- Mechanism of the burn: thermal, blast, explosion, chemical, electrical.\n- If the burn is thermal, whether it occurred in a confined, contained area, as this adds to the risk of inhalational injury.\n- Extent of burn, depth, body surface area.\n\n【118】 # AIRWAY AND BREATHING\nA low GCS  8.0 mm is the standard recommendation. An uncut tube is important because as the facial and airway swelling develops, intubation can become difficult or even impossible. All potential or actual thermal airway injuries should be treated with the patient in a semi-recumbent position in order to help reduce airway swelling. Consider adrenaline nebulizers.\nInduction for intubation can be with suxamethonium up to 24 hours from the burn. The risk of life-critical hyperkalaemia from extra-junctional acetylcholine receptors prevents the use of suxamethonium from this 24-hour mark to up to one year.\nCircumferential burns around the chest may restrict ventilation and hence emergency escharotomies may be required.\n\n【119】 # CIRCULATION\nFluid resuscitation is a crucial part of management in the first few hours. Venous access may be a problem, in which case the femoral site, which is usually unaffected by the burn, can be used although there is a risk of infection, particularly in case of prolonged use. Central access or intraosseous access may well be required at least for the initial resuscitation efforts. Fluid in the form of crystalloids should be infused and they should ideally be warmed.\nThere is no reason not to establish IV access through a burnt area.\nThe Parkland formula (4 ml/kg/hr x % body surface area) can be used to calculate the fluid requirement for the first 24 hours from the time of the burn. 2,3 The ICRC endorses a modified Parkland formula for fluid calculation:\n2 ml/kg/hr x % BSA (body surface area)\nThe BSA can be calculated using the \"rule of nines. \" This may be more useful in austere environments, where a Lund-Browder chart may not be available.\nThe Parkland formula is one of the many formulae for burns resuscitation. All these formulae are merely guides, particularly on starting resuscitation. The amount of fluid will need to be altered depending on how the patient responds. This will change considerably in the first 24-48 hours as the patient responds to the burn injury. Monitor the urine output. If this increases above 1-2 ml/kg, reduce the amount of fluid and reassess. A major burn is defined as having a BSA of >15% or 10% if associated with an inhalational injury. This type of burn would require fluid resuscitation with the modified Parkland formula. The calculated total fluid is divided in half. The first half is given over 8 hours from the time of the burn and the second half is given over the remaining 16 hours.\n\n【120】 # SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS\nSurgery is generally performed early to wash and debride dead tissue and accurately assess the extent of the burn. This strategy aims to reduce wound infection. Other early surgical interventions can include escharotomies for areas where a circumferential burn produces a tourniquet effect. This can cause a compartment syndrome, necessitating early surgical intervention to release this critical danger. Skin substitutes will not be available in the humanitarian environment and unless there is sufficient unburnt tissue, the options for skin harvest are limited. This needs to be borne in mind when deciding on the limits of treatment.\nSurgical intervention is crucial and may be repeated and frequent. It is necessary to prevent or minimize acute problems such as sepsis and long-term sequlae such as debilitating contractures.\n\n【121】 # ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ANAESTHESIA IN BURN VICTIMS\nAnaesthesia for burn victims can be very challenging, particularly if there is limited access to blood products, advanced monitoring and post-operative critical care.\nRestricted monitoring may mean that oximetry and non-invasive BP monitoring are the only options. Cardiovascular instability is very frequently faced, particularly as a result of ongoing SIRS, which can be compounded further by intraoperative acute blood loss. Repeated debridements in these patients can lead to progressive severe anaemia that can be very well tolerated until the point of decompensation.\nAlways check a HemoCue both before and after repeated surgeries, including small procedures/dressing changes.\nThe choice of drugs in limited-resource environments should include ketamine, a benzodiazepine and if necessary a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. The use of opioids and early consideration of multimodal analgesia should be based on what is available. Neuropathic pain medication may be restricted to amitriptyline. In addition to opioids and the standard analgesic ladder, regional techniques and local anaesthetics should be used wherever possible. Graft sites are often the most painful and femoral nerve blocks when harvesting split skin grafts from the thigh are particularly useful. Otherwise, spinal anaesthesia is ideal for lower limb work. Eextensive burns will, however, restrict the use of regional techniques. Small debridements and dressing changes can usually be safely performed with ketamine IV anaesthesia alone. For more severe burns and longer procedures, intubation is recommended as these patients often develop severe ileus and are at high risk of aspiration.\n\n【122】 # ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE CRITICAL CARE OF BURN VICTIMS.\nIn conventional practice, the critical care of burn patients involves many important considerations which cannot be addressed in limited-resource environments. However, simple procedures, if done well, can significantly improve the prognosis for burn patients and do not require complex equipment.\n\n【123】 # NUTRITION\nEarly enteral feeding via NG is crucial. It is critical to promote and maintain enteral feeding as there is no possibility of TPN. Conventional feeds are made as a high protein, calorific base to help prevent catabolism of viable tissue and muscle and to prevent immune failure and infection. While standard enteral feeds may not be available, therapeutic milks and feeds often are. Milk and egg mixes also work well. It is important to enlist the help of family members with feeding as it takes time and is often neglected on busy, understaffed wards. The hypermetabolic state can exist up to 1.5 years after the injury, with a peak at any time up to two weeks. Besides helping with the catabolic state, early enteral feeding reduces the incidence of ileus and helps to preserve gut integrity and reduce stress ulceration -all of which are major problems in burn patients.\n\n【124】 # WARMING\nIt is important to try and prevent heat loss to reduce coagulopathy, infection and energy requirements. If possible, ensure that the ambient temperature of the room is warm.\nIV fluids can always be warmed by placing them in a bottle of hot water. Try warm packs under the axilla and viable parts of the body that are not burnt.\n\n【125】 # INFECTION CONTROL\nThe risk of infection is very high in patients with burns. Wound infection and subsequent sepsis is the major cause of mortality in burn victims, but prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended. The antibiotic prophylaxis in case of surgery is outlined in Annex 1 on the ICRC's antibiotic protocol. Frequent dressing changes and surgical debridement along with meticulous patient handling can help to provide realistic preventative measures in the austere environment. Ensure that the patient is nursed in a \"clean area\" of the ward, isolated from other infected cases that are commonly found in this environment. Maintain strict handwashing procedures. Do not forget tetanus prophylaxis.\n- Major burns are catastrophic injuries whose management requires intensive and prolonged medical and nursing care. - Standards attainable in specialist burns units are not possible in the ICRC situation and difficult treatment decisions may have to be made when faced with a severe burns injury. - Anaesthesia and perioperative care of smaller burns will focus on managing analgesia, nutrition and infection care.\n\n【126】 # CRUSH INJURIES\nAfter entrapment in rubble there is a high risk of crush injury to limb/s. Sudden release may result in:\n- Reperfusion syndrome: acute hypovolaemia and metabolic abnormalities from release of damaged cell contents. This condition may cause lethal cardiac arrhythmias and hypotension; and/or - Myoglobinuria: causes renal failure if untreated.\nThe same picture may occur after prolonged tourniquet use in the field or after revascularization of a limb.\n\n【127】 # CLINICAL PRESENTATION\n\n【128】 # HYPOTENSION\n\n【129】 # Compartment syndrome\nMassive third spacing occurs in the crushed area over a 48-hour period. This may require fasciotomy.\n\n【130】 # Rhabdomyolysis (also a risk in severe deep burns and electrical burns)\nRhabdomyolysis releases myoglobin, potassium, phosphorous, and creatinine into the circulation. It is indicated by chocolate urine and myoglobin on urine dipstick. This may lead to renal failure.\nRelease of electrolytes from ischaemic muscles causes metabolic abnormalities.\n\n【131】 # METABOLIC ABNORMALITIES\n\n【132】 # Arrhythmias and cardiac arrest\nSecondary to hypocalcemia, hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis from lactic acid.\n\n【133】 # MANAGEMENT\n\n【134】 # HYPOTENSION\nIV fluids up to 1.5 l/hour to produce urine output of 1-2 ml/ kg (insert catheter)\n\n【135】 # MYOGLOBINUREA\nInduce an alkaline diuresis for 48hrs:\n- Add 20 ml 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to each litre of normal saline.\n- Aim for a urine output of 1-2 ml/kg/hr and urine pH of 6.5.\n- Early consideration of IV mannitol (0.25 g/kg of 20% solution over 10 to 30 minutes) may avoid the need for an alkaline diuresis. Note that mannitol is unlikely to be available in ICRC settings.\n- Haemodialysis may be required. Depending on the context, there may be specialist centres available for referral. However, it is important to be aware that many centres are established to deal with chronic renal failure and not with acute renal failure.\n\n【136】 # HYPERKALAEMIA/HYPOCALCAEMIA\n- Calcium gluconate 10% 10 ml - Insulin 10 IU in 50 ml 50% dextrose over 20 minutes - Salbutamol nebulizer - Monitor for arrhythmias and treat accordingly.\n\n【137】 # SECONDARY COMPLICATIONS\nTreat open wounds with antibiotics, tetanus toxoid and debridement.\n\n【138】 # Further reading\n\n【139】 # PAEDIATRIC ANAESTHESIA\nPaediatric anaesthesia is always a large part of the workload in austere environments and may not be an area familiar to all anaesthetists. The vast majority of cases can be handled under spontaneously breathing ketamine anaesthesia. For the rare instances in which volatile general anaesthesia is required, the ICRC provides a full range of paediatric equipment.\n\n【140】 # PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT\nThere are some essential differences between a paediatric population and adults:\n\n【141】 # MALNUTRITION\nMalnutrition is often evident and is the result of pre-existing food insecurity, acute post-disaster food shortages or illness (malaria, measles, diarrhoea). There are a number of implications for anaesthesia:\n- Chronic anaemia - Cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia and easy fluid overload - Increased duration of muscle relaxants - Poor wound healing - Immune compromise leading to high rates of preoperative and post-operative infection, e.g. pneumonia\nThe \"normal\" age-based paediatric formulae (e.g. Weight = (Age + 4) x 2) do not work.\nIt is essential to perform a nutritional assessment and not to carry out surgery on anyone with malnutrition unless it is an absolute emergency.\n\n【142】 # PARASITES\nIn many areas, infection with intestinal parasites is endemic. This leads to chronic anaemia and can be the cause of admission with a high parasite load causing intestinal obstruction. Consider treating any child admitted with albendazole 400 mg PO once only.\n\n【143】 # MALARIA\nMalaria in children can be very severe. Be very cautious of taking any children with malaria to the operating theatre. They can decompensate rapidly with severe anaemia and pulmonary oedema. In addition, they often develop hypoglycaemia, for which they must be monitored. In endemic areas a rapid check for malaria must be made of any child with a fever.\n\n【144】 # POOR GROWTH\nBecause of poor nutrition and repeated bouts of infection during their childhood, these children are, by Western standards, usually small for their age. Even in the absence of malnutrition, our normal (Western) paediatric formulae are not very helpful for estimating weight and endotracheal tube size. Any child admitted to the operating theatre must be weighed. To estimate ETT size, little finger size is a better guide than age-based formulae. A range of tube sizes must always be available.\n\n【145】 # PAEDIATRIC EQUIPMENT\nIt is useful to have a paediatric box set up so that everything is to hand in an emergency.\n\n【146】 # DIAMEDICA DPA 03\nThe DPA 03 has a smaller self-inflating bag for use in paediatrics and a smaller dead space coaxial circuit. The proximal positioning of the patient valve in the DPA 03 ensures that there is minimal weight at the patient end of the circuit. If an Ayres T-piece is preferred, the DPA circuit can be removed and the T-piece added using the adaptor supplied. At the lower flows generated by small children, the reservoir bag automatically fills and pressurizes to the limit of the 7.5 cm H 2 O pop-off valve (provided that 5 l/ min of oxygen is supplied). This pressurized bag turns the system into continuous flow mode. When performing a gas induction, it is very important for the face mask seal to be tight as air rather than an anaesthetic gas mix will otherwise be entrained, making it almost impossible to perform induction; CO induction with a small amount of IM ketamine is very helpful in this situation.\n\n【147】 # AIRWAY\nThe ICRC supplies a full range of sizes of ETTs, face masks and Guedel airways.\n\n【148】 # PRECORDIAL STETHOSCOPE\nIn the absence of conventional monitoring, a precordial stethoscope can be very useful when dealing with babies and small children, allowing rapid detection of differences in breathing, heart rate, heart rhythm and, with experience, even cardiac output. Dedicated precordial stethoscopes only have one earpiece so the rest of the room can be heard at the same time. Standard stethoscopes can be used but must be taped in place and listened to intermittently. Alternatively, a standard nursing stethoscope can be cannibalized to make a single-tube earpiece.  For heart and breath sounds, tape it at the apex of the heart.\n\n【149】 # VASCULAR ACCESS\nThe ICRC has paediatric size cannulae and paediatric intraosseous needles .\n\n【150】 # PATIENT WARMING\nKeep the operating theatre (OT) warm; do not use air conditioning if it is available. Keep the child well covered and make a hat from Tubigrip or Gamgee for use during surgery. Ensure that all fluids are warmed by placing them in a bucket of hot water. In recovery, the use of a survival blanket and, if possible, theatre lights can help to actively warm the child if other devices are not available.\n\n【151】 # THE UNCOOPERATIVE CHILD\nThe vast majority of children in austere environments are incredibly stoical. However, in the case of trauma and burns, recurrent visits to the operating theatre are often required and everything possible should be done to make these visits as atraumatic as possible. For IV access, topical local anaesthetic cream could be used if available, but it is not routinely supplied by the ICRC. Parents can accompany children to the theatre as far as recovery, where a small sedative dose of ketamine either IV (0.5 mg/kg) or IM (2-4 mg/kg) with the child sitting on the parent's lap provides very good conditions for transfer to the theatre and induction. Distraction also works well; it can therefore be a good idea to take some picture books/magazines with you, cartoons on an iPhone  or iPad. an inflated glove with a face on it, etc.\n\n【152】 # POST-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT\n\n【153】 # PAIN\nChildren can be very stoical; in combination with the language barrier, this can make pain assessment difficult. Be proactive by using local anaesthetic and nerve blocks wherever possible. To minimize acute pain, apply the WHO pain ladder and encourage the presence of supportive parents.\n\n【154】 # PAINFUL DRESSING CHANGES\nThe first dressings will be applied in the OT; subsequent dressings may be applied on the ward (with appropriate analgesia) or in the OT, depending on the severity of the case and the need for debridement. In ICRC environments, ketamine is often used when dressings are changed, using the dosages for regular pain management. Ketamine should be administered and monitored by the anaesthetist. Alternatively, morphine can be used as detailed below.\nPain management for bedside dressing changes Morphine 0.2-0.5 mg/kg SC 60 minutes before dressing change in children >1 year\n- ½ dose <1 year - ¼ dose <3 months\nObserve RR every 15 minutes following dressing change.\nIf analgesia is insufficient, move the child to the theatre.\nNaloxone and airway management equipment should be available.\n\n【155】 # NUTRITION\nEven in children who are not malnourished on admission, development of nutritional deficiency in hospital is common. All attempts must be made to reduce starvation times to the minimum possible. Children should be regularly reviewed post-operatively for their nutritional status. Those with major trauma and burns will benefit from systematic nutritional supplementation. Other children should be regularly reassessed and nutritional support implemented if required. If appetite is poor, nasogastric feeding may be required.\n\n【156】 # Nutritional support for children in austere environments\n- Empirically treat all children with albendazole, if not received in the previous 6 months.\n- Give infants small feeds frequently.\n- Encourage breast-feeding in <1-year-olds, every 2-3 hours.\n- Ensure oral intake as soon as surgically allowed.\n- If the child is anaemic, with Hb <10 g/dl, prescribe folic acid.\n- If the child has diarrhoea, give oral rehydration solution (ORS) and reintroduce feeds as soon as possible. Check that the child continues on a normal diet and add readyto-use therapeutic food (RUTF), such as BP-100 biscuits or Plumpy'Nut (PPN):\n- Child <8 kg: give 2 PPN per day.\n- If in any doubt, consult a nutritionist. A nutritionist is often available for consultation in the field setting or at headquarters level.\n- Paediatric anaesthesia will be a feature of conflict and disaster areas.\n- While both stoical and resilient, the children encountered will frequently be suffering from chronic disease and malnutrition. - Guidelines employed for paediatric anaesthesia in developed countries will often be inappropriate in the ICRC setting.\n\n【157】 # NEONATAL RESUSCITATION\nDuring a caesarean section in the field the anaesthetist is frequently needed to help with neonatal resuscitation.\nHave a box set up with the appropriate equipment. Ensure that a colleague monitors the mother while you are occupied with the baby. Remember that your colleague is unlikely to be another anaesthetist but will more likely be a member of the nursing team.\n\n【158】 # EQUIPMENT FOR THE NEONATAL RESUSCITATION TROLLEY\n- Towels - Paediatric Ambu bag with a neonatal face mask - As small a gauge cannulae as available (24G cannulae are available in ICRC kits)\n- Small soft suction catheter - Scissors and clamp (for cord clamping)\n- Stopwatch if possible A well baby: blue, good tone, cries within a few seconds of birth, HR 120-150, establishes good respiration quickly.\nLess well baby: blue, poor tone, HR 90-120 seconds.\nSick baby: pale, floppy, HR very slow (<60), not breathing.\nThe vast majority of babies will respond to being dried and warmed.\nUp to 10% of newborn babies will need some initial basic respiratory support but will usually respond very quickly to simple airway measures.\n\n【159】 # QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER IN THE SICK BABY\n\n【160】 # Is meconium present?\nIf meconium is present and causing obstruction then gently suction the mouth, the nose and then the oropharynx.\nDeep suction should always be avoided as it can cause fatal bradycardia. Do not suction routinely if there is no evidence of obstruction.\n\n【161】 # Is the baby septic?\nRisk factors for newborn sepsis include prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal sepsis, prolonged maternal labour and preterm labour. In any unwell newborn child, sepsis should be considered a possibility.\nIf in doubt give antibiotics (benzylpenicillin 25 mg/kg 12 hourly and gentamicin 3-5 mg/kg 24 hourly; ampicillin 50-100 mg/ kg 12 hourly can be used as an alternative to benzylpenicillin). If Gram -ve bacteria are suspected, give cefotaxime 50 mg/kg 24 hourly. Antibiotic therapy usually lasts 7 days.\nCheck blood glucose and treat as required (recommended: use 10% glucose 2.5 ml/kg in order to provide sufficient glucose without volume overload).\n\n【162】 # Has the mother taken any drugs?\nUse of traditional medicines, some of which have respiratory depressant properties, during labour is common. If a history of medication during labour is obtained and the baby's respiration is depressed, consider Naloxone 0.1 mg/kg IV or IM.\nHaving given Naloxone, observe for a minimum of 2 hours.\n\n【163】 # How far should I take the resuscitation?\nMost newborn babies respond to having their airways opened and some initial help with breathing. If this does not meet with a good response and there are no other reversible causes, continue ventilating.\nRespiratory arrest only: continue for up to 20 minutes; if there is then no response, stop.\nCardiorespiratory arrest: think carefully before commencing chest compressions -is special neonatal care available? If there has been no response after 10 minutes of effective resuscitation, resuscitation should be abandoned.\n\n【164】 Ensure that the baby's head is in a neutral position (towel roll under the shoulders).\nResuscitation should be with air, not oxygen.\nIf adrenaline is given, the dose is 10-30 mcg/kg IV -but consider the circumstances carefully before commencing advanced life support.\n\n【165】 # POST-RESUSCITATION CARE\nKeep the baby warm.\n\n【166】 # RESPIRATORY SUPPORT\nIf the baby is grunting, nasal CPAP using 1 l/min from an oxygen concentrator through nasal specs can be very effective. CPAP machines are unlikely to be available in ICRC settings and anaesthetists are therefore advised to consider alternative methods to achieve a CPAP effect.\n\n【167】 # FEEDING\nEncourage feeding as soon as possible and monitor blood glucose. If unable to feed, consider nasogastric feeding of breast milk.\n\n【168】 # Umbilical arteries\nUmbilical vein - The ICRC anaesthetist may be expected to adopt the role of neonatologist.\n- Most neonatal problems will often respond to simple measures. If these fail, careful decisions must be made in respect of further cardio-respiratory resuscitation.\n\n【169】 # Further reading\n\n【170】 # OBSTETRICS\nRegardless of the type of deployment -post-disaster or conflict -babies continue to be born and obstetrics always form part of the workload. Many anaesthetists may not carry out obstetric anaesthesia in their regular work. Even for those who practise obstetric anaesthesia regularly, there are some different considerations and limitations in the field.\n\n【171】 # PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT\nThe general health of the mother in some parts of the world may be less than optimal and account will need to be taken of malnutrition and high rates of malaria, TB and HIV. It is common for there to be very little antenatal care or none at all, and conditions such as placenta praevia and pre-eclampsia may therefore be undiagnosed. Access difficulties may often lead to mothers arriving very late for caesarean section; it is not uncommon for patients to have been in obstructed labour for several days.\nBesides your usual preoperative assessment, you will need to consider the following:\n- General maternal state: chronic anaemia, TB, HIV, malnutrition, malaria, congenital heart disease and valvular abnormalities\n- Unrecognized antenatal problems: placenta praevia, pre-eclampsia and grande multiparous pregnancy\n\n【172】 # CHOICE OF ANAESTHETIC TECHNIQUE\nSpinal anaesthesia is usually the safest option, except in cases of major haemorrhage and coagulopathy or maternal respiratory distress.\n\n【173】 # SPINAL ANAESTHESIA FOR CAESAREAN SECTION\nPre-delivery 1. Check the blood pressure every 2 minutes in the early stages of the block 8. Treat hypotension aggressively with vasopressorsnausea and vomiting is an early sign of hypotension 9. Assess the block height -you are aiming for a block to nipple height. It is rare for ethyl chloride to be available in the field but you will usually have access to some ice or cold packs as most field hospitals will have a refrigerator. Other clear signs are inability to lift the legs and warm dry feet with dilated vessels. Assessment can be very difficult even with a translator present. Have the surgeon check with forceps before using the scalpel 10. Give Cefazolin 1 g IV\n\n【174】 # After delivery\n11. Administer Oxytocin 5 units slowly -causes vasodilation and reflex tachycardia. Make sure that a twin is not present before administering it! 12. An oxytocin infusion may be asked for. Put 30 units in a 500 ml bag of saline and give over 4 hours. Pumps are not usually available; use the drops per minute method.\nBe aware that oxytocin infusion may have also been administered prior to the decision to proceed with a caesarean section 13. Motor power and sensation should be fully returned by 6 hours; the patient should remain in bed until that time\nIn case of pain during a caesarean section:\n- Ketamine 5-10 mg bolus IV is very effective - Local anaesthetic supplementation by surgeon\n\n【175】 # Differences from practice in non-austere environments\n\n【176】 # Spinal opiates\nGenerally these are avoided as monitoring on the ward may be suboptimal.\n\n【177】 # Lower volume spinals\nWe often use anaesthetic volumes of 2-3 ml. In the field high blocks and hypotension can be difficult to manage and a total spinal is very difficult to give. It is therefore usually safer to use lower volumes with the risk of some intraoperative pain -which is easily and safely treated with ketamine and/or local infiltration.\n\n【178】 # GENERAL ANAESTHESIA FOR CAESAREAN SECTIONS\nPre-delivery 1. Full monitoring 2. Left lateral tilt 3. Pre-oxygenation 4. Have all intubation equipment, including bougie, close to hand 5. Ensure that an assistant is present who understands how to apply cricoid pressure and how to use a bougie 6. Rapid sequence induction (As anaesthetists are aware, this is one of the very few occasions where rapid induction is a must) 7. Maintenance with oxygen and volatile or, if the patient is shocked, with ketamine 8. Cefazolin 1 g IV prior to surgery Post-delivery 1. Oxytocin as for spinal anaesthesia 2. Give opiates, unless you have used ketamine, in which case opiates are usually unnecessary 3. TAP block by the surgeon or anaesthetist for post-operative analgesia 4. Extubate a patient when awake, either on the side or in a sitting position\n\n【179】 # Differences from practice in non-austere environments\nAssistance A skilled assistant is rarely available. Make sure that you have identified someone in your team who can help with cricoid pressure and difficult intubations and teach them what you need.\n\n【180】 # Ketamine for caesarean section\nIn the shocked patient, using ketamine for induction and maintenance is a very effective technique. Owing to the risk of aspiration, it is usually best for a fully trained anaesthetist to intubate and ventilate patients having a general anaesthetic for caesarean section.\nIf a general anaesthetic is necessary but you are worried about a difficult airway, a ketamine anaesthetic with spontaneous ventilation and oxygen via a Hudson face mask may be a safer option. Keep the patient with her head slightly raised in order to reduce the risk of regurgitation. Ketamine crosses the placenta, so be aware of the possibility of neonatal respiratory depression. To reduce the dose of ketamine required, it is good if the surgeon can infiltrate with local anaesthetic. For many anaesthetic officers in the developing world, this is the standard technique for caesarean section. The dose of ketamine for caesarean section is 1 mg/kg as higher doses cause neonatal depression. It is worthwhile discussing the anticipated absence of muscle relaxation with the surgeon and hence the need for surgeons to adjust their technique, e.g. make a larger incision.\n\n【181】 # OBSTETRIC EMERGENCIES\nAn obstetrician is rarely available in the field. The medical management of obstetric patients will therefore often fall to the anaesthetist. There may also be an ICRC mobile midwife working within the hospital facility who will be able to support you.\n\n【182】 # Pre-eclampsia\n\n【183】 # Recognition\nPre-eclampsia is defined as a triad of hypertension (>140/90), proteinuria and peripheral oedema.\nSevere pre-eclampsia is hypertension of >140/90 with 2+ protein and/or other symptoms, e.g. headache, epigastric pain, visual disturbance, jitteriness, breathlessness, reduced urine output.\nEclampsia is pre-eclampsia with seizures.\nHELLP syndrome is hypertension, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets; in the field we are usually unable to measure platelets and liver enzymes and the condition is classified as severe pre-eclampsia.\n\n【184】 # Management of severe pre-eclampsia\nThe treatment is delivery of the placenta after stabilization of the mother.\nThe management aims are to control the hypertension and to prevent seizures. These patients are at risk of pulmonary oedema, making careful fluid management essential.\n- IV access - Blood pressure management: aim for 130-140/90-100\nGive hydralazine 5 mg over 3 minutes\n- Repeat after 30 minutes if not sufficient - Maximum dose: 20 mg  give labetalol 10 mg IV\n- Keep increasing the dose by 10 mg every 10 minutes until a satisfactory effect is obtained Hydralazine is available in ICRC kits but labetalol is currently not available.\n- Seizure prevention Magnesium loading dose: MgSO 4 4 g slow IV injection (10-15 minutes). The 50% magnesium solution should always be diluted to a maximum of 20% for IV injection. Magnesium maintenance dose:\n- Pump available: 1 g/hr for 24 hours after last convulsion or delivery\n- No pump: 5 g IM (2.5 mg to each buttock with 1 ml 2% lignocaine) 4 hourly for 24 hours\n- Do not give further magnesium if knee jerk absent or respiratory depression occurs\n- Treatment for respiratory depression: calcium gluconate 1 g IV (10 ml of 10%) over 10 minutes; restart Mg at half previous rate once the depression is resolved\n- Fluid management\n- Urinary catheter aiming at 0.5 ml/kg/hr max - Fluid input/output chart - Restrict intake to 1 ml/kg/hr - Furosemide may be required\n\n【185】 # - Management of convulsions\nMost eclamptic fits are self-limiting. Put the patient in the left lateral position and maintain the airway giving oxygen. If magnesium has not yet been started, give it. If convulsions recur after magnesium, give a further 2 g by slow IV injection after 15 minutes. If convulsions still continue or if magnesium is not available, give diazepam 10 mg IV slowly with appropriate airway maintenance.\nWhilst eclamptic fits would be the most common diagnosis and can occur even in the absence of hypertension in endemic areas, always consider cerebral malaria and meningitis.\n\n【186】 # - Delivery\nThe mother should be stabilized prior to delivery If a caesarean section is required, the technique of choice is a spinal anaesthetic unless there is clear evidence of coagulopathy, in which case GA is preferable.\n- GA in pre-eclampsia\n- Intubation may be difficult due to soft tissue oedema - Hypertensive responses to laryngoscopy and extu bation must be attenuated: MgSO 4 if not already loaded - Fentanyl / labetalol. Avoid ketamine if possible - Post-delivery The mother will need to be closely monitored for 24 hours owing to the ongoing risk of convulsions and fluid overload.\n- Analgesia\n- Paracetamol - Morphine - TAP blocks - Avoid NSAID owing to risk of renal failure - Fluids\n- Restrict to 1 ml/kg/hr and start oral intake immediately; when tolerated, stop infusion\n- Magnesium\n- Continue for 24 hours from the last convulsion\n- Management of severe pre-eclampsia and (insipient) heart failure\n- The mother with severe pre-eclampsia may also be in heart failure\n- Signs and symptoms:\n- Respiratory distress caused by pulmonary oedema\n\n【187】 # Obstetric haemorrhage\nObstetric haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide.\n\n【188】 # APH: placenta praevia and abruption\n\n【189】 # PPH:\nThe four Ts:\n- Tone: atony: grand multip, prolonged obstructed labour, older mothers\n- Tissue: retained products - Trauma: genital tract lacerations - Thrombin: coagulopathy Obstetric haemorrhage is difficult to manage because of the lack of blood products and often very late presentation.\n\n【190】 # Management APH\n- IV access and blood for crossmatch and Hb - Rapid IV fluid bolus to restore BP (warmed fluids)\n- Left  - Tone:\n- Oxytocin 5 iu slow IV bolus plus 30-40 units in 500 ml over 4 hours - Ergometrine 0.5 mg IM (not in asthmatics or pre-eclamptics)\n- Misoprostol 1000 mcg rectally - Bimanual compression of uterus - Early decision to perform a hysterectomy in case of lack of blood products\n- If the patient is already in theatre, it is possible to continue under spinal anaesthesia but conversion to GA may be necessary\n\n【191】 # HEAD INJURY/ NEUROSURGERY\nHead injury can be classified as either primary or secondary. Primary injury occurs directly, as a result of a penetrating or blunt injury, or indirectly as a result of the brain moving within the skull vault, sustaining a variety of different injury patterns. Secondary injury occurs as a result of the physiological and pathological changes in response to injury, which can exacerbate the primary injury by producing ischaemia in the at risk watershed areas around the primary injury extending the area damaged. 1 Patients with a head injury may require anaesthesia to facilitate surgery directly related to the head injury or for other injuries. The anaesthetist's targets are to provide good operative conditions and adequate anaesthesia while minimizing any further secondary injury. The most important causes of secondary injury are listed in  Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is dependent on the mean arterial pressure (MAP), the intracranial pressure (ICP) and the central venous pressure (CVP).\n\n【192】 # CPP = MAP -ICP -CVP\nAlthough it is unlikely that you will be able to measure ICP, it can be assumed that it will be raised in a patient with a head injury (ICP > 20-25 mmHg would be considered a treatment threshold in a monitored setting) and we know that cerebral blood flow (CBF) and hence ICP are affected by PaO . PaCO 2 and MAP; cerebral autoregulation will be disrupted in a head injury and becomes pressure dependent. It would therefore be pragmatic to attempt to maintain a MAP greater than 90 mmHg, PaO 2 > 100 mmHg (13 Kpa), normal PaCO 2 (30-35 mmHg) and to use manoeuvres to minimize increases in CVP (tilt head upwards, loosen neck collars and ties, etc.).\nThe anaesthetic technique used should therefore attempt to rapidly induce anaesthesia, secure the airway and control ventilation while limiting haemodynamic instability. Ketamine is the ICRC's anaesthetic agent of choice for major surgery, and standard practice includes craniotomy under ketamine anaesthesia. Ketamine has traditionally been thought to be contraindicated in cases of brain injury but the evidence base for this position is weak and many authors argue that any adverse effects of the drug on cerebral physiology are attenuated or reversed by controlled ventilation and the haemodynamic stability that it offers. 3 The perioperative period can be divided into three distinct phases; although the physiological goals remain the same, there are specific considerations for each phase.\n\n【193】 # PREOPERATIVE\nThe first priority is to ensure that the patient is adequately resuscitated to maintain an appropriate blood pressure to perfuse the brain. 4 This resuscitation should be with fluids and blood products, as available, in order to optimize oxygen delivery to the brain. There is often a conflict between the concept of hypotensive resuscitation and achieving adequate cerebral perfusion pressure, which may require compromise. Life-threatening extracranial injuries, particularly non-compressible haemorrhage, will require treatment before any intracranial injuries. If the patient's level of consciousness is compromised, and especially if the GCS is </= 8, the patient should be intubated early to enable adequate oxygenation, ventilation and airway protection.\n\n【194】 # MANNITOL\nIf there are signs of raised intracranial pressure such as pupillary abnormalities or other lateralizing, focal neurological signs, intravenous mannitol (0.5 g/kg) may be used as a temporary measure. Mannitol can cause hypotension in under-resuscitated patients and will cause diuresis; a urinary catheter should therefore be inserted and the blood pressure monitored closely. The ICRC does not provide mannitol in all contexts as its benefit is only temporary. The availability of mannitol will therefore be dependent on the availability of appropriate referral structures.\n\n【195】 # INTRAOPERATIVE\nFollowing appropriate resuscitation, anaesthesia should be induced with ketamine (1-2 mg/kg, depending on the clinical condition of the patient) and muscle relaxation achieved with suxamethonium using a rapid sequence induction (RSI) technique. While securing the airway, consider the possibility of a cervical spine injury and attempt to minimize unnecessary neck movement but remember that the priority is securing the airway and that the risks of exacerbating a cervical injury with careful laryngoscopy are low.\nAnaesthesia can be maintained with ketamine or a volatile anaesthetic technique and supplemented with a longacting neuromuscular blocking drug. Ventilation should be controlled manually or mechanically in order to control end-tidal CO 2 : end-tidal CO 2 should ideally be monitored.\nFluid balance should be monitored and a urinary catheter inserted. Urine output (> 0.5 ml/kg/hr) is a good indication of adequate resuscitation. Mannitol, if administered, may cause diuresis.\nAlthough there is no evidence that seizure prophylaxis prevents late onset seizures, it is often given as unrecognized seizures while anaesthetized will cause a rise in the cerebral metabolic rate and may increase intracranial pressure (ICP). A loading dose of intravenous phenytoin (20 mg/ kg) should be given slowly with blood pressure and ECG monitoring, as it can cause hypotension and arrhythmias.\nCareful attention to perioperative targets will optimize the patient's outcome. 5 Parameter Targets\n\n【196】 # POST-OPERATIVE\nPost-operatively goals remain the prevention of secondary brain injury by maintaining the intraoperative targets into the immediate post-operative period and by providing good nursing care. If the GCS remains low (</= 8), it may be wise to consider an early tracheostomy to ensure airway protection. 6 Fluid balance and nutrition are important considerations to optimize recovery; careful input and output monitoring are required and enteral nutrition through a nasogastric tube and prophylaxis for stress ulceration may be necessary. If analgesia is required, avoid NSAIDs and use regular paracetamol and opioids as needed. Seizures should be treated if they occur but there is no evidence that anti-seizure prophylaxis prevents the occurrence of late onset epilepsy. The CRASH study 7 confirmed that there is no place for the use of steroids in the treatment of head injury.\n\n【197】 # SUMMARY\nAnaesthesia for head-injured patients is based on good quality anaesthesia with controlled ventilation and haemodynamic control, maintaining the specific targets to reduce secondary brain injury. Attention to detail needs to be maintained into the post-operative period and include good nursing care to optimize recovery and rehabilitation.\n- Successful anaesthesia for head injuries relies on careful attention to physiology in order to minimize secondary insult. - Despite the best care, the limitations of post operative ventilation and critical care will have an impact on the outcome of severe head injury. - Several doses may be required if there is severe hypotension or bronchospasm. If several doses of adrenaline are required, consider starting an intravenous infusion.\n- Give crystalloid boluses (Large volumes may be required.)\n- Adult: 500-1000 ml - Child: 20 ml/kg\nTransfer the patient to an appropriate critical care area, if available. Otherwise keep the patient in the theatre or recovery area, intubated and if necessary hand-ventilated until there is no risk to the airway. This is important since there is a clearly defined cause that is probably very reversible.\n\n【198】 # SECONDARY MANAGEMENT\nGive chlorphenamine IV\n- Adult: 10 mg - Child 6-12 years: 5 mg - Child 6 months -6 years: 2.5 mg - Child < 6 months: 250 μg/kg Give hydrocortisone i.v.\n- Treat using salbutamol infusion.\n- Consider giving IV magnesium sulphate.\n- Severe anaphylaxis can be immediately life threatening but is reversible with prompt recognition and treatment.\n\n【199】 # LOCAL ANAESTHETIC SYSTEMIC TOXICITY (LAST)\nLocal anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) can occur after administration of an excessive dose, with rapid absorption, or because of an accidental intravenous injection.\nManagement can be challenging and prolonged resuscitation may be required, especially in the case of cardiac toxicity. Management is especially difficult in ICRC settings, with prevention being particularly important. Careful calculation of local anaesthetic (LA) doses is crucial, as is the practice of always aspirating before injecting LA.\nLAST usually manifests as central nervous system (CNS) toxicity (tinnitus, confusion and, ultimately, seizures) or cardiovascular toxicity (hypotension, dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest). As the CNS is more susceptible, these symptoms tend to develop at lower concentrations.\n\n【200】 # RECOGNITION\n\n【201】 # SIGNS OF SEVERE TOXICITY (DELAYED ONSET IS POSSIBLE)\n- Sudden alteration in mental status, severe agitation or loss of consciousness, with or without tonic-clonic convulsions\n- Cardiovascular collapse\n\n【202】 # IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT\n- Stop injecting the LA.\n- Get HELP.\n- Maintain the airway and, if necessary intubate.\n- 100% oxygen ensuring adequate lung ventilation.\n(Hyperventilation may help by increasing plasma pH in the presence of metabolic acidosis.)\n- Control seizures: give a benzodiazepine or thiopental in small incremental doses.\n\n【203】 # IN CIRCULATORY ARREST\n- Start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using ALS protocols.\n- Manage arrhythmias, these may be refractory to treatment.\n- Give IV lipid emulsion .\n- Continue CPR throughout treatment with lipid emulsion.\n- Recovery from LA-induced cardiac arrest may take >1 hour.\n- Lignocaine should NOT be used as an anti-arrhythmic therapy.\n- Arrange safe transfer to an appropriate clinical area.\n\n【204】 # WITHOUT CIRCULATORY ARREST\n- Use conventional therapies to treat:\n- Hypotension - Bradycardia - Tachyarrhythmia\n- Consider use of lipid emulsion.\n\n【205】 # LIPID EMULSION REGIMEN\n\n【206】 # Immediately\n- Initial IV bolus of 20% lipid emulsion 1.5 ml/kg over 1 minute.\n- Start an IV infusion of 20% lipid emulsion at 15 ml/kg/hr.\n\n【207】 # After 5 minutes\nGive a maximum of two repeat boluses (same dose) if:\n- cardiovascular stability has not been restored or there is circulatory deterioration.\nLeave 5 minutes between boluses. A maximum of three boluses can be given.\nContinue infusion at same rate, but double the rate to 30 ml/kg/hr at any time after 5 minutes, if cardiovascular stability has not been restored or a previously adequate circulation deteriorates.\nContinue infusion until stable or the maximum dose of lipid emulsion has been given.\n\n【208】 # MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA\nMalignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare pharmacogenetic autosomal dominant muscle disorder of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is induced by exposure to suxamethonium and all volatile anaesthetic agents and is characterized by hypermetabolism, muscle rigidity and hyperpyrexia.\nWithout standard monitoring in a limited-resource environment, recognition will be difficult. It is important to remain clinically vigilant; treatment with dantrolene (if available) can be life-saving. Post-exposure investigations to confirm the diagnosis as normally performed in a robust healthcare system will rarely be feasible in a limited-resource environment.\nOwing to the reasons stated above, the rare nature of MH and its high cost, dantrolene is not currently available in ICRC structures.\n\n【209】 # RECOGNITION\n- Onset may be within minutes of induction or insidious.\n- Unexplained increase in EtCO 2 and - Unexplained tachycardia and - Unexplained increase in oxygen requirement - Temperature changes are a late sign.\n- Previous uneventful anaesthesia does not rule out MH.\n\n【210】 # IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT\n- STOP all trigger agents.\n- CALL FOR HELP. Allocate specific tasks.\n- Remove the breathing system and change to an Ambu bag and hyperventilate with 100% O 2 at the highest flow possible.\n- Maintain anaesthesia with intravenous ketamine.\n- ABANDON or FINISH surgery as soon as possible.\n- Muscle relaxation with non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug.\n\n【211】 # MONITORING AND TREATMENT\n- Give dantrolene (2.5 mg/kg immediate IV bolus).\n- Repeat 1 mg/kg boluses as required to a maximum of 10 mg/kg.\n- Initiate active cooling, trying to avoid vasoconstriction.\nCool blocks may be available, otherwise wet cloths draped on the patient with a standard room fan blowing is quite effective. Bladder irrigation with refrigerated cold water.\n- Tepid sponging.\n- NG tube with cold fluid washout.\n- Cold to the axillary areas.\n\n【212】 # TREAT\n- Hyperkalaemia: if ECG available, large peaked t waves initially, followed by widening of QRS and bradycardia - 20 ml/kg crystalloid bolus followed by twice the maintenance dose, aiming for a urine output of 2-3 ml/kg/hr\n- Consider a forced alkaline diuresis: mannitol dose 0.25-0.5 g/ kg bd; NaHCO 3 dose 2-5 mmol/kg over 4-8 hours (equivalent to 2-5 ml /kg when using an 8.4% NaHCO 3 solution).\n\n【213】 # FOLLOW-UP\n- Continue monitoring and repeat dantrolene as necessary.\n- Monitor for clinical signs of acute kidney injury and compartment syndrome.\n- Consider alternative diagnoses (e.g. sepsis, phaeochromocytoma, thyroid storm, myopathy).\n- Malignant hyperpyrexia is a rare complication of exposure to anaesthesia -the established syndrome will carry a high mortality. - Opportunities to confirm the diagnosis in the ICRC setting are unlikely.\n\n【214】 # D. EQUIPMENT GUIDANCE AND REGIONAL BLOCKS\n\n【215】 # ADMINISTERING OXYGEN\nThe two possible oxygen sources in the field are oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators. Oxygen may not be available 24 hours a day since power is needed for oxygen concentrators. The safety of stored oxygen in a war zone is a major concern and is an obstacle to storing oxygen at a hospital as well as to sourcing oxygen cylinders. Oxygen stored in cylinders or manifolds can add to the explosive potential if it comes into contact with live ammunition.\n\n【216】 # OXYGEN CYLINDERS\nOxygen cylinders deliver oxygen at 4 bar. They are convenient as they are portable, do not require a power source and can deliver high-flow oxygen. However, in the field they have a number of disadvantages:\n- They may be unavailable.\n- They are difficult to transport because of their weight and the associated fire/explosive hazard.\n- Facilities for refilling may be lacking or very expensive.\n- Poor maintenance of cylinders can make them dangerous.\n- Poor maintenance of the pressure gauge can produce faulty readings and unexpected oxygen failure.\n- Inconsistent colour coding of cylinders can make it difficult to be sure what gas is being given.\n- Purity of the oxygen is unknown.\n- Unsafe unless they are tethered to the wall or placed on solid metallic stands.\nIn practice in the field, a few small oxygen cylinders are often available as a temporary back-up in case of power failure. Otherwise, oxygen concentrators are used.\n\n【217】 # OXYGEN CONCENTRATORS\nOxygen concentrators work by compressing air and passing it over zeolite, which adsorbs the nitrogen. The best concentrators produce a maximum flow rate of oxygen of around 8 l/min at low pressure, with an inspired oxygen concentration of around 90%. They are a cheap source of oxygen, require little maintenance and are safe since even in the event of a complete breakdown they will still provide a minimum of 21% oxygen. However, they do require a power source.\n\n【218】 # OPERATION\nConcentrators can be run from the mains or a generator supply. A voltage stabilizer should be used between the concentrator and the electricity supply as voltage fluctuations are very common both with generators and local power supplies and these can significantly affect the performance and life of the concentrator.\nEach oxygen concentrator is fitted with a low FiO 2 alarm consisting of a high-pitched sound and a light. When the concentrator is switched on, this alarm will sound as a test, after which the alarm light and sound should switch off automatically.\nA concentrator has two output flowmeters, both of which are marked up to 10 l/min. (N.B. The maximum output is approximately 8 l/min of oxygen in total.) If both flowmeters are set at up to 10 l/min each, the performance of the concentrator and the oxygen concentration will rapidly decline; there will be an output of >8 l/min of gas but the difference of 2 l/min will be mainly compressed air.\nA bottle of water can be added to one of the outputs for humidification. However, this cold water humidification is not very effective, can be a source of infection and is often a site for leaks from the circuit. For these reasons, the bottle is not normally used. Moreover, it should not be used in conjunction with halothane.\nWhen the concentrator is not in use, it should be switched off in order to conserve generator fuel and to prevent the build-up of oxygen if working in tents.\n\n【219】 # MAINTENANCE\nConcentrators require minimal maintenance. On the back of the concentrator there is a small foam filter which fills with dust. This filter needs to be removed every few days and run under water to clean it. It is then shaken dry and placed back on the concentrator. Filters should be replaced immediately after washing since they are easily mislaid and without the filter, the concentrator can cease to function as a result of a build-up of dust. The filters provided with the concentrator machine should not be replaced by \"makeshift\" or \"home-made\" filters, i.e. pillow sponge.\nIn addition, concentrators have internal filters, which should not be cleaned by the operator. No attempt should be made to interfere with the zeolite canisters.  - The musculocutaneous nerve (MN) is not directly next to the AA but appears as a hyperechoic flattened structure within the body of the coracobracialis muscle. Dynamic scanning in a proximal to distal direction will give the appearance of the nerve \"peeling away\" from the AA. Blocking the MN is necessary to offset tourniquet associated pain during surgery.\n\n【220】 # Key goal of block\nThe deposition of local anesthetic to circumferentially surround the four key nerves listed above.\n\n【221】 # N.B.\nThis technique requires comprehensive blocking of four nerves, which can be technically challenging if utilized as the sole means of surgical anaesthesia.\n\n【222】 # Block technique\n- Once the AA and the nerve of interest have been identified, approach the nerve with an in-plane technique.\n- Inject up to 5-6 ml of LA around each nerve, looking for circumferential spread around the nerve.\n- A total of 20-25 ml of local anesthetic will be used.       - Target the line of the needle trajectory to arrive just inside the epineural sheath.\n- Inject 2-5 ml aliquots, observing for hydro-separation of the CPN and TN in the epineural sheath with circumferential spread around these structures.\n- A total of 20-30 ml of local anesthetic will be used.\n\n【223】 # INFRACLAVICULAR BRACHIAL PLEXUS BLOCK\nIndications: analgesia or surgical anaesthesia for arm, elbow, forearm and hand injury or surgery Preparation of patient, equipment, drugs for resuscitation and the block as described in Section 13.1 on the generic principles of regional anaesthesia Specific preparation: 22G block needle 50 mm or 80 mm in length loaded with a 20 ml syringe of 0.5% bupivacaine and an additional 10 ml syringe of 0.5% bupivacaine Patient position: supine, with head turned away from the side being blocked. The arm can be by the side or elbow flexed at 90 degrees and arm abducted. The plexus and the SA may be deeper than anticipated, so increasing the depth on the US machine will aid to visualize these structures.\nAt this level the brachial plexus exists as hypoechoic cords lateral, medial and posterior to the SA.\n\n【224】 # Key goal of block\nThe deposition of local anesthetic to circumferentially surround the SA, which will spread to surround the three aforementioned cords.\nBlock technique \n- Once the SA and the cords have been identified, approach the SA using an in-plane technique.\n- Target the line of the needle trajectory to arrive with the needle tip at 6 o'clock just posterior to the SA.\n- Inject 20-30 ml of LA as 5 ml aliquots observing circumferential spread around the SA and cords.\n- A total of 30 ml of local anesthetic will be used.\n\n【225】 # E. MEDICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n【226】 # TROPICAL DISEASES\nAs an anaesthetist working with the ICRC, you will encounter tropical diseases as a comorbidity complicating your anaesthetic management and as a reason for surgery. This chapter outlines some of the main anaesthetic considerations in connection with the more common tropical diseases. It is not exhaustive and you are advised to find out at briefing or from the Global Burden of Disease website (/gbd) which diseases are endemic to the area in which you will be working.\n\n【227】 # MALARIA\nMalaria is extremely common and may vary in severity from fever alone to severe complicated malaria.\n- In the elective setting, malaria should always be treated before embarking on surgery.\n- In the emergency setting, surgery should be delayed if at all possible. The risks are much higher in patients suffering from severe complicated malaria.\nMalaria in children and pregnant women tends to be more severe.\n\n【228】 # ANAESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS\nFever: You should have a high index of suspicion for malaria in any endemic area as it is a very common cause of perioperative fever. Rapid checks are quick and easy to carry out.\nAnaemia: It may be acute and severe, leading to rapid decompensation. Use packed cells to correct if possible because of the risk of pulmonary oedema.\nPulmonary oedema: Increased risk of fluid overload. Resuscitation fluids should be given more cautiously.\nRenal impairment: Pre-renal and acute tubular necrosis and nephrotic syndrome may be seen. Monitor fluid balance closely. (Black water fever is massive haemolysis and haemoblobinurea in response to quinine treatment.)\nCerebral oedema and symptoms of raised ICP secondary to vascular occlusion by parasites: Patients may have fits.\nBe careful with fluid resuscitation, consider an anaesthetic technique that will allow EtCO 2 to be well controlled, and ensure free venous drainage from the head -tube ties, head up, etc Hypoglycaemia: Regularly check BM; glucose may be required.\nLiver impairment: Jaundice (due to liver dysfunction as well as red cell haemolysis). Drug handling may be impaired. Avoid halothane if possible because of its potential hepatotoxic effects.\nAbdominal pain: it may mimic the acute abdomen.\nSplenomegaly is common and may be a cause of pain; increased risk of splenic rupture. It may also cause anaemia and thrombocytopaenia.\nCoagulopathy: You are unlikely to be able to carry out a clotting screen but do consider the risk of a coagulopathy when weighing up the risks of using a neuraxial technique.\nCo-infection: Patients may have a functional splenectomy and are more at risk of bacterial infections.\nQuinine: potentiates non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade.\n\n【229】 # TUBERCULOSIS\nTuberculosis can mimic virtually any condition and can affect any part of the body. It may be the reason why the patient is taken to the operating theatre: lung resection, lymph node biopsy, drainage of tubercular abscesses, bowel obstruction. There are a number of implications for the anaesthetist.\nMalnutrition, chronic anaemia and cachexia are common, with consequences for poor healing and increased post-operative infection.\nLungs: Function may be impaired; there may be an effusion or a pneumothorax.\nSpine: There may be deformity and/or an abscess. Careful examination is needed prior to neuraxial techniques.\nPericardium: effusion and constrictive pericarditis, more common in patients who also have HIV\n\n【230】 # CNS: abscesses -EtCO 2 control\nCo-infection with HIV is common.\nAnti-TB therapy: may cause liver damage and alter drug handling, generally inducing cytochrome P450 system and increasing the rate of metabolism. Halothane hepatitis is thought to be more common.\nInfection control: Theatre staff should wear protective face masks (HEPA or N95). An HME filter is sufficient to protect the circuit, preferably one at the patient end and one at the machine end. If possible, the circuit should be cleaned after the case and the case should be dealt with last on the list.\n\n【231】 # HIV\nGeneral state is usually poor: Malnutrition, anaemia and concomitant infection with TB are common.\nLungs: PCP and cryptococcal infections are commonly found with severe effects on lung function.\nKaposi's sarcoma: can be found in the oropharynx and periglottic area and may lead to difficult intubation.\nRetroviral treatment potentiates neuromuscular blockers and decreases the metabolism of benzodiazepines and pethidine. Care must be taken with dosing.\nAvoid blood transfusion unless absolutely necessary as the CD4 count decreases faster after transfusion owing to the immunosuppressant effect of blood transfusion.\n\n【232】 # TYPHOID\nPatients with typhoid may present for surgery with an acute abdomen secondary to bowel perforation. They are usually extremely septic with severe dehydration secondary to diarrhoea. They may have the classic rose spots. They have a relative bradycardia, which can be more pronounced under anaesthesia and may require treatment with atropine. Patients may have a myocarditis.\nIn surgery there are usually multiple perforations and the surgery is prolonged and difficult.\nConsider the possibility of typhoid in any severely septic patient presenting with bowel perforations. Take appropriate infection control measures.\n\n【233】 # WORMS\nIntestinal worms are extremely common. They may be a cause of malnutrition and anaemia. It is common practice to treat any child with malnutrition and anaemia for presumed intestinal parasites.\nWorms may cause intestinal obstruction requiring surgery and are quite commonly seen intraoperatively for unrelated bowel procedures. Any that are seen should be removed and any anastomosis should be over-sewn an extra time as worms can escape through the anastomosis, causing leaks.\n\n【234】 # HYDATID DISEASE\nAs an anaesthetist, you may be involved in the management of people with hydatid disease, either in surgery for resection of hydatid cysts or in the emergency room for management of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis occurs if the contents of a hydatid cyst escape into the circulation -either during surgery or because of cyst rupture. Usual anaphylaxis management is needed. There is no evidence that pre-treatment with antihistamines helps.\n- Tropical disease is common in ICRC situations. It is important both as the reason for surgery and as a potential negative influence on anaesthesia and perioperative care.\n\n【235】 # TETANUS\nTetanus is a toxin-mediated disease from clostridium tetani introduced into wounds. High fatality rate of 10-80% even with modern ITU. Incubation period: 3-21 days; the shorter the incubation period, the more severe the disease. Outbreaks of tetanus are well documented after earthquakes, tsunamis and in field hospitals with poor sterilization practices.\n\n【236】 # CLINICAL FEATURES\nMuscle rigidity and painful muscle spasms, often begins in the jaw (lockjaw) and face, with the characteristic risus sardonicus. Spasms are triggered by sensory stimuli, become more generalized and death is usually due to respiratory failure in the absence of ventilatory support. Autonomic instability may also occur, producing hypertension, hypotension and tachy and brady arrhythmias.\n\n【237】 # DIAGNOSIS\nDiagnosis is clinical; there are no laboratory tests.\n\n【238】 # TREATMENT\nGeneral measures: Keep the patient in a quiet, dimly lit location and reduce stimuli as much as possible. Extensive cleaning and debridement of all wounds is crucial. Ketamine anaesthesia should be avoided if possible as it can often cause restlessness and hallucinations, which can precipitate spasms. Regional anaesthesia via central neuroaxial blocks or peripheral nerve blocks provide important alternative anaesthetic strategies.\nImmunotherapy: The ICRC's war surgery manual contains guidance on the management of all war wounds, whatever their immunization status. This includes giving:\n- human tetanus immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin against toxin) 500 IU IM (adults) or 250 IU (children under 15 years of age) -also known as human anti-tetanus serum;\nbe done once spasms are well controlled as there is a risk of laryngeal spasming.\nTreatment is likely to be needed for 1-2 weeks. Good nursing and medical care can reduce mortality by 50% even without access to mechanical ventilation.\n- Following a crisis, there is a significant threat from clostridium tetani.\n- Established tetanus has a high mortality, potentially exacerbated by limitations in the field of intensive care. - Despite the challenges, good basic care can have a positive impact on survival.\n\n【239】 # CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT\nOne of the challenges in the perioperative management of patients in the austere environment is what to do about chronic disease management. The traditional view has been that patients presenting for surgery tend to be otherwise young and fit and that it is not a major issue. However, conflict situations are occurring increasingly in countries that previously had well-developed medical care, longer life expectancies and more Western diets and where patients were previously on medication.\nCommon conditions which may be diagnosed on the patient's admission to hospital include hypertension and diabetes.\nWith the other members of your team, including the hospital project manager and country health coordinator, and in consultation with health unit at ICRC headquarters, you need to decide whether you have the drugs to treat these chronic diseases and if so, whether you will treat them. If you do decide to treat them, will you treat them just for the duration of the patient's stay in hospital or over the long term? It is important for this decision to be taken at the programme level.\nIf the decision has been made to treat over the long term, a few other questions also need to be considered:\n- How is this condition normally managed in this country?\n- When the ICRC leaves, will the patient still have access to this medication?\n- Does the patient have to pay for the medication and if so, can they afford it?\n- Is there anyone to monitor the effects of the treatment, e.g. BP and BM monitoring?\n- Am I creating a demand for a service without the availability of the necessary resources? Can I do this for every patient?\nThere are no right or wrong answers to these questions.\nIn some contexts it may be entirely reasonable to manage these conditions, while in others it may simply not be possible. Chronic disease management will depend on the circumstances of the mission. It is important to remember that decisions regarding chronic disease management should not be taken on a patient-by-patient basis or even at the local level alone; the country health coordinator and the ICRC health unit should be involved. Having said that, even in the absence of medication, lifestyle advice can be given, meaning that it is still worth discussing the diagnosis with the patient.\n- Chronic disease may be considered as the \"boundary\" between classic ICRC activity and medical care provided by the host nation. There are no textbook solutions for an ICRC anaesthetist's role in managing long-term health issues.\n- Suxamethonium apnoea;\n- As a post-operative, short-term (few hours) measure to allow warming and filling prior to extubation It is unlikely that anyone other than you will have the skills to manage a patient on a ventilator; surveillance for the patient in your absence will therefore be poor. You will be unable to manage a ventilated patient safely for longer than a few hours without compromising the care of other patients. For these reasons it is extremely unlikely that it will be appropriate to intubate and ventilate a patient to manage respiratory failure, organ failure or head injury.\n\n【240】 # TRANSFER\nCritical patients can sometimes be transferred. It is important to be aware of the available facilities to which they can be sent, the quality of care in the referral facility, its willingness to accept patients from your hospital, its distance from your hospital and the practicalities of transferring patients (transport, security, escort) as well as to consider who will bear the costs of the transfer and subsequent care and the costs of the carer who must accompany the patient and to know whether transfer is acceptable to the family in the light of the above.\nThe answers to all these questions except the last one must be clear before patients are admitted.\n- In the ICRC environment the clinical decision to offer critical care to a patient must always be balanced against local logistical and cultural realities. - In particular the risk vs benefits of endotracheal intubation and ventilation must receive very careful scrutiny.\n\n【241】 # F. ANNEX\n- VANCOMYCIN 1 g IV 2x/day in 10 ml water for injection + 100 -500 ml of 0.9% NaCl, over 2hrs\n\n【242】 # MISSION\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an impartial, neutral and independent organization whose exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence and to provide them with assistance. The ICRC also endeavours to prevent suffering by promoting and strengthening humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles. Established in 1863, the ICRC is at the origin of the Geneva Conventions and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It directs and coordinates the international activities conducted by the Movement in armed conflicts and other situations of violence.\n\n【243】 # Obstetric sepsis\nRecognition Suspect obstetric sepsis if some or all of the features listed below are present:\n- Fever >38° C - Increased RR, HR (mother and foetus) - Low  - Ampicillin 2 g IV 6 hourly - Gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV daily - Metronidazole 500 mg IV 8 hourly - Continue antibiotics until there are no signs of sepsis for 48 hours - Treat the cause: abscess drainage/evacuation of products/ appendicectomy, etc.\n- If the baby is delivered, ensure it is also treated for sepsis\n\n【244】 # Non-obstetric surgery for obstetric patients\nThe most common reasons for non-obstetric surgery are trauma and intra-abdominal sepsis (appendicitis and cholecystitis).\nThe main points to note are as follows:\n- After 16/40 the mother is at risk of aspiration - After 20/40 aortocaval compression may be apparent and the mother should have a 15 degree left tilt - Regional techniques are preferable as there is some evidence of increased rates of miscarriage and preterm labour with low birth weight after GA\n- Maternal systemic vascular resistance should be maintained during anaesthesia as placental blood flow is dependent on it - NSAIDs should be avoided as they may cause foetal abnormalities - Conflict zones are no barrier to background obstetric activity.\n- Obstetric pathology will often be present and severe.\n- The anaesthetist may well have to assume the role of perinatal physician for both mother and baby.\n\n【245】 # ANAPHYLAXIS\nThis guidance is based on the AAGBI (Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland) guidelines and Resuscitation Council (UK) algorithms. Reported anaphylaxis rates vary widely from 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 20,000 people. Although rare, this is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction; early recognition and management are important. In anaesthesia, the agents most commonly leading to anaphylaxis include neuromuscular blocking agents, antibiotics, thiopentone and latex but this list is not exhaustive. Follow-up for allergy testing will depend on the existence of an intact local health system.\n\n【246】 # ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT\n- ABC approach (airway, breathing and circulation)\n- Remove all potential causative agents and maintain anaesthesia, if necessary.\n- CALL FOR HELP and note the time.\n- Maintain the airway and administer 100% oxygen.\nIntubate and ventilate if necessary.\n- If appropriate, start cardiopulmonary resuscitation immediately according to the Advanced Life Support Guidelines (Resuscitation Council (UK)).\n- Prior to intubation/ventilation the anaesthetist must consider the availability of aftercare.\n\n【247】 # GIVE ADRENALINE\nAdrenaline IM: doses of 1:1000 adrenaline (repeat after 5 minutes if no better)\n- Adult 500 mg IM (0.5 ml)\n- Child more than 12 years: 500 mg IM (0.5 ml)\n- Child 6-12 years: 300 mg IM (0.3 ml)\n- Child less than 6 years: 150 mg IM (0.15 ml) Adrenaline IV\n- Adult dose: 50 mg (0.5 ml of 1:10,000 solution) - Child's dose: 1.0 mg/kg (0.1 ml/kg of 1:100,000 solution)\nDo not exceed a maximum cumulative dose of 12 ml/kg. The ICRC \"resuscitation set\" includes lipid emulsion for this indication only; it should therefore be available in the field. (Please note that the ICRC does not provide lipid emulsion for enteral nutrition.)\n- Treatment of severe LAST can be prolonged and difficult.\n- Prevention is better than cure.\n\n【248】 # OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR\nThe Oxygen Concentrator provides both oxygen and air through the flowmeters on the control panel.\nThe uninterruptable power supply (UPS)\n\n【249】 # HELIX VENTILATOR\nThe\n\n【250】 # Ventilator control panel Controls\nThis contains the following features from left to right: - On/off power switch with illuminated \"power on\" indicator above.\n\n【251】 # - Trigger level control (top).\n- Respiratory rate control (centre).\n- Patient pressure control (bottom).1 on the generic principles of regional anaesthesia - Identify the heads of the triceps muscle, which is replaced by the key landmark of the conjoint tendon of teres major and latissimus dorsi muscles. It is a key landmark as the radial nerve is almost always found above the conjoint tendon.\n- The nerves appear around the axillary artery with mixed echogenicity in the following positions:\n- Median nerve (MN) sits around the 9-12 o'clock position.\n- Ulnar nerve (UN) sits around the 12-4 o'clock position.\n- Radial nerve (RN) sits around the 4-7 o'clock position (just above the conjoint tendon).\n\n【252】 # FEMORAL NERVE BLOCK\nIndications: analgesia or surgical anaesthesia for anterior thigh, shaft of femur, hip or knee Preparation of patient, equipment, drugs for resuscitation and the block as described in Section 13.1 on the generic principles of regional anaesthesia - Identify the pulsating femoral artery (FA) and compressible femoral vein (FV).\n- The femoral nerve (FN) is lateral to the FA, deep to the fascia iliacus but just above the iliacus muscle.\n- The FN can be difficult to visualize but will often appear as a flattened hyperechoic triangular structure immediately adjacent to the artery.\n\n【253】 # Key goal of block\nThe deposition of local anesthetic to circumferentially surround the femoral nerve.\n\n【254】 # Block technique\n- Once the FA and FV have been identified, approach the FN using an in-plane technique.\n- Target the line of the needle trajectory to arrive lateral to the femoral nerve and under the fascia iliacus.\n- Inject 15-20 ml of LA as 1-2 ml aliquots, observing circumferential spread around the FN.\n- A total of 20 ml of local anesthetic will be used.\n\n【255】 # POPLITEAL SCIATIC NERVE BLOCK\nIndications: analgesia or surgical anaesthesia for foot and ankle injury or surgery Preparation of patient, equipment, drugs for resuscitation and the block as described in Section 13.1 on the generic principles of regional anaesthesia Specific preparation: 22G block needle 50 mm in length loaded with a 20 ml syringe of 0.5% bupivacaine and an additional 10 ml syringe of 0.5% bupivacaine - Identify the pulsating popliteal artery (PA).\n- The sciatic nerve (SN) will appear as a hyperechoic structure above and lateral to the PA.\n- Dynamic scanning distally towards the popliteal fossa will show the SN dividing into the tibial nerve (TN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN), scanning back up proximally will identify an optimal site to block where the SN exists as one nerve in an epineural sheath. This is normally 5 cm above the popliteal crease.\n\n【256】 # Key goal of block\nThe deposition of local anesthetic to circumferentially surround the SN within the epineural sheath  if the SN has divided, around the CPN and TN separately.\n\n【257】 # Block technique\n- Once the PA and the SN have been identified, approach the SN using an in-plane technique.\n- tetanus toxoid vaccine (inactivated tetanus toxin) 0.5 ml IM, to be repeated at four weeks and again at six months. 2 The manual offers further advice on the treatment doses of immunotherapy in tetanus. This includes giving:\n- anti-tetanus human immunoglobulin . 2\nAntibiotics: Against clostridium. Metronidazole 500mg qds IV. Erythromycin and penicillin G are also active against clostridia. 2\nMuscle spasm control: Diazepam 5 mg IV titrated to control spasms without excessive sedation (children 0.2 mg/ kg every 2 hrs titrated). Large doses may be required -up to 600 mg/day. Magnesium 5 g slow IV loading dose (75 mg/ kg children) then 1-2 g/hr until spasms are under control may be used as an alternative or as an adjunct to diazepam. The combination works best to reduce excessive sedation.\nMonitor the patellar reflex. Baclofen may also help.\nAutonomic dysfunction: Magnesium as above. Do not use B blockers as they can cause hypotension and sudden death.\nAirway: This is of the utmost importance given the aspiration risk. Early tracheostomy may well be required, especially if persistent laryngospasms are a problem.\n\n【258】 # Fluids and nutrition:\nTetanus spasms result in high metabolic demands and a catabolic state. An ng tube may need to be passed if the patient is unable to eat. This should only\n\n【259】 # CRITICAL CARE\nCritical care is one of the most challenging areas in the austere environment. There is a large gap between what you can provide at home and what can be done in the field. At the same time, the stakes are very high.\nDecisions regarding the level of critical care provided in the ICRC hospital projects in which you will be involved will often have been made prior to your joining the project. Those decisions should be respected. If during your mission you have questions or difficulties regarding the level of critical care provided for patients, they should be discussed with the hospital project manager and if necessary, taken up with the country's health coordinator.\nSome useful questions to ask yourself and your colleagues when joining a project include the following:\n\n【260】 # Where is my critical care area?\nA dedicated area may have already been set up, often called the \"high dependency unit\" in ICRC structures. It will be either a stand-alone unit or a separate area on the ward, in the emergency room or in the recovery area. If such an area has not already been designated, you should discuss this with the hospital project manager, recommending that one be set up. The recovery area is usually the most convenient for you but you need to bear in mind what will happen when you are not there and theatres are not running -will the nursing staff stay with the patient?\n\n【261】 # What equipment do I have?\nAn ideal minimum requirement would be suction, an O 2 concentrator, a pulse oximeter and a sphygnomanometer. Be very cautious of more complex equipment and check it carefully. Ventilators frequently do not work correctly. Infusion pumps may not run at the correct speed; test them with a stopwatch and a syringe of saline.\n\n【262】 # Who are my staff?\nThe staff are the most important aspect of your critical care area. What training do they have; how exhausted are they; how motivated are they? Are they expected to do anything else? Even in the absence of the usual technology and drugs, excellent results can be obtained for patients with meticulous attention to detail and very good nursing care.\n\n【263】 # What normally happens with these patients?\nThis is a very important question to ask. It gives you useful information about local expectations and capabilities.\nIt is important to plan in advance for what you will do with the more common types of critical care patient, e.g. head injuries, severe burns, cerebral malaria and tetanus.\nThe plan needs to be understood and agreed with both international and national staff as well as with the hospital project manager. Plans may include ongoing management in your own hospital, with or without intubation, or transfer to another facility.\n\n【264】 # What are the cultural expectations regarding end-of-life care?\nIn some cultures any sort of withdrawal of care is unacceptable, i.e. once an ET tube is down, it cannot be removed; once on a ventilator, the patient cannot be disconnected. When making decisions with limited resources, it is important for these aspects to be understood and taken into consideration.\n\n【265】 # DECISION TO INTUBATE\nThe decision to intubate/ventilate for critical care reasons is a very difficult one in the austere environment. It is usually reserved for specific, reversible, short-term conditions only. Some possible indications include:\n- Airway compromise (fractures, burns, tetanus) prior to tracheostomy;\n- To facilitate transfer to another facility;\n- Prior to theatre if an extradural is clinically diagnosed;\n- Anaphylaxis;", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

This glucose-1-phosphate isomer cannot be metabolized easily. The enzyme phosphoglucomutase phosphorylates the 6-carbon, while subsequently dephosphorylating the 1-carbon. The result is glucose-6-phosphate, which can now theoretically travel down the glycolysis or pentose phosphate pathway.\n\n【4】 ## Function in Glycogenesis\nPhosphoglucomutase also acts in the opposite fashion when a large concentration of glucose-6-phosphate is present. In this case, it is the 1-carbon that is phosphorylated and the 6-carbon that is dephosphorylated. The resulting glucose-1-phosphate is then changed into UDP-glucose in a number of intermediate steps. If activated by insulin, glycogen synthase will proceed to clip the glucose from the UDP-glucose complex and on to the glycogen molecule.\n\n【5】 ## Disease Relevance\nHuman muscle contains two phosphoglucomutases with nearly identical catalytic properties, PGM I and PGM II. One or the other of these forms is missing in some humans congenitally.\nPhosphoglucomutase deficiency is an extremely rare condition that does not have a set of well-characterized physiological symptoms. This condition can be detected by an in vitro study of anaerobic glycolysis which reveals a block in the pathway toward lactic acid production after glucose 1-phosphate but before glucose 6-phosphate.\n\n【6】 ## Genes\n- PGM1, PGM2, PGM3, PGM5\n\n【7】 # Related Chapter\n- Mutase", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Holley, III, D.D.S. is a dental surgeon and politician, currently serving as mayor of Portsmouth, Virginia. Though blunt and often controversial, he has remained popular with constituents.\n\n【1】 # Early life\nAfter graduating from Portsmouth's I.C. Norcom High School in 1944, Holley served in World War II. Following the war, he attended West Virginia State College (now West Virginia State University), and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1949. From there he went to Washington, D.C. where he attended dental school at the Howard University College of Dentistry, graduating in 1955. He has also received an honorary law degree from West Virginia State.\nHolley joined the battle for civil rights in the 1950s and 60s, and played an integral role in the desegregation of his native Portsmouth, winning court battles which allowed for the equal use of the city's libraries, hospitals, restaurants and golf courses.\n\n【2】 # Politics\nHolley first served as a member of the Portsmouth City Council from 1968 to 1984, and was vice-mayor from 1978 to 1980. Upon his election in 1968, he became the first African American to serve on Portsmouth's City Council. He has twice held the office of mayor, first from July 1, 1984, to December 15, 1987, and again from July 1996 to the present day. His current term ends on June 30, 2008. Holley is also the first African American mayor in the city's history. His first term came to an end when he was forced from office following an expense account scandal, becoming the first Virginia politician in modern times to be recalled. Another factor in Holley's removal from office was his being linked to hate mail that was sent to community leaders.\nWhile an Independent, Holley has backed both Democrats and Republicans running for office, including Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid and former Senator George Allen's 2006 re-election bid. He also serves as chairman of Hampton Roads Transit.\n\n【3】 # Fashion\nHolley is known for his stylish dress.

In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\n- Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n- Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\n- Drug Interactions:\n- The concomitant use of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation.\n- Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n- Age 65 or Greater:\n- The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient’s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients.\n- Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n- Radiological Studies with Contrast:\n- Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis.\n- Stop Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast.\n- Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n- Surgery and Other Procedures:\n- Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment.\n- Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n- Hypoxic States:\n- Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia).\n- Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause pre renal azotemia.\n- When such events occur, discontinue Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.\n- Excessive Alcohol Intake:\n- Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.\n- Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.\n- Hepatic Impairment:\n- Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.\n- This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels.\n- Therefore, avoid use of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n【1】 # Hypotension\n- Empagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction.\n- Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating empagliflozin particularly in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics.\n- Before initiating Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride, assess for volume contraction and correct volume status if indicated.\n- Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy and increase monitoring in clinical situations where volume contraction is expected.\n\n【2】 # Ketoacidosis\n- Reports of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodiu- glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin.\n- Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking empagliflozin.\n- Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n- Patients treated with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels, as ketoacidosis associated with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg/dL.\n- If ketoacidosis is suspected, Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted.\n- Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid and carbohydrate replacement.\n- In many of the postmarketing reports, and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes, the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (often less than 250 mg/dL).\n- Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath.\n- In some but not all cases, factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g., type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were identified.\n- Before initiating Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause, caloric restriction, and alcohol abuse.\n- In patients treated with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g., prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery).\n\n【3】 # Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function\n- Empagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction.\n- There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age.\n- Before initiating Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride, consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury including hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure and concomitant medications (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs).\n- Consider temporarily discontinuing Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride in any setting of reduced oral intake (such as acute illness or fasting) or fluid losses (such as gastrointestinal illness or excessive heat exposure); monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury.\n- If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride promptly and institute treatment.\n- Empagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR.\n- Patients with hypovolemia may be more susceptible to these changes.\n- Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.\n- Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride and monitored periodically thereafter.\n- More frequent renal function monitoring is recommended in patients with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n- Use of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\n【4】 # Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis\n- There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin.\n- Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections.\n- Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated.\n\n【5】 # Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n- Empagliflozin:\n- Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia.\n- The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when empagliflozin is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin.\n- Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.\n- Metformin:\n- Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as SUs and insulin) or ethanol.\n- Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects.\n- Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking β-adrenergic blocking drugs.\n- Monitor for a need to lower the dose of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in these patients.\n\n【6】 # Genital Mycotic Infections\n- Empagliflozin increases the risk for genital mycotic infections.\n- Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop mycotic genital infections.\n- Monitor and treat as appropriate.\n\n【7】 # Vitamin B12 Levels\n- In controlled, 29-week clinical trials of metformin, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of metformin-treated patients.\n- Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia or neurologic manifestations due to the short duration (<1 year) of the clinical trials.\n- This risk may be more relevant to patients receiving long-term treatment with metformin, and adverse hematologic and neurologic reactions have been reported postmarketing.\n- The decrease in vitamin B12 levels appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation.\n- Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed.\n- Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels.\n- In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurement at 2- to 3-year intervals may be useful.\n\n【8】 # Increased Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)\n- Increases in LDL-C can occur with empagliflozin.\n- Monitor and treat as appropriate.\n\n【9】 # Macrovascular Outcomes\n- There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.\n- Lactic Acidosis\n- Hypotension\n- Ketoacidosis\n- Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function\n- Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis\n- Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n- Genital Mycotic Infections\n- Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n- Increased Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C).\n- Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n- The safety of concomitantly administered empagliflozin (daily dose 10 mg and 25 mg) and metformin hydrochloride (mean daily dose of approximately 1800 mg) has been evaluated in 3456 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 16 to 24 weeks, of which 926 patients received placebo, 1271 patients received a daily dose of empagliflozin 10 mg, and 1259 patients received a daily dose of empagliflozin 25 mg.\n- Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events across treatment groups was 3.0%, 2.8%, and 2.9% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.\n- Empagliflozin Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin:\n- In a 24-week placebo-controlled trial of empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg administered once daily added to metformin, there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in ≥5% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo.\n- Empagliflozin:\n- The data in Table 2 are derived from a pool of four 24-week placebo-controlled trials and 18-week data from a placebo-controlled trial with basal insulin.\n- Empagliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in four trials.\n- These data reflect exposure of 1976 patients to empagliflozin with a mean exposure duration of approximately 23 weeks.\n- Patients received placebo (N=995), empagliflozin 10 mg (N=999), or empagliflozin 25 mg (N=977) once daily.\n- The mean age of the population was 56 years and 3% were older than 75 years of age.\n- More than half (55%) of the population was male; 46% were White, 50% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American.\n- At baseline, 57% of the population had diabetes more than 5 years and had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8%.\n- Established microvascular complications of diabetes at baseline included diabetic nephropathy (7%), retinopathy (8%), or neuropathy (16%).\n- Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 91% of patients and moderately impaired in 9% of patients (mean eGFR 86.8 mL/min/1.73 m2).\n- Table 2 shows common adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) associated with the use of empagliflozin.\n- The adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on empagliflozin than on placebo and occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg or empagliflozin 25 mg.\n- Volume Depletion:\n- Empagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion.\n- In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g., blood pressure (ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope) were reported by 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.\n- Empagliflozin may increase the risk of hypotension in patients at risk for volume contraction.\n- Increased Urination:\n- In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions of increased urination (e.g., polyuria, pollakiuria, and nocturia) occurred more frequently on empagliflozin than on placebo .\n- Specifically, nocturia was reported by 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.8% of patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.\n- Acute Impairment in Renal Function:\n- Treatment with empagliflozin was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR.\n- Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline had larger mean changes.\n- In a long-term cardiovascular outcome trial, the acute impairment in renal function was observed to reverse after treatment discontinuation suggesting acute hemodynamic changes play a role in the renal function changes observed with empagliflozin.\n- Hypoglycemia:\n- The incidence of hypoglycemia increased when empagliflozin was administered with insulin or sulfonylurea.\n- In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of genital mycotic infections (e.g., vaginal mycotic infection, vaginal infection, genital infection fungal, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and vulvitis) was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo, occurring in 0.9%, 4.1%, and 3.7% of patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.\n- Discontinuation from study due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with either empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg.\n- Genital mycotic infections occurred more frequently in female than male patients.\n- Phimosis occurred more frequently in male patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg (less than 0.1%) and empagliflozin 25 mg (0.1%) than placebo (0%).\n- Urinary Tract Infections:\n- In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of urinary tract infections (e.g., urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and cystitis) was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo.\n- Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections were more likely to experience a urinary tract infection.\n- The rate of treatment discontinuation due to urinary tract infections was 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.1% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.\n- Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients.\n- The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively.\n- Metformin:\n- The most common (>5%) established adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin therapy are diarrhea, nausea/ vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache.\n- Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption which may very rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g., megaloblastic anemia).\n\n【10】 # Laboratory Tests\n- Empagliflozin:\n- Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C): Dose-related increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were observed in patients treated with empagliflozin.\n- LDL-C increased by 2.3%, 4.6%, and 6.5% in patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.\n- The range of mean baseline LDL-C levels was 90.3 to 90.6 mg/dL across treatment groups.\n- Increase in Hematocrit:\n- In a pool of four placebo-controlled studies, median hematocrit decreased by 1.3% in placebo and increased by 2.8% in empagliflozin 10 mg and 2.8% in empagliflozin 25 mg treated patients.\n\n【11】 - Metformin:\n- In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks’ duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum Vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients.\n- Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or Vitamin B12 supplementation.\n- Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nKetoacidosis\nUrosepsis and pyelonephritis.\n- Urosepsis and pyelonephritis.\n- Diuretics:\nCoadministration of empagliflozin with diuretics resulted in increased urine volume and frequency of voids, which might enhance the potential for volume depletion.\n- Coadministration of empagliflozin with diuretics resulted in increased urine volume and frequency of voids, which might enhance the potential for volume depletion.\n- Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues:\nCoadministration of empagliflozin with insulin or insulin secretagogues increases the risk for hypoglycemia.\n- Coadministration of empagliflozin with insulin or insulin secretagogues increases the risk for hypoglycemia.\n- Positive Urine Glucose Test:\nMonitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors as SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests.\nUse alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.\n- Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors as SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests.\n- Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.\n- Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol  Assay :\nMonitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors.\n- Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\n【12】 # Drug Interactions with Metformin Hydrochloride\n- Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance:\nConcomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2  / multidrug and toxin extrusion  inhibitors such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use.\n- Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2  / multidrug and toxin extrusion  inhibitors such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use.\n- Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors :\nTopiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently causes a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.\nConcomitant use of these drugs with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk of lactic acidosis.\nConsider more frequent monitoring of these patients.\n- Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently causes a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.\n- Concomitant use of these drugs with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk of lactic acidosis.\n- Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients.\n- Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control:\nCertain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control.\nThese drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid.\nWhen such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride, the patient should be closely observed to maintain adequate glycemic control.\nWhen such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia.\n- Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control.\n- These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines,

Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride, the patient should be closely observed to maintain adequate glycemic control.\n- When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia.\n- Alcohol:\nAlcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism.\nWarn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.\n- Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism.\n- Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.\n- Based on animal data showing adverse renal effects, Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.\n- Limited available data with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride or empagliflozin in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage.\n- Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk.\n- There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy.\n- In animal studies, adverse renal changes were observed in rats when empagliflozin was administered during a period of renal development corresponding to the late second and third trimesters of human pregnancy.\n- Doses approximately 13-times the maximum clinical dose caused renal pelvic and tubule dilatations that were reversible.\n- Empagliflozin was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits up to 300 mg/kg/day, which approximates 48-times and 128-times, respectively, the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg when administered during organogenesis.\n- No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 6-times, respectively, a 2000 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area.\n- The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with HbA1c >10.\n- The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.\n- In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.\n- Clinical Considerations:\n- Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk:\nPoorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth, and delivery complications.\nPoorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity.\n- Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth, and delivery complications.\n- Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity.\n- Data:\n- Human Data:\nPublished data from post-marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy.\nHowever, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.\n- Published data from post-marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy.\n- However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.\n- Animal Data:\n- Empagliflozin:\n- Empagliflozin dosed directly to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 21 until PND 90 at doses of 1, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day caused increased kidney weights and renal tubular and pelvic dilatation at 100 mg/kg/day, which approximates 13-times the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg, based on AUC.\n- These findings were not observed after a 13 week drug-free recovery period.\n- These outcomes occurred with drug exposure during periods of renal development in rats that correspond to the late second and third trimester of human renal development.\n- In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, empagliflozin was administered for intervals coinciding with the first trimester period of organogenesis in humans.\n- Doses up to 300 mg/kg/day, which approximates 48-times (rats) and 128-times (rabbits) the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg (based on AUC), did not result in adverse developmental effects.\n- In rats, at higher doses of empagliflozin causing maternal toxicity, malformations of limb bones increased in fetuses at 700 mg/kg/day or 154-times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose.\n- In the rabbit, higher doses of empagliflozin resulted in maternal and fetal toxicity at 700 mg/kg/day, or 139-times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose.\n- In pre- and postnatal development studies in pregnant rats, empagliflozin was administered from gestation day 6 through to lactation day 20 (weaning) at up to 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 16-times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose) without maternal toxicity.\n- Reduced body weight was observed in the offspring at greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 4-times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose).\n- Metformin hydrochloride:\nMetformin hydrochloride did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits at up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis.\nThis represents an exposure of approximately 2- and 6-times a clinical dose of 2000 mg, based on body surface area (mg/m2) for rats and rabbits, respectively.\n- Metformin hydrochloride did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits at up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis.\n- This represents an exposure of approximately 2- and 6-times a clinical dose of 2000 mg, based on body surface area (mg/m2) for rats and rabbits, respectively.\n- Empagliflozin and Metformin hydrochloride:\nNo adverse developmental effects were observed when empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride were coadministered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at exposures of approximately 35- and 14-times the clinical AUC exposure of empagliflozin associated with the 10 mg and 25 mg doses, respectively, and 4-times the clinical AUC exposure of metformin associated with the 2000 mg dose.\n- No adverse developmental effects were observed when empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride were coadministered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at exposures of approximately 35- and 14-times the clinical AUC exposure of empagliflozin associated with the 10 mg and 25 mg doses, respectively, and 4-times the clinical AUC exposure of metformin associated with the 2000 mg dose.\n- Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk.\n- However, there is insufficient information on the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production.\n- Empagliflozin is present in the milk of lactating rats.\n- Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when lactational exposure may occur, there may be risk to the developing human kidney.\n- Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, advise women that use of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended while breastfeeding.\n- Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1.\n- However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants.\n- Empagliflozin was present at a low level in rat fetal tissues after a single oral dose to the dams at gestation day 18.\n- In rat milk, the mean milk to plasma ratio ranged from 0.634 -5, and was greater than one from 2 to 24 hours post-dose.\n- The mean maximal milk to plasma ratio of 5 occurred at 8 hours post-dose, suggesting accumulation of empagliflozin in the milk.\n- Juvenile rats directly exposed to empagliflozin showed a risk to the developing kidney (renal pelvic and tubular dilatations) during maturation.\n- No empagliflozin dosage change is recommended based on age.\n- In studies assessing the efficacy of empagliflozin in improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 2721 (32%) patients treated with empagliflozin were 65 years of age and older, and 491 (6%) were 75 years of age and older.\n- Empagliflozin is expected to have diminished glycemic efficacy in elderly patients with renal impairment.\n- The risk of volume depletion-related adverse reactions increased in patients who were 75 years of age and older to 2.1%, 2.3%, and 4.4% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg.\n- The risk of urinary tract infections increased in patients who were 75 years of age and older to 10.5%, 15.7%, and 15.1% in patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.\n- Controlled clinical studies of metformin hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients.\n- In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis.\n- Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n- In patients with volume depletion not previously treated with empagliflozin, correct this condition before initiating Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.\n- Individualize the starting dose of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride based on the patient’s current regimen:\n- In patients on metformin hydrochloride, switch to Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride containing empagliflozin 5 mg with a similar total daily dose of metformin hydrochloride;\n– In patients on empagliflozin, switch to Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride containing metformin hydrochloride 500 mg with a similar total daily dose of empagliflozin;\n– In patients already treated with empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride, switch to Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride containing the same total daily doses of each component.\n- Take Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride twice daily with meals; with gradual dose escalation to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects due to metformin.\n- Adjust dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride 2000 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg.\n\n【13】 # Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment\n- Assess renal function prior to initiation of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride and periodically, thereafter.\n- Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\n【14】 # Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures\n- Discontinue Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast.\n- Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable.\n- Employ the usual supportive measures (e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive treatment) as dictated by the patient’s clinical status.\n- Removal of empagliflozin by hemodialysis has not been studied.\n- However, metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions.\n- Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful partly for removal of accumulated metformin from patients in whom Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride overdosage is suspected.\n- Metformin hydrochloride :\n- Overdose of metformin hydrochloride has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established.\n- Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases.\n- Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride combines 2 antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, and metformin, a member of the biguanide class.\n- Empagliflozin:\n- Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation.\n- Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2.\n- By inhibiting SGLT2, empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.\n- Metformin :\n- Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose.\n- It is not chemically or pharmacologically related to any other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents.\n- Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.\n- Unlike SUs, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or normal subjects (except in special circumstances) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia.\n- With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.\n- Empagliflozin is an orally-active inhibitor of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2).\n- The chemical name of empagliflozin is D-Glucitol,1,5-anhydro-1-C-oxyphenylmethylphenyl-, (1S).\n- Its molecular formula is C23H27ClO7 and the molecular weight is 450.91.\n- Empagliflozin is a white to yellowish, non-hygroscopic powder.\n- It is very slightly soluble in water, sparingly soluble in methanol, slightly soluble in ethanol and acetonitrile; soluble in 50% acetonitrile/water; and practically insoluble in toluene.\n- Metformin hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline compound with a molecular formula of C4H11N5HCl and a molecular weight of 165.63.\n- Metformin hydrochloride is freely soluble in water and is practically insoluble in acetone, ether, and chloroform.\n- The pKa of metformin is 12.4.\n- The pH of a 1% aqueous solution of metformin hydrochloride is 6.68.\n- SYNJARDY:\n- Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride tablets for oral administration are available in four dosage strengths containing 5 mg empagliflozin and 500 mg metformin hydrochloride, 5 mg empagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride, 12.5 mg empagliflozin and 500 mg metformin hydrochloride, or 12.5 mg empagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride.\n- Each film-coated tablet of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride contains the following inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate. Film-coating: hypromellose, titanium dioxide, talc, polyethylene glycol 400, and yellow ferric oxide (5 mg/500 mg, 5 mg/1000 mg) or red ferric oxide and black ferrosoferric oxide (12.5 mg/500 mg, 12.5 mg/1000 mg).\n- Urinary Glucose Excretion :\n- In patients with type 2 diabetes, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following a dose of empagliflozin and was maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period averaging at approximately 64 grams per day with 10 mg empagliflozin and 78 grams per day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily.\n- Urinary Volume:\n- In a 5-day study, mean 24-hour urine volume increase from baseline was 341 mL on Day 1 and 135 mL on Day 5 of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily treatment.\n- Cardiac Electrophysiology :\n- In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, crossover study, 30 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of empagliflozin 25 mg, empagliflozin 200 mg (8 times the maximum dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo.\n- No increase in QTc was observed with either 25 mg or 200 mg empagliflozin.\n- The results of a bioequivalence study in healthy subjects demonstrated that Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (empagliflozin/metformin hydrochloride) 5 mg/500 mg, 5 mg/1000 mg, 12.5 mg/500 mg, and 12.5 mg/1000 mg combination tablets are bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding doses of empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride as individual tablets.\n- Administration of 12.5 mg empagliflozin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride under fed conditions resulted in a 9% decrease in AUC and a 28% decrease in Cmax for empagliflozin, when compared to fasted conditions.\n- For metformin, AUC decreased by 12% and Cmax decreased by 26% compared to fasting conditions.\n- The observed effect of food on empagliflozin and metformin is not considered to be clinically relevant.\n- Absorption :\n- The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin has been characterized in healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes and no clinically relevant differences were noted between the two populations.\n- After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were reached at 1.5 hours post-dose.\n- Thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow terminal phase.\n- The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 1870 nmol·h/L and 259 nmol/L, respectively, with 10 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment, and 4740 nmol·h/L and 687 nmol/L, respectively, with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment.\n- Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner in the therapeutic dose range.\n- The single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of empagliflozin were similar, suggesting linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time.\n- Administration of 25 mg empagliflozin after intake of a high-fat and high-calorie meal resulted in slightly lower exposure; AUC decreased by approximately 16% and Cmax decreased by approximately 37%, compared to fasted condition.\n- The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not considered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food.\n- Distribution :\n- The apparent steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73.8 L based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis.\n- Following administration of an oral -empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects, the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 36.8% and plasma protein binding was 86.2%.\n- Metabolism :\n- No major metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in human plasma and the most abundant metabolites were three glucuronide conjugates (2-O-, 3-O-, and 6-O-glucuronide).\n- Systemic exposure of each metabolite was less than 10% of total drug-related material.\n- In vitro studies suggested that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9.\n- Elimination :\n- The apparent terminal elimination half-life of empagliflozin was estimated to be 12.4 h and apparent oral clearance was 10.6 L/h based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis.\n- Following once-daily dosing, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to plasma AUC, was observed at steady-state, which was consistent with empagliflozin half-life.\n- The majority of drug-related radioactivity recovered in feces was unchanged parent drug and approximately half of drug-related radioactivity excreted in urine was unchanged parent drug.\n- The absolute bioavailability of a metformin hydrochloride 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%.\n- Studies using single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride tablets 500 mg to 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination.\n- Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower Cmax, a 25% lower AUC, and a 35 minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting.\n- The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.\n- The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin hydrochloride tablets 850 mg averaged 654±358 L.\n- Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to SUs, which are more than 90% protein bound.\n- Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time.\n- At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL.\n- During controlled clinical trials of metformin, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 mcg/mL, even at maximum doses.\n- Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion.\nRenal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination.\n- Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination.\n- Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours.\n- In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.\n- Specific Populations:\n- Renal Impairment:\n- Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin and metformin after administration of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride in renally impaired patients have not been performed.\n- In patients with mild (eGFR: 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR: 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and severe (eGFR: less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment and subjects with kidney failure/end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, AUC of empagliflozin increased by approximately 18%, 20%, 66%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function.\n- Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were similar in subjects with moderate renal impairment and kidney failure/ESRD compared to patients with normal renal function.\n- Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were roughly 20% higher in subjects with mild and severe renal impairment as compared to subjects with normal renal function.\n- Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the apparent oral clearance of empagliflozin decreased with a decrease in eGFR leading to an increase in drug exposure.\n- However, the fraction of empagliflozin that was excreted unchanged in urine, and urinary glucose excretion, declined with decrease in eGFR.\n- In patients with decreased renal function (based on measured eGFR), the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in eGFR.\n- Hepatic Impairment:\n- In subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment according to the Child-Pugh classification, AUC of empagliflozin increased by approximately 23%, 47%, and 75%, and Cmax increased by approximately 4%, 23%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.\n- No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.\n- Effects of Age, Body Mass Index, Gender, and Race:\n- Based on the population PK analysis, age, body mass index (BMI), gender and race (Asians versus primarily Whites) do not have a clinically meaningful effect on pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin.\n- Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender.\n- Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females.\n- No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed.\n- In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Caucasians (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24).\n- Geriatric:\n- Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis.\n- Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmax is increased, compared with healthy young subjects.\n- From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function.\n- Pediatric:\n- Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components empagliflozin and metformin.\n- In vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions:\n- Empagliflozin does not inhibit, inactivate, or induce CYP450 isoforms.\n- Empagliflozin does not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7.\n- Therefore, no effect of empagliflozin is anticipated on concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates of the major CYP450 isoforms or UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7.\n- The effect of UGT induction (e.g., induction by rifampicin or any other UGT enzyme inducer) on empagliflozin exposure has not been evaluated.\n- Empagliflozin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), but it does not inhibit these efflux transporters at therapeutic doses.\n- Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with drugs that are P-gp substrates.\n- Empagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not OAT1 and OCT2.\n- Empagliflozin does not inhibit any of these human uptake transporters at clinically relevant plasma concentrations and, therefore, no effect of empagliflozin is anticipated on concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates of these uptake transporters.\n- No dose adjustment of empagliflozin is recommended when coadministered with commonly prescribed medicinal products based on results of the described pharmacokinetic studies.\n- Empagliflozin pharmacokinetics were similar with and without coadministration of metformin hydrochloride,glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, verapamil, ramipril, and simvastatin in healthy volunteers and with or without coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide and torsemide in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n- The observed increases in overall exposure (AUC) of empagliflozin following coadministration with gemfibrozil, rifampicin, or probenecid are not clinically relevant.\n- In subjects with normal renal function, coadministration of empagliflozin with probenecid resulted in a 30% decrease in the fraction of empagliflozin excreted in urine without any effect on 24-hour urinary glucose excretion.\n- The relevance of this observation to patients with renal impairment is unknown.\n- Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride:\n- No animal studies have been conducted with the combination of empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility.\n- General toxicity studies in rats up to 13 weeks were performed with the combined components.\n- These studies indicated that no additive toxicity is caused by the combination of empagliflozin and metformin.\n- Carcinogenesis :\n- Carcinogenesis was evaluated in 2-year studies conducted in CD-1 mice and Wistar rats.\n- Empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumors in female rats dosed at 100, 300, or 700 mg/kg/day (up to 72 times the exposure from the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg).\n- In male rats, hemangiomas of the mesenteric lymph node were increased significantly at 700 mg/kg/day or approximately 42 times the exposure from a 25 mg clinical dose.\n- Renal tubule adenomas and carcinomas were observed in male mice at 1000 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 45 times the exposure of the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg.\n- These tumors may be associated with a metabolic pathway predominantly present in the male mouse kidney.\n- Mutagenesis:\n- Empagliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the in vitro Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, the in vitro L5178Y tk+/- mouse lymphoma cell assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats.\n- Impairment of Fertility:\n- Empagliflozin had no effects on mating, fertility or early embryonic development in treated male or female rats up to the high dose of 700 mg/kg/day (approximately 155 times the 25 mg clinical dose in males and females, respectively).\n- Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively.\n- These doses are both approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg/kg/day based on body surface area comparisons.\n- No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice.\n- Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats.\n- There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day.\n- There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes).\n- Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative.\n- Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons.\n- In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with empagliflozin and metformin produced clinically and statistically significant improvements in HbA1c compared to placebo.\n- Reductions in HbA1c were observed across subgroups including age, gender, race, and baseline body mass index (BMI).\n- Empagliflozin Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin :\n- A total of 637 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in combination with metformin.\n- Patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on at least 1500 mg of metformin hydrochloride per day entered an open-label 2-week placebo run-in.\n- At the end of the run-in period, patients who remained inadequately controlled and had an HbA1c between 7 and 10% were randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, or empagliflozin 25 mg.\n- At Week 24, treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg daily provided statistically significant reductions in HbA1c (p-value <0.0001), FPG, and body weight compared with placebo .\na Modified intent to treat population. Last observation on study (LOCF) was used to impute missing data at Week 24. At Week 24, 9.7%, 14.1%, and 24.6% was imputed for patients randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, and placebo, respectively.\nb ANCOVA p-value <0.0001 (HbA1c: ANCOVA model includes baseline HbA1c, treatment, renal function, and region. Body weight and FPG: same model used as for HbA1c but additionally including baseline body weight/baseline FPG, respectively.)\nc FPG (mg/dL); for empagliflozin 10 mg, n=216, for empagliflozin 25 mg, n=213, and for placebo, n=207.\n- At Week 24, the systolic blood pressure was statistically significantly reduced compared to placebo by -4.1 mmHg (placebo-corrected, p-value <0.0001) for empagliflozin 10 mg and -4.8 mmHg (placebo-corrected, p-value <0.0001) for empagliflozin 25 mg.\n- Empagliflozin Initial Combination Therapy with Metformin:\n- A total of 1364 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in combination with metformin as initial therapy compared to the corresponding individual components.\n- Treatment-naïve patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes entered an open-label placebo run-in for 2 weeks.\n- At the end of the run-in period, patients who remained inadequately controlled and had an HbA1c between 7 and 10.5% were randomized to one of 8 active-treatment arms: empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg; metformin hydrochloride 1000 mg, or 2000 mg; empagliflozin 10 mg in combination with 1000 mg or 2000 mg metformin hydrochloride; or empagliflozin 25 mg in combination with 1000 mg or 2000 mg metformin hydrochloride.\n- At Week 24, initial therapy of empagliflozin in combination with metformin provided statistically significant reductions in HbA1c (p-value <0.01) compared to the individual components.\n- Treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg daily provided statistically significant reductions in HbA1c (p-value <0.0001), FPG, and body weight compared with placebo.\n- Active-Controlled Study vs Glimepiride in Combination with Metformin\n- The efficacy of empagliflozin was evaluated in a double-blind, glimepiride-controlled, study in 1545 patients with type 2 diabetes with insufficient glycemic control despite metformin therapy.\n- Patients with inadequate glycemic control and an HbA1c between 7% and 10% after a 2-week run-in period were randomized to glimepiride or empagliflozin 25 mg.\n- At Week 52, empagliflozin 25 mg and glimepiride lowered HbA1c and FPG.\n- The difference in observed effect size between empagliflozin 25 mg and glimepiride excluded the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.3%.\n- The mean daily dose of glimepiride was 2.7 mg and the maximal approved dose in the United States is 8 mg per day.\n- At Week 52, the adjusted mean change from baseline in systolic blood pressure was -3.6 mmHg, compared to 2.2 mmHg for glimepiride.\n- The differences between treatment groups for systolic blood pressure was statistically significant (p-value <0.0001).\n- At Week 104, the adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c was -0.75% for empagliflozin 25 mg and -0.66% for glimepiride.\n- The adjusted mean treatment difference was -0.09% with a 97.5% confidence interval of (-0.32%, 0.15%), excluding the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.3%.\n- The Week 104 analysis included data with and without concomitant glycemic rescue medication, as well as off-treatment data.\n- Missing data for patients not providing any information at the visit were imputed based on the observed off-treatment data.\n- In this multiple imputation analysis, 13.9% of the data were imputed for empagliflozin 25 mg and 12.9% for glimepiride.\n- At Week 104, empagliflozin 25 mg daily resulted in a statistically significant difference in change from baseline for body weight compared to glimepiride (-3.1 kg for empagliflozin 25 mg vs. +1.3 kg for glimepiride; ANCOVA-LOCF, p-value <0.0001).\n\n【15】 # Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Study in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease\n- Empagliflozin is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease.\n- However, the effectiveness of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride on reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease has not been established.\n- The effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular risk in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established, stable, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is presented below.\n- The EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, a multicenter, multi-national, randomized, double-blind parallel group trial compared the risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) between empagliflozin and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\n- Coadministered antidiabetic medications were to be kept stable for the first 12 weeks of the trial.\n- Thereafter, antidiabetic and atherosclerotic therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of investigators, to ensure participants were treated according to the standard care for these diseases.\n- A total of 7020 patients were treated (empagliflozin 10 mg = 2345; empagliflozin 25 mg = 2342; placebo = 2333) and followed for a median of 3.1 years.  Approximately 72% of the study population was Caucasian, 22% was Asian, and 5% was Black.\n- The mean age was 63 years and approximately 72% were male.\n- All patients in the study had inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline (HbA1c greater than or equal to 7%).\n- The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.1% and 57% of participants had had diabetes for more than 10 years.\n- Approximately 31%, 22% and 20% reported a past history of neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy to investigators respectively and the mean eGFR was 74 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n- At baseline, patients were treated with one (~30%) or more (~70%) antidiabetic medications including metformin (74%), insulin (48%), and sulfonylurea (43%).\n- All patients had established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at baseline including one (82%) or more (18%) of the following; a documented history of coronary artery disease (76%), stroke (23%) or peripheral artery disease (21%).\n- At baseline, the mean systolic blood pressure was 136 mmHg, the mean diastolic blood pressure was 76 mmHg, the mean LDL was 86 mg/dL, the mean HDL was 44 mg/dL, and the mean urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) was 175 mg/g.\n- At baseline, approximately 81% of patients were treated with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, 65% with beta-blockers, 43% with diuretics, 77% with statins, and 86% with antiplatelet agents (mostly aspirin).\n- The primary endpoint in EMPA-REG OUTCOME was the time to first occurrence of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE).\n- A major adverse cardiac event was defined as occurrence of either a cardiovascular death or a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a nonfatal stroke.\n- The statistical analysis plan had pre-specified that the 10 and 25 mg doses would be combined.\n- A Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non-inferiority against the pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and superiority on MACE if non-inferiority was demonstrated.\n- Type-1 error was controlled across multiples tests using a hierarchical testing strategy.\n- Empagliflozin significantly reduced the time to first occurrence of primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (HR: 0.86; 95% CI 0.74, 0.99).\n- The treatment effect was due to a significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death in subjects randomized to empagliflozin (HR: 0.62; 95% CI 0.49, 0.77), with no change in the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke.\n- Results for the 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin doses were consistent with results for the combined dose groups.\n- The efficacy of empagliflozin on cardiovascular death was generally consistent across major demographic and disease subgroups.\n- Vital status was obtained for 99.2% of subjects in the trial.\n- A total of 463 deaths were recorded during the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.\n- Most of these deaths were categorized as cardiovascular deaths.\n- The non-cardiovascular deaths were only a small proportion of deaths, and were balanced between the treatment groups (2.1% in patients treated with empagliflozin, and 2.4% of patients treated with placebo).\n- Store in a safe place out of reach of children.\n- Instruct patients to read the Medication Guide before starting Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride therapy and to reread it each time the prescription is renewed.\n- Instruct patients to inform their doctor or pharmacist if they develop any unusual symptom, or if any known symptom persists or worsens.\n- Inform patients of the potential risks and benefits of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride and of alternative modes of therapy.\n- Also inform patients about the importance of adherence to dietary instructions, regular physical activity, periodic blood glucose monitoring and HbA1c testing, recognition and management of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and assessment for diabetes complications.\n- Advise patients to seek medical advice promptly during periods of stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, as medication requirements may change.\n- Lactic Acidosis:\n- Inform patients of the risks of lactic acidosis due to the metformin component, its symptoms, and conditions that predispose to its development.\n- Advise patients to discontinue Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride immediately and to notify their doctor promptly if unexplained hyperventilation, malaise, myalgia, unusual somnolence, slow or irregular heart beat, sensation of feeling cold (especially in the extremities), or other nonspecific symptoms occur.\n- GI symptoms are common during initiation of metformin treatment and may occur during initiation of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride therapy; however, advise patients to consult their doctor if they develop unexplained symptoms.\n- Although GI symptoms that occur after stabilization are unlikely to be drug related, such an occurrence of symptoms should be evaluated to determine if it may be due to metformin-induced lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\n- Hypotension:\n- Inform patients that hypotension may occur with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride and advise them to contact their healthcare provider if they experience such symptoms.\n- Inform patients that dehydration may increase the risk for hypotension, and to have adequate fluid intake.\n- Ketoacidosis:\n- Inform patients that ketoacidosis is a serious life-threatening condition.\n- Cases of ketoacidosis have been reported during use of empagliflozin.\n- Instruct patients to check ketones (when possible) if symptoms consistent with ketoacidosis occur even if blood glucose is not elevated.\n- If symptoms of ketoacidosis (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing) occur, instruct patients to discontinue Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride and seek medical advice immediately.\n- Acute Kidney Injury:\n- Inform patients that acute kidney injury has been reported during use of empagliflozin.\n- Advise patients to seek medical advice immediately if they have reduced oral intake (such as due to acute illness or fasting) or increased fluid losses (such as due to vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive heat exposure), as it may be appropriate to temporarily discontinue Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride use in those settings.\n- Serious Urinary Tract Infections:\n- Inform patients of the potential for urinary tract infections, which may be serious.\n- Provide them with information on the symptoms of urinary tract infections.\n- Advise them to seek medical advice if such symptoms occur.\n- Genital Mycotic Infections in Females (e.g., Vulvovaginitis):\n- Inform female patients that vaginal yeast infections may occur and provide them with information on the signs and symptoms of vaginal yeast infections.\n- Advise them of treatment options and when to seek medical advice.\n- Genital Mycotic Infections in Males (e.g., Balanitis or Balanoposthitis):\n- Inform male patients that yeast infection of penis (e.g., balanitis or balanoposthitis) may occur, especially in uncircumcised males and patients with chronic and recurrent infections.\n- Provide them with information on the signs and symptoms of balanitis and balanoposthitis (rash or redness of the glans or foreskin of the penis).\n- Monitoring of Renal Function:\n- Inform patients about the importance of regular testing of renal function when receiving treatment with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.\n- Instruct patients to inform their doctor that they are taking Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride prior to any surgical or radiological procedure, as temporary discontinuation of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride may be required until renal function has been confirmed to be normal.\n- Hypoglycemia:\n- Inform patients that the risk of hypoglycemia is increased when Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), and that a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.\n- Laboratory Tests:\n- Inform patients that elevated glucose in urinalysis is expected when taking Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.\n- Pregnancy:\n- Advise pregnant women, and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus with treatment with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.\n- Instruct females of reproductive potential to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.\n- Lactation:\n- Advise women that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride.\n- Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:\n- Inform females that treatment with metformin may result in ovulation in some premenopausal anovulatory women which may lead to unintended pregnancy.\n- Missed Dose:\n- Instruct patients to take Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride only as prescribed.\n- If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers.\n- Advise patients not to double their next dose.\n- Blood Glucose and A1C Monitoring:\n- Inform patients that response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic measurements of blood glucose and HbA1c levels, with a goal of decreasing these levels toward the normal range.\n- Hemoglobin A1c monitoring is especially useful for evaluating long-term glycemic control.\n- Inform patients that the most common adverse reactions associated with the use of Empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride are hypoglycemia, urinary tract infection, and nasopharyngitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Preexposure prophylaxis against HAV infection through the administration of HepA vaccine or IG provides protection for unvaccinated persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate HAV endemicity. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group conducted a systematic review of the evidence for administering vaccine for PEP to persons aged >40 years and reviewed the HepA vaccine efficacy and safety in infants and the benefits of protection against HAV before international travel. The February 21, 2018, ACIP recommendations update and supersede previous ACIP recommendations for HepA vaccine for PEP and for international travel. Current recommendations include that HepA vaccine should be administered to all persons aged ≥12 months for PEP. In addition to HepA vaccine, IG may be administered to persons aged >40 years depending on the provider's risk assessment. ACIP also recommended that HepA vaccine be administered to infants aged 6-11 months traveling outside the United States when protection against HAV is recommended. The travel-related dose for infants aged 6-11 months should not be counted toward the routine 2-dose series. The dosage of IG has been updated where applicable (0.1 mL/kg).

The efficacy of IG or vaccine when administered >2 weeks after exposure has not been established.\nPrevious ACIP- recommendations for PEP included HepA vaccine for persons aged 1-40 years and IG for persons outside this age range; if IG was not available for persons aged >40 years, HepA vaccine could be administered .\nPreexposure prophylaxis against HAV infection through the administration of HepA vaccine or IG is also recommended for unvaccinated persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate HAV endemicity . Because HepA vaccine is not licensed for use in children aged <1 year, IG has historically been recommended for travelers in this age group; however, IG cannot be administered simultaneously with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is also recommended for infants aged 6-11 months traveling internationally from the United States .\nThis report provides recommendations for PEP use of HepA vaccine and IG, and use of HepA vaccine and IG for preexposure protection for persons who will be traveling internationally, including infants aged 6-11 months. This report updates and supersedes previous ACIP recommendations for HepA vaccine for PEP and for international travel .\n\n【1】 # Methods\nDuring November 2016-February 2018, the ACIP Hepatitis Work Group  held monthly conference calls to review and - Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents, and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of CDC on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian U.S. population. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults are harmonized with the recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations approved by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the date published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR),  The ACIP Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group comprises professionals from academic medicine (family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, infectious disease, occupational health, and preventive medicine specialists), federal and state public health entities, and medical societies.\nPlease note: An erratum has been published for this issue.  discuss relevant scientific evidence,  including the use of HepA vaccine and IG for PEP and the use of HepA vaccine for infants before some international travel. The ACIP Hepatitis Work Group evaluated the quality of evidence related to the benefits and harms of administering a dose of HepA vaccine for PEP for persons aged >40 years using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework (. html). Quality of evidence related to the benefits and harms of administering HepA vaccine for preexposure prophylaxis to infants aged 6-11 months who will be traveling internationally was not evaluated using the GRADE framework; instead, studies of HepA vaccine efficacy and safety in infants  and the benefits of protection against HAV before international travel were considered .\nAt the February 2018 ACIP meeting, the following proposed recommendations were presented to the committee: 1 HepA vaccines should be administered for PEP for all persons aged ≥12 months; in addition to HepA vaccine, IG may be administered to persons aged >40 years for PEP, depending on the provider's risk assessment; and 2 HepA vaccine should be administered to infants aged 6-11 months traveling outside the United States when protection against hepatitis A is recommended. After a period for public comment, the recommendations were approved unanimously by the voting ACIP members. \n\n【2】 # Summary of Key Findings\nPrevention of HAV infection with HepA vaccine following exposure. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial of HepA vaccine in 1,090 HAV-susceptible persons aged 2-40 years who were contacts of persons with HAV infection suggested that performance of HepA vaccine administered 40 years; available data indicate reduced response to HepA vaccine in older age groups compared with response in younger adults .  In preparation for ACIP deliberation, the scientific literature was searched using PubMed and EMBASE databases for reports published from January 1, 1992, through January 7, 2017. Search terms included \"hepatitis A vaccine\" and \"HAV vaccine\" and excluded studies in nonhumans and articles on children and adolescents. To qualify as a candidate for inclusion in the review, a study had to include data within 2 weeks of the first dose of HepA vaccine. Studies were excluded if they reported data focused solely on children, did not provide information on ages of persons studied, did not include data on Havrix or Vaqta (the two single antigen HepA vaccines currently licensed in the United States), only included safety data or discussed vaccine introduction without providing new data on vaccine efficacy or seroprotection, or only reported data on persons with underlying health conditions.  14 voted in favor, with none opposed, none abstained, and none recused. GRADE quality of evidence summary for HepA vaccine for PEP in persons aged >40 years. The evidence assessing benefits and harms of administering a dose of HepA vaccine for PEP to prevent HAV infection in adults aged >40 years was determined to be GRADE evidence type 4 (i.e., evidence from clinical experience and observations, observational studies with important limitations, or randomized controlled trials with several major limitations) for benefits and type 3 (i.e., evidence from observational studies, or randomized controlled trials with notable limitations) for harms (. gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/).\nPrevention of HAV infection among infants aged 6-11 months who received HepA vaccine before travel. HepA vaccine was demonstrated to be safe and efficacious for infants as young as age 2 months .\n\n【3】 # Rationale for Recommendations\nAdvantages of HepA vaccine for PEP. HepA vaccine for PEP provides numerous public health advantages compared with IG, including the induction of active immunity and longer duration of protection, ease of administration, and greater acceptability and availability . Previous recommendations favoring IG for adults aged >40 years were based on the premise that IG is more efficacious in this group; however, evidence of decreased IG potency (i.e., reduced titers of anti-HAV antibodies)  led to a recommendation for an increase in the IG dosage (0.1 mL/kg) for hepatitis A PEP in 2017, with a consequent increase in IG administration volume . In addition, when HAV exposure, and thus the need for PEP, is not clear (i.e., consumer of recalled food product or patron at a restaurant where a notification occurred), the benefit of IG compared with vaccine, which provides long-term protection, is less certain.\nBefore travel administration of HepA vaccine to infants aged 6-11 months. IG cannot be administered simultaneously with MMR vaccine because antibody-containing products such as IG can inhibit the immune response to measles and rubella vaccines for 3 months .\n\n【4】 # Recommendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis Against HAV Infection\nHepA vaccine should be administered to all persons aged ≥12 months for PEP. In addition to HepA vaccine, IG may be administered to persons aged >40 years, depending on the provider's risk assessment (Supplementary Text 1, ). Recommendations for PEP have been updated to include HepA vaccine for all unvaccinated persons aged ≥12 months, regardless of risk group, and co-administration of IG when indicated . The dosage of GamaSTAN S/D human IG for PEP (0.1 mL/kg) also has been updated . Persons who have recently been exposed to HAV and who have not received HepA vaccine previously should receive PEP as soon as possible, within 2 weeks of exposure .\nInfants aged <12 months and persons for whom vaccine is contraindicated. Infants aged <12 months and persons for whom vaccine is contraindicated (persons who have had a lifethreatening allergic reaction after a dose of HepA vaccine, or who have a severe allergy to any component of this vaccine) should receive IG (0.1 mL/kg) .\nImmunocompetent persons aged ≥12 months. Persons aged ≥12 months who have been exposed to HAV within the past 14 days and have not previously completed the 2-dose HepA vaccine series should receive a single dose of HepA vaccine  as soon as possible. In addition to HepA vaccine, IG (0.1 mL/kg) may be administered to persons aged >40 years depending on the providers' risk assessment (Supplementary Text 1, ). For long-term immunity, the HepA vaccine series should be completed with a second dose at least 6 months after the first dose; however, the second dose is not necessary for PEP. A second dose should not be administered any sooner than 6 months after the first dose, regardless of HAV exposure risk.\nPersons aged ≥12 months who are immunocompromised or have chronic liver disease. Persons who are immunocompromised or have chronic liver disease and who have been exposed to HAV within the past 14 days and have not previously completed the 2-dose HepA vaccination series should receive both IG (0.1 mL/kg) and HepA vaccine simultaneously in a different anatomic site (e.g., separate limbs) as soon as - Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine should not be administered for at least 3 months after receipt of IG.  A second dose is not required for postexposure prophylaxis; however, for long-term immunity, the hepatitis A vaccination series should be completed with a second dose at least 6 months after the first dose.  The provider's risk assessment should determine the need for immune globulin administration. If the provider's risk assessment determines that both vaccine and immune globulin are warranted, HepA vaccine and immune globulin should be administered simultaneously at different anatomic sites  Vaccine and immune globulin should be administered simultaneously at different anatomic sites.  Life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis A vaccine, or allergy to any vaccine component.   IG should be considered before travel for persons with special risk factors for either HAV infection or increased risk for complications in the event of exposure to HAV.   0.1 mL/kg for travel up to 1 month; 0.2 mL/kg for travel up to 2 months, 0.2mL/kg every 2 months for travel of ≥2 months' duration.   This dose should not be counted toward the routine 2-dose series, which should be initiated at age 12 months. * For persons not previously vaccinated with HepA vaccine, administer dose as soon as travel is considered, and complete series according to routine schedule.    May be administered, based on providers' risk assessment.\npossible after exposure  . For long-term immunity, the HepA vaccination series should be completed with a second dose at least 6 months after the first dose; however, the second dose is not necessary for PEP. A second dose should not be administered any sooner than 6 months after the first dose, regardless of HAV exposure risk.\nIn addition to HepA vaccine, IG should be considered for postexposure prophylaxis for persons with special risk factors for either HAV infection or increased risk of complications in the event of an exposure to HAV  (Supplementary Text 1, ). What are the implications for public health practice?\nHepA vaccine for PEP provides advantages over IG, including induction of active immunity, longer duration of protection, ease of administration, and greater acceptability and availability.\n. The travel-related dose for infants aged 6-11 months should not be counted toward the routine 2-dose series. Therefore, the 2-dose HepA vaccination series should be initiated at age 12 months according to the routine, age-appropriate vaccination schedule. Recommendations for preexposure protection against HAV for travelers aged <6 months and aged ≥12 months remain unchanged from previous recommendation. except for the updated dosage of IG where applicable (Supplementary Text 2, ) . For travel duration up to 1 month, 0.1 mL/kg of IG is recommended; for travel up to 2 months, the dose is 0.2 mL/kg, and for travel of ≥2 months, a 0.2 mL/kg dose should be repeated every 2 months for the duration of travel. All susceptible persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate HAV endemicity are at increased risk for infection and should be vaccinated or receive IG before departure .\n\n【5】 # Recommendations for Preexposure Protection Against HAV Infection for Travelers\nInfants aged 6-11 months.

There may be difficulty breathing, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and/or dyspepsia (discomfort in the upper abdomen), especially if the lump becomes large.\nThe most common locations for a thyroglossal cyst is midline or slightly off midline, between the isthmus of the thyroid and the hyoid bone or just above the hyoid bone. A thyroglossal cyst can develop anywhere along a thyroglossal duct, though cysts within the tongue or in the floor of the mouth are rare.\nA thyroglossal cyst will move upwards with protrusion of the tongue.\nThyroglossal cysts are associated with an increased incidence of ectopic thyroid tissue. Occasionally, a lingual thyroid can be seen as a flattened strawberry-like lump at the base of the tongue.\nVery rarely, the persistent duct can become cancerous, called thyroglossal duct carcinoma. In the case of thyroglossal duct carcinoma, the cancerous cells are ectopic thyroid tissue that has been deposited along the thyroglossal duct and usually follows exposure to radiation.\n\n【3】 # Embryology\nThe thyroglossal tract arises from the foramen cecum at the junction of the anterior two-thirds and posterior one-third of the tongue.  Any part of the tract can persist causing a sinus, fistula or cyst.  Most fistulae are acquired following rupture or incision of the infected thyroglossal cyst.\n\n【4】 # Diagnosis\n\n【5】 ## Symptoms\nThyroglossal duct cysts most often present with a palpable (able to be felt) asymptomatic midline neck mass below the level of the hyoid bone. The mass on the neck moves during swallowing. Some patients will have neck or throat pain, or dysphagia.\nThe persistent duct or sinus can promote oral secretions, which may cause cysts to become infected. Up to half of thyroglossal cysts are not diagnosed until adult life. The tract can lie dormant for years or even decades until some kind of stimulus leads to cystic dilation. Infection can sometimes cause the transient appearance of a mass or enlargement of the cyst, at times with periodic recurrences. Spontaneous drainage may also occur.\n\n【6】 # Clinical Features\nClinical features can be found in the subhyoid portion of the tract and 75% present as midline swellings. The remainder can be found as far lateral as the lateral tip of the hyoid bone.\n\n【7】 # Treatment\nTreatment for a thyroglossal cyst is surgical resection, often requiring concomitant removal of the midsection of the hyoid bone. Although generally benign the cyst will be removed if the patient exhibits difficulty in breathing or swallowing, or if the cyst is infected. Even if these symptoms are not present the cyst may be removed to eliminate the chance of infection or development of a carcinoma, or for cosmetic reasons if there is unsightly protrusion from the neck.\nSurgical management requires excision not only of the cyst but also of the path's tract and branches. A removal of the central portion of the hyoid bone is indicated to ensure complete removal of the tract. It is unlikely that there will be a recurrence after such an operation. At times antibiotics can be indicated if there is sign of infection.\nThyroid scans and thyroid function studies are ordered preoperatively, this is important to demonstrate that normally functioning thyroid tissue is in its usual location.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It is a complication of myocardial infarction (MI) and it is categorized into true and false aneurysms, based on the nature of it's wall. It is usually asymptomatic but may present as chest pain and dyspnea, and it should be suspected in patients with sustained ST elevation after MI. The diagnosis is based on echocardiographic findings.\n\n【2】 # Historical perspective\nThe British vascular surgeons, John and William Hunter, first described the aneurysm in 1880. In 1967, Gorlin and colleagues reported that aneurysms can be strongly suspected in up to 75% of patients with myocardial infarction.\n\n【3】 # Classification\nBased on the nature of the wall and its components, left ventricular aneurysms are classified as true or false aneurysms.\n\n【4】 ## True Left Ventricular Aneurysm\nA true left ventricular aneurysm has an aneurysmal sac which contains the endocardium, epicardium, and thinned fibrous tissue (scar) which is a remnant of the left ventricular muscle.\n\n【5】 ## False Left Ventricular Aneurysm or Pseudoaneurysm\nUnlike a true aneurysm which contains some myocardial elements in its wall, the walls of a false aneurysm are composed of organized hematoma and pericardium and lack any element of the original myocardial wall.\n\n【6】 # Pathophysiology\nAneurysms form when intraventricular tension stretches the noncontracting, infarcted heart muscle, producing the expansion of the thin layer of necrotic muscle and fibrous tissue, which bulge with each cardiac contraction. The wall of a mature aneurysm is a white fibrous scar which becomes more densely fibrotic with the passage of time. The outward bulge with each cardiac contraction compromises the left ventricular stroke volume. On histopathological analysis, hyalinized fibrous tissue is the predominant finding. It usually takes 1 month for fibrous tissue to form.\n\n【7】 # Causes\nMyocardial infarction is the most common cause of left ventricular (LV) aneurysm formation. Less common causes include HCM, trauma, idiopathic and congenital abnormalities.\n\n【8】 # Differential diagnosis\nTrue LV aneurysm must be differentiated from false aneurysms.\n\n【9】 # Epidemiology\nIt was estimated that LV aneurysm develops in 30%-35% of patients with Q wave MI, but this has decreased significantly due to improvements in the management of patients with acute MI. Currently it is estimated that true left ventricular aneurysms develop in less than 5% of all patients with STEMI.\nAccording to this report, the use of thrombolytic agents has decreased the incidence of LV aneurysm from 18.8% to 7.2%.\n\n【10】 # Risk Factors\nThe most potent risk factor for the development of LV aneurysm is ST elevation MI. Other risk factors include:\n- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)\n- Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)\n- Advanced age\n- Hypertension\n- Use of corticosteroids\n\n【11】 # Screening\nThe clue to the diagnosis of LV aneurysm following MI is a persistent ST elevation without chest pain, and there is no recommendation to screen patients for LV aneurysm.\n\n【12】 # Natural History\nIf left untreated, it may lead to heart failure and persistent anginal pain. For false aneurysms, rupture and hemodynamic compromise are the usual outcomes if left untreated. Improvements in STEMI management, control of hypertension and avoidance of corticosteroids in STEMI have led to a better prognosis and decreased mortality.\n\n【13】 # Complications\nMural thrombosis, heart failure, persistent angina, and arrhythmia, are the major complications.\n\n【14】 # Symptoms\nThe symptoms of left ventricular aneurysm depends on the size of the aneurysm. Small and medium sized aneurysms are usually asymptomatic but large sized aneurysms may present as persistent chest pain and dyspnea despite the proper treatment of the underlying cardiac condition.\n\n【15】 # Physical exam\nPhysical findings on cardiac examination in patients with LV aneurysm include diffuse and displaced apical impulse, S3 and/or S4 heart sounds and mitral regurgitation murmur.\n\n【16】 # Electrocardiography\nA persistent ST elevation is suggestive of LV aneurysm.\n\n【17】 # Chest X ray\nA bulge of the silhouette of the left ventricle on chest x-ray is the characteristic finding for LV aneurysm.\n\n【18】 # CT scan\nChest CT scan with or without contrast may reveal the size and the location of LV aneurysm, it can also show the presence of calcifications in it.\n\n【19】 # MRI\nCardiac MRI is helpful for the diagnosis of LV aneurysm and it may be emerging as the preferred noninvasive technique for the preoperative assessment of LV shape, thinning, and resectability.\n\n【20】 # Echocardiography\n- Echocardiography is the modality of choice for the diagnosis of LV aneurysm. \n- It can measure the size and location of the aneurysm, and it is helpful for distinguishing true from false aneurysms based on the mouth size.\n- Echocardiography is useful to diagnose dyskinesia or akinesia during systole.\n- Echocardiography is helpful to diagnose mural thrombosis in aneurysm sac.\n- Color flow echocardiography is helpful to establish the diagnosis based on in and out flow in the aneurysm.\n\n【21】 # Medical Therapy\nMedical therapy is indicated for small and medium-sized LV aneurysms. Medical therapy is targeted at decreasing the cardiac work load (afterload reduction), anti ischemic therapy for chest pain and anti coagulation if mural thrombosis exist.\n- Afterload reduction:\n- Anti ischemic therapy:\n\n【22】 # Surgery\n- Surgical aneurysmectomy is recommended for large symptomatic aneurysms that cause angina pectoris or heart failure. Appropriate CABG is indicated at the time of aneurysmectomy.\n- Another indication for surgical intervention is in patients who can not tolerate long term anticoagulation therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The Orthopoxvirus genus also includes variola virus (causes smallpox), vaccinia virus (used in the smallpox vaccine) and cowpox. Monkeys, rodents and nonhuman primates can harbour the virus and infect people. 1 Monkeypox cases in humans have been increasing since its discovery in the 1950s, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where it is now considered endemic. The age of infection has increased over time from young children to now more predominantly young adults and those of reproductive age. 2 While most cases occur in central Africa, cases outside of Africa have been reported periodically. The last outbreak in North America was reported in several American states in 2003 when community transmission resulted from contact with infected prairie dogs that had been housed with rodents imported from Ghana. 3 This outbreak was effectively contained with extensive education, laboratory testing and use of smallpox vaccines and treatments. 4\n\n【2】 # Natural History\nThe incubation period of monkeypox is usually 7-14 days, but can range from 5-21 days. The prodromal illness begins with generalized symptoms including fever, headache, myalgias, backache, lymphadenopathy (as a point of distinction from smallpox and varicella which do not cause lymphadenopathy), drenching sweats, chills and fatigue. Within 1-10 days, the patient develops a rash. The rash typically progresses from macules to papules, to vesicles, then to pustules that finally crust. The rash may start on the face and then spread to other parts of the body. In general, the illness lasts 2-4 weeks. The Central African clade can cause death in 1 in 10 persons, but the West African Clade is much less severe. The reported cases in the recent outbreak are of the West African Clade (milder disease). 5,6 The WHO classifies severity of monkeypox based on number of skin lesions:\n-Mild 250 skin lesions\n\n【3】 # Investigation\nThe differential diagnoses for presentations of fever, rash and lymphadenopathy in pregnancy are broad, and include human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, varicella, cytomegalovirus and parvovirus B19. Given the potential impact of these conditions on the fetus, they must be considered in the initial investigations for a suspected case of monkeypox in pregnancy. In addition, coxsackie virus (the pathogen causing hand, foot and mouth disease) can cause mouth, palmar and plantar vesicular lesions, but does not cause specific maternal/fetal morbidity.\n\n【4】 # Transmission\nThe virus enters the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or mucous membranes. Animal-to-human transmission can be through a bite, scratch, bush meat preparation, direct contact with a lesion or body fluids or indirect contact with body fluids such as bedding. Human-to-human contact is principally through large droplet transmission (prolonged face-to-face contact is required), as well as, direct contact with a lesion or body fluids or indirect contact with body fluids such as bedding. A more recent epidemiologic analysis from the DRC has raised questions about mode of transmission because, among the cohort studied, it was not clear whether all current cases had contact with an infected person. 7,8 There is limited information regarding asymptomatic shedding but the current research indicates viral shedding coincides with the onset of symptoms. Asymptomatic carriage and viral shedding prior to the onset of symptoms has not been reported. 7 Current recommendations from the Public Health Agency of Canada include airborne, droplet and contact precautions to be employed for suspected, probable and confirmed cases of monkeypox. 9\n\n【5】 # Prevention\nSmallpox vaccine has been reported to reduce the risk of monkeypox by 85% among previously vaccinated persons in Africa. Exposed persons should be vaccinated within 4 days of exposure if possible. Vaccination after 4 days, but before 14 days may not prevent infection but may attenuate symptoms. 3,5\n\n【6】 # Treatment\nThere is no proven treatment for monkeypox at present. To control outbreaks, smallpox vaccine, antivirals (e.g., cidofovir and tecovirimat) and vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) can be used. 9 Cidofovir is classified as category C by the FDA because in animal studies embryotoxicity and teratogenicity were noted, including reduced fetal weight and increased incidence of fetal external, soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities. There is no available safety data for tecovirimat in pregnancy. While no studies of the vaccinia immunoglobulin are known, other immunoglobulins have been used extensively in pregnancy and felt to be safe. There are no contraindications to the use of the smallpox vaccine in emergency and exposure situations.\n\n【7】 # Monkeypox and pregnancy 3, 5\nWe know that other orthopoxvirus infections, such as variola virus (smallpox) result in worse outcomes in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (i.e., higher rate of hemorrhagic smallpox that carries a case-fatality rate of 70% for unvaccinated pregnant women). In addition, smallpox infection in pregnancy is associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and preterm delivery. However, it is not known whether this holds true with monkeypox.\nThere are a limited number of reports from which to inform ourselves about monkeypox in pregnant women. As detailed below, of the 5 cases reported in the formal literature, 1 resulted in a live birth, 2 in miscarriages and 1 stillbirth and 1 neonatal death:\n-In the DRC (formerly Zaire), there was a case of a woman who was 24 weeks pregnant when she developed monkeypox (culture-proven) and she delivered a 1,500 g female infant 6 weeks later (at 30 weeks) with a generalized skin rash resembling monkeypox. This infant died of malnutrition at 6 weeks of age. 3 -A case series by Mbala et al. 5 reported fetal outcomes for four pregnant women in the DRC. These four women were the only pregnant patients among 222 patients symptomatic from monkeypox. Of these four women, by WHO classification, one had mild disease, two had moderate disease and one had severe disease. The only live birth was from the woman with mild disease, who was infected in the early 2 nd trimester, while the other three patients had either miscarriages (2/4) or fetal demise (1/4). Monkeypox was detected on the fetal tissue of the 18 week fetal demise case along with visible skin lesions on the infant. 5 If monkeypox is diagnosed in a pregnant patient, a multidisciplinary team including maternal-fetal medicine and infectious diseases or reproductive infectious diseases should be assembled.\n\n【8】 # Smallpox vaccine in pregnancy\nThere has been an evolution of the smallpox vaccine over time with an attenuation of viral replication potential. The first-and second-generations (e.g., ACAM 2000) of vaccines are live-attenuated vaccines with replication potential, but the third-generation vaccine (e.g., Imvamune) uses non-replicating virus which de facto cannot cause vaccinia in the recipient.\nImportantly, this third-generation vaccine only became licensed in 2019-2020 and therefore most data that we have related to the use of smallpox vaccine in pregnancy is based on first-and second-generation technology that uses a live-attenuated vaccinia virus with replicating potential. Badell et al conducted a systematic review that included 37 articles dating back into the 19 th century. 10 No adverse maternal outcomes were described for those vaccinated. This systematic review focused on three primary outcomes:\n- Spontaneous abortion: no association was found between the use of the smallpox vaccine and spontaneous abortion even when analysis was restricted to studies considering first trimester exposure (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.76-1.41) o Congenital defects: no increased risk of congenital anomaly for fetuses exposed to the smallpox vaccine (RR 1.25 95% CI 0.99-1.56). Of five studies restricted to first trimester exposure, four demonstrated no increased risk of congenital anomalies and one demonstrated an increased risk with no specific pattern of congenital anomaly associated with the smallpox vaccination. o Fetal vaccinia: Of the 37 articles, 18 articles included fetal outcomes of 12,201 pregnant women vaccinated against smallpox and no cases of fetal vaccinia were reported. In 19 articles, 21 cases of fetal vaccinia were described between 1809 to present.\nThe vaccine that is available for use in the current outbreak in Canada is a third-generation vaccine (Imvamune) that is non-replicating. No clinical trials have been conducted in pregnant individuals, although approximately 300 pregnancies have been reported to the manufacturer with no safety issues identified. Similarly, the available developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) data has not identified safety issues in animal studies. No data is available to determine whether Imvamune is excreted in breastmilk, but given that it is non-replicating, it is unlikely. Therefore, there is no biological concern with using this vaccine in pregnancy.\nBased on a small number of case reports and our experience with other viruses from the same family in pregnancy (i.e., smallpox), we believe that the risk of monkeypox to the pregnant woman and fetus could be significant. While data specific to the use of Imvamune in pregnancy are limited, the experience of using less-attenuated smallpox vaccines during pregnancy from 1809 to present is reassuring. Further, the rare risk of fetal vaccinia infection is felt to be completely obviated by use of a third-generation live-attenuated, non-replicating vaccine such as Imvamune.\nHence, the smallpox vaccine should be recommended as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to pregnant women, who are exposed to monkeypox, in accordance with jurisdictional-specific direction on categories of exposures that qualify for PEP.\n\n【9】 # Maternal-to-Child-transmission\nBased on the few cases of monkeypox in pregnancy that have been reported, vertical transmission appears possible.\nIn the five cases reported by Jameison 3 and Mbala, 5 two had supportive evidence of in utero transmission. The rate and gestational age at which it occurs is unclear and the fetal consequences are yet to be delineated. Almost nothing is known about genital tract shedding and perinatal monkeypox transmission.\n\n【10】 # Mode of Delivery\nFor antenatal monkeypox resolved by the time of delivery, mode of delivery should be determined based on obstetrical factors exclusively. There is no evidence that cesarean delivery will prevent neonatal monkeypox in the context of maternal monkeypox infection. In the context of active isolated genital lesions, cesarean delivery could be considered.\n\n【11】 # Peripartum Considerations\nInfant and newborn monkeybox disease appears to have serious morbidity. Horizontal transmission in the newborn period is of concern. It is advised to engage a multidisciplinary team including infection prevention and control experts, as well as, pediatric infectious diseases specialists to make decisions with respect to co-habitation of a newborn and mother who is actively infected with monkeypox. Where an infant appears uninfected at birth, strong consideration should be given to temporary separation of mother and infant in an attempt to prevent newborn infection. The length of time of separation will depend on individual factors (e.g stage of disease at delivery) and should be decided in consultation with a multidisciplinary team.\n\n【12】 # Breastfeeding\nIt is unknown whether monkeypox can be transmitted through breast-feeding or breastmilk. With active maternal disease, avoidance of breastfeeding until resolution of symptoms may be considered. Multidisciplinary discussions should guide management of individualized cases. 11\n\n【13】 # Precautions for patient interactions\nFor anyone presenting with unexplained fever, rash or prominent lymphadenopathy, monkeypox should be considered on the differential diagnosis, and appropriate contact, droplet and airborne precautions should be used. Testing, treatment and public health notification should be carried out in accordance with jurisdiction-specific protocols.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It was originally described in 1950. The use of esophageal tamponade in the treatment of bleeding varices has been known since Westphal described it in 1930.\nIt consists of a multiluminal plastic tube with two inflatable balloons. Apart from the balloons, two lumens serve the proximal esophagus and the gastric tip of the device, respectively (although earlier devices had no oesophageal lumen, requiring the parallel insertion of a nasogastric tube). It is passed down into the oesopagus and the distal balloon inflated in the stomach. Distension of the proximal balloon is used to stop bleeding from the varices. The gastric lumen is for aspirating stomach contents.\nGenerally it is used only in emergencies where bleeding from presumed varices is impossible to control by administration of medication. It may be difficult to position, particularly in an unwell patient, and may inadvertently be inserted in the trachea, hence endotracheal intubation before the procedure is strongly advised to secure the airway. The tube is often kept in the refrigerator in the hospital's emergency department, intensive care unit and gastroenterology ward. It is a temporary measure: ulceration and rupture of the esophagus and stomach are recognized complications.\nA related device with a larger gastric balloon capacity, the Linton-Nachlas tube, is used for isolated gastric hemorrhage (such as with gastric varices).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

While there are no specific ASL requirements for undergraduates, many graduate programs have sign language proficiency requirements.\n\n【1】 # History\nIn 1856, philanthropist and former United States Postmaster General Amos Kendall became aware of several deaf and blind children in Washington, DC who were not receiving proper care. Kendall had the courts declare the children to be his wards, and donated two acres of his land to establish housing and a school for them. \nIn 1857, the 34th Congress passed HR 806, which chartered Kendall's school as the Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind and provided funding for the tuition of indigent deaf, dumb, or blind children belonging to the District. \nIn 1864, the 38th Congress authorized the Institution to grant and confirm college degrees. \nIn 1865, the 38th Congress removed the instruction that the Institution was to educate the blind, and renamed it the \"Columbia Institution for the instruction of the Deaf and Dumb\"\nIn 1954, Congress amended the charter of the Institution, and renamed it \"Gallaudet College\". \nIn 1986, Congress again amended the charter of the Institution, and renamed it \"Gallaudet University\".\n\n【2】 # Controversy\n\n【3】 ## Deaf President Now \nStudent strikes at Gallaudet University starting March 6, 1988 revolutionized the perception and education of Deaf culture. Deaf students were outraged at the selection of another hearing president, Elisabeth Zinser, after a long line of university presidents who were not deaf. Alumni, faculty, staff, and students demanded that the next president of the university be deaf. After a week of protest and activism, Zinser resigned and was replaced by I. King Jordan. This movement became known as Deaf President Now (DPN).\n\n【4】 ## Unity for Gallaudet Movement \nDr. Jordan announced his retirement in September 2005. On May 1, 2006, the University's Board of Trustees announced that Dr. Jane K. Fernandes, the University's current provost, would be the University's next president. This was met with protests from the student body, both in person on campus and in internet blogs and forums.  This also marked what is sometimes referred to as the Deaf Blog Revolution.\nInitially, students cited the lack of racial diversity among finalists, Fernandes's lack of warmth, and, as The Washington Post claimed, her lack of fluency in American Sign Language.\nDr. Jordan publicly accused some critics of rejecting Dr. Fernandes because \"she is not deaf enough.\" He described the protest as \"identity politics,\" saying, \"We are squabbling about what it means to be deaf.\"\nThe Washington Post reported that Fernandes \"would like to see the institution become more inclusive of people who might not have grown up using sign language,\" stating that Gallaudet must embrace \"all kinds of deaf people.\" Those who opposed her, said that they feared a \"weakening of American Sign Language at an institution that should be its standard-bearer.\"\nProtesters said Fernandes distorted their arguments, and the protest centered on her inability to lead, an unfair selection process and longstanding problems at the school.\nIn the spring 2006 protest, students blocked entrances to the Gallaudet campus, held rallies, and set up tents near the University's main entrance. Fernandes, appointed to serve as president-designate until Jordan retired, promised that she would not step down. On May 8, the faculty gave a vote of no confidence for Dr. Fernandes.\nWhen the fall 2006 academic year resumed, some students, faculty, staff, and alumni continued their protest, calling for Fernandes to step down and the for the presidential search to be done again. On October 11, a group of protesting students shut down the campus. On October 16 at a regularly scheduled meeting, faculty members voted 138-24 to block Dr. Fernandes from becoming president of Gallaudet University.\nOn October 13, 133 students were arrested under the orders of then-President I. King Jordan after ignoring university warnings not to block entrances to school buildings.\nJane Fernandes said, \"I really don't understand. So I have to believe it's not about me  I believe it's about evolution and change and growth in the deaf community.\"\nOn October 29, the university withdrew the appointment of Jane Fernandes. In an opinion piece in The Washington Post, former President Jordan defended Fernandes' remarks and denounced the board's decision and the actions of the protesters, saying \"I am convinced that the board made a serious error in acceding to the demands of the protesters by terminating Fernandes's presidency before it began.\"\nOn December 10, 2006, the Board of Trustees announced that Robert Davila would serve as interim president for a period of up to two years.\n\n【5】 ## Threat to continued accreditation\nOn June 29, 2007, in the aftermath of the controversy over the university's presidency, Gallaudet was placed on probation by its accreditation organization, the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. In January 2007, former president Jordan had warned that \"A visiting team from the Middle States Association's Commission on Higher Education made clear in its exit report to the campus community this month that closing a university and denying the free exchange of ideas is not an acceptable expression of disagreement.\"\nThe Washington Post reported that the Middle States Commission cited concerns about deficiencies in standards for leadership, academic rigor, student retention and integrity that must be resolved for the school to maintain accreditation. The newspaper noted that in 2006 the Office of Management and Budget had reported that \"Gallaudet failed to meet its goals or showed declining performance in key areas, including the number of students who stay in school, graduate and either pursue graduate degrees or find jobs upon graduation.\" According to the article, if the school should become unaccredited, students would become ineligible to receive federal loans and could be unable to transfer credits to other schools, while the school might lose its federal government funding of $108 million per year.\n\n【6】 # Federal involvement\nThe university acknowledges that it \"is a congressionally created corporation that serves governmental objectives.\" \nThe university and the Department of Education explain that Gallaudet has been structured by the Federal Government to take the form of a \"federally chartered, private, non-profit educational institution.\"  The federal government plays various roles within the institution:\n- Congress incorporated the Columbia institution in 1857, significantly amended its charter in 1954 and authorizing permanent congressional appropriations. In 1986, Congress passed the Education of the Deaf Act and amended it in 1992. These Congressional acts are part of \"the supreme law of Gallaudet University.\"\n- Gallaudet must obtain authorization from the Secretary of the US Department of Education in order to sell or transfer title of any of its real property\n- The diplomas of all Gallaudet graduates are signed by the current U.S. President. \n- Three members of Congress are appointed to the university's Board of Trustees as \"Public Members.\"\n- Gallaudet must provide annual reports to the Secretary of Education.\n- \"Gallaudet receives the bulk of its income in the form of an annual appropriation from Congress, and the Department of Education oversees the University's appropriation for the Federal government.\"\n\n【7】 # Athletics\nGallaudet is a member of NCAA Division III and the Capital Athletic Conference. The Bison compete in baseball, basketball, cross country running, football, indoor and outdoor track and field, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, volleyball, and wrestling. Their colors are buff and blue.\n\n【8】 ## Football\nThe football huddle originated at Gallaudet when the team noticed that their opponents were trying to see and read their signs in order to try and guess their plays.\nAfter an undefeated season in 2005, which was achieved after 122 years, head coach Ed Hottle began his campaign to return to the NCAA ranks. With support from the Gallaudet administration, the Bison played their last season of club football in 2006 and will play a full NCAA slate of eight games in 2007.\n\n【9】 ## Volleyball\nIn 2006, the Gallaudet women's volleyball team ended their season 30-10 after a history-making run to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA Division III tournament. Tamijo Foronda, a senior outside hitter, was named to the AVCA All-American Team.\n\n【10】 # Research\nThe Gallaudet Research Institute (GRI) is internationally recognized for its leadership in deafness-related research.

Potential stressors include:\n⦁ ⦁ maternal separation ⦁ ⦁\nunresponsive and/or inconsistent care ⦁ ⦁ an overwhelming sensory environment  Toxic stress can result in epigenetic modification in which changes occur in DNA transcription affecting the development of major organs, especially the heart, brain, and kidneys, with lifelong health consequences.  Providing appropriate care for the newborn during periods of acute withdrawal should focus on mitigating the effects of toxic stress. This involves providing effective social emotional buffering by adhering to age appropriate, trauma-informed care principles. Social buffering confers protective effects against toxic stress. 15 Quality of parenting where the parent actively engages and responds to the needs of the newborn can have a profound positive influence on the effectiveness of social buffering during stressful situations. 18 Examples of trauma informed age appropriate care include:\n\n【7】 # Modified gene expression can influence the development of major organs\n\n【8】 # How Early Experiences Alters Gene Expression and Shape Development\nNewborn Responsive and Family-Centered Care Newborn responsive and family-centered care  focus on the newborn and family and: ⦁ ⦁ is optimal, evidence-based, and applies to all care environments; ⦁ ⦁ enhances bonding and attachment and promotes healthy physical and emotional development of the newborn; ⦁ ⦁ requires collaboration between healthcare providers and the mother, recognizing that the mother plays an integral role in the care of her newborn; ⦁ ⦁ needs to be holistic, culturally appropriate, and delivered as close to home as possible; ⦁ ⦁ systems of care must be prioritized to meet the needs of the newborn and the family. Honest consistent communication, and support, will empower the mother to build care capacity that will ensure ongoing competent care; ⦁ ⦁ promotes mother and baby togetherness, skin-to-skin care, breastfeeding (unless contraindicated), and maternal emotional support to manage the stress related to the symptoms of substance withdrawal in her newborn; ⦁ ⦁ promotes an appropriate care environment for the newborn exposed to substances that will allow for the control of light and noise as tolerated; ⦁ ⦁ is sleep protective. The newborn exposed to substances should not be awakened unnecessarily for assessments and/or procedures;\n⦁ ⦁ decreases length of hospital stay; ⦁ ⦁ is neuroprotective; ⦁ ⦁\nallows for better allocation of resources.\n\n【9】 # CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME Pathophysiology\nWhile the pathophysiology of NAS is unclear, exposure and abrupt discontinuation of substances during pregnancy alters neurotransmitter activity in the brain of the newborn.\nWithdrawal symptoms may present similar to drug toxicity syndrome (effect of too much of the substance). However, symptoms of drug toxicity decrease as the drug is eliminated where symptoms of withdrawal increase due to interruption of the drug supply. Prenatal exposure to substances such as cocaine and SSRIs can result in symptoms of withdrawal, drug toxicity, or a combination of both.  Antenatal exposure to habit forming substances Substances with molecular weight < 600da, that is lipid solubilize, non-ionized and not bound to protein, readily crosses the placenta by passive diffusion\n\n【10】 # In the fetus drug molecules attach to biochemical receptors in the CNS, blocking the action of neurotransmitters\nAs gestation increases more substances will cross the placental barrier due to a larger surface area, decreased diffusion distance, and increased placental blood flow\n\n【11】 # Cord clamping at birth interrupts drug supply\nNewborn continues to metabolize and excrete remaining metabolites of substances until depleted / excreted Absence of substance(s) at chronically stimulated receptors Altered neurotransmitter release (too much or too little) at the synapses\n\n【12】 # Onset of withdrawal symptoms\nSubstance Effects on Neurotransmitters  Cord clamping and cutting at birth interrupts the drug supply. The newborn will continue to metabolize and excrete the remaining metabolites of substances until depleted and once depleted the absence of substances alter neurotransmitter release resulting in signs of substance withdrawal.

Informed consent must be obtained prior to testing. However, tests may still be ordered by the primary care provider in the absence of maternal consent if deemed medically necessary.\n\n【21】 # Issues with diagnostic testing for substance exposure ⦁ ⦁\nPharmacokinetics of drugs through the maternal-placental-fetal unit and in the newborn are not well understood. 48 \nVariation in specimen collection methods, storage, and transport of the specimen to the laboratory can influence test accuracy. 51,52 \nPoor sensitivity and specificity may generate false positive or negative results. 53,54 ⦁ ⦁ Local laboratories may lack the ability to further analyze positive screens required to inform clinical management, or the resources to process them in a timely manner. 55,56 Newborn Drug Testing Information\n\n【22】 # SPECIMEN EASE OF COLLECTION WINDOW OF DETECTION\n\n【23】 # SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICTY\n\n【24】 # ASSESSMENT OF WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS Tools for Assessment\nSeveral neonatal withdrawal assessment tools have been developed over the years. 67 The Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool (FNAST) is the most commonly used tool to assess the severity of withdrawal and inform clinical management.  However, with the increased understanding of neonatal substance withdrawal the usefulness of the FNSAT is being questioned.\nLimitations of the FNSAT:\nModified and unvalidated versions are often used due to its intimidating length and complexity 67,73,74 ⦁ ⦁\nTo minimize subjectivity and maximize inter-rater reliability, extensive and continuous training is required  ⦁ ⦁\nAssessment of some criteria (e.g., Moro reflex) requires the newborn to be disturbed, which may artificially inflate scores\nValidated for use in full term newborns only 72 \nLikely to prompt earlier initiation and greater intensity of pharmacological management 48\n\n【25】 # The Eat, Sleep and Console (ESC) Care Tool\nIn 2008, a quality improvement initiative was launched at Yale New Haven Children's Hospital, Connecticut, USA to improve inpatient outcomes for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome. 78 The objective was to decrease the average length of hospital stay by 50% for newborns exposed to substances in utero. One of the key interventions of the Yale New Haven quality improvement project was the development and implementation of a novel assessment tool; the Eat, Sleep and Console (ESC) Care Tool.  This work was influenced by the innovative work done by Dr Ron Abrahams, Dr Paul Thiessen and Sarah Payne on Fir Square, BC Women's Hospital where mothers and babies were kept together, and functional assessments and weight gain were used to assess withdrawal in the newborn.  The ESC Care Tool, developed in 2017, is a function-based assessment tool that assesses how the newborn eats, sleeps, and consoles.  The ESC Care Tool was adapted by BC with permission from the developers of the original ESC Care Tool and:\nIs best practice evidence-based care. 86 \nAligns with trauma informed, culturally safe care and newborn responsive care\n\n【26】 # Promotes mother and baby togetherness ⦁ ⦁\nPromotes the use of non-pharmacological strategies to support the newborn during the acute phase of substance withdrawal\nAllows for easy adoption and implementation across all care settings in BC.\nIs an objective assessment tool with high inter-rater reliability. 84 \nPromotes standardized documentation and care.\nIs low cost, simple and achievable. 85\n\n【27】 # Principles of the ESC Approach\nAims to support the newborn exposed to substances to achieve developmentally normal eating, sleeping, consoling, and weight gain milestones.\nMother/caregiver is the primary provider of responsive, newborn-centered care and integral to managing NAS.\nEncourage the mother and health care professional to consider reasons other than withdrawal that may affect how the baby is eating, sleeping, consoling, and/or gaining weight.\n\n【28】 # Recommendations\nESC Care Tool is developed to track the newborns ESC behaviours and interventions over a 24-hour period:\nInitiate ESC assessments and non-pharmacological strategies within 4 -6 hours of birth.\nPerform ESC assessment every 2 -4 hours after feeding in collaboration with parent/ caregiver. 84 \nContinue for at minimum of 4 -7 days for the newborn exposed to long-acting opioids such as methadone, and a minimum of 48 hours for shorter acting opioids (e.g., oxycodone, codeine). 84,87,88 ⦁ ⦁\nFor newborns that required pharmacological management, ESC assessments should continue for at least 24 hours after administration of the last dose of morphine. 89,90 ⦁ ⦁\nGestational age at birth and actual postnatal age needs to be considered when assessing ESC behaviours. Some of these behaviours may be normal age appropriate behaviour such as cluster feeding and natural fluctuations in sleep-wake patterns.\nAssessments include all ESC behaviours that occurred since the newborn's last assessment as well as all non-pharmacological care interventions implemented. Incorporate input from all caregivers who interacted with the newborn during this period. Monitor excessive weight loss and slow weight gain due to higher energy requirements, poor feeding, loose stools, and vomiting.\nWeight loss more than 10% requires a full care team huddle regardless of ESC assessment.\n\n【29】 # ESC Assessment Eating\nAssess eating behaviour.\nPoor eating is defined as follows:\n⦁ ⦁ Newborn is unable to coordinate feeding within 10 minutes of showing hunger cues AND/ ⦁ ⦁ Newborn is unable to sustain feeding for age appropriate duration at breast \nNewborn is unable to take in age and weight appropriate volume by alternative feeding method\nIf the newborn is eating well answer NO and move to section that assess sleeping.\nIf the newborn is eating poorly answer YES and answer the next question to determine if poor eating is due to substance withdrawal or not.\nSubstance withdrawal symptoms such as fussiness, tremors, uncoordinated suck, and excessive rooting can affect the newborn's ability to eat and gain weight effectively. If poor eating is due to symptoms of substance withdrawal answer YES.\nIf poor eating is clearly due to reasons other than symptoms of withdrawal such as prematurity, transitional sleepiness, excess mucus in the first 24 hours, and inability to latch due to infant / maternal anatomical factors, answer NO. Implement appropriate management strategies (e.g., NG feeds for preterm infants), optimize nonpharmacological interventions, and monitor closely.\nIf it is unclear whether substance withdrawal symptoms are responsible for poor eating, answer YES and continue to monitor closely as this may be an indication of escalating withdrawal symptoms.\nReview optimal feeding recommendations with the parent/caregiver and continue to optimize nonpharmacological strategies.\nIf the newborn is eating poorly a Parent/caregiver-RN huddle is recommended to review optimal feeding recommendations with parent/caregiver. If eating has not improved on subsequent assessment, despite interventions, a full care team huddle is indicated.\n\n【30】 # Sleeping\nAssess sleeping behaviour.\nIf the newborn sleeps for more than one hour after feeding answer NO and move to the section that assess consoling.\nIf the newborn is unable to sleep for at least one hour after feeding answer YES for poor sleeping and answer the next question to determine if poor sleeping is due to substance withdrawal or not.\nSubstance withdrawal symptoms such as fussiness, restlessness, increased startle, and tremors can affect sleeping behaviour. If the newborn is unable to sleep for at least one hour after feeding due to substance withdrawal symptoms answer YES.\nIf the baby sleep less than 1 hour due to reasons other than substance withdrawal such as physiologic cluster feeding in first few days of life, interruptions in sleep due to external noise and ambient light, and interruption of sleep due to clinical care answer NO.\nIf it is unclear whether substance withdrawal symptoms are responsible for poor sleeping or not answer YES and continue to monitor.\nA Parent/caregiver-RN huddle is recommended to review nonpharmacological strategies to promote sleeping. If, on subsequent assessment, baby is still sleeping less than one hour after feeding due to symptoms of withdrawal, despite interventions, a full care team huddle is indicated.\n\n【31】 # Console\nAssess consoling behaviour.\nIf the newborn consoles easily within 10 minutes and remains consoled for longer than 10 minutes answer NO to indicated that the newborn does not experience any difficulty in consoling and move to the section that assess parental/caregiver presence.\nIf the newborn is unable to console within 10 minutes or remain consoled for longer than 10 minutes answer YES for difficulty in consoling and answer the next question to determine if difficulty in consoling is due to substance withdrawal or not.\nAltered neurotransmitter release due to substance withdrawal increase agitation and difficulty in consoling. If the newborn is unable to console easily within 10 minutes and remains consoled for longer than 10 minutes due to substance withdrawal symptoms answer YES.\nAnswer NO if the newborn's inconsolability is clearly due to other factors such as caregiver non-responsiveness to infant hunger cues.\nIf it is unclear whether substance withdrawal symptoms are responsible for inconsolability or not answer YES and continue to monitor.\nIf newborn has difficulty in consoling regardless of reason a Parent/caregiver-RN Huddle is recommended to review appropriate care interventions and Consoling Support Interventions.\nMonitor the newborn closely and continue to optimize non-pharmacological strategies. If newborn is still unable to console at subsequent assessment, despite effective implementation of all levels of consoling support, a full care team huddle is indicated.\nDocument consoling support needed using the numerical codes 1, 2 or 3:\n- Newborn is able to self-console 2. Newborn can console (and stay consoled) with caregiver support within 10 min 3. Newborn is unable to console with caregiver support within, or cannot stay consoled for 10 minutes Please note the numbers are NOT intended as a \"score\" but to indicate an escalation of withdrawal symptoms and identify a need for increased intervention.\n\n【32】 # Parent/Caregiver Section\nParent/Caregiver Presence and Involvement in Care of the Newborn ⦁ ⦁ Document the time, since last assessment, that the parent/s, or another caregiver, spent with the infant.\nCaregiver can be a parent, other family member, designated visitor, cuddler, or healthcare worker that can deliver responsive care in a timely manner.\nDocument the caregiver who provided the most care.\nNumbers above are NOT intended as a \"score\" but used for ease of documentation and to identify parental/caregiver involvement in the care of the baby. A Parent/caregiver-RN huddle is recommended if parent/caregiver is not spending enough time at the bedside, and/or not delivering newborn care in a responsive and timely manner. During the huddle the parent/ bedside RN will review options to assist the parent/caregiver to provide responsive and timely care.\n\n【33】 # Plan of Care\nParent/Caregiver and Bedside RN huddle\nParent/caregiver and Bedside RN should meet if infant receives a YES for any ESC item, to determine if non-pharmacological care interventions can be optimized further.\nDuring the huddle, the parent/caregiver and RN review and discuss how to optimize non-pharmacological care interventions to improve feeding, sleeping and consoling behaviour.\n\n【34】 # Full Care Team Huddle\nBedside meeting of entire team (parents/caregiver, bedside RN, nurse leadership if applicable, and provider) is indicated if the newborn:\nHas more than 10% weight loss\nContinued YES for any ESC items despite optimal non-pharmacological care\nIs unable to console despite effective implementation of all levels of consoling support\nHas any other significant concerns\nThe full care team will:\nReview non-pharmacological strategies and parental presence\nIf non-pharmacological care interventions are maximized to the fullest and the newborn continues to have poor eating, sleeping, or consoling behaviour (or other significant concerns are present) and symptoms are felt to be due to substance withdrawal, pharmacological management may be indicated.\n\n【35】 # Continue to follow the infant closely, optimizing all non-pharmacological interventions regardless of management decision\n\n【36】 # Non-Pharmacological Care Interventions\nThe ESC Care Tool promotes the use of non-pharmacological strategies to support the newborn during the acute phase of substance withdrawal. Use this section to indicate the use of these strategies using the following codes:\n\n【37】 # NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT\nWithdrawal from substances after birth results in physiological and physical dysregulation. This may impact sensory stimulation integration, state regulation, motor and tone control, and the autonomic nervous system. 91 The objective of non-pharmacological care interventions are to provide the infant with an environment that supports their ability to self-regulate. Although these strategies are commonly used to comfort and support infants, high quality research to determine their effectiveness is lacking. Despite the current shortcomings in research methodology, data suggests that non-pharmacological interventions may decrease the severity of withdrawal, the need for medical intervention, and duration of hospitalization. 34,92\n\n【38】 # Sensory Stimulation Integration\nThe following strategies may be helpful to support the infant and prevent sensory overload during the active period of withdrawal: approach the bedside using a gentle voice prior to touching the infant 96 ⦁ ⦁ slow, gentle handling 91,96 ⦁ ⦁ hold infant closely when transferring infant from one space to another to prevent startling 91 ⦁ ⦁ swaddling contains and prevents erratic movements and startling 91,95 ⦁ ⦁ tactile stimulation should be gentle and firm; avoid stroking 80 ⦁ ⦁ apply gentle pressure over the infant's head or body 91,94 ⦁ ⦁ bringing arms/hands midline and positioning infants in a fetal position 91,96,97\n\n【39】 # Swaddling\nIn the newborn exposed to substances swaddling has been shown to:\nreduce crying, startles, and physiological stress 98,99 ⦁ ⦁ improve sleep, motor organization and self-regulation 98,99\n\n【40】 # Safety\n\n【41】 # State Regulation\nSleep-wake regulation is an indication of how effectively the infant can regulate his/her internal processes and the influence of external stimulations. Full-term infants will transition between quiet sleep, active sleep, drowsy, quiet awake, and crying.\nThe infant exposed to substances may:\n\n【42】 # Skin-to-Skin\nEncourage skin-to-skin contact as much as possible to help calm the baby, promote neurobehavioural organization, bonding and attachment, and increase breastmilk supply (if breastfeeding). Skin-to-skin care is associated with improved sleep patterns, 102 a reduction in excessive crying and motor agitation associated with NAS, and a decreased need for pharmacological management. 103 Parent/caregiver should sit in a comfortable chair and be fully awake and focused on the infant.\nDistractions such as cell phones should be avoided. Infant should be naked except for diaper and placed directly on mother's/parent/caregiver's chest with a blanket placed over both for warmth.\nA wrap can also be used to secure infant.\n\n【43】 # Ensure infant's:\nhead is turned to one side\nhead is in the sniffing position and neck straight to maintain airway\n⦁ ⦁ face is visible ⦁ ⦁\nnose and mouth are not covered by the blanket or wrap\nlegs are flexed and is lying chest to chest with mother/parent\n\n【44】 # Vertical Rocking\nVertical rocking has been shown to decrease neurological hyperactivity and promote selfregulation. 191,104,105 The Hold 106 \n\n【45】 Infant can be swaddled. If not, fold infant's arms snugly across his/her chest.\nPick up infant and hold in a vertical, flexed position.\nGently but securely hold infant's bottom with the dominant hand.\nMaintain airway by supporting infant's chin with the other hand.\nBring infant's head a bit forward to position infant at a 45-degree angle, as it will be easier to control the infant.\nSlowly and rhythmically rock infant up and down.\n\n【46】 # Rhythmic movement using swings, chairs or beds ⦁ ⦁\nSwings or vibrating bouncy seats can also be used to provide rhythmical rocking.\nAdhere to manufacturer's safety recommendations and site-specific protocols when using. 107\n\n【47】 # Motor and Tone Control\nThe newborn exposed to substances may display: dysmature pattern of swallow-breath interaction 111 These feeding difficulties and the hypermetabolic state due to withdrawal may result in difficulties with weight gain.\n\n【48】 # Feeding\nMothers are encouraged to breastfeed unless there is concern related to continued substance use or other medical contraindication is present such as HIV.\nDespite the documented benefits of human milk, breastfeeding rates are low in women with substance use disorder.  ⦁ ⦁\nThe risk-benefits of breastfeeding should be carefully considered, and attempts should be made to minimize barriers and promote breastfeeding.\nIn the infant exposed to substances, breastfeeding is associated with:\n⦁ ⦁ delayed onset of withdrawal symptoms 96,115 ⦁ ⦁ decreased severity of withdrawal symptoms 82,112,115,116 ⦁ ⦁ decreased need for pharmacological management 115,11,12 ⦁ ⦁ decreased length of pharmacological management 96,112 ⦁ ⦁ shorter length of hospital stay 7,13,14 The Following General Strategies May Be Helpful to Support Optimal Feeding ⦁ ⦁ optimal feeding at early hunger cues without any limits placed in duration or volume of feeding If newborn is breastfeeding, ensure the newborn is latching deeply, with a comfortable latch for mother, and with sustained active suckling with only brief pauses noted. If necessary, assist the mother to achieve more optimal latch/position. To organize suck prior to latching, use expressed breastmilk and have the infant suck on an adult finger. Withhold pacifier use if possible.\nTo organize suck prior to latching, use expressed breastmilk and have the infant suck on an adult finger. Withhold pacifier use if possible.\nConsider fortifying breastmilk or supplementation with a high-calorie breast milk substitute for poor weight gain. 15,16,17 Bottle Feeding\nIf newborn is bottle feeding:\nReduce GI discomfort by using mother's expressed breast milk, donor breast milk or breastmilk substitute with a low osmolality. 117 \nMimic breastfeeding by letting baby pause and rest periodically.\n\n【49】 # Skin Care\nNewborns are at risk for skin injuries as adaptation to the extrauterine environment is still ongoing. The functionally immature epidermal barrier and acid-mantle increases the risk of chemical, microbial, or friction skin injuries. 119,120 Due to irritability, uncontrolled movements, and diarrhea related to withdrawal, the newborn exposed to substances is at risk for excoriations and diaper dermatitis. 121\n\n【50】 # Types of skin injuries Excoriation/abrasions\nRedness of the skin or broken/bleeding skin often found on chin, ankles and face.\nCause: Rubbing of an extremity or face on a linen covered surface/blankets due to excessive and uncontrolled movements of the extremities and/or head.\n\n【51】 # PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT Current Status\nThe current evidence as to when to initiate medication, treatment regimens, dosing, weaning protocols and use of adjunctive management is limited. 124,125,126 Evidence does show that a standardized pharmacological management protocol with clear weaning guidelines decreases the length of pharmacological intervention and hospital stay. 116,124,127,128 While suboxone and methadone can be used to manage substance withdrawal symptoms in the newborn, morphine is the most commonly used drug to manage newborn opioid withdrawal. 10,23,129 Morphine is a full mu-opioid receptor agonist with well-established pharmacokinetic features and a short half-life.\n\n【52】 # General Principles ⦁ ⦁\nRooming-in and implementing non-pharmacological is paramount. Pharmacological intervention should be employed as an adjunct.\nUse ESC Care Tool to guide management.\nMinimize opiate replacement exposure in the newborn.\nThe need for pharmacological management alone is not an indication for admission to the NICU. Transfer to the NICU only if there is a medical indication.\nTreatment Algorithm for the Newborn Exposed to Substance(s) in Pregnancy\n\n【53】 # APPENDIX: CONSOLING SUPPORT INTERVENTIONS CONSOLING SUPPORT INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN BE USED WHEN BABY IS DIFFICULT TO CONSOLE", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The amphipathic detergent-like properties of apolipoproteins solubilize the hydrophobic lipid constituents of lipoproteins.  In addition, apolipoproteins also serve as enzyme co-factors, receptor ligands, and lipid transfer carriers that regulate the intravascular metabolism of lipoproteins and their ultimate tissue uptake.\n\n【2】 # Structure\n\n【3】 # Classification\n\n【4】 #\n- ApoB-48 is exclusively found in chylomicrons.

Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.\n- The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients.\n- No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n- It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.\n- All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.\n- The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.\n- Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.\n- Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for nefazodone hydrochloride tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.\n\n【17】 ### Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder\n- A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that nefazodone hydrochloride tablets is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.\n\n【18】 ### Hepatotoxicity\n\n【19】 - Cases of life-threatening hepatic failure have been reported in patients treated with nefazodone.\n- The reported rate in the United States is about 1 case of liver failure resulting in death or transplant per 250,000 to 300,000 patient-years of nefazodone treatment. This represents a rate of about 3 to 4 times the estimated background rate of liver failure. This rate is an underestimate because of under reporting, and the true risk could be considerably greater than this. A large cohort study of antidepressant users found no cases of liver failure leading to death or transplant among nefazodone users in about 30,000 patient-years of exposure. The spontaneous report data and the cohort study results provide estimates of the upper and lower limits of the risk of liver failure in nefazodone-treated patients, but are not capable of providing a precise risk estimate.\n- The time to liver injury for the reported liver failure cases resulting in death or transplant generally ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months on nefazodone therapy. Although some reports described dark urine and nonspecific prodromal symptoms (e.g., anorexia, malaise, and gastrointestinal symptoms), other reports did not describe the onset of clear prodromal symptoms prior to the onset of jaundice.\n- The physician may consider the value of liver function testing. Periodic serum transaminase testing has not been proven to prevent serious injury but it is generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood for recovery.\n- Patients should be advised to be alert for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction (jaundice, anorexia, gastrointestinal complaints, malaise, etc.) and to report them to their doctor immediately if they occur. Ongoing clinical assessment of patients should govern physician interventions, including diagnostic evaluations and treatment.\n- Nefazodone should be discontinued if clinical signs or symptoms suggest liver failure . Patients who develop evidence of hepatocellular injury such as increased serum AST or serum ALT levels ≥ 3 times the upper limit of Normal, while on nefazodone should be withdrawn from the drug. These patients should be presumed to be at increased risk for liver injury if nefazodone is reintroduced. Accordingly, such patients should not be considered for re-treatment.\n\n【20】 # Adverse Reactions\n\n【21】 ## Clinical Trials Experience\n- Associated With Discontinuation of Treatment\n- Approximately 16% of the 3496 patients who received nefazodone in worldwide premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment due to an adverse experience. The more common (≥ 1%) events in clinical trials associated with discontinuation and considered to be drug related (i.e., those events associated with dropout at a rate approximately twice or greater for nefazodone compared to placebo) included: nausea (3.5%), dizziness (1.9%), insomnia (1.5%), asthenia (1.3%), and agitation (1.2%).\n\n【22】 ### Incidence in Controlled Trials\n- Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Controlled Clinical Trials\n- The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of nefazodone (incidence of 5% or greater) and not seen at an equivalent incidence among placebo-treated patient.i.\n- Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among Nefazodone-Treated Patients\n- The table that follows enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or more, and were more frequent than in the placebo group, among nefazodone-treated patients who participated in short-term (6 to 8 week) placebo-controlled trials in which patients were dosed with nefazodone to ranges of 300 to 600 mg/day. Reported adverse events were classified using standard Costart-based Dictionary terminology.\n- The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side-effect incidence rate in the population studied.\n- Events reported by at least 1% of patients treated with nefazodone and more frequent than the placebo group are included; incidence is rounded to the nearest 1.< 1% indicates an incidence less than 0.\n- Vasodilatation – flushing, feeling warm.\n- Abnormal vision – scotoma, visual trails.# Incidence adjusted for gender.\n- Dose Dependency of Adverse Events\n- The table that follows enumerates adverse events that were more frequent in the nefazodone dose range of 300 to 600 mg/day than in the nefazodone dose range of up to 300 mg/day.05 in incidence between the nefazodone dose ranges as well as a difference between the high dose range and placebo.\n- Visual Disturbances\n- In controlled clinical trials, blurred vision occurred in 9% of nefazodone-treated patients compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients. In these same trials abnormal vision, including scotomata and visual trails, occurred in 7% of nefazodone-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated . Dose-dependency was observed for these events in these trials, with none of the scotomata and visual trails at doses below 300 mg/day. However, scotomata and visual trails observed at doses below 300 mg/day have been reported in postmarketing experience with nefazodone .\n- Vital Sign Changes\n- \n- Weight Changes\n- In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled premarketing studies, there were no differences between nefazodone and placebo groups in the proportions of patients meeting criteria for potentially important increases or decreases in body weight (a change of ≥ 7%).\n- Laboratory Changes\n- Of the serum chemistry, serum hematology, and urinalysis parameters monitored during placebo-controlled premarketing studies with nefazodone, a pooled analysis revealed a statistical trend between nefazodone and placebo for hematocrit, i.e., 2.8% of nefazodone patients met criteria for a potentially important decrease in hematocrit (≤ 37% male or ≤ 32% female) compared to 1.5% of placebo patients (0.05 < p ≤ 0.10). Decreases in hematocrit, presumably dilutional, have been reported with many other drugs that block alpha1-adrenergic receptors. There was no apparent clinical significance of the observed changes in the few patients meeting these criteria.\n- ECG Changes\n- Of the ECG parameters monitored during placebo-controlled premarketing studies with nefazodone, a pooled analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between nefazodone and placebo for sinus bradycardia, i.e., 1.5% of nefazodone patients met criteria for a potentially important decrease in heart rate (≤ 50 bpm and a decrease of ≥ 15 bpm) compared to 0.4% of placebo patients (p < 0.05). There was no obvious clinical significance of the observed changes in the few patients meeting these criteria.\n- Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Nefazodone\n- During its premarketing assessment, multiple doses of nefazodone were administered to 3496 patients in clinical studies, including more than 250 patients treated for at least one year. The conditions and duration of exposure to nefazodone varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories.\n- In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using standard Costart-based Dictionary terminology.\n- It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with nefazodone, they were not necessarily caused by it.\n- Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled trials appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.\n- Body as a whole – Infrequent: allergic reaction, malaise, photosensitivity reaction, face edema, hangover effect, abdomen enlarged, hernia, pelvic pain, and halitosis. Rare: cellulitis.\n- Cardiovascular system – Infrequent: tachycardia, hypertension, syncope, ventricular extrasystoles, and angina pectoris. Rare: AV block, congestive heart failure, hemorrhage, pallor, and varicose vein.\n- Dermatological system – Infrequent: dry skin, acne, alopecia, urticaria, maculopapular rash,vesiculobullous rash, and eczema.\n- Gastrointestinal system – Frequent: gastroenteritis. Infrequent: eructation, periodontal abscess, abnormal liver function tests, gingivitis, colitis, gastritis, mouth ulceration, stomatitis, esophagitis, peptic ulcer, and rectal hemorrhage. Rare: glossitis, hepatitis, dysphagia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, oral moniliasis, and ulcerative colitis.\n- Hemic and lymphatic system – Infrequent: ecchymosis, anemia, leukopenia, and lymphadenopathy .\n- Metabolic and nutritional system – Infrequent: weight loss, gout, dehydration, lactic dehydrogenase increased, SGOT increased, and SGPT increased. Rare: hypercholesteremia and hypoglycemia.\n- Musculoskeletal system – Infrequent: arthritis, tenosynovitis, muscle stiffness, and bursitis. Rare: tendinous contracture.\n- Nervous system – Infrequent: vertigo, twitching, depersonalization, hallucinations, suicide attempt, apathy, euphoria, hostility, suicidal thoughts, abnormal gait, thinking abnormal, attention decreased, derealization, neuralgia, paranoid reaction, dysarthria, increased libido, suicide, and myoclonus. Rare: hyperkinesia, increased salivation, cerebrovascular accident, hyperesthesia, hypotonia, ptosis, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\n- Respiratory system – Frequent: dyspnea and bronchitis. Infrequent:asthma, pneumonia, laryngitis, voice alteration, epistaxis, hiccup. Rare: hyperventilation and yawn.\n- Special senses – Frequent: eye pain. Infrequent: dry eye, ear pain, abnormality of accommodation, diplopia, conjunctivitis, mydriasis, keratoconjunctivitis, hyperacusis, and photophobia. Rare: deafness, glaucoma, night blindness, and taste loss.\n- Urogenital system – Frequent: impotence. Infrequent: cystitis, urinary urgency, metrorrhagiaa, amenorrheaa, polyuria, vaginal hemorrhagea, breast enlargementa, menorrhagiaa, urinary incontinence, abnormal ejaculationa, hematuria, nocturia, and kidney calculus. Rare: uterine fibroids enlarged, uterine hemorrhagea, anorgasmia, and oliguria.\n- Adjusted for gender.\n- Postmarketing experience with nefazodone has shown an adverse experience profile similar to that seen during the premarketing evaluation of nefazodone. Voluntary reports of adverse events temporally associated with nefazodone have been received since market introduction that are not listed above and for which a causal relationship has not been established. These include:\n- Anaphylactic reactions; angioedema; convulsions (including grand mal seizures); galactorrhea; gynecomastia (male); hyponatremia; liver necrosis and liver failure, in some cases leading to liver transplantation and/or death ; priapism ; prolactin increased; rhabdomyolysis involving patients receiving the combination of nefazodone and lovastatin or simvastatin ; serotonin syndrome; and Stevens-Johnson syndrome; and thrombocytopenia.\n\n【23】 ## Postmarketing Experience\n- Postmarketing experience with nefazodone has shown an adverse experience profile similar to that seen during the premarketing evaluation of nefazodone. Voluntary reports of adverse events temporally associated with nefazodone have been received since market introduction that are not listed above and for which a causal relationship has not been established. These include: Anaphylactic reactions; angioedema; convulsions (including grand mal seizures); galactorrhea; gynecomastia (male); hyponatremia; liver necrosis and liver failure, in some cases leading to liver transplantation and/or death ; priapism ; prolactin increased; rhabdomyolysis involving patients receiving the combination of nefazodone and lovastatin or simvastatin ; serotonin syndrome; and Stevens-Johnson syndrome; and thrombocytopenia.\n\n【24】 # Drug Interactions\n- Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein\n- Because nefazodone is highly bound to plasma protei. administration of nefazodone to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound may cause increased free concentrations of the other drug, potentially resulting in adverse events. Conversely, adverse effects could result from displacement of nefazodone by other highly bound drugs.\n- Warfarin – There were no effects on the prothrombin or bleeding times or upon the pharmacokinetics of R-warfarin when nefazodone (200 mg BID) was administered for 1 week to subjects who had been pretreated for 2 weeks with warfarin. Although the coadministration of nefazodone did decrease the subjects’ exposure to S-warfarin by 12%, the lack of effects on the prothrombin and bleeding times indicates this modest change is not clinically significant. Although these results suggest no adjustments in warfarin dosage are required when nefazodone is administered to patients stabilized on warfarin, such patients should be monitored as required by standard medical practices.\n- CNS-Active Drugs\n\n【25】 - Haloperidol – When a single oral 5 mg dose of haloperidol was coadministered with nefazodone (200 mg BID) at steady state, haloperidol apparent clearance decreased by 35% with no significant increase in peak haloperidol plasma concentrations or time of peak. This change is of unknown clinical significance. Pharmacodynamic effects of haloperidol were generally not altered significantly. There were no changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters for nefazodone. Dosage adjustment of haloperidol may be necessary when coadministered with nefazodone.\n- Lorazepam – When lorazepam (2 mg BID) and nefazodone (200 mg BID) were coadministered to steady state, there was no change in any pharmacokinetic parameter for either drug compared to each drug administered alone. Therefore, dosage adjustment is not necessary for either drug when coadministered.\n\n【26】 - Alcohol – Although nefazodone did not potentiate the cognitive and psychomotor effects of alcohol in experiments with normal subjects, the concomitant use of nefazodone and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised.\n- Buspirone – In a study of steady-state pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers, coadministration of buspirone (2.5 or 5 mg BID) with nefazodone (250 mg BID) resulted in marked increases in plasma buspirone concentrations (increases up to 20 fold in Cmax and up to 50 fold in AUC) and statistically significant decreases (about 50%) in plasma concentrations of the buspirone metabolite 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine. With 5 mg BID doses of buspirone, slight increases in AUC were observed for nefazodone (23%) and its metabolites hydroxynefazodone (17%) and mCPP (9%). Subjects receiving nefazodone 250 mg BID and buspirone 5 mg BID experienced lightheadedness, asthenia, dizziness, and somnolence, adverse events also observed with either drug alone. If the two drugs are to be used in combination, a low dose of buspirone (e.g., 2.5 mg QD) is recommended. Subsequent dose adjustment of either drug should be based on clinical assessment.\n\n【27】 - Fluoxetine – When fluoxetine (20 mg QD) and nefazodone (200 mg BID) were administered at steady state there were no changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters for fluoxetine or its metabolite, norfluoxetine. Similarly, there were no changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of nefazodone or HO-NEF; however, the mean AUC levels of the nefazodone metabolites mCPP and triazole-dione increased by 3 to 6 fold and 1.3 fold, respectively. When a 200 mg dose of nefazodone was administered to subjects who had been receiving fluoxetine for 1 week, there was an increased incidence of transient adverse events such as headache, lightheadedness, nausea, or paresthesia, possibly due to the elevated mCPP levels. Patients who are switched from fluoxetine to nefazodone without an adequate washout period may experience similar transient adverse events. The possibility of this happening can be minimized by allowing a washout period before initiating nefazodone therapy and by reducing the initial dose of nefazodone. Because of the long half-life of fluoxetine and its metabolites, this washout period may range from one to several weeks depending on the dose of fluoxetine and other individual patient variables.\n- Phenytoin – Pretreatment for 7 days with 200 mg BID of nefazodone had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 300 mg oral dose of phenytoin. However, due to the nonlinear pharmacokinetics ofphenytoin, the failure to observe a significant effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of phenytoin does not preclude the possibility of a clinically significant interaction with nefazodone when phenytoin is dosed chronically. However, no change in the initial dosage of phenytoin is considered necessary and any subsequent adjustment of phenytoin dosage should be guided by usual clinical practices.\n- Desipramine – When nefazodone (150 mg BID) and desipramine (75 mg QD) were administered together there were no changes in the pharmacokinetics of desipramine or its metabolite, 2-hydroxy desipramine. There were also no changes in the pharmacokinetics of nefazodone or its triazole-dione metabolite, but the AUC and Cmax of mCPP increased by 44% and 48%, respectively, while the AUC of HO-NEF decreased by 19%. No changes in doses of either nefazodone or desipramine are necessary when the two drugs are given concomitantly. Subsequent dose adjustments should be made on the basis of clinical response.\n- Lithium – In 13 healthy subjects the coadministration of nefazodone (200 mg BID) with lithium (500 mg BID) for 5 days (steady-state conditions) was found to be well tolerated. When the two drugs were coadministered, there were no changes in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either lithium, nefazodone, or its metabolite HO-NEF; however, there were small decreases in the steady-state plasma concentrations of two nefazodone metabolites, mCPP and triazole-dione, which are considered not to be of clinical significance. Therefore, no dosage adjustment of either lithium or nefazodone is required when they are coadministered.\n- Carbamazepine – The coadministration of nefazodone (200 mg BID) for 5 days to 12 healthy subjects on carbamazepine who had achieved steady state (200 mg BID) was found to be well tolerated. Steady-state conditions for carbamazepine, nefazodone, and several of their metabolites were achieved by day 5 of coadministration. With coadministration of the two drugs there were significant increases in the steady-state Cmax and AUC of carbamazepine (23% and 23%, respectively), while the steady-state Cmax and the AUC of the carbamazepine metabolite, 10,11 epoxycarbamazepine, decreased by 21% and 20%, respectively. The coadministration of the two drugs significantly reduced the steady-state Cmax and AUC of nefazodone by 86% and 93%, respectively. Similar reductions in the Cmax and AUC of HO-NEF were also observed (85% and 94%), while the reductions in Cmax and AUC of mCPP and triazole-dione were more modest (13% and 44% for the former and 28% and 57% for the latter). Due to the potential for coadministration of carbamazepine to result in insufficient plasma nefazodone and hydroxynefazodone concentrations for achieving an antidepressant effect for nefazodone, it is recommended that nefazodone not be used in combination with carbamazepine .\n- General Anesthetics – Little is known about the potential for interaction between nefazodone and general anesthetics; therefore, prior to elective surgery, nefazodone hydrochloride should be discontinued for as long as clinically feasible.\n- Other CNS-Active Drugs – The use of nefazodone in combination with other CNS-active drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised if concomitant administration of nefazodone and such drugs is required.\n- Cimetidine\n- When nefazodone (200 mg BID) and cimetidine (300 mg QID) were coadministered for one week, no change in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either nefazodone or cimetidine was observed compared to each dosed alone. Therefore, dosage adjustment is not necessary for either drug when coadministered.\n- Theophylline\n- When nefazodone (200 mg BID) was given to patients being treated with theophylline (600 to 1200 mg/day) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, there was no change in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either nefazodone or theophylline. FEV1 measurements taken when theophylline and nefazodone were coadministered did not differ from baseline dosage (i.e., when theophylline was administered alone). Therefore, dosage adjustment is not necessary for either drug when coadministered.\n- Cardiovascular-Active Drugs\n- Digoxin – When nefazodone (200 mg BID) and digoxin (0.2 mg QD) were coadministered for 9 days to healthy male volunteers (n = 18) who were phenotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, Cmax, Cmin, and AUC of digoxin were increased by 29%, 27%, and 15%, respectively. Digoxin had no effects on the pharmacokinetics of nefazodone and its active metabolites. Because of the narrow therapeutic index of digoxin, caution should be exercised when nefazodone and digoxin are coadministered; plasma level monitoring for digoxin is recommended.\n- Propranolol – The coadministration of nefazodone (200 mg BID) and propranolol (40 mg BID) for 5.5 days to healthy male volunteers (n = 18), including 3 poor and 15 extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers, resulted in 30% and 14% reductions in Cmax and AUC of propranolol, respectively, and a 14% reduction in Cmax for the metabolite, 4-hydroxypropranolol. The kinetics of nefazodone, hydroxynefazodone, and triazole-dione were not affected by coadministration of propranolol. However, Cmax, Cmin, and AUC of m-chlorophenylpiperazine were increased by 23%, 54%, and 28%, respectively. No change in initial dose of either drug is necessary and dose adjustments should be made on the basis of clinical response.\n- HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors – When single 40 mg doses of simvastatin or atorvastatin, both substrates of CYP3A4, were given to healthy adult volunteers who had received nefazodone hydrochloride, 200 mg BID for 6 days, approximately 20 fold increases in plasma concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid and 3 to 4 fold increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and atorvastatin lactone were seen. These effects appear to be due to the inhibition of CYP3A4 by nefazodone because, in the same study, nefazodone had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of pravastatin, which is not metabolized by CYP3A4 to a clinically significant extent.\n- There have been rare reports of rhabdomyolysis involving patients receiving the combination of nefazodone and either simvastatin or lovastatin, also a substrate of CYP3A4 . Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients receiving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors administered alone (at recommended dosages) and in particular, for certain drugs in this class, when given in combination with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 isozyme.\n- Caution should be used if nefazodone is administered in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin, and dosage adjustments of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are recommended. Since metabolic interactions are unlikely between nefazodone and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that undergo little or no metabolism by the CYP3A4 isozyme, such as pravastatin or fluvastatin, dosage adjustments should not be necessary.\n\n【28】 ### Immunosuppressive Agents\n- There have been reports of increased blood concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus into toxic ranges when patients received these drugs concomitantly with nefazodone. Both cyclosporine and tacrolimus are substrates of CYP3A4, and nefazodone is known to inhibit this enzyme. If either cyclosporine or tacrolimus is administered with nefazodone, blood concentrations of the immunosuppressive agent should be monitored and dosage adjusted accordingly.\n- Pharmacokinetics of Nefazodone in ‘Poor Metabolizers’ and Potential Interaction With Drugs That Inhibit and/or Are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isozymes\n- CYP3A4 Isozyme – Nefazodone has been shown in vitro to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4. This is consistent with the interactions observed between nefazodone and triazolam, alprazolam, buspirone, atorvastatin, and simvastatin, drugs metabolized by this isozyme. Consequently, caution is indicated in the combined use of nefazodone with any drugs known to be metabolized by CYP3A4. In particular, the combined use of nefazodone with triazolam should be avoided for most patients, including the elderly. The combined use of nefazodone with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, or pimozide is contraindicated .\n- CYP2D6 Isozyme – A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6. Such individuals are referred to commonly as “poor metabolizers” of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and the tricyclic antidepressants. The pharmacokinetics of nefazodone and its major metabolites are not altered in these “poor metabolizers.” Plasma concentrations of one minor metabolite (mCPP) are increased in this population; the adjustment of nefazodone dosage is not required when administered to “poor metabolizers.” Nefazodone and its metabolites have been shown in vitro to be extremely weak inhibitors of CYP2D6. Thus, it is not likely that nefazodone will decrease the metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by this isozyme.\n- CYP1A2 Isozyme – Nefazodone and its metabolites have been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP1A2. Thus, metabolic interactions between nefazodone and drugs metabolized by this isozyme are unlikely.\n.Electroconvulsive therapy\n\n【29】 # Use in Specific Populations\n\n【30】 ### Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category (FDA): C\n- Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rabbits and rats at daily doses up to 200 and 300 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 6 and 5 times, respectively, the maximum human daily dose on a mg/m2 basis). No malformations were observed in the offspring as a result of nefazodone treatment. However, increased early pup mortality was seen in rats at a dose approximately five times the maximum human dose, and decreased pup weights were seen at this and lower doses, when dosing began during pregnancy and continued until weaning. The cause of these deaths is not known. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was 1.3 times the human dose on a mg/m2 basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nefazodone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nThere is no Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) guidance on usage of Nefazodone in women who are pregnant.\n\n【31】 ### Labor and Delivery\nThe effect of nefazodone on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.\n\n【32】 ### Nursing Mothers\nIt is not known whether nefazodone or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nefazodone is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n【33】 ### Pediatric Use\n- Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established . Two placebo-controlled trials in 286 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with nefazodone, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of nefazodone hydrochloride tablets in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.\n\n【34】 ### Geriatic Use\n- Of the approximately 7000 patients in clinical studies who received nefazodone for the treatment of depression, 18% were 65 years and older, while 5% were 75 years and older. Based on monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and results of laboratory tests, no overall differences in safety between elderly and younger patients were observed in clinical studies. Efficacy in the elderly has not been demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\nDue to the increased systemic exposure to nefazodone seen in single-dose studies in elderly patient. treatment should be initiated at half the usual dose, but titration upward should take place over the same range as in younger patients . The usual precautions should be observed in elderly patients who have concomitant medical illnesses or who are receiving concomitant drugs.\n\n【35】 ### Gender\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Nefazodone with respect to specific gender populations.\n\n【36】 ### Race\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Nefazodone with respect to specific racial populations.\n\n【37】 ### Renal Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Nefazodone in patients with renal impairment.\n\n【38】 ### Hepatic Impairment\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Nefazodone in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\n【39】 ### Females of Reproductive Potential and Males\nThere is no FDA guidance on the use of Nefazodone in women of reproductive potentials and males.\n\n【40】 ### Immunocompromised Patients\nThere is no FDA guidance one the use of Nefazodone in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n【41】 # Administration and Monitoring\n\n【42】 ### Administration\nThere is limited information regarding Nefazodone Administration in the drug label.\n\n【43】 ### Monitoring\nThere is limited information regarding Nefazodone Monitoring in the drug label.\n\n【44】 # IV Compatibility\nThere is limited information regarding the compatibility of Nefazodone and IV administrations.\n\n【45】 # Overdosage\nHuman Experience\n- In premarketing clinical studies, there were seven reports of nefazodone overdose alone or in combination with other pharmacological agents. The amount of nefazodone ingested ranged from 1000 mg to 11,200 mg. Commonly reported symptoms from overdose of nefazodone included nausea, vomiting, and somnolence. One nonstudy participant took 2000 to 3000 mg of nefazodone with methocarbamol and alcohol; this person reportedly experienced a convulsion (type not documented). None of these patients died.\n- In postmarketing experience, overdose with nefazodone alone and in combination with alcohol and/or other substances has been reported. Commonly reported symptoms were similar to those reported from overdose in premarketing experience. While there have been rare reports of fatalities in patients taking overdoses of nefazodone, predominantly in combination with alcohol and/or other substances, no causal relationship to nefazodone has been established.\n\n【46】 ## Overdosage Management=\n- Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any antidepressant.\n- Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients.\n- Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to the wide distribution of nefazodone in body tissues, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for nefazodone are known.\n\n【47】 # Pharmacology\n\n【48】 ## Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of nefazodone, as with other antidepressants, is unknown.\n\n【49】 ## Structure\nNefazodone hydrochloride tablets USP are an antidepressant for oral administration with a chemical structure unrelated to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics, tetracyclics, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI).\nNefazodone hydrochloride is a synthetically derived phenylpiperazine antidepressant. The chemical name for nefazodone hydrochloride is 2-propyl-5-ethyl-2,4-dihydro-4-(2-phenoxyethyl)-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one monohydrochloride. The structural formula is:\nC25H32CIN5O2HCl M.W. 506.5\nNefazodone hydrochloride is a nonhygroscopic, white crystalline solid. It is freely soluble in chloroform, soluble in propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in polyethylene glycol and water.\nNefazodone hydrochloride tablets USP are supplied as capsule-shaped tablets containing 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, or 250 mg of nefazodone hydrochloride and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate and povidone. Additionally, the 50 mg tablets include ferric oxide red as a colorant, the 150 mg tablets include ferric oxide red and yellow as colorants, and the 200 mg tablets include ferric oxide yellow as a colorant.\n\n【50】 ## Pharmacodynamics\n- Preclinical studies have shown that nefazodone inhibits neuronal uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.\n- Nefazodone occupies central 5-HT2 receptors at nanomolar concentrations, and acts as an antagonist at this receptor. Nefazodone was shown to antagonize alpha1-adrenergic receptors, a property which may be associated with postural hypotension. In vitro binding studies showed that nefazodone had no significant affinity for the following receptors: alpha2 and beta adrenergic, 5-HT1A, cholinergic, dopaminergic, or benzodiazepine.\n\n【51】 ## Pharmacokinetics\nNefazodone is rapidly and completely absorbed but is subject to extensive metabolism, so that its absolute bioavailability is low, about 20%, and variable. Peak plasma concentrations occur at about one hour and the half-life of nefazodone is 2 to 4 hours.\n- Both nefazodone and its pharmacologically similar metabolite, hydroxynefazodone, exhibit nonlinear kinetics for both dose and time, with AUC and Cmax increasing more than proportionally with dose increases and more than expected upon multiple dosing over time, compared to single dosing. For example, in a multiple-dose study involving BID dosing with 50, 100, and 200 mg, the AUC for nefazodone and hydroxynefazodone increased by about 4 fold with an increase in dose from 200 to 400 mg per day; Cmax increased by about 3 fold with the same dose increase. In a multiple-dose study involving BID dosing with 25, 50, 100, and 150 mg, the accumulation ratios for nefazodone and hydroxynefazodone AUC, after 5 days of BID dosing relative to the first dose, ranged from approximately 3 to 4 at the lower doses (50 to 100 mg/day) and from 5 to 7 at the higher doses (200 to 300 mg/day); there were also approximately 2 to 4 fold increases in Cmax after 5 days of BID dosing relative to the first dose, suggesting extensive and greater than predicted accumulation of nefazodone and its hydroxy metabolite with multiple dosing. Steady-state plasma nefazodone and metabolite concentrations are attained within 4 to 5 days of initiation of BID dosing or upon dose increase or decrease.\n- Nefazodone is extensively metabolized after oral administration by n-dealkylation and aliphatic and aromatic hydroxylation, and less than 1% of administered nefazodone is excreted unchanged in urine. Attempts to characterize three metabolites identified in plasma, hydroxynefazodone (HO-NEF), meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), and a triazole-dione metabolite, have been carried out. The AUC (expressed as a multiple of the AUC for nefazodone dosed at 100 mg BID) and elimination half-lives for these three metabolites were as follows:\n- HO-NEF possesses a pharmacological profile qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that of nefazodone. mCPP has some similarities to nefazodone, but also has agonist activity at some serotonergic receptor subtypes. The pharmacological profile of the triazole-dione metabolite has not yet been well characterized. In addition to the above compounds, several other metabolites were present in plasma but have not been tested for pharmacological activity.\n- After oral administration of radiolabeled nefazodone, the mean half-life of total label ranged between 11 and 24 hours. Approximately 55% of the administered radioactivity was detected in urine and about 20 to 30% in feces.\n\n【52】 ### Distribution\n- Nefazodone is widely distributed in body tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). In humans the volume of distribution of nefazodone ranges from 0.22 to 0.87 L/kg.\n- Protein Binding\n- At concentrations of 25 to 2500 ng/mL nefazodone is extensively (> 99%) bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. The administration of 200 mg BID of nefazodone for 1 week did not increase the fraction of unbound warfarin in subjects whose prothrombin times had been prolonged by warfarin therapy to 120 to 150% of the laboratory control . While nefazodone did not alter the in vitro protein binding of chlorpromazine, desipramine, diazepam, diphenylhydantoin, lidocaine, prazosin, propranolol, or verapamil, it is unknown whether displacement of either nefazodone or these drugs occurs in vivo. There was a 5% decrease in the protein binding of haloperidol; this is probably of no clinical significance.\n- Effect of Food\n- Food delays the absorption of nefazodone and decreases the bioavailability of nefazodone by approximately 20%.\n- Renal Disease\n- In studies involving 29 renally impaired patients, renal impairment (creatinine clearances ranging from 7 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) had no effect on steady-state nefazodone plasma concentrations.\n- Liver Disease\n- In a multiple-dose study of patients with liver cirrhosis, the AUC values for nefazodone and HO-NEF at steady state were approximately 25% greater than those observed in normal volunteers.\n- Age/Gender Effects\n- After single doses of 300 mg to younger (18 to 45 years) and older patients (> 65 years), Cmax and AUC for nefazodone and hydroxynefazodone were up to twice as high in the older patients. With multiple doses, however, differences were much smaller, 10 to 20%. A similar result was seen for gender, with a higher Cmax and AUC in women after single doses but no difference after multiple doses.\n- Treatment with nefazodone should be initiated at half the usual dose in elderly patients, especially wome. but the therapeutic dose range is similar in younger and older patients.\n- Clinical Efficacy Trial Results\n- Studies in Outpatients With Depression\n- During its premarketing development, the efficacy of nefazodone was evaluated at doses within the therapeutic range in five well-controlled, short-term (6 to 8 weeks) clinical investigations. These trials enrolled outpatients meeting DSM-III or DSM-IIIR criteria for major depression. Among these trials, two demonstrated the effectiveness of nefazodone, and two provided additional support for that conclusion.\n- One trial was a 6 week dose-titration study comparing nefazodone in two dose ranges (up to 300 mg/day and up to 600 mg/da. on a BID schedule) and placebo. The second trial was an 8 week dose-titration study comparing nefazodone (up to 600 mg/day; mean modal dose was 375 mg/day), imipramine (up to 300 mg/day), and placebo, all on a BID schedule. Both studies demonstrated nefazodone, at doses titrated between 300 mg to 600 mg/day (therapeutic dose range), to be superior to placebo on at least three of the following four measures: 17 Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or HDRS (total score), Hamilton Depressed Mood item, Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Severity score, and CGI Improvement score. Significant differences were also found for certain factors of the HDRS (e.g., anxiety factor, sleep disturbance factor, and retardation factor). In the two supportive studies, nefazodone was titrated up to 500 or 600 mg/day (mean modal doses of 462 mg/day and 363 mg/day). In the fifth study, the differentiation in response rates between nefazodone and placebo was not statistically significant. Three additional trials were conducted using subtherapeutic doses of nefazodone.\n- Overall, approximately two thirds of patients in these trials were women, and an analysis of the effects of gender on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of sex. There were too few elderly patients in these trials to reveal possible age-related differences in response.\n- Since its initial marketing as an antidepressant drug product, additional clinical investigations of nefazodone have been conducted. These studies explored nefazodone’s use under conditions not evaluated fully at the time initial marketing approval was granted.\n- Studies in “Inpatients”\n- Two studies were conducted to evaluate nefazodone’s effectiveness in hospitalized depressed patients. These were 6 week, dose-titration trials comparing nefazodone (up to 600 mg/day) and placebo, on a BID schedule. In one study, nefazodone was superior to placebo. In this study, the mean modal dose of nefazodone was 503 mg/day, and 85% of these inpatients were melancholic; at baseline, patients were distributed at the higher end of the 7 point CGI Severity scale, as follows: 4 = moderately ill (17%); 5 = markedly ill (48%); 6 = severely ill (32%). In the other study, the differentiation in response rates between nefazodone and placebo was not statistically significant. This result may be explained by the “high” rate of spontaneous improvement among the patients randomized to placebo.\n- Studies of “Relapse Prevention in Patients Recently Recovered (Clinically) From Depression”\n- Two studies were conducted to assess nefazodone’s capacity to maintain a clinical remission in acutely depressed patients who were judged to have responded adequately (HDRS total score ≤ 10) after a 16 week period of open treatment with nefazodone (titration up to 600 mg/day). In one study, nefazodone was superior to placebo. In this study, patients (n = 131) were randomized to continuation on nefazodone or placebo for an additional 36 weeks (1 year total). This study demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate (HDRS total score ≥ 18) for patients taking nefazodone compared to those on placebo. The second study was of appropriate design and power, but the sample of patients admitted for evaluation did not suffer relapses at a high enough incidence to provide a meaningful test of nefazodone’s efficacy for this use.\n- Comparisons of Clinical Trial Results\n- Highly variable results have been seen in the clinical development of all antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, in those circumstances when the drugs have not been studied in the same controlled clinical trial(s), comparisons among the findings of studies evaluating the effectiveness of different antidepressant drug products are inherently unreliable. Because conditions of testing (e.g., patient samples, investigators, doses of the treatments administered and compared, outcome measures, etc.) vary among trials, it is virtually impossible to distinguish a difference in drug effect from a difference due to one or more of the confounding factors just enumerated.\n\n【53】 ## Nonclinical Toxicology\nThere is limited information regarding Nefazodone Nonclinical Toxicology in the drug label.\n\n【54】 # Clinical Studies\nThere is limited information regarding Nefazodone Clinical Studies in the drug label.\n\n【55】 # How Supplied\nNefazodone hydrochloride tablets USP, 50 mg, are light-pink to pink (mottled), capsule-shaped, beveled-edged tablets, debossed “7178” on one side and debossed “93” on the other side.

{"seq_id": "d79165ac-0d63-4f20-b947-98db9e97a64a", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Loprazolam\n\n【1】 # Overview\nLoprazolam marketed under the band names Dormonoct, Havlane, Sonin, Somnovit, is a drug which is an imidazole  benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It is available in 1mg tablets. It is licensed and marketed for the short term treatment of severe insomnia.\n\n【2】 # Indications\nInsomnia. Insomnia can be described as a difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. Loprazolam is an intermediate acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep or have difficulty falling asleep. Hypnotics should only be used on a short term basis or in those with chronic insomnia on an occasional basis.\n\n【3】 # Dose\nThe dose of Loprazolam for insomnia is usually 1 mg but can be increased to 2 mg if necessary. In the elderly a lower dose is recommended due to more pronounced effects and a significant impairment of standing up to 11 hours after dosing of 1 mg of loprazolam. The half life is much more prolonged in the elderly than in younger patients. A half life of 19.8 hours has been reported in elderly patients.\nPatients and prescribing physicians should however bear in mind that higher doses of loprazolam may impair long term memory functions.\n\n【4】 # Mechanism of Action\nLoprazolam is a benzodiazepine, which acts via positively modulating the GABAa receptor complex via a binding to the benzodiazepine receptor which is situated on alpha subunit containing GABAa receptors. This action enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAa receptor complex by increasing the opening frequency of the chloride ion channel. This action allows more chloride ions to enter the neuron which in turn produces the following properties: muscle relaxation, anxiolytic, hypnotic, amnesic and anticonvulsant. These properties can be used for therapeutic benefit in clinical practise. These properties are also sometimes used for recreational purposes in the form of drug abuse of benzodiazepines where high doses are used to achieve intoxication and or sedation.\n\n【5】 # Pharmacokinetics\nAfter oral administration of loprazolam on an empty stomach it takes 2 hours for serum concentration levels to reach their peak which is a significantly longer time than other benzodiazepine hypnotics. The delay in the time for peak plasma levels to reach their maximum brings into question the benefit of loprazolam for the treatment of insomnia when compared to other hypnotics, although studies have shown that the sleep inducing properties of loprazolam occur within 0.5 hours, which may indicate rapid penetration into the brain and thus the peak plasma delay of loprazolam may not be sigificantly relevant to loprazolams benefit as a hypnotic agent for the treatment of insomnia. If loprazolam is taken after a meal the time for plasma levels to reach their peak may be delayed even further. Loprazolam induces significant changes in the electrical activity of the brain as measured by an EEG, these changes are more pronounced, the higher the dosage. Metabolism of loprazolam in humans produces an active metabolite which is similar in potency to loprazolam, in levels of about half that of parent compound,  the other half is excreted unchanged as loprazolam. The half life of the active metabolite is about the same as the parent compound loprazolam.\n\n【6】 # Cognitive behavioural therapy\nChronic users of sedative hypnotic drugs who took part in a large scale clinical trial were found to have very high levels of insomnia and very low levels of sleep quality at trial intake. Those who received cognitive behavioural therapy and sleep hygiene, stimulus control, relaxation therapies had improved sleep quality, increased vitality, increased physical functioning and improved mental health. Reduced sedative hypnotic drug use also occurred in CBT treated patients with 33% at 6 month follow up reporting zero sedative hypnotic use. Clinical improvements were still apparent at 12 month follow-up. The patients age was not a barrier to successful outcome. It was concluded that psychological treatment can improve sleep quality, reduce hypnotic drug use and thus improve health related quality of life and is cost effective treatment for long term hypnotic users with chronic insomnia. CBT should be considered by healthcare providers and practitioners for insomnia management and to reduce benzodiazepine use in those with chronic insomnia.\n\n【7】 # Side Effects\nSide effects of loprazolam are generally the same as for other benzodiazepines such as diazepam Valium. The only main difference in side effects of loprazolam and diazepam is it is less prone to day time sedation as the half life of loprazolam is considered to be intermediate whereas diazepam has a very long half life. The side effects of loprazolam are the following:\nList of Side Effects\n- drowsiness\n- paradoxical increase in aggression\n- lightheadedness\n- confusion\n- muscle weakness\n- ataxia (particularly in the elderly)\n- amnesia\n- headache\n- vertigo\n- hypotension\n- salivation changes\n- gastro-intestinal disturbances\n- visual disturbances\n- dysarthria\n- tremor\n- changes in libido\n- incontinence\n- urinary retention\n- blood disorders and jaundice\n- skin reactions\n- dependence and withdrawal reactions\nResidual 'hangover' effects after nighttime administration of loprazolam such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions may persist into the next day which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures.\n\n【8】 # Tolerance, Dependence and Withdrawal\nLoprazolam as with all other benzodiazepines is recommended for only short term management of insomnia in the UK due to the serious concerns of adverse affects of long term usage of benzodiazepines such as tolerance, dependency and withdrawal phenomenon as well as adverse effects on mood and cognition. Prolonged usage of benzodiazepines also is not recommended due to a lack of efficacy in there therapeutic actions due to tolerance to their effects and concerns of increasing physical and psychological adverse effects of some patients on long term benzodiazepines, eg agorophobia, gastrointestinal and peripheral nerve abnormalities such as burning and tingling sensations.\nLoprazolam however has a low risk of dependence (addiction) and withdrawal phenomenon if it is used for less than 4 weeks or very occasionally. However in one placebo controlled study comparing 3 week treatment for insomnia of either loprazolam or triazolam rebound anxiety and insomnia occurred 3 days after discontinuing loprazolam therapy whereas with triazolam the rebound anxiety and insomnia was seen the next day. The difference between the two benzodiazepines in time for rebound or withdrawal phenomenon to appear is likely due to the difference in the elimination half life of the two drugs.  These results would suggest that loprazolam and possibly other benzodiazepines should be prescribed for 1 - 2 weeks rather than 2 - 4 weeks to reduce the risk of physical dependence or and withdrawal or rebound phenomenon.\nWithdrawal Symptoms\nIt should be noted that slow reduction of the dosage over a period of months at a rate which the individual can tolerate greatly minimises the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. It is usually recommended for individuals dependent on benzodiazepines cross to an equivalent dose of diazepam to gradually taper as diazepam has a longer half life and small dose reductions can be achieved compared to other benzodiazepines.  \n- anxiety and panic attacks\n- sweating\n- nightmares\n- insomnia\n- headache\n- tremor\n- nausea and vomiting\n- feelings of unreality\n- abnormal sensation of movement\n- hypersensitivity to stimuli\n- hyperventilation\n- flushing\n- palpitations\n- dimensional distortions of rooms and television pictures\n- paranoid thoughts and feelings of persecution\n- depersonalisation\n- fears of 'going mad\n- heightened perception of taste, smell, sound, and light; photophobia\n- agoraphobia\n- clinical depression\n- poor memory and concentration\n- aggression\n- excitability\n- Somatic Symptoms\n- numbness\n- altered sensations of the skin\n- pain\n- stiffness\n- weakness in the neck, head, jaw, and limbs\n- muscle fasciculation ranging from twitches to jerks affecting the legs or shoulders\n- ataxia\n- paraesthesiae\n- influenza-like symptoms\n- blurred double vision\n- menorrhagia\n- loss of or dramatic gain in appetite\n- thirst with polyuria\n- urinary incontinence\n- dysphagia\n- abdominal pain\n- diarrhoea\n- constipation\nMajor complications can occur after abrupt or over rapid withdrawal especially from high doses producing symptoms such as:\n- psychosis\n- confusion\n- visual and auditory hallucinations\n- delusions\n- epileptic seizures (which may be fatal)\nIt has been estimated that between 30% and 50% of long term users of benzodiazepines will experience withdrawal symptoms.

It is not necessary that the order of a reaction is a whole number - zero and fractional values of order are possible - but they tend to be integers. Reaction orders can be determined only by experiment. Their knowledge allows conclusions about the reaction mechanism.\nThe reaction order is not necessarily related to the stoichiometry of the reaction, unless the reaction is elementary. Complex reactions may or may not have reaction orders equal to their stoichiometric coefficients\nFor example :\n- The alkaline hydrolysis of ethyl acetate is a complex reaction:\n- The rate equation for imidazole catalyzed hydrolysis is\n- In the reaction of aryldiazonium ions with nucleophiles in aqueous solution ArN2+ + X- → ArX + N2 the rate equation is\nReactions can also have an undefined reaction order with respect to a reactant, for example one can not talk about reaction order in the rate equation found when dealing with a bimolecular reaction between adsorbed molecules:\nIf the concentration of one of the reactants remains constant (because it is a catalyst or it is in great excess with respect to the other reactants) its concentration can be included in the rate constant, obtaining a pseudo constant: if B is the reactant whose concentration is constant then  r= k =k'. The second order rate equation has been reduced to a pseudo first order rate equation. This makes the treatment in order to obtain an integrated rate equation much easier.\nZero-order reactions are often seen for thermal chemical decompositions where the reaction rate is independent of the concentration of the reactant (changing the concentration has no effect on the speed of the reaction):\nIn broken-order reactions the order is a non-integer typical of reactions with a complex reaction mechanism. For example the chemical decomposition of ethanal into methane and carbon monoxide proceeds with an order of 1.5 with respect to ethanal. The decomposition of phosgene to carbon monoxide and chlorine has order 1 with respect to phosgene itself and order 0.5 with respect to chlorine.\nIn a mixed-order reaction the order of a reaction changes in the course of a reaction as a result of changing variables such as pH. An example is the oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone by a ruthenate (RuO42-) and a hexacyanoferrate, the latter serving as the sacrificial catalyst converting Ru(IV) back to Ru(VI) : the disappearing-rate of the ferrate is zero-order with respect to the ferrate at the onset of the reaction (when its concentration is high and the ruthenium catalyst is quickly regenerated) but changes to first-order when its concentration decreases.\nNegative order reactions are rare, for example the conversion of ozone (order 2) to oxygen (order -1).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It is a feature of hypereosinophilic syndrome and occurs in 40-50% of all cases.  Eosinophills enter the tissue and undergo degranulation; release cytotoxic proteins; increase production of reactive oxygen species, enzymes, growth factor, and cytokines. This process leads to tissue damage and dysfunction, eventually leading to fibrosis and restrictive cardiomyopathy. There are 3 stages of the eosinophilic cardiomyopathy: Stage 1 that is acute necrotic stage, stage 2 that is mural thrombus formation, and stage 3 that is ibrotic stage.

Influenza viruses also can cause pandemics, during which rates of illness and death from influenza-related complications can increase worldwide. Influenza viruses cause disease among all age groups . Rates of infection are highest among children, but rates of serious illness and death are highest among persons aged >65 years, children aged <2 years, and persons of any age who have medical conditions that place them at increased risk for complications from influenz.2,.\nInfluenza vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza and its severe complications. In this report from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the primary target groups recommended for annual vaccination are 1 persons at increased risk for influenza-related complications (i.e., those aged >65 years, children aged 6-23 months, pregnant women, and persons of any age with certain chronic medical conditions); 2 persons aged 50-64 years because this group has an elevated prevalence of certain chronic medical conditions; and 3 persons who live with or care for persons at high risk (e.g., health-care workers and household contacts who have frequent contact with persons at high risk and who can transmit influenza to those persons at high risk). Vaccination is associated with reductions in influenza-related respiratory illness and physician visits among all age groups, hospitalization and death among persons at high risk, otitis media among children, and work absenteeism among adults . Although influenza vaccination levels increased substantially during the 1990s, further improvements in vaccine coverage levels are needed, chiefly among persons aged 65 years, among children aged 6-23 months, and among health-care workers. ACIP recommends using strategies to improve vaccination levels, including using reminder/recall systems and standing orders programs . Although influenza vaccination remains the cornerstone for the control and treatment of influenza, information on antiviral medications is also presented because these agents are an adjunct to vaccine.\n\n【1】 # Primary Changes and Updates in the Recommendations\nThe 2005 recommendations include five principal changes or updates:\n- ACIP recommends that persons with any condition (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, spinal cord injuries, seizure disorders, or other neuromuscular disorders) that can compromise respiratory function or the handling of respiratory secretions or that can increase the risk for aspiration be vaccinated against influenza . - ACIP emphasizes that all health-care workers should be vaccinated against influenza annually, and that facilities that employ health-care workers be strongly encouraged to provide vaccine to workers by using approaches that maximize immunization rates. - Use of both available vaccines (inactivated and LAIV) is encouraged for eligible persons every influenza season, especially persons in recommended target groups. During periods when inactivated vaccine is in short supply, use of LAIV is especially encouraged when feasible for eligible persons (including health-care workers) because use of LAIV by these persons might considerably increase availability of inactivated vaccine for persons in groups at high risk. - CDC and other agencies will assess the vaccine supply throughout the manufacturing period and will make recommendations preceding the 2005-06 influenza season regarding the need for tiered timing of vaccination of different risk groups. In addition, CDC will publish ACIP recommendations regarding inactivated vaccine subprioritization (tiering) on a later date in MMWR.\n\n【2】 # Influenza and Its Burden\n\n【3】 # Biology of Influenza\nInfluenza A and B are the two types of influenza viruses that cause epidemic human disease . Influenza A viruses are further categorized into subtypes on the basis of two surface antigens: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Influenza B viruses are not categorized into subtypes. Since 1977, influenza A (H1N1) viruses, influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation. In 2001, influenza A (H1N2) viruses that probably emerged after genetic reassortment between human A (H3N2) and A (H1N1) viruses began circulating widely. Both influenza A and B viruses are further separated into groups on the basis of antigenic characteristics. New influenza virus variants result from frequent antigenic change (i.e., antigenic drift) resulting from point mutations that occur during viral replication. Influenza B viruses undergo antigenic drift less rapidly than influenza A viruses.\nImmunity to the surface antigens, particularly the hemagglutinin, reduces the likelihood of infection and severity of disease if infection occurs . Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another type or subtype of influenza. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not completely protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype . Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual incorporation of one or more new strains in each year's influenza vaccine.\n\n【4】 # Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Influenza\nInfluenza viruses are spread from person to person primarily through the coughing and sneezing of infected persons . The typical incubation period for influenza is 1-4 days, with an average of 2 days . Adults can be infectious from the day before symptoms begin through approximately 5 days after illness onset. Children can be infectious for >10 days, and young children can shed virus for several days before their illness onset. Severely immunocompromised persons can shed virus for weeks or months .\nUncomplicated influenza illness is characterized by the abrupt onset of constitutional and respiratory signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, nonproductive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis) . Among children, otitis media, nausea, and vomiting are also commonly reported with influenza illness . Respiratory illness caused by influenza is difficult to distinguish from illness caused by other respiratory pathogens on the basis of symptoms alone . Reported sensitivities and speci-ficities of clinical definitions for influenza-like illness (ILI) in studies primarily among adults that include fever and cough have ranged from 63% to 78% and 55% to 71%, respectively, compared with viral culture .\nInfluenza illness typically resolves after 3-7 days for the majority of persons, although cough and malaise can persist for >2 weeks. Among certain persons, influenza can exacerbate underlying medical conditions (e.g., pulmonary or cardiac disease), lead to secondary bacterial pneumonia or primary influenza viral pneumonia, or occur as part of a coinfection with other viral or bacterial pathogens . Young children with influenza infection can have initial symptoms mimicking bacterial sepsis with high fevers .\n\n【5】 # Hospitalizations and Deaths from Influenza\nThe risks for complications, hospitalizations, and deaths from influenza are higher among persons aged >65 years, young children, and persons of any age with certain underlying health conditions  than among healthy older children and younger adult.1,6,8,. Estimated rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations have varied substantially by age group in studies conducted during different influenza epidemics .\nAmong children aged 0-4 years, hospitalization rates have ranged from approximately 500/100,000 children for those with high-risk medical conditions to 100/100,000 children for those without high-risk medical conditions . Within the 0-4 year age group, hospitalization rates are highest among children aged 0-1 years and are comparable to rates reported among persons aged >65 years  .\nDuring influenza epidemics from 1979-80 through 2000-01, the estimated overall number of influenzaassociated hospitalizations in the United States ranged from approximately 54,000 to 430,000/epidemic. An average of approximately 226,000 influenza-related excess hospitalizations occurred per year, with 63% of all hospitalizations occurring among persons aged >65 years . Since the 1968 influenza A (H3N2) virus pandemic, the greatest numbers of influenza-associated hospitalizations have occurred during epidemics caused by type A (H3N2) viruses .\nInfluenza-related deaths can result from pneumonia and from exacerbations of cardiopulmonary conditions and other chronic diseases. Deaths of older adults account for >90% of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza .\nDeaths from influenza are uncommon among both children with and without high-risk conditions, but do occur . Further information is needed regarding the risk for severe influenza-complications and optimal strategies for minimizing severe disease and death among children.\n\n【6】 # Options for Controlling Influenza\nIn the United States, the primary option for reducing the effect of influenza is immunoprophylaxis with vaccine. Inactivated (i.e., killed virus) influenza vaccine and live, attenuated influenza vaccine are available for use in the United State.see Recommendations for Using Inactivated and Live, At- * Outcomes were limited to hospitalizations in which either pneumonia or influenza was listed as the first condition on discharge records (Simonsen) or included anywhere in the list of discharge diagnoses (Barker).    Source: Simonsen L, Fukuda K, Schonberger LB, Cox NJ. Impact of influenza epidemics on hospitalizations. J Infect Dis 2000;181:831-7.    Persons at high risk and not at high risk for influenza-related complications are combined.    The low estimate is the average during influenza A (H1N1) or influenza B-predominate seasons, and the high estimate is the average during influenza A (H3N2)-predominate seasons. Outcomes were for rate of primary respiratory and circulatory hospitalizations.\n    Source: Thompson\n\n【7】 # Influenza Vaccine Composition\nBoth the inactivated and live, attenuated vaccines prepared for the 2005-06 season will include A/California/7/2004 (H3N2)-like, A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like, and B/Shanghai/361/2002-like antigens. For the A/California/7/ 2004 (H3N2)-like antigen, manufacturers may use the antigenically equivalent A/New York/55/2004 (H3N2) virus, and for the B/Shanghai/361/2002-like antigen, manufacturers may use the antigenically equivalent B/Jilin/20/2003 virus or B/Jiangsu/10/2003 virus. These viruses will be used because of their growth properties and because they are representative of influenza viruses likely to circulate in the United States during the 2005-06 influenza season. Because circulating influenza A (H1N2) viruses are a reassortant of influenza A (H1N1) and (H3N2) viruses, antibody directed against influenza A (H1N1) and influenza (H3N2) vaccine strains provides protection against circulating influenza A (H1N2) viruses. Influenza viruses for both the inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccines are initially grown in embryonated hens eggs. Thus, both vaccines might contain limited amounts of residual egg protein.\nFor the inactivated vaccine, the vaccine viruses are made noninfectiou.i\n\n【8】 # Thimerosal\nThimerosal, a mercury-containing compound, has been used as a preservative in vaccines  since the 1930s and is used in multi-dose vials of inactivated influenza vaccine to reduce the likelihood of bacterial contamination. Although no scientific evidence indicates that thimerosal in vaccines leads to serious adverse events in vaccine recipients, in 1999, the U.S. Public Health Service and other organizations recommended that efforts be made to eliminate or reduce the thimerosal content in vaccines to decrease total mercury exposure, chiefly among infants . Since mid-2001, vaccines routinely recommended for infants in the United States have been manufactured either without or with only trace amounts of thimerosal to provide a substantial reduction in the total mercury exposure from vaccines for children . Vaccines containing trace amounts of thimerosal have <1 mcg mercury/dose.\nInfluenza Vaccines and Thimerosal. LAIV does not contain thimerosal. Thimerosal preservative-containing inactivated influenza vaccines, distributed in multi-dose containers in the United States, contain 25 mcg of mercury/0.5-mL dose  in 0.25-mL-dose syringes.\nInfluenza vaccine is part of the routine childhood immunization schedule. Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. (formerly Aventis Pas-teur, Inc.) produces FluZone. which is an inactivated influenza vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for persons aged >6 months. FluZone that is available in multi-dose vials contains thimerosal as a preservative. Thimerosal-free FluZone packaged as 0.25-mL unit dose syringes is available for use among persons aged 6-35 months. Thimerosal-free FluZone packaged as 0.5 mL unit dose syringes is available for use among persons aged >3 years. Fluvirin. produced by Chiron, is an inactivated influenza vaccine available in a preservative-free formulation, is packaged as 0.5-mL single-dose syringes, and is licensed for use in persons aged >4 years. The preservative-free Fluvirin vaccine contains trace amounts of thimerosal. The total amount of inactivated influenza vaccine available without thimerosal as a preservative will be increased as manufacturing capabilities are expanded.\nThe risks for severe illness from influenza infection are elevated among both young children and pregnant women, and both groups benefit from vaccination by preventing illness and death from influenza. In contrast, no scientifically conclusive evidence exists of harm from exposure to thimerosal preservative-containing vaccine, whereas evidence is accumulating of lack of any harm resulting from exposure to such vaccines . Therefore, the benefits of influenza vaccination outweigh the theoretical risk, if any, for thimerosal exposure through vaccination. Nonetheless, certain persons remain concerned regarding exposure to thimerosal. The U.S. vaccine supply for infants and pregnant women is in a period of transition during which the availability of thimerosal-reduced or thimerosal-free vaccine intended for these groups is being expanded by manufacturers as a feasible means of reducing an infant's total exposure to mercury because other environmental sources of exposure are more difficult or impossible to eliminate. Reductions in thimerosal in other vaccines have been achieved already and have resulted in substantially lowered cumulative exposure to thimerosal from vaccination among infants and children. For all of these reasons, persons recommended to receive inactivated influenza vaccine may receive either vaccine preparation, depending on availability.\n\n【9】 # Efficacy and Effectiveness of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine\nThe effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine depends primarily on the age and immunocompetence of the vaccine recipient and the degree of similarity between the viruses in the vaccine and those in circulation. The majority of vaccinated children and young adults develop high postvaccination hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers . These antibody titers are protective against illness caused by strains that are antigenically similar to those strains of the same type or subtype included in the vaccine .\nAdults Aged <65 Years. When the vaccine and circulating viruses are antigenically similar, influenza vaccine prevents influenza illness among approximately 70%-90% of healthy adults aged <65 years .\nChildren. Children aged 6 months can develop protective levels of anti-influenza antibody against specific influenza virus strains after influenza vaccinatio.69,70, although the antibody response among children at high risk for influenza-related complications might be lower than among healthy children .\nAdults Aged >65 Years. Older persons and persons with certain chronic diseases might develop lower postvaccination antibody titers than healthy young adults and thus can remain susceptible to influenza infection and influenza-related upper respiratory tract illness . A randomized trial among noninstitutionalized persons aged >60 years reported a vaccine efficacy of 58% against influenza respiratory illness, but indicated that efficacy might be lower among those aged >70 years . The vaccine can also be effective in preventing secondary complications and reducing the risk for influenzarelated hospitalization and death among adults aged >65 years with and without high-risk medical conditions (e.g., heart disease and diabetes) 18,92. Among elderly persons not living in nursing homes or similar chronic-care facilities, influenza vaccine is 30%-70% effective in preventing hospitalization for pneumonia and influenza .\n\n【10】 # Efficacy and Effectiveness of LAIV\nHealthy Children. A randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial among 1,602 healthy children initially aged 15-71 months assessed the efficacy of trivalent LAIV against culture-confirmed influenza during two seasons .\nHealthy Adults. A randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial among 4,561 healthy working adults aged 18-64 years assessed multiple endpoints, including reductions in illness, absenteeism, health-care visits, and medication use during peak and total influenza outbreak periods . The study was conducted during the 1997-98 influenza season, when the vaccine and circulating A (H3N2) strains were not wellmatched. The study did not include testing of viruses by a laboratory. During peak outbreak periods, no difference was identified between LAIV and placebo recipients experiencing any febrile episodes. However, vaccination was associated with reductions in severe febrile illnesses of 19% and febrile upper respiratory tract illnesses of 24%. Vaccination also was associated with fewer days of illness, fewer days of work lost, fewer days with health-care-provider visits, and reduced use of prescription antibiotics and over-the-counter medications.\nAmong the subset of 3,637 healthy adults aged 18-49 years, LAIV recipients (n = 2,411) had 26% fewer febrile upperrespiratory illness episodes; 27% fewer lost work days as a result of febrile upper respiratory illness; and 18%-37% fewer days of health-care provider visits caused by febrile illness, compared with placebo recipients (n = 1,226). Days of antibiotic use were reduced by 41%-45% in this age subset.\nAnother randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge study among 92 healthy adults (LAIV, n = 29; placebo, n = 31; inactivated influenza vaccine, n = 32) aged 18-41 years assessed the efficacy of both LAIV and inactivated vaccine . The overall efficacy of LAIV and inactivated influenza vaccine in preventing laboratory-documented influenza from all three influenza strains combined was 85% and 71%, respectively, on the basis of experimental challenge by viruses to which study participants were susceptible before vaccination. The difference in efficacy between the two vaccines was not statistically significant.\n\n【11】 # Cost-Effectiveness of Influenza Vaccine\nInfluenza vaccination can reduce both health-care costs and productivity losses associated with influenza illness. Economic studies of influenza vaccination of persons aged >65 years conducted in the United States have reported overall societal cost savings and substantial reductions in hospitalization and death  gained and resulted in costs of $23-$256/QALY among younger age groups. Additional studies of the relative cost-effectiveness and cost utility of influenza vaccination among children and among adults aged <65 years are needed and should be designed to account for year-to-year variations in influenza attack rates, illness severity, and vaccine efficacy when evaluating the longterm costs and benefits of annual vaccination.\n\n【12】 # Vaccination Coverage Levels\nOne of the national health objectives for 2010 is to achieve vaccination coverage for 90% of persons aged >65 years (objective no. 14-29a) . Among persons aged >65 years, influenza vaccination levels increased from 33% in 1989  to 66% in 199. surpassing the Healthy People 2000 objective of 60% . Vaccine coverage in this group reached the highest levels recorded (68%) during the 1999-00 influenza season, using the percentage of adults reporting influenza vaccination during the previous 12 months who participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) during the first and second quarters of each calendar year as a proxy measure of influenza vaccine coverage for the previous  Persons categorized as being at high risk for influenza-related complications self-reported one or more of the following: 1 ever being told by a physician they had diabetes, emphysema, coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack, or other heart condition; 2 having a diagnosis of cancer during the previous 12 months (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) or ever being told by a physician they have lymphoma, leukemia, or blood cancer during the previous 12 months; 3 being told by a physician they have chronic bronchitis or weak or failing kidneys; or 4 reporting an asthma episode or attack during the preceding 12 months.  Aged 18-44 years, pregnant at the time of the survey and without high-risk conditions.  Adults were classified as health-care workers if they were currently employed in a health-care occupation or in a health-care-industry setting, on the basis of standard occupation and industry categories recoded in groups by CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.   Interviewed adult in each household containing at least one of the following: a child aged 65 years, or any person aged 2-17 years at high risk . To obtain information on household composition and high-risk status of household members, the sampled adult, child, and person files from NHIS were merged. Interviewed adults who were health-care workers or who had high-risk conditions were excluded. Information could not be assessed regarding high-risk status of other adults aged 18-64 years in the household, thus, certain adults 18-64 years who live with an adult aged 18-64 years at high risk were not included in the analysis.\ninfluenza season . Possible reasons for the increase in influenza vaccination levels among persons aged >65 years through the 1999-00 influenza season include 1 greater acceptance of preventive medical services by practitioners; 2 increased delivery and administration of vaccine by healthcare providers and sources other than physicians; 3 new information regarding influenza vaccine effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety; and 4 initiation of Medicare reimbursement for influenza vaccination in 1993 .\nReducing racial and ethnic health disparities, including disparities in vaccination coverage, is an overarching national goal . Although estimated influenza vaccination coverage for the 1999-00 season reached the highest levels recorded among older black, Hispanic, and white populations, vaccination levels among blacks and Hispanics continue to lag behind those among whites . Additional strate-gies are needed to achieve the Healthy People 2010 objectives among all racial and ethnic groups.\nIn 1997 and 1998, vaccination coverage estimates among nursing home residents were 64%-82% and 83%, respectively .\nReported vaccination levels are low among children at increased risk for influenza complications. One study conducted among patients in health maintenance organizations reported influenza vaccination percentages ranging from 9% to 10% among children with asthma . A 25% vaccination level was reported among children with severe to moderate asthma who attended an allergy and immunology clinic . However, a study conducted in a pediatric clinic demonstrated an increase in the vaccination percentage of children with asthma or reactive airways disease from 5% to 32% after implementing a reminder/recall system . One study reported 79% vaccination coverage among children attending a cystic fibrosis treatment center  Vaccination of health-care workers has been associated with reduced work absenteeism  and fewer deaths among nursing home patients .\nLimited information is available regarding use of influenza vaccine among pregnant women. Among women aged 18-44 years without diabetes responding to the 2001 BRFSS, those who were pregnant were less likely to report influenza vaccination during the previous 12 months (13.7%) than those not pregnant (16.8%) .\nRecent data indicate that self-report of influenza vaccination among adults, compared with extraction from the medical record, is both sensitive and specific . Patient self-reports should be accepted as evidence of influenza vaccination in clinical practice . However, information on the validity of parents' reports of pediatric influenza vaccination is not yet available.\n\n【13】 # Recommendations for Using Inactivated and Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccines\nBoth the inactivated influenza vaccine and LAIV can be used to reduce the risk for influenza. LAIV is approved for use among healthy persons aged 5-49 years. Inactivated influenza vaccine is approved for persons aged >6 months, including those with high-risk conditions .\n\n【14】 # Target Groups for Vaccination\n\n【15】 # Persons at Increased Risk for Complications\nVaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended for the following persons who are at increased risk for complications from influenza:\n\n【16】 # Persons Aged 50-64 Years\nVaccination is recommended for persons aged 50-64 years because this group has an increased prevalence of persons with high-risk conditions. In 2002, approximately 43.6 million persons in the United States were aged 50-64 years, of whom 13.5 million (34%) had one or more high-risk medical conditions . Influenza vaccine has been recommended for this entire age group to increase the low vaccination rates among persons in this age group with high-risk conditions . Age-based strategies are more successful in increasing vaccine coverage than patient-selection strategies based on medical conditions. Persons aged 50-64 years without high-risk conditions also receive benefit from vaccination in the form of decreased rates of influenza illness, decreased work absenteeism, and decreased need for medical visits and medication, including antibiotics . Furthermore, 50 years is an age when other preventive services begin and when routine assessment of vaccination and other preventive services has been recommended .\n\n【17】 # Persons Who Can Transmit Influenza to Those at High Risk\nPersons who are clinically or subclinically infected can transmit influenza virus to persons at high risk for complications from influenza. Decreasing transmission of influenza from caregivers and household contacts to persons at high risk might reduce influenza-related deaths among persons at high risk. Evidence from two studies indicates that vaccination of healthcare workers is associated with decreased deaths among nursing home patients . In addition to health-care workers, additional groups that can transmit influenza to high-risk persons and that should be vaccinated include\n- employees of assisted living and other residences for persons in groups at high risk; - persons who provide home care to persons in groups at high risk; and - household contacts (including children) of persons in groups at high risk. In addition, because children aged 0-23 months are at increased risk for influenza-related hospitalizatio. vaccination is recommended for their household contacts and out-of-home caregivers, particularly for contacts of children aged 0-5 months, because influenza vaccines have not been approved by FDA for use among children aged <6 months .\nHealthy persons aged 5-49 years in these groups who are not contacts of severely immunosuppressed persons  can receive either LAIV or inactivated influenza vaccine. All other persons in this group should receive inactivated influenza vaccine.\n\n【18】 # Health-Care Workers\nAll health-care workers should be vaccinated against influenza annually . Facilities that employ health-care workers are strongly encouraged to provide vaccine to workers by using approaches that maximize vaccination rates. This will protect health-care workers, their patients, and communities, and will improve prevention of influenza-associated disease, patient safety, and will reduce disease burden. Influenza vaccination rates among health-care workers should be regularly measured and reported. Although vaccination rates for healthcare workers are typically <40%, with moderate effort, organized campaigns can attain higher rates of vaccination among this populatio. should be vaccinated, as should employees of nursing home and chroniccare facilities who have contact with patients or residents.\n\n【19】 # Additional Information Regarding Vaccination of Specific Populations Pregnant Women\nInfluenza-associated excess deaths among pregnant women were documented during the pandemics of 1918-19 and 1957-58 (49,. Case reports and limited studies also indicate that pregnancy can increase the risk for serious medical complications of influenza . An increased risk might result from 1) increases in heart rate, stroke volume, and oxygen consumption; 2 decreases in lung capacity; and 3 changes in immunologic function during pregnancy. A study of the effect of influenza during 17 interpandemic influenza seasons demonstrated that the relative risk for hospitalization for selected cardiorespiratory conditions among pregnant women enrolled in Medicaid increased from 1.4 during weeks 14-20 of gestation to 4.7 during weeks 37-42, in comparison with women who were 1-6 months postpartum . Women in their third trimester of pregnancy were hospitalized at a rate (i.e., 250/100,000 pregnant women) comparable with that of nonpregnant women who had high-risk medical conditions. Researchers estimate that an average of 1-2 hospitalizations can be prevented for every 1,000 pregnant women vaccinated .\nBecause of the increased risk for influenza-related complications, women who will be pregnant during the influenza season should be vaccinated. Vaccination can occur in any trimester. One study of influenza vaccination of approximately 2,000 pregnant women demonstrated no adverse fetal effects associated with influenza vaccine .\n\n【20】 # Healthy Young Children\nStudies indicate that rates of hospitalization are higher among young children than older children when influenza viruses are in circulation .\nBecause children aged 6-23 months are at substantially increased risk for influenza-related hospitalizations, ACIP recommends vaccination of all children in this age group . ACIP continues to recommend influenza vaccination of persons aged >6 months who have high-risk medical conditions.\nThe current inactivated influenza vaccine is not approved by FDA for use among children aged <6 months, the pediatric group at greatest risk for influenza-related complications . Vaccinating their household contacts and out-of-home caregivers might decrease the probability of influenza infection among these children.\nBeginning\n\n【21】 # Persons Infected with HIV\nLimited information is available regarding the frequency and severity of influenza illness or the benefits of influenza vaccination among persons with HIV infection .\nInactivated influenza vaccination has been demonstrated to produce substantial antibody titers against influenza among vaccinated HIV-infected persons who have minimal AIDSrelated symptoms and high CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell counts . A limited, randomized, placebo-controlled trial determined that inactivated influenza vaccine was highly effective in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza infection among HIV-infected persons with a mean of 400 CD4+ T-lymphocyte cells/mm3; a limited number of persons with CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell counts of 100 CD4+ cells and among those with <30,000 viral copies of HIV type-1/mL . Among persons who have advanced HIV disease and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell counts, inactivated influenza vaccine might not induce protective antibody titers .\nOne study determined that HIV RNA (ribonucleic acid) levels increased transiently in one HIV-infected person after influenza infection . Studies have demonstrated a transient (i.e., 2-4 week) increase in replication of HIV-1 in the plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-infected persons after vaccine administration . Because influenza can result in serious illness and because vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine can result in the production of protective antibody titers, vaccination will benefit HIV-infected persons, including HIV-infected pregnant women.\n\n【22】 # Breastfeeding Mothers\nInfluenza vaccine is safe for mothers who are breastfeeding and their infants. Breastfeeding does not adversely affect the immune response and is not a contraindication for vaccination.\n\n【23】 # Travelers\nThe risk for exposure to influenza during travel depends on the time of year and destination. In the tropics, influenza can occur throughout the year. In the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, the majority of influenza activity occurs during April-September. In temperate climate zones of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, travelers also can be exposed to influenza during the summer, especially when traveling as part of large organized tourist groups (e.g., on cruise ships) that include persons from areas of the world where influenza viruses are circulating . Persons at high risk for complications of influenza who were not vaccinated with influenza vaccine during the preceding fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccine before travel if they plan to\n- travel to the tropics,\n- travel with organized tourist groups at any time of year, or - travel to the Southern Hemisphere during April-September. No information is available regarding the benefits of revaccinating persons before summer travel who were already vaccinated in the preceding fall. Persons at high risk who receive the previous season's vaccine before travel should be revaccinated with the current vaccine the following fall or winter. Persons aged >50 years and persons at high risk should consult with their physicians before embarking on travel during the summer to discuss the symptoms and risks for influenza and the advisability of carrying antiviral medications for either prophylaxis or treatment of influenza.\n\n【24】 # General Population\nIn addition to the groups for which annual influenza vaccination is recommended, physicians should administer influenza vaccine to any person who wishes to reduce the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza or transmitting influenza to others should they become infected (the vaccine can be administered to children aged >6 months), depending on vaccine availability . Persons who provide essential community services should be considered for vaccination to minimize disruption of essential activities during influenza outbreaks. Students or other persons in institutional settings (e.g., those who reside in dormitories) should be encouraged to receive vaccine to minimize the disruption of routine activities during epidemics.\n\n【25】 # Comparison of LAIV with Inactivated Influenza Vaccine\nBoth inactivated influenza vaccine and LAIV are available to reduce the risk for influenza infection and illness. However, the vaccines also differ in key ways .\n\n【26】 # Major Similarities\nLAIV and inactivated influenza vaccine contain strains of influenza viruses that are antigenically equivalent to the annually recommended strains: one influenza A (H3N2) virus, one A (H1N1) virus, and one B virus. Each year, one or more virus strains might be changed on the basis of global surveillance for influenza viruses and the emergence and spread of new strains. Viruses for both vaccines are grown in eggs. Both vaccines are administered annually to provide optimal protection against influenza infection .\n\n【27】 # Major Differences\nInactivated influenza vaccine contains killed viruses, whereas LAIV contains live, attenuated viruses still capable of replication. LAIV is administered intranasally by sprayer, whereas inactivated influenza vaccine is administered intramuscularly by injection. LAIV is more expensive than inactivated influenza vaccine, although the price differential between inactivated vaccine and LAIV has decreased for the 2005-06 season. LAIV is approved for use among healthy persons aged 5-49 years; inactivated influenza vaccine is approved for use among persons aged >6 months, including those who are healthy and those with chronic medical conditions .\n\n【28】 # Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Recommendations Persons Who Should Not Be Vaccinated with Inactivated Influenza Vaccine\nInactivated influenza vaccine should not be administered to persons known to have anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs or to other components of the influenza vaccine without first consulting a physician . Prophylactic use of antiviral agents is an option for preventing influenza among such persons. However, persons who have a history of anaphylactic hypersensitivity to vaccine components but who are also at high risk for complications from influenza can benefit from vaccine after appropriate allergy evaluation and desensitization. Information regarding vaccine components is located in package inserts from each manufacturer. Persons with acute febrile illness usually should not be vaccinated until their symptoms have abated. However, minor illnesses with or without fever do not contraindicate use of influenza vaccine, particularly among children with mild upper-respiratory-tract infection or allergic rhinitis. Immunogenicity and side effects of split-and whole-virus vaccines are similar among adults when vaccines are administered at the recommended dosage.  For adults and older children, the recommended site of vaccination is the deltoid muscle. The preferred site for infants and young children is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.  Two doses administered at least 1 month apart are recommended for children aged <9 years who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time.\n\n【29】 # Dosage\nDosage recommendations vary according to age group . Among previously unvaccinated children aged 1 month apart are recommended for satisfactory antibody responses. If possible, the second dose should be administered before December. If a child aged <9 years receiving vaccine for the first time does not receive a second dose of vaccine within the same season, only 1 dose of vaccine should be administered the following season. Two doses are not required at that time. Among adults, studies have indicated limited or no improvement in antibody response when a second dose is administered during the same season . Even when the current influenza vaccine contains one or more antigens administered in previous years, annual vaccination with the current vaccine is necessary because immunity declines during the year after vaccination . Vaccine prepared for a previous influenza season should not be administered to provide protection for the current season. Because of lack of vaccine efficacy data, ACIP does not recommend that a child receiving influenza vaccine for the first time be given the first dose of vaccine in the spring, followed by the second dose in the autumn of the same year.\n\n【30】 # Route\nThe intramuscular route is recommended for influenza vaccine. Adults and older children should be vaccinated in the deltoid muscle. A needle length >1 inch can be considered for these age groups because needles <1 inch might be of insufficient length to penetrate muscle tissue in certain adults and older children .\nInfants and young children should be vaccinated in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh . ACIP recommends a needle length of 7/8-1 inch for children aged <12 months for intramuscular vaccination into the anterolateral thigh. When injecting into the deltoid muscle among children with adequate deltoid muscle mass, a needle length of 7/8-1.25 inches is recommended .\n\n【31】 # Side Effects and Adverse Reactions\nWhen educating patients regarding potential side effects, clinicians should emphasize that 1 inactivated influenza vaccine contains noninfectious killed viruses and cannot cause influenza; and 2 coincidental respiratory disease unrelated to influenza vaccination can occur after vaccination.\n\n【32】 # Local Reactions\nIn placebo-controlled studies among adults, the most frequent side effect of vaccination is soreness at the vaccination site (affecting 10%-64% of patients) that lasts <2 day.12,. These local reactions typically are mild and rarely interfere with the person's ability to conduct usual daily activities. One blinded, randomized, cross-over study among 1,952 adults and children with asthma, demonstrated that only body aches were reported more frequently after inactivated influenza vaccine (25.1%) than placebo-injection (20.8%) . One study  reported 20%-28% of children with asthma aged 9 months-18 years with local pain and swelling, and another study  reported 23% of children aged 6 months-4 years with chronic heart or lung disease had local reactions. A different study  reported no difference in local reactions among 53 children aged 6 months-6 years with high-risk medical conditions or among 305 healthy children aged 3-12 years in a placebo-controlled trial of inactivated influenza vaccine. In a study of 12 children aged 5-32 months, no substantial local or systemic reactions were noted .\n\n【33】 # Systemic Reactions\nFever, malaise, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms can occur after vaccination with inactivated vaccine and most often affect persons who have had no previous exposure to the influenza virus antigens in the vaccine (e.g., young children) .\nLess information from published studies is available for children, compared with adults. However, in a randomized crossover study among both children and adults with asthma, no increase in asthma exacerbations was reported for either age group . An analysis of 215,600 children aged <18 years and 8,476 children aged 6-23 months enrolled in one of five health maintenance organizations reported no increase in biologically plausible medically attended events during the 2 weeks after inactivated influenza vaccination, compared with control periods 3-4 weeks before and after vaccination . In a study of 791 healthy childre. postvaccination fever was noted among 11.5% of children aged 1-5 years, 4.6% among children aged 6-10 years, and 5.1% among children aged 11-15 years. Among children with high-risk medical conditions, one study of 52 children aged 6 months-4 years reported fever among 27% and irritability and insomnia among 25% ; and a study among 33 children aged 6-18 months reported that one child had irritability and one had a fever and seizure after vaccination . No placebo comparison was made in these studies. However, in pediatric trials of A/New Jersey/76 swine influenza vaccine, no difference was reported between placebo and split-virus vaccine groups in febrile reactions after injection, although the vaccine was associated with mild local tenderness or erythema .\nLimited data regarding potential adverse events after influenza vaccination are available from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). During January 1, 1991-June 30, 2004, VAERS received 1,895 reports of adverse events among children aged <18 years, including 479 reports of adverse events among children aged 6-23 months. The number of influenza vaccine doses received by children during this entire period is unknown (CDC, unpublished data, 2005). A recently published review of VAERS reports of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in children aged 6-23 months documented that the most frequently reported adverse events were fever, rash, injection-site reactions, and seizures. The majority of the small total number of reported seizures appeared to be febrile . Because of the limitations of passive reporting systems, determining causality for specific types of adverse events, with the exception of injection-site reactions, is usually not possible by using VAERS data alone. A population-based study of TIV safety in children aged 6-23 months indicated no vaccine associated adverse events that had a plausible relationship to vaccination .\nHealth-care professionals should promptly report to VAERS all clinically significant adverse events after influenza vaccination of children, even if the health-care professional is not certain that the vaccine caused the event. The Institute of Medicine has specifically recommended reporting of potential neurologic complications (e.g., demyelinating disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome ), although no evidence exists of a causal relationship between influenza vaccine and neurologic disorders in children.\nImmediate -presumably allergic -reactions (e.g., hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, and systemic anaphylaxis) rarely occur after influenza vaccination . These reactions probably result from hypersensitivity to certain vaccine components; the majority of reactions probably are caused by residual egg protein. Although current influenza vaccines contain only a limited quantity of egg protein, this protein can induce immediate hypersensitivity reactions among persons who have severe egg allergy. Persons who have had hives or swelling of the lips or tongue, or who have experienced acute respiratory distress or collapse after eating eggs should consult a physician for appropriate evaluation to help determine if vaccine should be administered. Persons who have documented immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to eggs, including those who have had occupational asthma or other allergic responses to egg protein, might also be at increased risk for allergic reactions to influenza vaccine, and consultation with a physician should be considered. Protocols have been published for safely administering influenza vaccine to persons with egg allergies .\nHypersensitivity reactions to any vaccine component can occur. Although exposure to vaccines containing thimerosal can lead to induction of hypersensitivity, the majority of patients do not have reactions to thimerosal when it is administered as a component of vaccines, even when patch or intradermal tests for thimerosal indicate hypersensitivity .\n\n【34】 # Guillain-Barré Syndrome\nThe 1976 swine influenza vaccine was associated with an increased frequency of GBS .\nDuring three of four influenza seasons studied during 1977-1991, the overall relative risk estimates for GBS after influenza vaccination were slightly elevated but were not statistically significant in any of these studies . However, in a study of the 1992-93 and 1993-94 seasons, the overall relative risk for GBS was 1.7 (95% CI = 1.0-2.8; p = 0.04) during the 6 weeks after vaccination, representing approximately 1 additional case of GBS/1 million persons vaccinated. The combined number of GBS cases peaked 2 weeks after vaccination . Thus, investigations to date have not documented a substantial increase in GBS associated with influenza vaccines (other than the swine influenza vaccine in 1976), and that, if influenza vaccine does pose a risk, it is probably slightly more than one additional case/1 million persons vaccinated. Recent data from VAERS has documented decreased reporting of post influenza vaccine GBS across age groups, despite overall increased reporting for influenza vaccine . Cases of GBS after influenza infection have been reported, but no epidemiologic studies have documented such an association .\nEven if GBS were a true side effect of vaccination in the years after 1976, the estimated risk for GBS of approximately 1 additional case/1 million persons vaccinated is substantially less than the risk for severe influenza, which can be prevented by vaccination among all age groups, especially persons aged >65 years and those who have medical indications for influenza vaccination  . The potential benefits of influenza vaccination in preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death substantially outweigh the possible risks for experiencing vaccine-associated GBS. The average case fatality ratio for GBS is 6% and increases with age . No evidence indicates that the case fatality ratio for GBS differs among vaccinated persons and those not vaccinated.\nThe incidence of GBS among the general population is low, but persons with a history of GBS have a substantially greater likelihood of subsequently experiencing GBS than persons without such a history . Thus, the likelihood of coincidentally experiencing GBS after influenza vaccination is expected to be greater among persons with a history of GBS than among persons with no history of this syndrome. Whether influenza vaccination specifically might increase the risk for recurrence of GBS is unknown; therefore, avoiding vaccinating persons who are not at high risk for severe influenza complications and who are known to have experienced GBS within 6 weeks after a previous influenza vaccination is prudent. As an alternative, physicians might consider using influenza an-tiviral chemoprophylaxis for these persons. Although data are limited, for the majority of persons who have a history of GBS and who are at high risk for severe complications from influenza, the established benefits of influenza vaccination justify yearly vaccination.\n\n【35】 # Live, Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Recommendations Background\nDescription and Action Mechanisms. LAIVs have been in development since the 1960s in the United States, where they have been evaluated as mono-, bi-, and trivalent formulations . The LAIV licensed for use in the United States beginning in 2003 is produced by MedImmune, Inc. (Gaithersburg, Maryland; ) and marketed under the name FluMist. It is a live, trivalent, intranasally administered vaccine that is\n- attenuated, producing mild or no signs or symptoms related to influenza virus infection; - temperature-sensitive, a property that limits the replication of the vaccine viruses at 38 º C-39 º C, and thus restricts LAIV viruses from replicating efficiently in human lower airways; and - cold-adapted, replicating efficiently at 25 º C, a temperature that is permissive for replication of LAIV viruses, but restrictive for replication of different wild-type viruses. In animal studies, LAIV viruses replicate in the mucosa of the nasopharynx, inducing protective immunity against viruses included in the vaccine, but replicate inefficiently in the lower airways or lungs.\nThe first step in developing an LAIV was the derivation of two stably attenuated master donor viruses (MDV), one for type A and one for type B influenza viruses. The two MDVs each acquired the cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive, attenuated phenotypes through serial passage in viral culture conducted at progressively lower temperatures. The vaccine viruses in LAIV are reassortant viruses containing genes from these MDVs that confer attenuation, temperature sensitivity, and cold adaptation and genes from the recommended contemporary wild-type influenza viruses, encoding the surface antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Thus, MDVs provide the stably attenuated vehicles for presenting influenza HA and NA antigens, to which the protective antibody response is directed, to the immune system. The reassortant vaccine viruses are grown in embryonated hens eggs. After the vaccine is formulated and inserted into individual sprayers for nasal administration, the vaccine must be stored at -15 º C or colder. The immunogenicity of the approved LAIV has been assessed in multiple studie.102, which included approximately 100 children aged 5-17 years, and approximately 300 adults aged 18-49 years. LAIV virus strains replicate primarily in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. The protective mechanisms induced by vaccination with LAIV are not completely understood but appear to involve both serum and nasal secretory antibodies. No single laboratory measurement closely correlates with protective immunity induced by LAIV.\nShedding and Transmission of Vaccine Viruses. Available data indicate that both children and adults vaccinated with LAIV can shed vaccine viruses for >2 days after vaccination, although in lower titers than typically occur with shedding of wild-type influenza viruses. Shedding should not be equated with person-to-person transmission of vaccine viruses, although, in rare instances, shed vaccine viruses can be transmitted from vaccinees to nonvaccinated persons.\nOne unpublished study in a child care center settingassessed transmissibility of vaccine viruses from 98 vaccinated to 99 unvaccinated subjects, all aged 8-36 months. Eighty percent of vaccine recipients shed one or more virus strains, with a mean of 7.6 days' duration . One vaccine type influenza type B isolate was recovered from a placebo recipient and was confirmed to be vaccine-type virus. The type B isolate retained the cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive, attenuated phenotype, and it possessed the same genetic sequence as a virus shed from a vaccine recipient in the same children's play group. The placebo recipient from whom the influenza type B vaccine virus was isolated did not exhibit symptoms that were different from those experienced by vaccine recipients. The estimated probability of acquiring vaccine virus after close contact with a single LAIV recipient in this child care population was 0.58%-2.4%.\nOne study assessing shedding of vaccine viruses in 20 healthy vaccinated adults aged 18-49 years demonstrated that the majority of shedding occurred within the first 3 days after vaccination, although one subject was noted to shed virus on day 7 after vaccine receipt. No subject shed vaccine viruses >10 days after vaccination. Duration or type of symptoms associated with receipt of LAIV did not correlate with duration of shedding of vaccine viruses. Person-to-person transmission of vaccine viruses was not assessed in this study .\nAnother study assessing shedding of vaccine viruses in 14 healthy adults aged 18-49 years indicated that 50% of these adults had viral antigen detected by direct immunofluorescence or rapid antigen tests within 7 days of vaccination. Most viral shedding was detected on day 2 or 3. Person-to-person transmission of vaccine viruses was not assessed in this study .\n\n【36】 # Stability of Vaccine Viruses.\nIn clinical trials, viruses shed by vaccine recipients have been phenotypically stable. In one study, nasal and throat swab specimens were collected from 17 study participants for 2 weeks after vaccine receipt . Virus isolates were analyzed by multiple genetic techniques. All isolates retained the LAIV genotype after replication in the human host, and all retained the cold-adapted and temperature-sensitive phenotypes.\n\n【37】 # Using LAIV\nLAIV is an option for vaccination of healthy persons aged 5-49 years, including health-care workers and other persons in close contact with groups at high risk and those wanting to avoid influenza. During periods when inactivated vaccine is in short supply, use of LAIV is encouraged when feasible for eligible persons (including health-care workers) because use of LAIV by these persons might increase availability of inactivated vaccine for persons in groups at high risk. Possible advantages of LAIV include its potential to induce a broad mucosal and systemic immune response, its ease of administration, and the acceptability of an intranasal rather than intramuscular route of administration.\n\n【38】 # Persons Who Should Not Be Vaccinated with LAIV\nThe following populations should not be vaccinated with LAIV:\n\n【39】 # Close Contacts of Persons at High Risk for Complications from Influenza\nClose contacts of persons at high risk for complications from influenza should receive influenza vaccine to reduce transmission of wild-type influenza viruses to persons at high risk.\nACIP has not indicated a preference for inactivated influenza vaccine use by health-care workers or other persons who have close contact with persons with lesser degrees of immunosuppression (e.g., persons with diabetes, persons with asthma taking corticosteroids, or persons infected with HIV) or for inactivated influenza vaccine use by health-care workers or other healthy persons aged 5-49 years in close contact with all other groups at high risk. Use of inactivated influenza vaccine is preferred for vaccinating household members, healthcare workers, and others who have close contact with severely immunosuppressed persons (e.g., patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplants) during those periods in which the immunosuppressed person requires care in a protective environment. The rationale for not using LAIV among healthcare workers caring for such patients is the theoretical risk that a live, attenuated vaccine virus could be transmitted to the severely immunosuppressed person. If a health-care worker receives LAIV, that worker should refrain from contact with severely immunosuppressed patients for 7 days after vaccine receipt. Hospital visitors who have received LAIV should refrain from contact with severely immunosuppressed persons for 7 days after vaccination; however, such persons need not be excluded from visitation of patients who are not severely immunosuppressed.\n\n【40】 # Personnel Who May Administer LAIV\nLow-level introduction of vaccine viruses into the environment is likely unavoidable when administering LAIV. The risk for acquiring vaccine viruses from the environment is unknown but likely to be limited. Severely immunosuppressed persons should not administer LAIV. However, other persons at high risk for influenza complications may administer LAIV. These include persons with underlying medical conditions placing them at high risk or who are likely to be at risk, including pregnant women, persons with asthma, and persons aged >50 years.\n\n【41】 # LAIV Dosage and Administration\nLAIV is intended for intranasal administration only and should not be administered by the intramuscular, intradermal, or intravenous route. LAIV must be thawed before administration. This can be accomplished by holding an individual sprayer in the palm of the hand until thawed, with subsequent immediate administration. Alternatively, the vaccine can be thawed in a refrigerator and stored at 2 º C-8 º C for <24 hours before use. Vaccine should not be refrozen after thawing. LAIV is supplied in a prefilled single-use sprayer containing 0.5 mL of vaccine. Approximately 0.25 mL (i.e., half of the total sprayer contents) is sprayed into the first nostril while the recipient is in the upright position. An attached dose-divider clip is removed from the sprayer to administer the second half of the dose into the other nostril. If the vaccine recipient sneezes after administration, the dose should not be repeated.\nLAIV should be administered annually according to the following schedule:\n- Children aged 5-8 years previously unvaccinated at any time with either LAIV or inactivated influenza vaccine should receive 2 doses  of LAIV separated by 6-10 weeks. - Children aged 5-8 years previously vaccinated at any time with either LAIV or inactivated influenza vaccine should receive 1 dose of LAIV. They do not require a second dose. - Persons aged 9-49 years should receive 1 dose of LAIV. LAIV can be administered to persons with minor acute illnesses (e.g., diarrhea or mild upper respiratory tract infection with or without fever). However, if clinical judgment indicates nasal congestion is present that might impede delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral of administration should be considered until resolution of the illness.\nWhether concurrent administration of LAIV with other vaccines affects the safety or efficacy of either LAIV or the simultaneously administered vaccine is unknown. In the absence of specific data indicating interference, following the ACIP general recommendations for immunization is prudent . Inactivated vaccines do not interfere with the immune response to other inactivated vaccines or to live vaccines. An inactivated vaccine can be administered either simultaneously or at any time before or after LAIV. Two live vaccines not administered on the same day should be administered >4 weeks apart when possible.\n\n【42】 # LAIV and Use of Influenza Antiviral Medications\nThe effect on safety and efficacy of LAIV coadministration with influenza antiviral medications has not been studied. However, because influenza antivirals reduce replication of influenza viruses, LAIV should not be administered until 48 hours after cessation of influenza antiviral therapy, and influenza antiviral medications should not be administered for 2 weeks after receipt of LAIV.\n\n【43】 # LAIV Storage\nLAIV must be stored at -15 º C or colder. A manufacturersupplied freezer box was formerly required for storage of LAIV in a frost-free freezer; however, the freezer box is now optional, and LAIV may now be stored in frost-free freezers without using a freezer box. LAIV can be thawed in a refrigerator and stored at 2 º C-8 º C for <60 hours before use. It should not be refrozen after thawing.\n\n【44】 # Side Effects and Adverse Reactions\nTwenty prelicensure clinical trials assessed the safety of the approved LAIV. In these combined studies, approximately 28,000 doses of the vaccine were administered to approximately 20,000 subjects. A subset of these trials were randomized, placebo-controlled studies in which an estimated 4,000 healthy children aged 5-17 years and 2,000 healthy adults aged 18-49 years were vaccinated. The incidence of adverse events possibly complicating influenza (e.g., pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or central nervous system events) was not statistically different among LAIV and placebo recipients aged 5-49 years. LAIV is made from attenuated viruses and does not cause influenza in vaccine recipients.\nChildren. In a subset of healthy children aged 60-71 months from one clinical trial . These symptoms were associated more often with the first dose and were self-limited. Unpublished data from a study including subjects aged 1-17 years indicated an increase in asthma or reactive airways disease in the subset aged 12-59 months. Because of this, LAIV is not approved for use among children aged <60 months.\nAdults. Among adults, runny nose or nasal congestion (28%-78%), headache (16%-44%), and sore throat (15%-27%) have been reported more often among vaccine recipients than placebo recipients .\nSafety Among Groups at High Risk from Influenza-Related Morbidity. Until additional data are acquired and analyzed, persons at high risk for experiencing complications from influenza infection (e.g., immunocompromised patients; patients with asthma, cystic fibrosis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; or persons aged >65 years) should not be vaccinated with LAIV. Protection from influenza among these groups should be accomplished by using inactivated influenza vaccine.\nSerious Adverse Events. Serious adverse events among healthy children aged 5-17 years or healthy adults aged 18-49 years occurred at a rate of <1%. Surveillance should continue for adverse events that might not have been detected in previous studies. A preliminary review of reports to VAERS after distribution of approximately 800,000 doses during the 2003-04 influenza season did not reveal any substantial new safety concerns . Health-care professionals should promptly report all clinically significant adverse events after LAIV administration to VAERS, as recommended for inactivated influenza vaccine.\n\n【45】 # Recommended Vaccines for Different Age Groups\nWhen vaccinating children aged 6 months-3 years, healthcare providers should use inactivated influenza vaccine that has been approved by FDA for this age group. Inactivated influenza vaccine from Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., (FluZone splitvirus) is approved for use among persons aged >6 months. Inactivated influenza vaccine from Chiron (Fluvirin) is labeled in the United States for use among persons aged >4 years because data to demonstrate efficacy among younger persons have not been provided to FDA. Live, attenuated influenza vaccine from MedImmune (FluMist) is approved for use by healthy persons aged 5-49 years .\n\n【46】 # Timing of Annual Influenza Vaccination\nThe annual supply of influenza vaccine and the timing of its distribution cannot be guaranteed in any year. Information regarding the supply of 2005-06 vaccine might not be available until late summer or early fall 2005. To allow vaccine providers to plan for the upcoming vaccination season, taking into account the yearly possibility of vaccine delays or shortages and the need to ensure vaccination of persons at high risk and their contacts, ACIP recommends that inactivated influenza vaccine campaigns conducted in October focus primarily on persons at increased risk for influenza complications and their contacts, including health-care workers. Campaigns conducted in November and later should continue to vaccinate persons at high risk and their contacts, but also vaccinate other persons who wish to decrease their risk for influenza infection. Vaccination for all groups should continue into December and beyond. CDC and other public health agencies will assess the vaccine supply on a continuing  basis throughout the manufacturing period and will make recommendations preceding the 2005-06 influenza season regarding the need for tiered timing of inactivated influenza vaccination of different risk groups. Because LAIV is approved for use in healthy persons 5-49 years, its use has not been subject to tiered timing.\n\n【47】 # Vaccination Before October\nTo avoid missed opportunities for vaccination of persons at high risk for serious complications, such persons should be offered vaccine beginning in September during routine healthcare visits or during hospitalizations, if vaccine is available. In facilities housing older persons (e.g., nursing homes), vaccination before October typically should be avoided because antibody levels in such persons can begin to decline within a limited time after vaccination . In addition, children aged <9 years who have not been previously vaccinated and who need 2 doses before the start of the influenza season can receive their first dose in September so that both doses of the most up-to-date vaccine can be administered before the onset of influenza activity. For previously vaccinated children, 2 doses are needed to provide optimal protection against influenza.\n\n【48】 # Vaccination in October and November\nThe optimal time to vaccinate is usually during October-November. ACIP recommends that vaccine providers focus their vaccination efforts in October and earlier primarily on persons aged >50 years, persons aged <50 years at increased risk for influenza-related complications (including children aged 6-23 months), household contacts of persons at high risk (including out-of-home caregivers and household contacts of children aged 0-23 months), and health-care workers. Vaccination of children aged <9 years who are receiving vaccine for the first time should also begin in October or earlier because those persons need a booster dose 1 month after the initial dose. Efforts to vaccinate other persons who wish to decrease their risk for influenza infection should begin in November; however, if such persons request vaccination in October, vaccination should not be deferred, unless vaccine supplies dictate otherwise. Materials to assist providers in prioritizing early vaccine are available at / professionals/vaccination/ .\n\n【49】 # Timing of Organized Vaccination Campaigns\nPersons and institutions planning substantial organized vaccination campaigns should consider scheduling these events after mid-October because the availability of vaccine in any location cannot be ensured consistently in early fall. Scheduling campaigns after mid-October will minimize the need for cancellations because vaccine is unavailable. Campaigns conducted before November using inactivated vaccine should focus efforts on vaccination of persons aged >50 years, persons aged <50 years at increased risk for influenza-related complications (including children aged 6-23 months and pregnant women), health-care workers, and household contacts of persons at high-risk (including children aged 0-23 months) to the extent feasible. Campaigns using the LAIV are also optimally conducted in October and November.\n\n【50】 # Vaccination in December and Later\nAfter November, many persons who should or want to receive influenza vaccine remain unvaccinated. In addition, substantial amounts of vaccine are often left over at the end of the influenza season. To improve vaccine coverage, influenza vaccine should continue to be offered in December and throughout the influenza season as long as vaccine supplies are available, even after influenza activity has been documented in the community. In the United States, seasonal influenza activity can begin to increase as early as October or November, but influenza activity has not reached peak levels in the majority of recent seasons until late December-early March . Therefore, although the timing of influenza activity can vary by region, vaccine administered after November is likely to be beneficial in the majority of influenza seasons. Adults develop peak antibody protection against influenza infection 2 weeks after vaccination .\n\n【51】 # Strategies for Implementing Vaccination Recommendations in Health-Care Settings\nSuccessful vaccination programs combine publicity and education for health-care workers and other potential vaccine recipients, a plan for identifying persons at high risk, use of reminder/recall systems, assessment of practice-level vaccination rates with feedback to staff, and efforts to remove administrative and financial barriers that prevent persons from receiving the vaccine, including use of standing orders programs  and patient reminders are recommended strategies for increasing rates of influenza vaccination. Persons for whom influenza vaccine is recommended can be identified and vaccinated in the settings described in the following sections.\n\n【52】 # Outpatient Facilities Providing Ongoing Care\nStaff in facilities providing ongoing medical care (e.g., physicians' offices, public health clinics, employee health clinics, hemodialysis centers, hospital specialty-care clinics, and outpatient rehabilitation programs) should identify and label the medical records of patients who should receive vaccination. Vaccine should be offered during visits beginning in Septem-ber and throughout the influenza season. The offer of vaccination and its receipt or refusal should be documented in the medical record. Patients for whom vaccination is recommended and who do not have regularly scheduled visits during the fall should be reminded by mail, telephone, or other means of the need for vaccination.\n\n【53】 # Outpatient Facilities Providing Episodic or Acute Care\nBeginning each September, acute health-care facilities (e.g., emergency departments and walk-in clinics) should offer vaccinations to persons for whom vaccination is recommended or provide written information regarding why, where, and how to obtain the vaccine. This written information should be available in languages appropriate for the populations served by the facility.\n\n【54】 # Nursing Homes and Other Residential Long-Term-Care Facilities\nDuring October and November each year, vaccination should be routinely provided to all residents of chronic-care facilities with the concurrence of attending physicians. Consent for vaccination should be obtained from the resident or a family member at the time of admission to the facility or anytime afterwards. All residents should be vaccinated at one time, preceding the influenza season. Residents admitted through March after completion of the vaccination program at the facility should be vaccinated at the time of admission.\n\n【55】 # Acute-Care Hospitals\nPersons of all ages (including children) with high-risk conditions and persons aged >50 years who are hospitalized at any time during September-March should be offered and strongly encouraged to receive influenza vaccine before they are discharged. In one study, 39%-46% of adult patients hospitalized during the winter with influenza-related diagnoses had been hospitalized during the preceding autumn . Thus, the hospital serves as a setting in which persons at increased risk for subsequent hospitalization can be identified and vaccinated. However, vaccination of persons at high risk during or after their hospitalizations is often not done. In a study of hospitalized Medicare patients, only 31.6% were vaccinated before admission, 1.9% during admission, and 10.6% after admission . Using standing orders in hospitals increases vaccination rates among hospitalized persons .\n\n【56】 # Visiting Nurses and Others Providing Home Care to Persons at High Risk\nBeginning in September, nursing-care plans should identify patients for whom vaccination is recommended, and vac-cine should be administered in the home, if necessary. Caregivers and other persons in the household (including children) should be referred for vaccination.\n\n【57】 # Other Facilities Providing Services to Persons Aged >50 Years\nBeginning in October, such facilities as assisted living housing, retirement communities, and recreation centers should offer unvaccinated residents and attendees vaccination on-site before the influenza season. Staff education should emphasize the need for influenza vaccine.\n\n【58】 # Health-Care Workers\nBeginning in October each year, health-care facilities should offer influenza vaccinations to all workers, including night and weekend staff. Particular emphasis should be placed on providing vaccinations to persons who care for members of groups at high risk. Efforts should be made to educate healthcare workers regarding the benefits of vaccination and the potential health consequences of influenza illness for themselves, their family members, and their patients. All healthcare workers should be provided convenient access to influenza vaccine at the work site, free of charge, as part of employee health programs .\n\n【59】 # Influenza Vaccine Supply\nInfluenza vaccine distribution delays or vaccine supply shortages have occurred in the United States vaccine in three of the last five influenza seasons. Influenza vaccine delivery delays or vaccine shortages remain possible in part because of the inherent critical time constraints in manufacturing the vaccine given the annual updating of the influenza vaccine strains.\nSteps being taken to accommodate possible future delays or vaccine shortages include identification and implementation of ways to expand the influenza vaccine supply and improvement of targeted delivery of vaccine to groups at high risk when delays or shortages are expected.\n\n【60】 # Influenza Vaccine Use During Shortages of Inactivated Vaccine\nACIP will publish additional guidance regarding the prioritized (tiered) use of inactivated influenza vaccine to be implemented only during periods when there is a shortage of influenza vaccine. Otherwise, when vaccine is in adequate supply, every effort should be made to promote and use influenza vaccine for all regularly targeted groups and for other persons who wish to reduce their risk for influenza illness. The prioritized (tiered) use of influenza vaccine during inactivated influenza vaccine shortages applies only to use of inactivated vaccine and not to LAIV. When feasible, during shortages of inactivated influenza vaccine, LAIV should be used preferentially for all healthy persons aged 5-49 years (including health-care workers) to increase the availability of inactivated vaccine for groups at high risk.\n\n【61】 # Future Directions for Influenza Vaccine Recommendations\nACIP plans to review new vaccination strategies for improving prevention and control of influenza, including the possibility of expanding recommendations for use of influenza vaccines. In addition, strategies for regularly monitoring vaccine effectiveness will be reviewed.\n\n【62】 # Recommendations for Using Antiviral Agents for Influenza\nAntiviral drugs for influenza are an adjunct to influenza vaccine for controlling and preventing influenza. However, these agents are not a substitute for vaccination. Four licensed influenza antiviral agents are available in the United States: amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, and oseltamivir.\nAmantadine and rimantadine are chemically related antiviral drugs known as adamantanes with activity against influenza A viruses, but not influenza B viruses. Amantadine was approved in 1966 for chemoprophylaxis of influenza A (H2N2) infection and was later approved in 1976 for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza type A virus infections among adults and children aged >1 year. Rimantadine was approved in 1993 for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza A infection among adults and prophylaxis among children. Although rimantadine is approved only for chemoprophylaxis of influenza A infection among children, rimantadine treatment for influenza A among children can be beneficial .\nZanamivir and oseltamivir are chemically related antiviral drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity against both influenza A and B viruses. Both zanamivir and oseltamivir were approved in 1999 for treating uncomplicated influenza infections. Zanamivir is approved for treating persons aged >7 years, and oseltamivir is approved for treatment of persons aged >1 year. In 2000, oseltamivir was approved for chemoprophylaxis of influenza among persons aged >13 years.\nThe four drugs differ in pharmacokinetics, side effects, routes of administration, approved age groups, dosages, and costs\n\n【63】 # Role of Laboratory Diagnosis\nAppropriate treatment of patients with respiratory illness depends on accurate and timely diagnosis. Early diagnosis of influenza can reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics and provide the option of using antiviral therapy. However, because certain bacterial infections can produce symptoms similar to influenza, bacterial infections should be considered and appropriately treated, if suspected. In addition, bacterial infections can occur as a complication of influenza.\nInfluenza surveillance information and diagnostic testing can aid clinical judgment and help guide treatment decisions. The accuracy of clinical diagnosis of influenza on the basis of symptoms alone is limited because symptoms from illness caused by other pathogens can overlap considerably with influenza . Influenza surveillance by state and local health departments and CDC can provide information regarding the presence of influenza viruses in the community. Surveillance can also identify the predominant circulating types, influenza A subtypes, and strains of influenza.\nDiagnostic tests available for influenza include viral culture, serology, rapid antigen testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunofluorescence assays . Sensitivity and specificity of any test for influenza might vary by the laboratory that performs the test, the type of test used, and the type of specimen tested. Among respiratory specimens for viral isolation or rapid detection, nasopharyngeal specimens are typically more effective than throat swab specimens . As with any diagnostic test, results should be evaluated in the context of other clinical and epidemiologic information available to health-care providers.\nCommercial rapid diagnostic tests are available that can detect influenza viruses within 30 minutes . Some tests are approved for use in any outpatient setting, whereas others must be used in a moderately complex clinical laboratory. These rapid tests differ in the types of influenza viruses they can detect and whether they can distinguish between influenza types. Different tests can detect 1 only influenza A viruses; 2 both influenza A and B viruses, but not distinguish between the two types; or 3 both influenza A and B and distinguish between the two.\nNone of the tests provide any information about influenza A subtypes\nDespite the availability of rapid diagnostic tests, collecting clinical specimens for viral culture is critical, because only culture isolates can provide specific information regarding circulating strains and subtypes of influenza viruses. This information is needed to compare current circulating influenza strains with vaccine strains, to guide decisions regarding influenza treatment and chemoprophylaxis, and to formulate vaccine for the coming year. Virus isolates also are needed to monitor the emergence of antiviral resistance and the emergence of novel influenza A subtypes that might pose a pandemic threat.\n\n【64】 # Indications for Use Treatment\nWhen administered within 2 days of illness onset to otherwise healthy adults, amantadine and rimantadine can reduce the duration of uncomplicated influenza A illness, and zanamivir and oseltamivir can reduce the duration of uncomplicated influenza A and B illness by approximately 1 day, compared with placeb.75,. More clinical data are available concerning the efficacy of zanamivir and oseltamivir for treatment of influenza A infection than for treatment of influenza B infectio.253,. However, in vitro data and studies of treatment among mice and ferret. in addition to clinical studies, have documented that zanamivir and oseltamivir have activity against influenza B viruses (254,290,291).\nData are limited regarding the effectiveness of the four antiviral agents in preventing serious influenza-related complications (e.g., bacterial or viral pneumonia or exacerbation of chronic diseases). Evidence for the effectiveness of these four antiviral drugs is principally based on studies of patients with uncomplicated influenza . Data are limited and inconclusive concerning the effectiveness of amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, and oseltamivir for treatment of influenza among persons at high risk for serious complications of influenz.28,248,250,251,253,254,261,. One study assessing oseltamivir treatment primarily among adults reported a reduction in complications, necessitating antibiotic therapy compared with placebo . Fewer studies of the efficacy of influenza antivirals have been conducted among pediatric populations .\nTo reduce the emergence of antiviral drug-resistant viruses, amantadine or rimantadine therapy for persons with influenza A illness should be discontinued as soon as clinically warranted, typically after 3-5 days of treatment or within 24-48 hours after the disappearance of signs and symptoms. The recommended duration of treatment with either zanamivir or oseltamivir is 5 days.\n\n【65】 # Chemoprophylaxis\nChemoprophylactic drugs are not a substitute for vaccination, although they are critical adjuncts in preventing and controlling influenza. Both amantadine and rimantadine are indicated for chemoprophylaxis of influenza A infection, but not influenza B. Both drugs are approximately 60%-90% effective in preventing illness from influenza A infection .\nAmong the neuraminidase inhibitor antivirals zanamivir and oseltamivir, only oseltamivir has been approved for prophylaxis, but community studies of healthy adults indicate that both drugs are similarly effective in preventing febrile, laboratory-confirmed influenza illness (efficacy: zanamivir, 84%; oseltamivir, 82%) . Data are not available regarding the efficacy of any of the four antiviral agents in preventing influenza among severely immunocompromised persons.\nWhen determining the timing and duration for administering influenza antiviral medications for prophylaxis, factors related to cost, compliance, and potential side effects should be considered. To be maximally effective as prophylaxis, the drug must be taken each day for the duration of influenza activity in the community. However, to be most cost-effective, one study of amantadine or rimantadine prophylaxis reported that the drugs should be taken only during the period of peak influenza activity in a community .\nPersons at High Risk Who Are Vaccinated After Influenza Activity Has Begun. Persons at high risk for complications of influenza still can be vaccinated after an outbreak of influenza has begun in a community. However, development of antibodies in adults after vaccination takes approximately 2 weeks .\nPersons Who Provide Care to Those at High Risk. To reduce the spread of virus to persons at high risk during community or institutional outbreaks, chemoprophylaxis during peak influenza activity can be considered for unvaccinated persons who have frequent contact with persons at high risk. Persons with frequent contact include employees of hospitals, clinics, and chronic-care facilities, household members, visiting nurses, and volunteer workers. If an outbreak is caused by a variant strain of influenza that might not be controlled by the vaccine, chemoprophylaxis should be considered for all such persons, regardless of their vaccination status.\nPersons Who Have Immune Deficiencies. Chemoprophylaxis can be considered for persons at high risk who are expected to have an inadequate antibody response to influenza vaccine. This category includes persons infected with HIV, chiefly those with advanced HIV disease. No published data are available concerning possible efficacy of chemoprophylaxis among persons with HIV infection or interactions with other drugs used to manage HIV infection. Such patients should be monitored closely if chemoprophylaxis is administered.\nOther Persons. Chemoprophylaxis throughout the influenza season or during peak influenza activity might be appropriate for persons at high risk who should not be vaccinated. Chemoprophylaxis can also be offered to persons who wish to avoid influenza illness. Health-care providers and patients should make this decision on an individual basis.\n\n【66】 # Control of Influenza Outbreaks in Institutions\nUsing antiviral drugs for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza is a key component of influenza outbreak control in institutions\nThe majority of published reports concerning use of antiviral agents to control influenza outbreaks in institutions are based on studies of influenza A outbreaks among nursing home populations where amantadine or rimantadine were used . When confirmed or suspected outbreaks of influenza occur in institutions that house persons at high risk, chemoprophylaxis should be started as early as possible to reduce the spread of the virus. In these situations, having preapproved orders from physicians or plans to obtain orders for antiviral medications on short notice can substantially expedite administration of antiviral medications.\nWhen outbreaks occur in institutions, chemoprophylaxis should be administered to all residents, regardless of whether they received influenza vaccinations during the previous fall, and should continue for a minimum of 2 weeks. If surveillance indicates that new cases continue to occur, chemoprophylaxis should be continued until approximately 1 week after the end of the outbreak. The dosage for each resident should be determined individually. Chemoprophylaxis also can be offered to unvaccinated staff who provide care to persons at high risk. Prophylaxis should be considered for all employees, regardless of their vaccination status, if the outbreak is caused by a variant strain of influenza that is not well-matched by the vaccine.\nIn addition to nursing homes, chemoprophylaxis also can be considered for controlling influenza outbreaks in other closed or semiclosed settings (e.g., dormitories or other settings in which persons live in close proximity). For example, chemoprophylaxis with rimantadine has been used successfully to control an influenza A outbreak aboard a large cruise ship .\nTo limit the potential transmission of drug-resistant virus during outbreaks in institutions, whether in chronic or acutecare settings or other closed settings, measures should be taken to reduce contact as much as possible between persons taking antiviral drugs for treatment and other persons, including those taking chemoprophylaxis .\n\n【67】 # Dosage\nDosage recommendations vary by age group and medical conditions .\n\n【68】 # Children\nAmantadine. Use of amantadine among children aged 10 years is 200 mg/ day (100 mg twice a day); however, for children weighing <40 kg, prescribing 5 mg/kg body weight/day, regardless of age, is advisable .\nRimantadine. Rimantadine is approved for prophylaxis among children aged >1 year and for treatment and prophylaxis among adults. Although rimantadine is approved only for prophylaxis of infection among children, certain specialists in the management of influenza consider it appropriate for treatment among children . Use of rimantadine among children aged 10 years is 200 mg/day (100 mg twice a day); however, for children weighing <40 kg, prescribing 5 mg/kg body weight/day, regardless of age, is recommended .\nZanamivir. Zanamivir is approved for treatment among children aged >7 years. The recommended dosage of zanamivir for treatment of influenza is two inhalations (one 5-mg blister per inhalation for a total dose of 10 mg) twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart) .\nOseltamivir. Oseltamivir is approved for treatment among persons aged >1 year and for chemoprophylaxis among persons aged >13 years. Recommended treatment dosages for children vary by the weight of the child: the dosage recommendation for children who weigh 15-23 kg, the dosage is 45 mg  .   Older nursing-home residents should be administered only 100 mg/day of rimantadine. A reduction in dosage to 100 mg/day should be considered for all persons aged >65 years, if they experience possible side effects when taking 200 mg/day. * Zanamivir administered through inhalation by using a plastic device included in the medication package. Patients will benefit from instruction and demonstration of the correct use of the device.    Zanamivir is not approved for prophylaxis.    A reduction in the dose of oseltamivir is recommended for persons with creatinine clearance 15-23 kg, the dose is 45 mg twice a day. For children who weigh >23-40 kg, the dose is 60 mg twice a day. And, for children who weigh >40 kg, the dose is 75 mg twice a day.\ntwice a day; for those weighing >23-40 kg, the dosage is 60 mg twice a day; and for children weighing >40 kg, the dosage is 75 mg twice a day. The treatment dosage for persons aged >13 years is 75 mg twice daily. For children aged >13 years, the recommended dose for prophylaxis is 75 mg once a day .\n\n【69】 # Persons Aged >65 Years\nAmantadine. The daily dosage of amantadine for persons aged >65 years should not exceed 100 mg for prophylaxis or treatment, because renal function declines with increasing age. For certain older persons, the dose should be further reduced.\nRimantadine. Among older persons, the incidence and severity of central nervous system (CNS) side effects are substantially lower among those taking rimantadine at a dosage of 100 mg/day than among those taking amantadine at dosages adjusted for estimated renal clearance . However, chronically ill older persons have had a higher incidence of CNS and gastrointestinal symptoms and serum concentrations 2-4 times higher than among healthy, younger persons when rimantadine has been administered at a dosage of 200 mg/day .\nFor prophylaxis among persons aged >65 years, the recommended dosage is 100 mg/day. For treatment of older persons in the community, a reduction in dosage to 100 mg/day should be considered if they experience side effects when taking a dosage of 200 mg/day. For treatment of older nursing home residents, the dosage of rimantadine should be reduced to 100 mg/day .\nZanamivir and Oseltamivir. No reduction in dosage is recommended on the basis of age alone.\n\n【70】 # Persons with Impaired Renal Function\nAmantadine. A reduction in dosage is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/min. Guidelines for amantadine dosage on the basis of creatinine clearance are located in the package insert. Because recommended dosages on the basis of creatinine clearance might provide only an approximation of the optimal dose for a given patient, such persons should be observed carefully for adverse reactions. If necessary, further reduction in the dose or discontinuation of the drug might be indicated because of side effects. Hemodialysis contributes minimally to amantadine clearance .\nRimantadine. A reduction in dosage to 100 mg/day is recommended for persons with creatinine clearance <10 mL/min. Because of the potential for accumulation of rimantadine and its metabolites, patients with any degree of renal insufficiency, including older persons, should be monitored for adverse effects, and either the dosage should be reduced or the drug should be discontinued, if necessary. Hemodialysis contributes minimally to drug clearance .\nZanamivir. Limited data are available regarding the safety and efficacy of zanamivir for patients with impaired renal function. Among patients with renal failure who were administered a single intravenous dose of zanamivir, decreases in renal clearance, increases in half-life, and increased systemic exposure to zanamivir were observed .\nOseltamivir. Serum concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate (GS4071), the active metabolite of oseltamivir, increase with declining renal functio. a reduction of the treatment dosage of oseltamivir to 75 mg once daily and in the prophylaxis dosage to 75 mg every other day is recommended. No treatment or prophylaxis dosing recommendations are available for patients undergoing routine renal dialysis treatment.\n\n【71】 # Persons with Liver Disease\nAmantadine. No increase in adverse reactions to amantadine has been observed among persons with liver disease. Rare instances of reversible elevation of liver enzymes among patients receiving amantadine have been reported, although a specific relation between the drug and such changes has not been established .\nRimantadine. A reduction in dosage to 100 mg/day is recommended for persons with severe hepatic dysfunction.\nZanamivir and Oseltamivir. Neither of these medications has been studied among persons with hepatic dysfunction.\n\n【72】 # Persons with Seizure Disorders\nAmantadine. An increased incidence of seizures has been reported among patients with a history of seizure disorders who have received amantadine . Patients with seizure disorders should be observed closely for possible increased seizure activity when taking amantadine.\nRimantadine. Seizures (or seizure-like activity) have been reported among persons with a history of seizures who were not receiving anticonvulsant medication while taking rimantadine . The extent to which rimantadine might increase the incidence of seizures among persons with seizure disorders has not been adequately evaluated.\nZanamivir and Oseltamivir. Seizure events have been reported during postmarketing use of zanamivir and oseltamivir, although no epidemiologic studies have reported any increased risk for seizures with either zanamivir or oseltamivir use.\n\n【73】 # Route\nAmantadine, rimantadine, and oseltamivir are administered orally. Amantadine and rimantadine are available in tablet or syrup form, and oseltamivir is available in capsule or oral suspension form. Zanamivir is available as a dry powder that is self-administered via oral inhalation by using a plastic device included in the package with the medication. Patients will benefit from instruction and demonstration of correct use of this device.\n\n【74】 # Pharmacokinetics Amantadine\nApproximately 90% of amantadine is excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretio.274,. Thus, renal clearance of amantadine is reduced substantially among persons with renal insufficiency, and dosages might need to be decreased  .\n\n【75】 # Rimantadine\nApproximately 75% of rimantadine is metabolized by the liver . The safety and pharmacokinetics of rimantadine among persons with liver disease have been evaluated only after single-dose administration .\nRimantadine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. The safety and pharmacokinetics of rimantadine among patients with renal insufficiency have been evaluated only after single-dose administration .\n\n【76】 # Zanamivir\nIn studies of healthy volunteers, approximately 7%-21% of the orally inhaled zanamivir dose reached the lungs, and 70%-87% was deposited in the oropharynx .\n\n【77】 # Oseltamivir\nApproximately 80% of orally administered oseltamivir is absorbed systemically . Absorbed oseltamivir is metabolized to oseltamivir carboxylate, the active neuraminidase inhibitor, primarily by hepatic esterases. Oseltamivir carboxylate has a half-life of 6-10 hours and is excreted in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion via the anionic pathway .\n\n【78】 # Side Effects and Adverse Reactions\nWhen considering use of influenza antiviral medications (i.e., choice of antiviral drug, dosage, and duration of therapy), clinicians must consider the patient's age, weight, and renal function ; presence of other medical conditions; indications for use (i.e., prophylaxis or therapy); and the potential for interaction with other medications.\n\n【79】 # Amantadine and Rimantadine\nBoth amantadine and rimantadine can cause CNS and gastrointestinal side effects when administered to young, healthy adults at equivalent dosages of 200 mg/day. However, incidence of CNS side effects (e.g., nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and lightheadedness) is higher among persons taking amantadine than among those taking rimantadine . In a 6-week study of prophylaxis among healthy adults, approximately 6% of participants taking rimantadine at a dosage of 200 mg/day experienced one or more CNS symptoms, compared with approximately 13% of those taking the same dosage of amantadine and 4% of those taking placebo . A study of older persons also demonstrated fewer CNS side effects associated with rimantadine compared with amantadine . Gastrointestinal side effects (e.g., nausea and anorexia) occur among approximately 1%-3% of persons taking either drug, compared with 1% of persons receiving the placebo .\nSide effects associated with amantadine and rimantadine are usually mild and cease soon after discontinuing the drug. Side effects can diminish or disappear after the first week, despite continued drug ingestion. However, serious side effects have been observed (e.g., marked behavioral changes, delirium, hallucinations, agitation, and seizures) .\n\n【80】 # Zanamivir\nIn a study of zanamivir treatment of ILI among persons with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease where study medication was administered after use of a B2-agonist, 13% of patients receiving zanamivir and 14% of patients who received placebo (inhaled powdered lactose vehicle) experienced a >20% decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) after treatment .\nIn clinical treatment studies of persons with uncomplicated influenza, the frequencies of adverse events were similar for persons receiving inhaled zanamivir and for those receiving placebo (i.e., inhaled lactose vehicle alone) 269. The most common adverse events reported by both groups were diarrhea; nausea; sinusitis; nasal signs and symptoms; bronchitis; cough; headache; dizziness; and ear, nose, and throat infections. Each of these symptoms was reported by <5% of persons in the clinical treatment studies combined .\n\n【81】 # Oseltamivir\nNausea and vomiting were reported more frequently among adults receiving oseltamivir for treatment (nausea without vomiting, approximately 10%; vomiting, approximately 9%) than among persons receiving placebo (nausea without vomiting, approximately 6%; vomiting, approximately 3%) .\n\n【82】 # Use During Pregnancy\nNo clinical studies have been conducted regarding the safety or efficacy of amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, or oseltamivir for pregnant women; only two cases of amantadine use for severe influenza illness during the third trimester have been reported .\n\n【83】 # Drug Interactions\nCareful observation is advised when amantadine is administered concurrently with drugs that affect CNS, including CNS stimulants. Concomitant administration of antihistamines or anticholinergic drugs can increase the incidence of adverse CNS reactions . No clinically substantial interactions between rimantadine and other drugs have been identified.\nClinical data are limited regarding drug interactions with zanamivir. However, no known drug interactions have been reported, and no clinically critical drug interactions have been predicted on the basis of in vitro data and data from studies using rats .\nLimited clinical data are available regarding drug interactions with oseltamivir. Because oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate are excreted in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion via the anionic pathway, a potential exists for interaction with other agents excreted by this pathway.\nFor example, coadministration of oseltamivir and probenecid resulted in reduced clearance of oseltamivir carboxylate by approximately 50% and a corresponding approximate twofold increase in the plasma levels of oseltamivir carboxylate .\nNo published data are available concerning the safety or efficacy of using combinations of any of these four influenza antiviral drugs. For more detailed information concerning potential drug interactions for any of these influenza antiviral drugs, package inserts should be consulted.\n\n【84】 # Antiviral Drug-Resistant Strains of Influenza\nAmantadine-resistant viruses are cross-resistant to rimantadine and vice versa . Drug-resistant viruses can appear in approximately one third of patients when either amantadine or rimantadine is used for therapy .\nPersons who have influenza A infection and who are treated with either amantadine or rimantadine can shed susceptible viruses early in the course of treatment and later shed drugresistant viruses, including after 5-7 days of therapy . Such persons can benefit from therapy even when resistant viruses emerge.\nResistance to zanamivir and oseltamivir can be induced in influenza A and B viruses in vitr. but induction of resistance usually requires multiple passages in cell culture. By contrast, resistance to amantadine and rimantadine in vitro can be induced with fewer passages in cell culture .\n\n【85】  of Information Regarding Influenza and Its Surveillance\nInformation regarding influenza surveillance, prevention, detection, and control is available at / weekly/ State and local health departments should be consulted concerning availability of influenza vaccine, access to vaccination programs, information related to state or local influenza activity, and for reporting influenza outbreaks and receiving advice concerning outbreak control.\n\n【86】 # Additional Information Regarding Influenza Infection Control Among Specific Populations\nEach year, ACIP provides general, annually updated information regarding control and prevention of influenza. Other reports related to controlling and preventing influenza among specific populations (e.g., immunocompromised persons, health-care workers, hospitals, and travelers) are also available in the following publications:\n- CDC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It may also detect infections and abnormalities in the endocervix and endometrium.\n\n【2】 # Procedure\nThe endocervix may be partially sampled with the device used to obtain the ectocervical sample, but due to the anatomy of this area, consistent and reliable sampling cannot be guaranteed. As abnormal endocervical cells may be sampled, those examining them are taught to recognize them.\nThe endometrium is not directly sampled with the device used to sample the ectocervix. Cells may exfoliate onto the cervix and be collected from there, so as with endocervical cells, abnormal cells can be recognised if present but the Pap Test should not be used as a screening tool for endometrial malignancy.\nThe pre-cancerous changes (called dysplasias or cervical or endocervical intraepithelial neoplasia) are usually caused by sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses (HPVs).  The test aims to detect and prevent the progression of HPV-induced cervical cancer and other abnormalities in the female genital tract by sampling cells from the outer opening of the cervix (Latin for \"neck\") of the uterus and the endocervix. The sampling technique changed very little since its invention by Georgios Papanikolaou (1883–1962) to detect cyclic hormonal changes in vaginal cells in the early 20th century until the development of liquid based cell thinlayer technology.  The test remains an effective, widely used method for early detection of cervical cancer and pre-cancer. The UK's call and recall system is among the best; estimates of its effectiveness vary widely but it may prevent about 700 deaths per year in the UK. It is not a perfect test. \"A nurse performing 200 tests each year would prevent a death once in 38 years. During this time she or he would care for over 152 women with abnormal results, over 79 women would be referred for investigation, over 53 would have abnormal biopsy results, and over 17 would have persisting abnormalities for more than two years. At least one woman during the 38 years would die from cervical cancer despite being screened.\" HPV vaccine may offer better prospects in the long term.\nIt is generally recommended that sexually active females seek Pap smear testing annually, although guidelines may vary from country to country. If results are abnormal, and depending on the nature of the abnormality, the test may need to be repeated in three to twelve months. If the abnormality requires closer scrutiny, the patient may be referred for detailed inspection of the cervix by colposcopy.  The patient may also be referred for HPV DNA testing, which can serve as an adjunct (or even as an alternative) to Pap testing.\nAbout 5% to 7% of pap smears produce abnormal results, such as dysplasia, possibly indicating a pre-cancerous condition. Although many low grade cervical dysplasias spontaneously regress without ever leading to cervical cancer, dysplasia can serve as an indication that increased vigilance is needed. Endocervical and endometrial abnormalities can also be detected, as can a number of infectious processes, including yeast and Trichomonas vaginalis. A small proportion of abnormalities are reported as of \"uncertain significance\".\n\n【3】 # Technical Aspects\nSamples are collected from the outer opening or os of the cervix using an Aylesbury spatula or (more frequently with the advent of liquid-based cytology) a plastic-fronded broom. The cells are placed on a glass slide and checked for abnormalities in the laboratory.\nThe sample is stained using the Papanicolaou technique, in which tinctorial dyes and acids are selectively retained by cells. Unstained cells can not be visualized with light microscopy. The stains chosen by Papanicolau were selected to highlight cytoplasmic keratinization, which actually has almost nothing to do with the nuclear features used to make diagnoses now.\nThe sample is then screened by a specially trained and qualified cytotechnologist using a light microscope. The terminology for who screens the sample varies according the country; in the UK, the personnel are known as Cytoscreeners, Biomedical scientists (BMS), Advanced Practitioners and Pathologists. The latter two take responsibility for reporting the abnormal sample which may require further investigation.\nStudies of the accuracy of conventional cytology report:\n- Sensitivity 72%\n- Specificity 94%\nIn the United States, physicians who fail to diagnose cervical cancer from a pap smear have been convicted of negligent homicide.  In 1988 and 1989, Karen Smith had received pap smears which were argued to have \"unequivocally\" shown that she had cancer; yet the lab had not made the diagnosis. She died on March 8 1995. Later, a physician and a laboratory technician were convicted of negligent homicide. These events have led to even more rigorous quality assurance programs, and to emphasizing that this is a screening, not a diagnostic, test, associated with a small irreducible error rate.\n\n【4】 # Liquid Based Monolayer Cytology\nSince the mid-1990s, techniques based around placing the sample into a vial containing a liquid medium which preserves the cells have been increasingly used. The media are primarily ethanol based. Two of the types are Sure-Path (TriPath Imaging) and Thin-Prep (Cytyc Corp).\nOnce placed into the vial, the sample is processed at the laboratory into a cell thin-layer, stained, and examined by light microscopy. The liquid sample has the advantage of being suitable for low and high risk HPV testing and reduced unsatisfactory specimens from 4.1% to 2.6%. Proper sample acquisition is crucial to the accuracy of the test; clearly, a cell that is not in the sample cannot be evaluated.\nStudies of the accuracy of liquid based monolayer cytology report:\n- Sensitivity 61% to 66%\n- Specificity 82% to 91%\nSome, but not all studies, report increased sensitivity from the liquid based smears.\n\n【5】 # Results\nIn screening a general or low-risk population, most Pap results are normal.\nIn the United States, about 2–3 million abnormal Pap smear results are found each year. Most abnormal results are mildly abnormal (ASC-US (typically 2–5% of Pap results) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)  (about 2% of results)), indicating HPV infection. Although most low-grade cervical dysplasias spontaneously regress without ever leading to cervical cancer, dysplasia can serve as an indication that increased vigilance is needed.\nIn a typical scenario, about 0.5% of Pap results are high-grade SIL (HSIL), and less than 0.5% of results indicate cancer; 0.2 to 0.8% of results indicate Atypical Glandular Cells of Undetermined Significance (AGC-NOS).\nAs liquid based preparations (LBPs) become a common medium for testing, atypical result rates have increased. The median rate for all preparations with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions using LBPs was 2.9% compared with a 2003 median rate of 2.1%. Rates for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (median, 0.5%) and atypical squamous cells have changed little.\nAbnormal results are reported according to the Bethesda system. They include:\n- Squamous cell abnormalities (SIL)\nAtypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)\nAtypical squamous cells – cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)\nLow-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL or LSIL)\nHigh-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL or HSIL)\nSquamous cell carcinoma\n- Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)\n- Atypical squamous cells – cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)\n- Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL or LSIL)\n- High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL or HSIL)\n- Squamous cell carcinoma\n- Glandular epithelial cell abnormalities\nAtypical Glandular Cells not otherwise specified (AGC or AGC-NOS)\n- Atypical Glandular Cells not otherwise specified (AGC or AGC-NOS)\nEndocervical and endometrial abnormalities can also be detected, as can a number of infectious processes, including yeast, herpes simplex virus and trichomoniasis.  However it is not very sensitive at detecting these infections, so absence of detection on a Pap does not mean absence of the infection.\n\n【6】 # Effectiveness\nThe Pap test, when combined with a regular program of screening and appropriate follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80%.\nFailure of prevention of cancer by the Pap test can occur for many reasons, including not getting regular screening, lack of appropriate follow up of abnormal results, and sampling and interpretation errors.  In the US, over half of all invasive cancers occur in women that have never had a Pap smear; an additional 10 to 20% of cancers occur in women that have not had a Pap smear in the preceding five years.  About one-quarter of US cervical cancers were in women that had an abnormal Pap smear, but did not get appropriate follow-up (woman did not return for care, or clinician did not perform recommended tests or treatment).\nAdenocarcinoma of the cervix has not been shown to be prevented by Pap tests.  In the UK, which has a Pap smear screening program, Adenocarcinoma accounts for about 15% of all cervical cancers\nEstimates of the effectiveness of the United Kingdom's call and recall system vary widely, but it may prevent about 700 deaths per year in the UK. A medical practitioner performing 200 tests each year would prevent a death once in 38 years, while seeing 152 women with abnormal results, referring 79 for investigation, obtaining 53 abnormal biopsy results, and seeing 17 persisting abnormalities lasting longer than two years. At least one woman during the 38 years would die from cervical cancer despite being screened.\nSince the population of the UK is about 61 million, the maximum number of women who could be receiving Pap smears in the UK is around 15 million to 20 million (eliminating the percentage of the population under 20 and over 65).   This would indicate that the use of Pap smear screening in the UK saves the life of 1 person for every approximately 20,000 people tested (assuming  15,000,000 are being tested yearly).  If only 10,000,000 are actually tested each year, then it would save the life of 1 person for every approximately 15,000 people tested.\n\n【7】 # Human Papillomavirus Testing\nThe presence of  HPV indicates that the person has been infected, the majority of women who get infected will successfully clear the infection within 18 months. It is those who have an infection of prolonged duration with high risk types (e.g. types 16,18,31,45) that are more likely to develop Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia due to the effects that HPV has on DNA.\nStudies of the accuracy of  HPV testing report:\n- Sensitivity 88% to 91% (for detecting CIN 3 or higher) to 97% (for detecting CIN2+)\n- Specificity 73% to 79% (for detecting CIN 3 or higher) to 93% (for detecting CIN 3 or higher)\nBy adding the more sensitive HPV Test, the specificity may decline. However, the drop in specificity is not definite.  If the specificity does decline, this results in increased numbers of false positive tests and many women who did not have disease having colposcopy and treatment. A worthwhile screening test requires a balance between the sensitivity and specificity to ensure that those having a disease are correctly identified as having it and equally importantly those not identifying those without the disease as having it. Due to the liquid based pap smears having a false negative rate of 15-35%, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology have recommended the use of  HPV testing in addition to the pap smear in all women over the age of 30.\nRegarding the role of  HPV testing, randomized controlled trials have compared  HPV to colposcopy.  HPV testing appears as sensitive as immediate colposcopy while reducing the number of colposcopies needed. Randomized controlled trial have suggested that  HPV testing could follow abnormal cytology or could precede cervical cytology examination.\nA study published in April 2007 suggested the act of performing a Pap smear produces an inflammatory cytokine response, which may initiate immunologic clearance of HPV, therefore reducing the risk of cervical cancer. Women who had even a single Pap smear in their history had a lower incidence of cancer. \"A statistically significant decline in the HPV positivity rate correlated with the lifetime number of Pap smears received.\"\n\n【8】 # Automated Analysis\n\n【9】 # Practical Aspects\nThe physician or operator collecting a sample for the test inserts a speculum into the patient's vagina, to obtain a cell sample from the cervix. A pap smear appointment is normally not scheduled during menstruation. The procedure is usually just slightly painful, because of the neuroanatomy of the cervix. However, this can depend on the patient's anatomy, the skill of the practitioner, psychological factors, and other conditions. Results usually take about 3 weeks. Slight bleeding, cramps, and other discomfort can occur afterwards.\nOther tests, including the TruTest, an endometrial biopsy used for early detection of uterine cancer, can be performed during the same visit.\n\n【10】 # 2012 ACS, ASCCP and ASCP Release New Screening Guidelines for Cervical Cancer \n\n【11】 # 2012 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement for Screening for Cervical Cancer", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Use of NICE's information for the public is recommended.\nEnter all patients having totally endoscopic robotically assisted coronary artery bypass grafting onto the National Congenital Heart Disease Audit Database managed by the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research. Contact  for details.\nPublication of safety and efficacy outcomes will be useful. NICE may review the procedure upon publication of further evidence.# The procedure\n\n【3】 # Indications\nIn coronary artery disease, plaque deposits on the inner walls of the coronary arteries lead to narrowing or occlusion, and subsequently decreased oxygen supply to the heart. This may cause angina or myocardial infarction, and long-term weakening of the heart muscle leading to heart failure or arrhythmia.\nThe aim of a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is to increase the flow of blood to the heart by inserting grafts to bypass narrowed or obstructed coronary arteries.\nCABG is usually performed with open surgery through a sternotomy. Less invasive approaches avoiding sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass and general anaesthesia have been developed, using either left anterior small thoracotomy (LAST), regional anaesthesia or catheter-based intervention.\n\n【4】 # Outline of the procedure\nTotally endoscopic robotically assisted coronary artery bypass (TECAB) systems vary, but they generally include a surgeon's viewing and control console with display system. Remote-control handles control robotic arms that position and precisely manoeuvre an endoscope and endoscopic instruments within the patient. Some equipment uses voice-controlled robotic arms.\nFollowing deflation of the lung, small port incisions are made in three intercostal spaces through which one robotic arm carrying the endoscope and two arms with surgical implement attachments are introduced. Grafts are harvested from suitable donor sites, and are used to bypass one or more diseased coronary arteries.\nTECAB treatment of the beating heart is carried out using a stabilisation device consisting of two branches that immobilise the site for anastomosis while the heart continues to beat. This removes the need for cardiopulmonary bypass. The stabilisation device is introduced into the chest through an additional port incision.\n\n【5】 # Efficacy\nFully patent grafts were achieved in 95% (21/22) of patients when assessed at 3 months by postoperative angiography, together with good functional results.\nMost case series used duration of operation as a measure and this varied according to the type of procedure undertaken and the number of vessels bypassed. In 45 consecutive patients undergoing TECAB, the mean operating time was 4 hours 12 minutes for single vessel surgery and 6 hours 18 minutes for multiple vessel surgery. In 35 patients, including eight in whom the procedure was performed on the beating heart, the operating time ranged from 3 hours 30 minutes to 8 hours (mean 5 hours 47 minutes). In a further 37 patients (29 of whom had the beating heart procedure), the mean operating time for the early cases in the series was 4 hours 40 minutes, but this was reduced to 3 hours 6 minutes following the introduction of endoscopic stabilisation. The mean length of stay in an intensive care unit varied from 14 hours to 74 hours, and the mean total length of hospital stay ranged from 5.0 to 15.4 days. The upper limits for length of stay were following multiple vessel surgery. \nThe Specialist Advisors noted that bleeding could potentially make vessel identification difficult. They also noted that patency rates of coronary bypass grafts were not sufficiently well documented.\n\n【6】 # Safety\nConversion rates to open procedures (either mini-thoracotomy or full sternotomy) were reported in all case series and ranged from 19% (5/27) to 51% (19/37) of procedures initiated as TECAB.\nThere were no cases of operative mortality associated with the TECAB procedure (n = 142).\nIn a case series of 45 patients, operative complications included port access failure in 7% (3/45) of patients, prolonged cross clamp time in 9% (4/45), myocardial infarction in 2% (1/45), hypoxic brain damage in 2% (1/45) and internal thoracic artery injury in 2% (1/45) of patients.\nIn a series of 45 patients, 4% (2/45) needed secondary intervention because of bleeding from the site of anastomosis. There were no cases of wound infection at the port site throughout the series. \nThe Specialist Advisors noted theoretical complications as myocardial infarction, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade and fatal haemorrhage. They also noted that there is potential for stenosis or occlusion at the site of anastomosis.\n\n【7】 # Other comments\nThere are a number of other procedures for treating patients with coronary artery disease but no good studies have been found that compare these with TECAB.# Further information\n\n【8】  of evidence\nThe evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the following document.\nInterventional procedures overview of totally endoscopic robotically assisted coronary artery bypass surgery, November 2004.\n\n【9】 # Information for patients\nNICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers.

{"seq_id": "b9e458db-5131-4936-862e-d0b2ff085748", "title": null, "text": "【0】 Shouldice Hernia Centre\nShouldice Hernia Centre is a hospital in Thornhill, Ontario, Canada, that is known for its specialization in external abdominal hernia operations. Shouldice uses a technique developed during World War II by Dr. Edward Earle Shouldice. Their ten full-time surgeons perform over 7500 hemiorrhapies each year. The facility, which looks much like a mansion, is purposely comfortable, featuring a 23-acre property. The centre is owned by Shouldice Hospital Limited.\nThe facility was subject of a 1983 business case by the Harvard Business School. Written by professor James Heskett, the report is currently the school's fourth-best-selling business case, selling nearly 260,000 copies. Twenty thousand students at 500 universities worldwide read about the centre annually, as part of their curriculum.\nShouldice launched a website in 1995. Over 300,000 visit the site each year; each year 1300 operations are scheduled online, and close to 10,000 emails requesting information are received.\nIn 2000, former Prime Minister of Canada Joe Clark revealed he had attended the facility in the 1980s.\nDuring the 2006 federal election campaign, New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton was criticized for attending the facility. As a critic of private healthcare, Layton was actually unaware that the facility was private. The hospital is, however, a non-profit operation, and it has a virtual monopoly on hernia repair in Toronto (Layton is from Toronto). Additionally, the surgery is covered under provincial insurance in Ontario.\n\n【1】 # The process\n\n【2】 ## Pre-surgery\nShouldice requires patients to be at an acceptable weight appropriate to their height. Prospective patients who are overweight must lose weight.\nPatients enter the hospital the day before surgery and are given a briefing about the procedures to be followed the next day. The night before the operation is also intended as an opportunity for patients to come to know each other – Shouldice encourages patients to work together to promote recovery.\nDoctors from other institutes constitute a disproportionately higher percentage of patients (i.e. if a doctor from the U.S. needs surgery he goes to Shouldice).\n\n【3】 ## Surgery\nAt most hospitals, surgery takes 90 minutes, but Shouldice doctors take simply 35–40 minutes. Local anesthesia is used in surgeries, instead of general anesthesia, as the second is unnecessary in hernia surgeries, and the first is both safer and cheaper. The procedure most commonly used at Shouldice uses no surgical mesh.\nMost surgeries at Shouldice involve sewing muscle layers together in overlap. The specific technique is often referred to as the Shouldice operation or the Canadian operation.\n\n【4】 ## Recovery\nUnlike many hospitals, Shouldice does not have a \"fleet of wheelchairs and gurneys, armies of aides to push them, and banks of wide elevators. The hospital focuses on customer service, without compromising on speedy recovery.\nThe landscaped grounds, pool table, and putting green are all intended to encourage patients to be mobile following surgery – to take walks in the grounds and to stretch and bend while playing pool or practising putting. Similarly, there are no television sets or telephones in patients' rooms and beds have to be adjusted manually. A daily exercise program is also provided.\nPatients are scheduled stay in the hospital for two days and three nights following surgery, although those who recover faster may leave earlier.\nAll rooms are double occupancy, and regularly flow through patients. The patient rooms have \"low capital investment\"—with no phone, television, and minimal medical equipment. The double occupancy rooms also provide income from additional charges for semi-private rooms. These mandatory charges are not covered by public health insurance and effectively make the Shouldice an example of the upper tier of two-tier health care – welfare recipients, for example, cannot be referred there.\n\n【5】 ## Follow-up\nShouldice sends out a newsletter to all of its patients. The newsletter includes a questionnaire for Shouldice's post-operative follow-up program. The program is considered the world's largest and longest-running follow-up program. The post-op is gradually transistioning to e-mail, as much as possible.\nShouldice reports that fewer than 1% of patients have a recurrence after hernia repair. This compares to the 10-15% in normal hospitals. However, a study published in 2005 by two Shouldice surgeons reports a recurrence rate of 8% after three years for mesh repairs. The study also found no effect of preoperational weight loss by obese patients (a Shouldice requirement) on recurrence rate.\nStudies carried out outside Shouldice generally show recurrence rates for \"Shouldice repairs\" (described above) which are higher than the recurrence rates reported by Shouldice. For example, a French study of 1,706 repairs performed using the Shouldice, Bassini's, and Cooper's ligament repairs found that Shouldice repairs had the lowest recurrence rate, but that the rate was 6.1% after 8.5 years. However, the surgeons performing the repairs in these studies are almost certainly less experienced with this type of repair than Shouldice surgeons. For example, in the French study, fewer repairs were performed over six years than would be performed in about three months at Shouldice.\nThe disparity between the rates claimed by Shouldice and published rates also may be due in part to differences in the length of the post-surgery period assessed. Shouldice does its first follow-up after 18 months. Yearly follow-ups are conducted after that, but there is doubtless loss of contact with many former patients who have moved. The average period since surgery in Shouldice's data may therefore be shorter than the periods in published studies.\nShouldice holds annual patient reunions, which one year attracted 1500 former patients.\n\n【6】 # Primary staff\n- Byrnes Shouldice, co-owner, president, chairman, former surgeon at the facility\n- Germaine Urquhart, co-owner\n- Daryl Urquhart, director of business development and grandson of the founder\n- Dr. Cassim T.
